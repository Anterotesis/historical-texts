            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to chill your ears by keeping you long at the
doors; not to detain you one minute with a cold
unprofitable <hi>Preface:</hi> This <hi>Chapter</hi> is the exacteſt
Hiſtory of the <hi>Spiritual eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Jews, i. e.
The elect of God,</hi> and the powerfulleſt exprobration
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of their ſins, that all the Writings under <hi>Heaven</hi>
can preſent to our eyes. From the firſt time I
could think I underſtood any part of it I have been confident, that
never any thing was ſet down more rhetorically, never more <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, more <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>ſublimity of ſpeech,</hi> ever concurred in

and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> that lies concealed in this one <hi>Chapter,</hi> and yet there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is enough in the ſurface and outward dreſs of it, to affect the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
underſtanding that will but read it. For our preſent purpoſe it
will ſuffice to have obſerv'd, 1. That the <hi>natural</hi> ſinful <hi>eſtate</hi> of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> being premiſed in the five firſt Verſes: 2. The <hi>calling</hi> of them
in this <hi>condition,</hi> in their <hi>pollutions,</hi> in their <hi>blood,</hi> and beſtowing all
manner of <hi>ſpiritual ornaments</hi> upon them, following in the next ten
Verſes; the remainder is moſt what ſpent in the <hi>upbraiding</hi> and <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating</hi>
their <hi>ſins</hi> to them in a moſt elevated <hi>ſtrain</hi> of reproof; and

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>higheſt pitch</hi> of it, is in the words of my Text, <hi>The work of
an imperious Whoriſh Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the handling of which words, I firſt beg two <hi>poſtulata</hi> to be
granted and ſuppoſed, before my diſcourſe, becauſe I would not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you to hear them proved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47754:4"/>
I. That the <hi>elect</hi> choſen people of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> were <hi>degenerate</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
into heathen, deſperate, devilliſh ſinners.</p>
            <p>II. That what is <hi>literally</hi> ſpoken in <hi>aggravation</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſin,
is as fully <hi>applicable</hi> to any other <hi>ſinful people,</hi> with whom <hi>God</hi> hath
entred <hi>Covenant,</hi> as he did with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe, ſhall be this, That
<hi>Indulgence</hi> to ſin, in a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is the <hi>Work of an imperious Whoriſh
Woman.</hi> And that 1. Of a <hi>Woman</hi> noting a great deal of weakneſs;
and that not <hi>ſimple natural</hi> weakneſs, through a privation of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſtrength, but an acquired, ſluggiſh weakneſs, by effeminate neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
to make uſe of it. 2. Of a <hi>Whore,</hi> noting <hi>unfaithfulneſs</hi> and
<hi>falſeneſs</hi> to the <hi>Husband.</hi> 3. Of an <hi>imperious Whore,</hi> noting <hi>inſolency</hi>
and an <hi>high pitch</hi> of <hi>contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of theſe, briefly and plainly; not to encreaſe your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but to enliven and enflame the practical part of your ſouls;
not to enrich your brains with new ſtore, but to ſink that which you
have already down into your hearts.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt of the firſt, That <hi>Indulgence to ſin,</hi> in a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is
the work of a <hi>Woman;</hi> an effect and argument of an infinite deal of
weakneſs, together with the nature and grounds of that weakneſs:
<hi>The work, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this very thing, that it may be the more heeded, is empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
noted three ſeveral times in this one Verſe. 1. <hi>The work of a
Woman,</hi> in my Text, a poor, cowardly, puſillanimous part that any
body elſe, any one that had but the leaſt ſpark of valor or manhood in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
him, would ſcorn to be guilty of, an argument of one that hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his parts and gifts to lie <hi>ſluggiſh &amp; unprofitable,</hi> and at laſt, even
quite periſhed by difuſing. As the weakneſs of Women, below Men,
proceeds not only from their <hi>conſtitution</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> but from their
<hi>courſe of life;</hi> not from want of <hi>natural ſtrength,</hi> but of civil <hi>manlike</hi>
exerciſe, which might ſtir up and diſcipline, and ripen that ſtrength
they have: For if their education were as warlike, and their ſtrength
by valiant undertaking, ſo ſet out; <hi>Virago</hi>'s and <hi>Amazons,</hi> would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
well-nigh as ordinary as ſoldiers. And ſo will the compariſon hold of
thoſe womaniſh, ſluggiſh, abuſers of <hi>Gods</hi> graces. Then in the firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
words of this Verſe, <hi>How weak is thy heart?</hi>] noting it to be a degree
of weakneſs below ordinary; as we call one a <hi>weak man,</hi> that hath done
any thing raſhly or unadviſedly, which, if he had but thought on, he
could never have been ſo <hi>ſottiſh,</hi> his ordinary reaſon would have
prompted him to ſafer counſels. In brief, Any frequent, indiſcreet
actions, argue a <hi>weak fellow:</hi> Not that he wants ſtrength of diſcretion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to do better, but that he makes no uſe of it in his actions. Thirdly,
<hi>How weak is thy heart?</hi>] <hi>Thy heart, i. e.</hi> The principal part of the

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the <hi>feminine,</hi> out of order, perhaps emphatically, to note an unman-like

ſo much impotency in his behaviour, (even like the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>

Chriſt, led away, and abuſed and baffled by every pelting paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
luſt. 'Tis lamentable to obſerve what a poor, <hi>cowardly,

and petty ſtratagems, they are either taken captive, or put
to flight; how eaſily in their moſt reſolute undertakings of piety or
vertue, they are either vanquiſht, or caught. The ordinarieſt,
courſeſt, had-favouredſt <hi>temptation</hi> that they can ſee, affects and
ſmites them ſuddenly; they are entangled, before they are wooed;
and the leaſt appearance of any difficulty, the vizard or picture of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of <hi>Religion,</hi> or hope of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a meer <hi>natural man</hi> that hath nothing but <hi>original ſin,</hi> or worſe
in him, that hath received nothing from God and his parents, but a
<hi>talent</hi> in a broken Veſſel, a ſoul infected by a crazy body, diſeas'd
as ſoon as born; for an <hi>Heathen</hi> that hath nothing to ſubſiſt on but a
poor pittance of natural reaſon, but one eye to ſee by, and that a
dim one; for a meer <hi>Barbarian</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> to be thus triumphed over
by every Devil, (as an Owl by the ſmalleſt Bird in the air) might be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> matter of pity rather than wonder: And yet few of them were ſuch
cowards; thoſe very weapons that Nature had furniſhed them with,
being rightly put on, and fitted to them, ſtood many of them in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good ſtead. There were few paſſions, few ſins of an ordinary ſize,
but a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and meer <hi>Stoick</hi> would be able to meet and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh:
And therefore 'tis not ſo much <hi>natural,</hi> as <hi>affected weakneſs,</hi>
not ſo much want of ſtrength, as ſluggiſhneſs and want of care; not ſo
much impotency, as numbneſs and ſtupidity of our parts, which hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſo extremely diſ-abled thoſe that take themſelves to be the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of us.</p>
            <p>The truth is, we are willing to conceive that our <hi>natural abilities</hi>
are quite <hi>periſht</hi> and annihilate, and that God hath no ways repaired
them by <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe we will not be put to the trouble of making
uſe of them: We would ſpare our pains, and therefore would fain
count our ſelves impotent, as <hi>ſluggards</hi> that perſonate and act <hi>diſeaſes</hi>
becauſe they would not work; or the old <hi>Tragedians</hi> which could call
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> a god down upon the <hi>Stage</hi> at any time, to conſummate the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleſt
<hi>Plot,</hi> and therefore would not put their brains to the toil of
concluding it fairly.</p>
            <p>Certainly the <hi>decrepiteſt man</hi> under Heaven (if he be but a degree
above a Carcaſs) is able to defend himſelf from an ordinary <hi>Flie;</hi> 'Tis
one of the Devils titles to be <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Flies; and ſuch

could repel them as faſt as they come, yet 'twould be a troubleſome
piece of work; it will be more for your eaſe to lye ſtill under them, to
let them work their will: So in time Fly-blows beget noyſomneſs
and <hi>vermine</hi> in the <hi>ſoul;</hi> and then the life and death of that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

of any the ſtrongeſt temptation, and to encourage him in the

For what ſin didſt thou ever look upon with the fulleſt delight of all

certainly one clear ſingle apprehenſion of that infinite bliſs which
the Eye of Faith repreſents to us, were enough to raviſh a world of

what would we not do to recompence, and anſwer, and entertain that
love? what difficulty would it not ingratiate to us? what exquiſite
pleaſure, or carnal rival, would not be cheap and contemptible in its

            <p>Again, How <hi>imperious</hi> is he in triumphing over a <hi>ſin,</hi> which he

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which are aſhamed of the <hi>light,</hi> either of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>

            <p>The <hi>Iſſue</hi> of this ſecond <hi>Pracognitum,</hi> is this, That if there ſtill

               </gap>, there is
no new way imaginable to be found out; and that perhaps is the
reaſons of thoſe peremptory denunciations of <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt them
that ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> againſt that adminiſtration of <hi>grace</hi>
entruſted to him, That <hi>there ſhall be never any remiſſion for them, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
this world, or in another, i. e.</hi> Either by way of Juſtification here, or
Glorification at that grand Manumiſſion hereafter. And that may
ſerve for a ſecond proof of the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> That if for all, the duty
of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is not feaſible, it muſt remain ſo for ever; an adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
thereof you may ſee ſet down <hi>Heb.</hi> x.<note place="margin">Heb. x 16, 26.</note> comparing the 16 with

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The third thing to be premiſed is, <hi>Wherein this condition of the
ſecond Covenant conſiſts;</hi> and that is not in any rigor of legal perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
(that was the bloody purport of that old obligation, that ſoon
concluded us all under death irreverſibly) nor in any <hi>Egyptian Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
tasks, a full tale of Bricks, without Straw, without any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als

not only light, but alleviating: He that was laden before, is the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lighter for this yoke, Verſ. 29. <hi>Take my yoke, and you ſhall find reſt.</hi>
And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> thinks reaſonable, not to lay the yoke upon them
as an injunction (as the worldly faſhion is) but to commend it to
them, as a thing that any prudent man would be glad to take up, in
the beginning of the Verſe, <hi>Take my yoke upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, it conſiſts in the embracing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all his <hi>Offices,</hi>
the whole <hi>Perſon of Chriſt;</hi> but eſpecially as he is typically deſcribed

            </p>

that are diſpenſed among us, yet the <gap reason="foreign">

This is the reaſon that ſo much of <hi>Gods</hi> Husbandry among

and 'tis hard finding any better tillage now a-days; the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Holy Land, the <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>honey</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> is degenerate, they ſay, into
this Compoſition; and herein is a marvellous thing, that where God

unſavoury fruits, is the beſt return he can hear of.</p>
            <p>One thing more let me tell you; 'Tis not the original hardneſs of
<hi>Nature</hi> to which all this can be imputed, for, for the mollifying of
that, all this gardening was beſtowed; digging &amp; gathering out, and
indeed nothing more ordinary, than out of ſuch <hi>ſtones to raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

it into a perfect quarry or mine; and 'tis not the Preachers
Charm, the Annunciation of the Goſpel, that Power of God unto
Salvation, unto a Jew or Heathen; 'tis not <hi>David</hi>'s Harp, (that

            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sluggiſhneſs,</hi> and inobſervances of God's ſeaſons and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
and ſeed-times of Grace. <hi>God</hi> may appear a thouſand times,

themſelves up to that high flood of ſpiritual pride &amp; confidence, that
it will be ſure to impoſtumate in the ſoul. Some men have been fain
to be permitted to <hi>ſin,</hi> for the abating this humour in them by way of

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was turned a grazing, to cure his ſecular Pride; and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I am
ſure, had a Meſſenger ſent to him to that purpoſe, by way of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he might not be exalted above meaſure; and when he
thought well of it, he receives it as a preſent ſent him from Heaven,
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, reckons of it as a <hi>gift of Grace,</hi> or if you will, a

which <hi>per antiperiſtaſin</hi> would drive in his ſpiritual heat, and ſo

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for ever after.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſſue</hi> of this firſt Inference is this, That 'tis not <hi>God</hi>'s partial
or niggardly diſpencing of Grace; but either our <hi>unpreparedneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
or prepoſterous giddineſs in making uſe of it, which is the

or <hi>ſurfeiting</hi> the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Inference,</hi> how all the <hi>Chriſtians diligence</hi> is to be
placed; what he hath to do in this wayfare to his home: And that is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the ſame that all <hi>Travellers</hi> have, firſt, to be alway upon his feet, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing

               </gap>; and ſee that we be <hi>employed aright,</hi> or elſe <hi>God</hi> muſt not,

they want <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> to lift them up, and activity to <hi>preſs</hi>

            <p>Firſt, As the calling one <hi>ſimple,</hi> is a word of <hi>reproach,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely;

            <p>A <hi>reproach to Nature</hi> firſt, to our humane kind, which was an

            <p>Laſtly, 'Tis a reproach to the very <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and the reſt of the

            <p>A ſecond Notion of this Phraſe, and degree of this Character, is
the <hi>giddineſs</hi> and <hi>unadviſedneſs</hi> of the Sinners Courſe; as ſimplicity

thoſe impediments which hindred Gods approach unto mens rebel

might underſtand the affinity of Prophecies, and Goſpel, as differing
not in ſubſtance, but only in clearneſs of revelation, as the glorious
face of the <hi>Sun,</hi> from it ſelf, being overcaſt and mask'd with a cloud;
and alſo for the clearing of my Text: For this entire paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of which theſe words are a cloſe, is the <hi>Angels</hi> meſſage, or <hi>Goſpel</hi>
unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſet down by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as both the interpretation,
and accompliſhment of a Prophecy delivered long ago by <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> perhaps not at all underſtood by the <hi>Jews:</hi> to wit, <hi>That a Virgin ſhould
conceive and bear a Son, and they ſhould call his name</hi> Emmanuel.</p>
            <p>Where firſt we muſt examine the ſeeming <hi>difference</hi> in the point
of <hi>Chriſts Name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> betwixt the place here cited from <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the
words here vouched of the <hi>Angel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> V. 21. and proved by the effect
V. 25.<note place="margin">Iſa. vii. 14.</note> For the Prophet ſays, he ſhall be called <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> but the
Angel commands he ſhould be, and the Goſpel records he was named
<hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And here we muſt reſume and enlarge the ground premiſed in our
Preface, that Prophecies being not Hiſtories, but rude imperfect
draughts of things to come, do not exactly expreſs and delineate, but
only ſhadow, and covertly vail thoſe things, which only the Spirit
of God, and the event muſt interpret. So that in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> we
conſtrue the <hi>words,</hi> but in <hi>Prophecies,</hi> the <hi>ſence; i. e.</hi> we expect not
the performance of every Circumſtance expreſt in the words of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
but we acknowledge another ſence beyond the literal; and in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the comparing of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> we exact not the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
provided we find the ſame ſubſtance, and the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy.
So then, the Prophets [<hi>and call his name</hi> Emmanuel] is not
as humane Covenants are, to be fulfill'd in the rigour of the Letter,
that he ſhould be ſo named at his <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but in the agreement
of ſence; that this name ſhould expreſs his nature; that he was indeed,
<hi>God with us;</hi> and that at the Circumciſion he ſhould receive a name of
the ſame power and ſignificancy. Whence the <hi>obſervation</hi> by the way
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is, that <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> in effect, ſignifies <hi>Jeſus, God with us,</hi> a <hi>Saviour;</hi>
and from thence the point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that Gods coming to us, <hi>i. e.
Chriſts Incarnation, brought Salvation into the World.</hi> For if there be
a ſubſtantial agreement betwixt the Prophet, and the Angel; if <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi>
ſignifie directly <hi>Jeſus;</hi> if <hi>God with us,</hi> and a <hi>Saviour</hi> be really
the ſame title of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> then was there no <hi>Saviour,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no <hi>Salvation,</hi> before this preſence of <hi>God with us.</hi> Which poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we will briefly explain, and then omitting unneceſſary proofs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> apply it.</p>
            <p>In explaining of it, we muſt calculate the time of <hi>Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi>
and ſet down how with it, and not before, came <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may collect in Scripture a three-fold <hi>incarnation</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi>
1. In the <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 2. In the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 3. In a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi>

of both <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. xiii. 8.</note> ſo <hi>He was as ſlain,</hi> ſo <hi>incarnate, before
the foundation of the World</hi> Rev. xiii. 8. For the word <hi>ſlain,</hi> being
not competible to the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> but only to the aſſumption of the
<hi>humane nature,</hi> preſuppoſes him <hi>incarnate,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſlain. God</hi> then
in his Preſcience, ſurveyingbefore he created, and viewing the lapſed,
miſerable, ſick eſtate of the future Creation; in his Eternal Decree,
foreſaw, and preordained <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Saviour, the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of the Worlds Salvation. So that in the Counſel of <hi>God,</hi> to
whom all things to come are made preſent, <hi>Emmanuel</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> went
together; and no <hi>Salvation</hi> beſtowed on us, but in reſpect to this, God
<hi>with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and then <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>incarnate</hi> when he
was promiſed firſt in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. iii. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The ſeed of the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo he
is as old in the fleſh, as the World in ſin, and was then in Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
firſt born, when <hi>Adam</hi> and man-kind began to die. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
he was not again, but ſtill incarnate in Gods promiſe more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time;<note place="margin">Gen. xii. 3. xviii. 18. xxii. 18.</note> 
               <hi>In thy ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time;
when at the addition of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> a moſt ſignificant repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the incarnate and crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. xiii.</note> he was more than promiſed,
almoſt exhibited. Under which times, it is by ſome aſſerted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in the form of <hi>Man,</hi> and habit of <hi>Angel,</hi> appeared ſundry times to the
Fathers, to give them not an hope, but a poſſeſſion of the <hi>Incarnate
God,</hi> and to be <hi>praeludium incarnationis,</hi> a pawn unto them, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
truſted not in vain: And here it is plain thorowout, that this Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the Promiſe of <hi>God,</hi> did perpetually accompany,
or go before <hi>Salvation:</hi> not one bleſſing on the nations, without

of Righteouſneſs and Salvation, but on ground and condition of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
belief of that <hi>Jeſus</hi> which was then in promiſe, <hi>Emmanuel, God
with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>Perſonal exhibiting</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in form of fleſh unto the
World, dated at the <hi>fulneſs of time,</hi> and call'd in our ordinary phraſe
<hi>his Incarnation;</hi> then no doubt was <hi>Emmanuel, Jeſus;</hi> then was he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly

            </p>
            <p>Thus do you ſee a three-fold <hi>Incarnation,</hi> a three-fold <hi>Emmanuel,</hi>
and proportionably a three-fold <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Saviour</hi> firſt decreed for the World, anſwerable to <hi>God,</hi>
incarnate in <hi>Gods Counſel,</hi> and ſo no man was ever capable <hi>of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but through <hi>God with us.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 2. A <hi>Saviour</hi> promiſed to the World anſwerable to the ſecond
<hi>God with us,</hi> to wit, incarnate in the Promiſe, and ſo there is no <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of <hi>Salvation,</hi> but in this <hi>God with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A <hi>Saviour</hi> truly exhibited and born of a Woman, anſwerable
to the third <hi>Immanuel;</hi> and ſo alſo is there no <hi>manifeſtation,</hi> no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming,
no preaching of <hi>Salvation,</hi> but by the birth and merits of
<hi>God with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe three, if we add a fourth <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of our <hi>Immortal Fleſh,</hi> which was at his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Doctrine will be complete, and this <hi>Emmanuel</hi> incarnate in the
<hi>Womb</hi> of the <hi>grave,</hi> &amp; brought forth cloath'd upon with an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſeed, is now more fully than ever prov'd an Eternal <hi>Jeſus; For
when he had overcome the ſharpneſs of Death, he opened the kingdom of
Heaven to all believers,</hi> as it is in our <hi>Te Deum;</hi> as if all that till then ever
entred into Heaven, had been admitted by ſome privy key; but now
the very gates were wide opened to all believers: This laſt Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being accompanied with a Catholick Salvation, that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> might be as <hi>Eternal</hi> as <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that he might be as <hi>Immortal</hi>
a <hi>Saviour</hi> as a <hi>God with us.</hi> 'Twere but a ſuperfluous work, further
to demonſtrate, that through all ages of the World, there was no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
ever tendred, but in reſpect to this Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that
the hopes, the belief, the expectation of Salvation, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
lived and breathed by, under the types of the Law, was only
grounded upon, and referred unto theſe promiſes of the future <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that they which were not in ſome meaſure enlightned in this

all the means beſides that Heaven and Earth, and which goes beyond
them both, the brain of <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> could afford or invent, could
not excuſe, much leſs ſave any child of <hi>Adam:</hi> That every Soul
which was to ſpring from theſe loins, had been without thoſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
mercies which were exhibited by this <hi>Incarnation</hi> of
<hi>Chriſts,</hi> plung'd in neceſſary deſperate <hi>damnation:</hi> Your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhall be more profitably imployed in a brief <hi>Application</hi> of

            <p>Firſt, That you perſwade, and drive your ſelves to a <hi>ſenſe</hi> and
<hi>feeling</hi> of your <hi>Sins,</hi> thoſe ſins which thus pluckt <hi>God</hi> out of Heaven,
and for a while depriv'd him of his Majeſty; which laid an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon <hi>God,</hi> either to leave his infinite Juſtice unſatisfied, or elſe
to ſubject his infinite Deity to the ſervile mortality of Fleſh, or elſe
to leave an infinite World in a common damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Secondly, To ſtrain all the expreſſions of our hearts, tongues,
and lives, to the higheſt note of <hi>gratitude</hi> which is poſſible, in anſwer
to this Myſtery and Treaſure of this <hi>God with us;</hi> to reckon all the
Miracles of either common or private preſervations, as foils to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Mercy, infinitely below the leaſt circumſtance of it; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, thine Eſtate, thy Underſtanding, thy Body, thy Soul,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47754:32"/>
thy Being, thy very Creation, were each of them as exquiſite Curſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
as Hell or Malice could invent for thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To obſerve with an ecſtaſie of joy and thanks the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>priviledges</hi> of us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> beyond all that ever <hi>God</hi> profeſt love
to, in that we have obtained a full revelation of this <hi>God with us:</hi>
which all the <hi>Fathers</hi> did but ſee in a <hi>cloud,</hi> the <hi>Angels peep'd</hi> at, the
<hi>Heathen</hi> world <hi>gap'd</hi> after, but we beheld as in a plain at <hi>mid-day:</hi>
For ſince the veil of the Temple was rent, every man that hath eyes

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, To make a real <hi>uſe</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the profit of our
Souls, that if <hi>God</hi> have deſigned to be <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> an <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
God,</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> to us; that then we will fit, and prepare, and
make our ſelves capable of this <hi>Mercy;</hi> and by the help of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
devout, humble endeavours, not fruſtrate, but further and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
in our ſelves this end of <hi>Chriſts Incarnation,</hi> the ſaving of our
Souls; and this uſe is effectually made to our hands in the twelfth to
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. xii. ult.</note> at the laſt, <hi>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom that cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
be moved: i. e.</hi> being partakers of the Preſence, the Reign, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Incarnate God, Let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve
God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. And do thou, O power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God, improve the truth of this Doctrine, to the beſt advantage of our
Souls, that thy Son may not be born to us unprofitably; but that he may be
God, not only with us, but in us; in us, to ſanctifie and adorn us here with
his effectual grace; and with us, to ſuſtain us here, as our Emmanuel,
and as our Jeſus, to crown and perfect us hereafter with glory.</hi>

            <p>And ſo much for this point, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Emmanuel</hi> import the

that of Grace, that we be not dead whilſt we live. For were it not
for this aſſumption of fleſh, you may juſtly curſe that ever you carried
fleſh about you; that ever your Soul was committed to ſuch a Priſon
as your Body is; nay, ſuch a Dungeon, ſuch a Grave: But through
this <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>fleſh</hi> is, or ſhall be cleanſed into a <hi>Temple,</hi>

task (and it were a notable <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> employment, I ſhould bleſs
God, for any one that would be ſo piouſly valiant, as to undertake it)
you muſt read over the whole Book of Scripture and Nature to this
purpoſe. For when you find in the Pſalmiſt, the news of <hi>Chriſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

of the Scripture: Whenſoever, I ſay, you read any of theſe, then
are you to note; that <hi>Shiloh</hi> was to come; that he which was ſent,
was on his journey; that from the Creation, till the fulneſs of time,
the Scripture was in travel with him; and by his leaping ever now

that it had <hi>conceived,</hi> and would at laſt bring forth the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So
that the whole <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is a <hi>Myſtical Virgin Mary,</hi> a kind of
<hi>Mother of Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. iii. 15.</note> which by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> conceived him in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Mal. iii. 4.</note> and was very big of him: And at laſt in <hi>Malachi,</hi> Chap. iii.

Howſoever, at the leaſt it is plain, that the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> brought
him to his birth, though it had not ſtrength to bring forth; and the

            </p>
            <p>For the very firſt words of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> being, as it it were,

<hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> foreſeeing by his skill in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> was near his birth, did droop upon it, and hang the wing; did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſenſibly decay in his courage; began to breath thick, and ſpeak imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly;

            <p>And now by way of <hi>Uſe,</hi> Can ye ſee the <hi>Devil</hi> put out of heart,

               <hi>God with us, i. e.</hi> With our ſpirits, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> begotten and brought

            <p>And that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus born in a regenerate mans ſoul, if it were

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the better, we will compare it with his <hi>Real Incarnation</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi>
of the <hi>Virgin;</hi> that ſo we may keep cloſe to the buſineſs of the day, and
at once obſerve both his <hi>birth</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> and ours to <hi>Grace;</hi> and ſo
even poſſeſs <hi>Chriſt</hi> whilſt we ſpeak of him.</p>
            <p>And firſt, if we look on his <hi>Mother Mary,</hi> we ſhall find her an
entire pure <hi>Virgin,</hi> only eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph; but before they came
together, ſhe was found with child of the Holy Ghoſt, Matth.</hi> i. 18.
And then the <hi>Soul of Man</hi> muſt be this <hi>Virgin.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Now there is a threefold <hi>Purity</hi> or <hi>Virginity</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> Firſt,
An <hi>abſolute</hi> one, ſuch as was found in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall. Secondly,
A <hi>reſpective,</hi> of a <hi>Soul,</hi> which like <hi>Mary,</hi> hath not yet <hi>joyned</hi> or <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with the <hi>World,</hi> to whom it is <hi>eſpouſed;</hi> which though it have its

occaſion, hath not yet broke forth into the common outrages of ſin.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47754:34"/>
Thirdly, A <hi>reſtored purity</hi> of a <hi>Soul</hi> formerly polluted, but now clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
by <hi>repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former kind of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>abſolute purity,</hi> as it were to be
wiſhed for, ſo is it not to be <hi>hoped;</hi> and therefore is not to be imagined
in the <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> or expected in the <hi>Virgin Soul.</hi> The ſecond
<hi>purity,</hi> we find in all <hi>regenerate infants,</hi> who are at the ſame time out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
initiated to the <hi>Church,</hi> and inwardly to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or in thoſe
whom <hi>God</hi> hath called, before they have engaged themſelves in the

up; and to uſe our <hi>Saviours</hi> words, <hi>Have ſo lived, as not to be far from

               <hi>Acts</hi> x. 1. and ſuch
a <hi>Soul</hi> as this, is the fitteſt <hi>Womb,</hi> in which our <hi>Saviour</hi> delights to be
incarnate; where he may enter and dwell, without either reſiſtance
or annoyance; where he ſhall be received at the firſt knock, and never
be diſordered or repulſed by any ſtench of the carcaſs, or violence of
the <hi>Body of ſin.</hi> The <hi>reſtared purity,</hi> is a <hi>right Spirit renewed in the
Soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. li. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> li. 10. A wound cured up by <hi>repentance,</hi> and differs only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
from the former <hi>purity;</hi> as a ſcar from a skin never cut, wanting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

But this <hi>perpetual integrity,</hi> being a deſperate, impoſſible wiſh,
there is one only remedy, which though it cannot prevent a leak, can
ſtop it. And this is <hi>repentance</hi> after ſin committed, <hi>Poſt naufragium ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a means to ſecure one after a ſhipwrack, &amp; to deliver him even in
the deep Waters. And this we call a <hi>reſtored Virginity</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo vouchſafes to be conceived and born in. The firſt degree of
<hi>Innocence,</hi> being not to have ſinned, the ſecond to have repented.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, The <hi>Mother of Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> was a <hi>Virgin,</hi>

            <p>In the third place, if we look on the <hi>agent</hi> in this <hi>conception,</hi> we
ſhall find it, both in <hi>Mary</hi> and in the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> to be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
that which is <hi>conceived</hi> in either of them, <hi>is of the Holy Ghoſt, Mat.</hi> i. 20.
Nothing in this buſineſs of <hi>Chriſts</hi> birth with us, to be imputed to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
power or cauſes, the whole contrivance and final production of
it; the preparations to, and laboring of it, is all the <hi>workmanſhip</hi> of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Spirit.</hi> So that as <hi>Mary</hi> was called by an Ancient, ſo may the <hi>Soul</hi>
without an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> by us, be ſtyled, <hi>The Shop of Miracles,</hi> and <hi>The
Work-houſe of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> in which every operation is a miracle to
nature, and no tools are uſed, but what the <hi>Spirit</hi> forged and moves.
<hi>Mary</hi> conceived <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but it was above her own reach to apprehend
the manner how;<note place="margin">Luk. i. 34.</note> for ſo ſhe queſtions the Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> i. 34. <hi>How ſhall
this be, &amp;c?</hi> So doth the <hi>Soul of Man</hi> conceive and grow big, and bring
forth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; yet not it ſelf fully perceives how this work is wrought;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> being, for the moſt part, inſenſibly begotten in us, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
only ſpiritually, not at his <hi>entrance,</hi> but in his <hi>fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place, That <hi>Mary</hi> was <hi>choſen</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> among
all the Families of the Earth, to be the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was no
manner of deſert of hers, but <hi>Gods</hi> ſpecial favor and dignation;
whence the words run truly interpreted,<note place="margin">Luk. i. 28. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Luk.</hi> i. 28. <hi>Hail thou that art

And again,<note place="margin">V. 30.<gap reason="foreign">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> caſe of <hi>Mans Soul,</hi> there is no power of nature, no preparation of
Morality, no art that all the Philoſophy or Learning in the World can
teach a man, which can deſerve this grace at <hi>Chriſts</hi> hands, that can
any way woo or allure <hi>God</hi> to be born ſpiritually in us; which can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
or entice the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to conceive and beget <hi>Chriſt</hi> in us, but
only the meer favor &amp; good pleaſure of <hi>God;</hi> which may be obtained
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47754:35"/>
by our <hi>prayers,</hi> but can never be challenged by our <hi>merits,</hi> may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
comfortably expected and hoped for, as a largeſs given to our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and wants, but can never be required as a reward of our deſerts:
For it was no high pitch of <hi>perfection,</hi> which <hi>Mary</hi> obſerved in her
ſelf, as the motive to this favour; but only the meer mercy of <hi>God,</hi>
which <hi>regarded the lowlineſs of his hand-maid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke i. 48.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> i. 48.</p>
            <p>Whence in the fifth place, This <hi>Soul</hi> in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to be born, muſt be a <hi>lowly, humble ſoul;</hi> or elſe it will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
where in the midſt of her glory, ſhe humbly ſpecifies the <hi>lowlineſs of
his hand-maid.</hi> But this by the way.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, If we conſider here with <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>
his forerunner, coming to prepare his way; and his Preaching repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as a neceſſary requiſite to <hi>Chriſts</hi> being born, &amp; received in the
World: Then we ſhall drive the matter to a further iſſue, and find
<hi>repentance,</hi> a neceſſary <hi>preparation</hi> for the <hi>birth of Chriſt</hi> in our hearts.
For ſo the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Meſſage ſet down,<note place="margin">Iſai. xl. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 3. <hi>Prepare the ways, &amp;c.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
is here interpreted by the event,<note place="margin">Matth. iii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 2. <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom
of God is at hand;</hi> As if this <hi>Harbinger</hi> had no other furniture and
proviſion to beſpeak in the heart that was to receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but only
repentance for ſins. I will not examine here the precedence of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
before <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> though I might ſeaſonably here ſtate
the queſtion, and direct you to begin with <hi>John,</hi> &amp; proceed to <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
firſt repent, then faſten on <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Only this for all, The <hi>promiſes</hi>
of <hi>Salvation</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are promiſed on condition of <hi>repentance,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>amendment,</hi> they muſt be weary and heavy laden, who ever come to
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and expect reſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 28. And therefore whoſoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
theſe benefits to himſelf, and thereby conceives <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his
heart, muſt firſt reſolve to undertake the condition required, to wit,
<hi>Newneſs of life;</hi> which yet he will not be able to perform, till <hi>Chriſt</hi>
be fully born, and dwell in him, by his enabling <hi>graces:</hi> For you may
mark, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being both about the ſame age, as appears
by the ſtory, <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt needs be born before <hi>Johns</hi> Preaching: So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
in the <hi>Soul</hi> there is ſuppoſed ſome kind of <hi>incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>repentance</hi> or <hi>newneſs of life;</hi> yet before <hi>Chriſt</hi> he is born, or at
leaſt, come to his full ſtature and perfect growth in us; this <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s
Sermon, that is, this <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>reſolution</hi> to amendment, muſt be
preſumed in our <hi>Souls.</hi> And ſo <hi>repentance</hi> is both a <hi>preparation</hi> to
<hi>Chriſts</hi> birth, and an effect of it: For ſo <hi>John</hi> preached, <hi>Repent for, &amp;c.
Matth.</hi> iii. 2. And ſo alſo in the ſame words <hi>Chriſt</hi> preaches, <hi>Repent,
&amp;c. Matth.</hi> iv. 17. And ſo theſe two together, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Chriſt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and <hi>Faith,</hi> though one began before the other was perfected;
yet, I ſay, theſe two together in the fully regenerate man, <hi>Fulfil all
righteouſneſs, Matth.</hi> iii. 15.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh place, you may obſerve, That when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the whole Land was in an uproar. <hi>Herod</hi> the King
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47754:35"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>was troubled, and all Jeruſalem with him, Matth.</hi> ii. 3. Which whether
we apply to the leſſer city, the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> in which, or the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people, amongſt whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſpiritually born in any man, you
ſhall for the moſt acknowledge the agreement: For the man himſelf,
if he have been any inordinate ſinner, then at the birth of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
him, all his natural, ſinful faculties are much diſpleaſed, his reigning
<hi>Herod</hi> ſins, and all the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of <hi>habituate Luſts</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> are
in great diſorder, as knowing, that this new birth abodes their inſtant
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deſtruction; and then they cry oft in the voice of the <hi>Devil, Mark.</hi> i.
24. <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus, thou Son of God? Art thou
come to torment and diſpoſſeſs us before our time?</hi> If it be applied to the
<hi>Neighbor Worldlings</hi> which hear of this <hi>new convert;</hi> then are they
alſo in an uproar, and conſult how they ſhall deal with this turbulent
ſpirit, <hi>Which is made to upbraid our ways and reprove our thoughts,</hi>

againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe the attempt of his upſtart doctrine, was like to
undo the Shrine-makers: <hi>Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our
wealth.</hi> And no marvel, that in both theſe reſpects, there is a great
uproar, ſeeing the <hi>ſpiritual birth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is moſt infinitely oppoſite
to both the common people of the World, and common affections of
the Soul, two the moſt turbulent, tumultuous, wayward, violent
Nations upon Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> In the eighth and laſt place (becauſe I will not tyre you above
the time which is allotted for the tryal of your parience) you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the encreaſe and growth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that either in himſelf, <hi>in
Wiſdom and Stature, &amp;c. Luke</hi> ii. 52. or elſe in his <hi>troop</hi> and <hi>attendants,</hi>
and that either of <hi>Angels to miniſter unto him. Matth.</hi> iv. 11. or of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples</hi>
to follow &amp; obey him; and then the harmony will ſtill go cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>regenerate man,</hi> is firſt <hi>conceived,</hi> then <hi>born,</hi> then
by degrees of <hi>childhood</hi> and <hi>youth,</hi> grows at laſt to the <hi>meaſure of the

ſtrength, from vertue to vertue, is encreaſed to a perfect manhood in
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Then alſo where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus born, he chuſes and calls
a Jury at leaſt of <hi>Diſciple-graces,</hi> to judge and ſit upon thee, to give
in evidence unto thy <hi>Spirit, That thou art the Son of God.</hi> Then is he
alſo miniſtred unto, and furniſhed by the <hi>Angels</hi> with a perpetual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
either to encreaſe the lively, or to recover decayed <hi>graces.</hi> So
that now <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth beſtow a new life upon the man, and the <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

And do thou, O Holy Jeſus, which haſt loved us, and given thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſelf for us; love us ſtill, and give thy ſelf to us. Thou which haſt
been born in the World to ſave ſinners, vouchſafe again, to be again

which art the Theme of our preſent rejoycing become our Author
of perpetual, ſpiritual rejoycing; that our Souls may conceive and

that we may dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us: And from the

of thine Immortal glory hereafter.</q>
            <p>Thus have we briefly paſſed through theſe words, and in them
firſt ſhewed you the real agreement betwixt <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in
the point of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Name, and from thence noted, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi>
is in effect, all one; and that <hi>Chriſts Incarnation</hi> brought <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
into the World. Which being proved through <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Incarnations,</hi> were applied to our <hi>direction:</hi> 1. To <hi>humble</hi> our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſelves. 2. To expreſs our <hi>thankfulneſs.</hi> 3. To obſerve our <hi>priviledges.</hi>
4. To make our ſelves capable and worthy receivers of this <hi>mercy.</hi>
Then we came to the <hi>Incarnation</hi> it ſelf, where we ſhewed you the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
of this <hi>Myſtery</hi> by the effects, which the expectation and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight

               </gap>,
what doubts muſt firſt be made,
what ignorances earlieſt provided for: and
there is not a more remarkable ſpring and principle of all the
Scripture folly (that is wickedneſs) among men, than the <hi>beginning</hi>
our <hi>Chriſtian courſe</hi> unluckily, with ſome one, or more <hi>falſe infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
which not only are very hardly ever corrected afterward,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> like the errors of the firſt concoction, that are never rectified in

in them, turn all into nouriſhment of the prevailing humour:
and then as the injury of filching ſome of that <hi>corn</hi> that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

is not to be meaſured in the <hi>garner,</hi> but in the <hi>field;</hi> not by the

            <p>In the words it will be very natural to obſerve theſe 3. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;

do it upon this one ignorance, <hi>You know not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin firſt with the firſt of theſe, That there is a <hi>Peculiar Spirit</hi>
that Chriſtians are of: A ſpirit of the Goſpel; and that muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
here, not in an unlimited latitude, but one as it is oppoſite
to the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi>

               </gap>; Wilt thou do as he did? It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
will then be neceſſary to ſhew you the peculiarity of the <hi>Goſpel Spirit,</hi>
by its oppoſition to that of <hi>Elias,</hi> which is manifold for inſtance;
Firſt, <hi>Elias</hi> was the great aſſertor of Law, upon which ground <hi>Moſes</hi>
and he appear with our Saviour at his transfiguration: So that two
things will be obſervable, which make a difference betwixt the <hi>Legal,</hi>
and the <hi>Goſpel ſpirit:</hi> 1. That ſome Precepts of <hi>Chriſt</hi> now clearly (and
with weight upon them) delivered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were, if in ſubſtance
delivered at all; yet ſure not ſo clearly, and at length, and intelligibly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
propoſed under the Law. You have examples in the fifth of <hi>Matthew,</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> than ever it was to the Jews before. And there you have one
part of the Spirit of the Goſpel, in oppoſition to a firſt notion of the
legal Spirit: And by it you may conclude, that what Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can indulge himſelf the enjoyment of that helliſh ſenſuality, that
of <hi>revenge,</hi> or retributing of injuries; nay that doth not practiſe that

            <p>But there is another thing obſervable of the Law, and ſo of the
Judaical Legal Spirit; to wit, as it concerned the <hi>planting the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
in Canaan,</hi> and that is the <hi>command of rooting out the nations;</hi>
which was a particular caſe, upon God's ſight of the filling up of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath found guilty of that charge, that is all for the fire from Heaven,

            <p>In the next place, <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit was a <hi>Prophetick Spirit;</hi> whoſe dictates

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47754:38"/>
who can but Prophecy?) And ſo likewiſe are the actions Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
many things that are recorded to be done by Prophets in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they proceed from ſome peculiar incitations of God; I mean not
from the ordinary, or extraordinary, general, or ſpecial <hi>direction,</hi> or
influence of his grace, cooperating with the Word, as in the breaſt of
every regenerate man, (for the Spirit of Sanctification, and the Spirit
of Prophecy, are very diſtant things) but from the extraordinary <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
of God's Will, many times againſt the ſetled rule of duty,
acted and animated not as a living creature, by a Soul, but mov'd as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
an outward impellent, a ſphear by an intelligence, and that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into eccentrical and planetary motions; ſo that they were no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
juſtifiable, than that prophetick calling to that particular enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
will avow: Conſequent to which is, that becauſe the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
office was not beyond the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time to continue conſtantly
in the Church, any further, than to interpret, and ſuperſtruct upon
what the Canon of the Scripture hath ſetled among Chriſtians;
(<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Word in the New Teſtament, being that <hi>Bath-Col,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
which the Jews tell us, was alone to ſurvive all the other ways of
Prophecy:) he that ſhall now pretend to that Prophetick Spirit, to
ſome Viſion, to teach what the Word of God will not own; to ſome
incitation, to do what the New Teſtament Law will not allow of; he
that with the late <hi>Fryar</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pere Barnard.</note> pretends to ecſtatical revelations,

God, when he is in an <hi>Epileptick</hi> fit, ſets off the moſt ghaſtly diſeaſes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
I ſhall add moſt horrid <hi>ſins,</hi> by undertaking more particular <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>

ſuch deluſions, and put all to death that will not be their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes,</hi>
is far enough from the Goſpel Spirit that lies viſible in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
New Teſtament, (<hi>verbum vehiculum ſpiritûs,</hi> and the preaching of
the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and is not infuſed by dream or whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

            </p>
            <p>In the third place, <hi>Elias</hi> was the great precedent and example of
ſharp unjudiciary procedure with Malefactors, which from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ordinary awards on Criminals in that execution, proceeded
Trial, and the Malefactor ſuffered <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, without attending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the formalities of Law.</p>
            <p>Of this kind, two Examples are by <hi>Mattathias</hi> cited, 1 <hi>Macab.</hi> ii.
one of <hi>Phinees,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that zeal'd a zeal, and in that
run through <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> and ſo (as the Captain once anſwered
for the killing the drowſie Sentinel) <hi>reliquit quos invenit,</hi> found
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47754:38"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them in unclean embraces, and ſo left them: (And the variety of
our interpretations in rendring of that paſſage in the Pſalm, <hi>Then ſtood
up Phinehas and prayed,</hi> in the Old, and <hi>then ſtood up Phinehas and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
judgment,</hi> in the New Tranſlations, may perhaps give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that action of his, that upon <hi>Phinehas</hi> Prayer for Gods dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
what ſhould be done in that matter, God raiſed him up in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner to execute judgment on thoſe offenders.) And the
other of <hi>Elias</hi> in the Text, and he with ſome addition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>, <hi>In zealing the zeal of the Law, called fire from Heaven upon
thoſe that were ſent out from</hi> Ahazai, <hi>to bring him to him.</hi> And this
fact of his (by God's anſwering his call, and the coming down of the
fire upon them) was demonſtrated to come from God alſo, as
much as the prediction of the Kings death, which was confirm'd by
this means.</p>
            <p>It may very probably be gueſt by <hi>Matathias</hi> his words in that place
that there were no precedents of the zelotick ſpirit in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but thoſe two; for among all the Catalogue of examples menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to his ſons, to enflame their zeal to the Law, he produceth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and 'tis obſervable, that though there be practiſes of this nature
mentioned in the ſtory of the New Teſtament, the <hi>ſtoning</hi> of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Iconium,</hi> &amp;c. yet all of them practiſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
not one that can ſeem to be blameleſs, but that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who ſure
had extraordinary power) upon the <hi>buyers</hi> and <hi>ſellers</hi> in the <hi>Temple;</hi>
upon which the Apoſtles remembred the Pſalmiſts Prophecy, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the <hi>zeal of Gods houſe</hi> carried him to that act of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
and puniſhment upon the tranſgreſſors. And what miſchief
was done among the Jews by thoſe of that ſect in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that call'd
themſelves by that name of <hi>Zealots,</hi> and withal, took upon them to be
the ſaviours and preſervers of the City, but as it prov'd, the haſtners
&amp; precipitators of the deſtruction of that Kingdom, by caſting out, &amp;
killing the High-Prieſts firſt, and then the Nobles and chief men
of the Nation, and ſo embaſing, and intimidating, and dejecting the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hearts of the people, that all was at length given up to their fury,
<hi>Joſephus,</hi> and any of the learned that have converſed with the Jewiſh
Writers will inſtruct the enquirer: And ever ſince, no very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
notion had of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the New Teſtament; one of the
<hi>fruits of the fleſh, Gal.</hi> v. of the <hi>Wiſdom that comes not from Heaven,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>bitter zeal,</hi> a gall that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
all that come near it. The ſhort of it is, the putting any man
to death, or inflicting other puniſhment upon any terms, but that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of legal, perfectly legal proceſs; is the importance of a zelotick Spirit,
as I remember in <hi>Maimonides,</hi> him that curſes God in the name of
an Idol,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Idol.</hi> c. 2.</note> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that meet him, kill him, <hi>i. e.</hi> the zealots permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it ſeems, if not authorized to do ſo. And this is the Spirit of
<hi>Elias,</hi> that is of all others, moſt evidently reprehended and renounced
by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Samaritans</hi> no very ſacred perſons, added to their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47754:39"/>
conſtant guilts, at that time to deny common civility of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; and the Diſciples asked whether they
might not do what <hi>Elias</hi> had done, <hi>call for fire from Heaven</hi> upon them
in that caſe; &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells them, that the Goſpel-Spirit was of another
complexion from that of <hi>Elias,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>turn'd</hi> to them
as he did to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> as to ſo
many fiery Satanical-ſpirited men, and checkt them for that their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
zeal, with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The leaſt I can conclude from
hence is this, that they that put any to death, by any but perfectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
legal proceſs; that draw the ſword upon any, but by the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
command, are far enough from the Goſpel-Spirit, whatever
precedent they can produce to countenance them: And ſo if they be
really, what they pretend, Chriſtians, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
miſtake, or ignorance; <hi>They know not what Spirit they are
of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet farther is it obſervable of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he did execrate and
curſe, call for judgments from Heaven upon mens perſons; and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
temper of mind in the parallel, you may diſtribute into two ſorts; Firſt
in paſſing <hi>judgments</hi> upon mens <hi>future eſtates,</hi> the <hi>cenſorious</hi> reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Spirit,</hi> which though we find it not in <hi>Elias</hi> at this time, yet is a
conſequent of the Prophetick Office, and part of the burthen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Lord, and layed upon thoſe guilty perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom it hath pleaſed Almighty God to reveal that ſecret of
his Cabinet; but then this rigor cannot, without ſin, be pretended to
by any elſe; for in the blackeſt inſtances, charity believes all things &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hopes all things, and even in this ſence, covers the multitudes of ſins.
Now this ſo culpable an inſolent humour, raſhly to paſs a condemning
ſentence, was diſcernible in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> (this <hi>Publican</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and trade is forbidden by that <hi>Law,</hi> and this <hi>people that know
not that Law, is curſed</hi>) ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Montaniſts, (nos ſpirituales,</hi>
and all others <hi>animals</hi> and <hi>Pſychici</hi>) ſo in the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all but themſelves) and in <hi>all thoſe</hi> generally whoſe <hi>pride</hi> and
<hi>malice</hi> conjoyned, (moſt directly contrary to the Goſpel-Spirit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and charity) doth (prepare them one and the other) inflame
them to triumph, and glut themſelves in this <hi>ſpiritual aſſaſſinacy,</hi> this
deepeſt dye of blood, the murthering of Souls; which becauſe they
cannot do it really, they endeavour in effigie, anathematize, and
ſlaughter them here in this other <hi>Calvary,</hi> the place for the <hi>crucifying</hi>
of <hi>reputations,</hi> turning them out of the Communion of their charity,
though not of bliſs; and I am confident, reject many whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
entertain more hoſpitably. Another part of this curſing Spirit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
there is, more peculiarly <hi>Elias</hi>'s, that of <hi>praying</hi> (and ſo calling) for
<hi>curſes</hi> on mens perſons; and that being upon the enemies of <hi>God,</hi> and
thoſe appearing to <hi>Elias,</hi> a Prophet to be ſuch, might be then lawful
to him, and others like him, <hi>David</hi> perhaps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi>
but is wholly diſliked and renounced by <hi>Chriſt</hi> under this ſtate of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47754:39"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> higher <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> to which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are deſigned by him in the <hi>New.</hi>
I ſay, not only for that which concerns our own enemies, for that is
clear, <hi>When thine enemy hungreth, feed him;</hi> and ſomewhat like that
in the <hi>Old Testament, When thine enemies Ox, &amp;c.</hi> But I extend it even
to the enemies of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and that I need not do upon other
evidence than is afforded from the Text; the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were enemies
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and were barbarous and inhumane to his perſon, and
they muſt not be curſt by <hi>Diſciples.</hi> And he that can now curſe even
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wicked men, who are more diſtantly the enemies of <hi>God,</hi> can call for
(I ſay, not diſcomfiture upon their devices, for that is <hi>charity</hi> to them,
to keep them from being ſuch unhappy Creatures as they would be,
<hi>contrivers</hi> of ſo much miſchief to the world; but) <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi>

ſay the Fathers, <hi>Peter</hi> was of an <hi>hot Conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had commended to him, he had not it ſeems yet

doing <hi>no more;</hi> not for cutting off his Ear, but for not directing the

barbarous Divinity hath been juſtified of late by the Writings of ſome
(who will yet perſwade us that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not reprehend St. <hi>Peter</hi> for
that act) and by the actions of others, I have little joy to repreſent to
you; God knows, I love not to widen breaches; only I am ſure the
<hi>Fathers</hi> are clear; that though formerly St. <hi>Peter</hi> were ignorant, and

               <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>though it were to avenge even God himſelf.</hi> And having given

the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came according to promiſe <hi>to teach them all things, and

there is not a Creature here that hath reaſon to doubt, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
ſent to die for him, and by that death hath purchaſed his right to life.
Only do but come in, do but ſuffer your ſelves to <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to
have <hi>died;</hi> do not uncrucifie <hi>Chriſt</hi> by crucifying him again by your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

Heaven, as <hi>God</hi> is willing, nay deſirous to bring you thither; and
<hi>Chriſt</hi> as ready to beſtow that Inheritance upon you at his ſecond
coming, as at his firſt to purchaſe it. Nothing but Infidelity reſtrains
<hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings, and confines them to a few. Were but this one

               <p>A ſecond Argument of <hi>God</hi>'s good meaning towards us of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs

what a degree of prophaneneſs, &amp; unnatural abominations the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
World was then arrived to, as you may read in all their ſtories;
and in the firſt <hi>to the Romans,</hi> how well grown, and ripe for the Devil,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> found them; all of them damnably Superſtitious and <hi>Idolatrous</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
in their Worſhip; damnably <hi>unclean</hi> in their lives; nay, engaged for

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>never to entertain any new Laws,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dio.</note> or <hi>Religion:</hi> not to innovate,
though it were to get <hi>Salvation,</hi> as beſides their own <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> may be
gathered out of <hi>Act.</hi> xvii. 18. And laſtly, conſider how they were
hook'd in by the Devil, to <hi>joyn in crucifying</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they might
be guilty of that blood which might otherwiſe have ſaved them, and
then you will find no argument to perſwade you 'twas poſſible, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> ſhould have any deſign of mercy on them. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo reſolv'd

Counſels, a Mercy decreed in ſecret, that no Creature ever wiſt of,

               <p>And in this behalf are we all (being lineally deſcended from the
<hi>Gentiles</hi>) bound over to an infinite meaſure both of humiliation and
gratitude, for our deliverance from the guilt and reign of that <hi>ſecond
original ſin,</hi> that Heatheniſm of our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> and Catholick damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Sixteen hundred years ago we were allinvolv'd in. Beloved,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we were long ago ſet right again, and the obligation lies heavy upon
us, to ſhew this change to have been wrought in us to ſome purpoſe;
to prove our ſelves Chriſtians in grain, ſo fixed and eſtabliſhed,
that all the Devils in Hell ſhall not be able to reduce us again to that
abhorred condition. If we that are thus called out, ſhall fall back after
ſo much Goſpel to Heathen practices, and ſet up <hi>Shrines</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi>
in our hearts to every poor <hi>delight</hi> that our ſottiſhneſs can call a <hi>God;</hi>
if we are not called out of their ſins, as well as out of their ignorance;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then have we advanced but the further toward Hell; we are ſtill but
Heathen Goſpellers; our Chriſtian Infidelity and practical Atheiſm,
will but help to charge their guilt upon us, and damn us the deeper
for being Chriſtians. Do but examine your ſelves on this one <hi>Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
whether this calling the Gentiles hath found any effect in your
hearts, any influence on your lives; whether your Converſations are
not ſtill as Heatheniſh as ever? If you have no other grounds or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to embrace the Goſpel, but only becauſe you are born within the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pale of the <hi>Church,</hi> no other evidences of your Diſcipleſhip, but your
livery; then God is little beholding to you for your ſervice, The
ſame motives would have ſerved to have made you <hi>Turks,</hi> if it had
been your chance to have been born amongſt them: and now all that
fair Chriſtian outſide is not thank-worthy. 'Tis but your good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that you are not now at the ſame work with the old <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
or preſent <hi>Indians,</hi> a worſhipping either <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the <hi>Sun!</hi> 'Twas
a ſhrewd ſpeech of <hi>Clemens,</hi> that the life of every unregenerate Man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> is an Heathen-life; and the ſins of unſanctified Men, are Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins;
and the eſtate of a Libertine Chriſtian, an Heathen eſtate: and

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:47754:48"/>
The third, and in ſum, the powerfulleſt Argument to prove <hi>God</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
willingneſs that we ſhould live, is, that <hi>he hath beſtowed his ſpirit upon
us;</hi> that as ſoon as he called up the <hi>Son,</hi> he ſent the <hi>Comforter.</hi> This
may ſeem to be the main buſineſs that <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended to Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
ſo that a Man would gueſs from the xvi.<note place="margin">John xvi. 7.</note> Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>
and Verſ. 7. that if it had not been for that, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had tarried amongſt
us till this time; but that it was more expedient to ſend the Spirit to
ſpeak thoſe things powerfully to our hearts, which often and in vain
had been ſounded in our ears. 'Tis a fancy of the <hi>Paracelſians,</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
if we could ſuck out the lives and ſpirits of other Creatures, as we
feed on their fleſh, we ſhould never die: their lives would nouriſh and
tranſubſtantiate into our lives, their ſpirit increaſe our ſpirits, and ſo
our lives grow with our years, &amp; the older we were, by conſequence
the fuller of life; and ſo no difficulty to become Immortal. Thus
hath <hi>God</hi> dealt with us; firſt ſent his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>Incarnate Son,</hi> his own
Fleſh, to feed, and nouriſh us; and for all this, we die daily: he hath
now given us his own very Life, and incorporeous <hi>Eſſence,</hi> a piece of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  <hi>pure God,</hi> his very <hi>Spirit</hi> to feed upon, and digeſt, that if it be poſſible
we might live. There is not a vein in our Souls, unleſs it be quite pin'd
and ſhrivel'd up, but hath ſome blood produced in it by that holy nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment;
every breath that ever we have breathed toward Heaven,
hath been thus inſpired; beſides thoſe louder Voices of <hi>God,</hi> either
ſounding in his <hi>Word,</hi> or thundring in his <hi>Judgments:</hi> there is his
calm, ſoft voice of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> like the Night Viſion of old, which
ſtole in upon the mind, mingled with ſleep, and gentle ſlumber. He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
draws not out into the Field, or meets us as an Enemy; but entraps us
by ſurprize, and diſarms us in our quarters, by a Spiritual Stratagem
conquers at unawares, and even betrays, and circumvents, and cheats
us into Heaven. That precept of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>To worſhip at the noiſe and whiſtling of the wind,</hi> had
ſenſe, and divinity in it, that <hi>Iamblicus</hi> that cites it never dreamt of;
that every ſound and whiſpering of this Spirit, which ruſtles either
about our ears, or in our hearts, (as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tecum eſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
intus eſt</hi>) when it breaths, and blows within us, the ſtouteſt faculty of
our Souls, the proudeſt piece of fleſh about us ſhould bow down, and
worſhip. Concerning the manner of the <hi>Spirits</hi> working, I am not,
I need not to diſpute. Thus far it will be ſeaſonable and profitable for
you to know, that many other Illuminations and holy Graces are to
be imputed to <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> beſides that by which we are effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
<hi>God</hi> ſpeaks to us many times, when we anſwer him not, and
ſhines about our eyes, when we either wink, or ſleep. Our many ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſhort-winded <hi>Ejaculations</hi> toward Heaven, our frequent, but
weak <hi>inclinations</hi> to good, our ephemerous <hi>wiſhes,</hi> that no man can
diſtinguiſh from true <hi>piety,</hi> but by their ſudden death; our every-day
<hi>reſolutions</hi> of obedience, whileſtwe continue in ſin are arguments that
<hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Spirit</hi> hath ſhined on us, though the warmth that it produced
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47754:48"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be ſoon chill'd with the damp it meets with in us. For example, there
is no doubt, beloved, but the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> accompanies his Word, as
at this time, to your ears; if you will but open at its knock, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and entertain it in your hearts, it ſhall prove unto you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its moſt glorious attribute, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. <hi>The power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
But if you will refuſe it, your ſtubborneſs may repel and
<hi>fruſtrate</hi> God's Work, but not <hi>annihilate</hi> it; though you will not be
ſaved by it, it is <hi>God</hi>'s ſtill, and ſo ſhall continue to witneſs againſt you
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at the day of doom. Every <hi>word</hi> that was every darted from that <hi>Spirit,</hi>
as a beam or javelin of that piercing Sun, every atome of that flaming
Sword, as the word is phraſed, ſhall not, though it be rebated, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh:
the day of vengeance ſhall inſtruct your Souls, that it was ſent
from <hi>God,</hi> and ſince it was once refuſed, hath been kept in ſtore, not
to upbraid, but damn you.</p>
               <p>Many other petty <hi>occaſions</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> ordinarily takes to put off
the <hi>Cloud,</hi> and open his <hi>Face</hi> towards us: nay, it were not a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doubt, whether he do not always ſhine, and the cloud be only
in our hearts, which makes us think the Sun is gone down, or quite
extinct, if at any time we feel not his rays within us. Beloved, there
be many things amongſt us, that ſingle fire can do nothing upon; they

with ſome ſolid inſtrument, ſome ſound, corpulent, piercing
<hi>judgment,</hi> or elſe it will be very unlikely to thrive. True it is, the
<hi>Spirit</hi> is an omnipotent Agent, which can ſo inviſibly infuſe and
inſinuate its vertue through the inward man, that the whole moſt

and this is a <hi>Miracle</hi> which I deſire from my heart, might be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhewed upon every Soul here preſent.</p>
               <p>But that which is to my preſent purpoſe, is only this, That <hi>God</hi>
hath alſo other manners and ways of working, which are truly to be
ſaid to have deſcended from Heaven, though they are not ſo ſucceſsful
as to bring us thither; other more calm, and leſs boyſterous influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which if they were received into an honeſt heart, might prove
<hi>ſemen immortalitatis,</hi> and in time encreaſe, and <hi>grow up to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> There is no ſuch encumbrance to traſh us in our Chriſtian Progreſs
as a fancy that ſome men get poſſeſſed with; that if they are <hi>elected,</hi>
they ſhall be <hi>called</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi> in ſpight of their teeth; every man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
an extraordinary call, becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> met with one; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:47754:49"/>
In this behalf, all that I deſire of you is, Firſt, to conſider, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
though our <hi>regeneration</hi> be a <hi>miracle,</hi> yet there are degrees of <hi>miracles,</hi>
and thou haſt no reaſon to expect, that the greateſt and ſtrongeſt <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi>
in the world, ſhall in the higheſt degree be ſhewed in thy <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Who art thou, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould take ſuch extraordinary pains
with thee?</p>
               <p>Secondly, To reſolve, that many precious rays and beams of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> though when they enter, they come with power; yet through
our neglect, may prove tranſitory, paſs by that heart which is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
open for them.</p>
               <p>And then thirdly, You will eaſily be <hi>convinced,</hi> that no duty
concerns us all ſo ſtrictly, as to obſerve, as near as we can, when thus
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> appears to us; to collect and muſter up the moſt lively,
quick-ſighted, ſprightfulleſt of our <hi>faculties:</hi> and with all the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives</hi>
that <hi>ſpiritual Opticks</hi> can furniſh us with, to lay wait for every
glance and glimpſe of its fire or light. We have ways in <hi>nature,</hi> to
apprehend the beams of the Sun, be they never ſo weak and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and by uniting them into a burning Glaſs, to turn them into afire.
Oh that we were as witty and ſagacious in our <hi>ſpiritual estate!</hi> then it
were eaſie for thoſe ſparks which we ſo often either contemn or ſtifle,
to thrive within us, and at leaſt, break forth into a <hi>flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In brief, <hi>Incogitancy</hi> and <hi>inobſervance</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> ſeaſons, ſupine
numbneſs, and negligence in <hi>ſpiritual affairs,</hi> may on good grounds be
reſolved on, as the main or ſole cauſe of our <hi>final impenitence</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi>
it being juſt with <hi>God,</hi> to take thoſe away in a <hi>ſleep</hi> who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
thus walked in a <hi>dream,</hi> and at laſt to refuſe them, whom he hath ſo
long ſollicited. He that hath ſcorned or waſted his <hi>inheritance,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
complain if he dies a bankrupt; nor he that hath ſpent his <hi>candle</hi>
at play, count it hard uſage, that he is fain to go to bed darkling. It
were eaſie to multiply arguments on this <hi>theme,</hi> &amp; from every minute
of our lives, to diſcern ſome <hi>pawn</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> fatherly will
and deſire that we ſhould live. Let it ſuffice, that we have been
large, if not abundant in theſe three chief ones: Firſt, <hi>The giving of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
his Son to the World.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Diſpatching the Goſpel to the Gentiles.</hi>
And laſtly, <hi>The ſending of his Spirit.</hi> We come now to a view of the

               <p>There is no one conceit that engages us ſo deep, to continue in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſin, that keeps us from repentance, and hinders any ſeaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of our wicked lives, as a perſwaſion, that <hi>God</hi>'s will is a

have done, could not be otherwiſe; all our care could not have cut off
one ſin from the Catalogue. And ſo being reſolved, that when we
thus ſinned, we could not chuſe, we can ſcarce tell how to repent for
ſuch neceſſary fatal miſdemeanors; the ſame excuſes which we have

generally better prepared for Apologies than Reformation. Beloved,
it will certainly much conduce to our edification, inſtead of this ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>(whoſe grounds or truth, I will not now examine) to fix this

eternal death, or as it is the <hi>ſin</hi> it ſelf, a privation of the life of <hi>grace,
ſpiritual death,</hi> is wholly to be imputed to our wilful will. It is a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme</hi>

1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 15.<note place="margin">1 Joh. ii. 15.</note> in its compoſition, it will be hard for the <hi>ſpiritual life</hi>

yet if it be only in the <hi>brain,</hi> neither is this to be accounted ſolid

carnal, either in indulgence to <hi>many,</hi> or, which is the ſnare of

as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is ſaid to have done, who undertook to raiſe the dead,
give motion to the head, make the eyes look up or the tongue ſpeak;

And it is impoſſible, though not abſolutely, yet <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> the ſecond

So that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> would not wonder at the voice that cried, <hi>O Altar,

prayer for a ſtony heart, as if it were more likely to receive impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than that which he had already of fleſh.</p>
               <p>It were long to inſiſt on the <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> of our fleſhy hearts, how
they make a faction within themſelves, and bandy faculties for the

venture to be unmannerly: We have all <hi>married a Wife,</hi> eſpouſed our

The Devil is wiſer in his generation than we, he knows the price and
value of a Soul &amp; will pay any rate for it, rather than loſe his market;
he will give all the riches in the world, rather than miſs. And we at
how low a rate do we prize it? it is the cheapeſt commodity we carry
about us. The beggarlieſt content under <hi>Heaven,</hi> is fair, is rich enough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to be given in exchange for the Soul. <hi>Spiritus non ponderat,</hi> ſaith the
<hi>Philoſopher;</hi> the Soul being a ſpirit, when we put it into the balance,
weighs nothing; nay, more than ſo, it is lighter than vanity, lighter
than nothing, <hi>i. e.</hi> it doth not only weigh nothing, but even lifts up
the ſcale it is put into, when nothing is weighed againſt it. How
many ſins, how many vanities, how many idols, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi>
phraſe, how many nothings be there in the world, each of which will

               <p>It were tedious to obſerve and deſcribe the ſeveral ways that our

one minute betwixt this time of our jollity, and our everlaſting hell.
Do but lay this one circumſtance to your hearts, do but ſuppoſe your

a one as ſhall finally conſume the whole world; as it were battered
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with <hi>thundering</hi> and <hi>lightning,</hi> and beſieged with <hi>fire,</hi> where the next
<hi>throw</hi> or <hi>plunge</hi> of thy diſeaſe, may poſſibly ſeparate thy ſoul from thy

then ſuppoſe there were one only minute, wherein a ſerious reſigning
up thy ſelf to <hi>God,</hi> might recover you to Heaven. O then what
power and energy! what force and ſtrong efficacy, would there be in
this voice from <hi>God, Why will you die?</hi> I am reſolved, that heart that
were truly ſenſible of it, that were prepared ſeaſonably by all theſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> circumſtances to receive it, would find ſuch inward vigor and
ſpirit from it, that it would ſtrike death dead in that one minute;
this <hi>ultimus conatus,</hi> this laſt <hi>ſpring</hi> and <hi>plunge,</hi> would do more than a
thouſand heartleſs <hi>heaves</hi> in a lingring ſickneſs, and perhaps over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and quit the danger.</p>
               <p>And therefore let me <hi>beſeech</hi> you to repreſent this condition to
your ſelves, and not any longer be flattered or couzened in a ſlow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:

in vain, labour and ſtruggle, and not have breath enough to ſend up
one ſigh toward Heaven. The hour of our death we are wont to call
<hi>Tempus improbabilitatis,</hi> a very improbable <hi>inch</hi> of time to build our
Heaven in; as after death is <hi>impoſſibilitatis,</hi> a time wherein it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

perhaps a <hi>Fever</hi> may ſend us away raving, in no caſe to name <hi>God,</hi> but
only in <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>curſes;</hi> and then it were hideous to tell you, what a

muſt be a work of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and a gift of <hi>God,</hi> how can we promiſe
our ſelves, that <hi>God</hi> will be ſo merciful, whom we have till then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
or our ſouls then capable of any holy impreſſion, having been

and a conviction, that in ſpight of his teeth, he muſt now ſin no

               <p>Many a <hi>ſick man</hi> reſolves ſtrongly to take the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> doſe,

            <p>-NOt to waſte any <hi>time</hi> or <hi>breath,</hi> or (which men
in this delicate and effeminate Age, are wont to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be moſt ſparing and thrifty of) any part of your
precious <hi>patience</hi> unprofitably, but briefly to give
you a gueſs whither our diſcourſe is like to lead
you; We will ſeverally lay down, and ſort to
your view, every word of the Text ſingle; and
ſo we may gather them up again, and apply them to their natural
proper purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then the particle, <hi>Though</hi>] in the front, and, <hi>ſurely</hi>] in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Text, are but bands and junctures to keep all together into
one propoſition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Pronoun, <hi>They</hi>] in each place, is in the letter, the
<hi>Jews,</hi> in application preſent <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and being indefinite, might
ſeem to be of the ſame extent in both places, did not the matter alter
it, and make it <hi>univerſal</hi> in the <hi>former,</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> in the <hi>latter:</hi>
For <hi>Artiſts</hi> ſay, that an indefinite ſign, where the matter is neceſſary,
is equivalent to an <hi>Univerſal,</hi> where but contingent, to a particular.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Now to ſay <hi>the Lord liveth,</hi> was, and is neceſſary; though not by
any Logical, yet by a Political neceſſity; the Government and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, under which then the <hi>Jews,</hi> and now we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> live,
require this profeſſion neceſſarily at our hands: But to <hi>ſwear falſly,</hi>
not to perform what before they profeſt, is <hi>materia contingens,</hi> a matter
of no neceſſity, but free will and choice, that no humane Law can ſee
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47754:53"/>
into; and therefore we muſt not interpret by the rules of Art, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that all were perjur'd, but ſome only; though 'tis probable a
major part;<note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> and as we may gueſs by the firſt verſe of this Chapter,
well nigh all of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to <hi>ſay</hi>] is openly to make profeſſion, and that very
reſolutely and boldly, that none may dare to diſtruſt it; nay, with an
<hi>Oath</hi> to confirm it to jealous opinions, as appears by the latter
words,<note place="margin">Jer. iv. 2.</note> 
               <hi>They ſwear falſly,</hi> while they do but ſay: and <hi>Jer. 14. 2. Thou
ſhalt ſwear, The Lord liveth, &amp;c.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>the Lord</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> both in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi>
the whole <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Liveth</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> by way of <hi>Excellency,</hi> hath a life of his
own, independent and eternal, and in reſpect of us, is the Fountain of
all <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> that we have; and not only of <hi>Life,</hi> but <hi>Motion,</hi>
and <hi>Perfection,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and all that belongs to
it. In brief, to ſay, <hi>The Lord liveth,</hi> is to acknowledg him in his
<hi>Eſſence,</hi> and all his <hi>Attributes,</hi> conteined together under that one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Principle, on that of <hi>life,</hi> to believe whatever <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
<hi>Prophets</hi> then, or now our <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> hath made known to us of
him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, to falſifie and ſwerve from <hi>Truth,</hi> becomes a farther ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation,
eſpecially in the preſent inſtance; though they make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> and loves a plain veracious
ſpeech, yet they ſwear; though by loud and dreadful imprecations,
they beſpeak him a Witneſs and a Judge unto the Criminal; pray as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
devoutly for deſtruction for their <hi>Sin,</hi> as the moſt ſober Penitent can
do for its <hi>Pardon,</hi> yet are they <hi>perjur'd, they ſwear falſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More than all this, they openly renounce the <hi>Deity</hi> when they call
upon him; their <hi>hearts</hi> go not along with their <hi>words</hi> and <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi>
though it be the ſureſt truth in the World that they ſwear,
when they aſſert <hi>that the Lord liveth,</hi> yet they are perjur'd in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; though they make a fair ſhew of believing in the <hi>brain,</hi> and
from the teeth outward, they never lay the truth that they are ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
for, at all to their <hi>hearts;</hi> or as the Original hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

to no purpoſe 'tis that they ſwear, no man that ſees how they
live, will give any heed to their words, will imagine that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any ſuch matter.</p>
            <p>So now having paced over, and as it were ſpell'd every word ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
there will be no difficulty for the raweſt underſtanding to put it
together, and read it currently enough in this propoſition; <hi>Amongſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the multitude of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, there is very little real piety,
very little true belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the verſe next before my Text, there is an <hi>O Yes</hi> made, a <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
nay, a <hi>Hew</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> and a hurrying about the ſtreets, if it
were poſſible, to find out but a man that were a ſincere Believer; and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47754:53"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> here in my Text is brought in a <hi>Non eſt inventus, Though they ſay the
Lord liveth</hi>] a multitude of Profeſſors indeed every where, <hi>yet ſurely
they ſwear falſly,</hi> there is no credit to be given to their words; infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and hypocriſie is in their hearts; for all their fair believing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
they had an unfaithful rebellious heart,<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> V. 23. and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
manifeſted it, <hi>they are departed and gone,</hi> arrant <hi>Apoſtates</hi> in their
lives, by which they were to be tryed; <hi>Neither ſay they in their

               <hi>Let us fear the Lord,</hi> V. 24. whatſoever they flouriſhed with

            <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> of the firſt, wherein this <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and to ſpeak more

            <p>Since that rather <hi>phancy</hi> than <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts, Schoolmen,</hi>
and <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> generally defining <hi>Faith</hi> to be a <hi>bare aſſent to the truth of

baniſhed out of the Schools, as a faith for a <hi>Chamaelion</hi> to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed

which ſtill poſſeſſes the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> and alſo a ſort of men, who would
be thought moſt diſtant from them, hath been exerciſed, and ſilenced,
and caſt out of our <hi>Schools</hi> (would I could ſay, out of our <hi>hearts</hi>) by

confining it to the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> others to the <hi>Will</hi>) till at laſt it
pitched upon the whole <hi>Soul,</hi> the intellective nature. For the Soul of
Man, ſhould it be partitioned into faculties, (as the grounds of our
ordinary Philoſophy would perſwade us) it would not be ſtately e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for ſo royal a gueſt: either room would be too pent, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to entertain at once ſo many graces as attend it. <hi>Faith</hi> therefore,
that it may be received in ſtate; that it may have more freedom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> its Soveraignty, hath required all partitions to be taken down;
that ſitting in the whole Soul, it may command and order the whole
Man; is not in the <hi>brain</hi> ſometimes as its <hi>gallery,</hi> to recreate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template;
at another in the <hi>heart,</hi> as its <hi>parlour</hi> to feed, or a <hi>cloſet</hi> to
diſpatch buſineſs; but if it be truly that royal Perſonage which we take
it for, it is <hi>repletive</hi> in the whole <hi>houſe</hi> at once, as in one room, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47754:54"/>
that a ſtately Palace, which would be much diſgraced, and loſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
its ſplendor, by being cut into offices: and accordingly this royal
Grace is an entire abſolute <hi>Prince</hi> of a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> (not as a <hi>Tetrarch</hi>
of <hi>Galilee,</hi> a <hi>ſharer</hi> of a <hi>Saxon Heptarchy</hi>) and deſcribed to us as one
ſingle act, though of great command; and defined to be an aſſent
and adherence to the goodneſs of the object; (which object is the
whole word of <hi>God,</hi> and ſpecially the promiſes of the Goſpel.) So
then, to <hi>believe,</hi> is not to acknowledge the <hi>truth</hi> of Scripture, and
Articles of the Creed, (as vulgarly we uſe knowledg) but to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

all the Commands, Prohibitions, and Promiſes never ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he doth not adhere to them in his practice, and by particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of them as a rule to guide him in all his actions, expreſs that
he ſets a true value on them; if he do not this, he is yet an Infidel; all
his Religion is but like the <hi>Beads-mans,</hi> who whines over his Creed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

believe that he could not make good his threatnings. The truth is
this; ſhe ſaw clearly enough in her <hi>brain,</hi> but had not ſunk it down
into her <hi>heart;</hi> or perhaps ſhe aſſented to it in the general, but not as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
appliable to her preſent caſe. This aſſent was like a <hi>Bird</hi> fluttering

danger again to be converted, for fear of a <hi>divorce</hi> from his two trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
his <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and his <hi>Whore.</hi>
            </p>

calls <hi>Almoſt a Chriſtian;</hi> or as the phraſe may be rendred, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 28. convinced to the general truths in his brain;
but the lower half, his heart and affections, remained as <hi>Heatheniſh</hi>
as ever.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>third ground</hi> of <hi>practical unbelief,</hi> that <hi>generalities</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
can be cheaply believed without parting from any thing we prize:
The Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> can be received, and thwart never a <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
affection,</hi> as being an inoffenſive truth. <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for ſin, by the <hi>natural man,</hi> may be heard with joy; but <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application</hi> is very difficult: That our <hi>obedience</hi> to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of that <hi>Trinity,</hi> muſt be ſincere: that we muſt forgo all, and
hate our own fleſh to adhere to ſo merciful a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and expreſs our
love to the moſt contemptible Soul under Heaven, as he hath loved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
us; that we muſt, at laſt, expect him in <hi>majeſty</hi> as a <hi>Judge,</hi> whom we
are content to hug and embrace in his <hi>humility</hi> as a <hi>Saviour:</hi> This is a
bloody word, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his wife counted the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> too harſh and
rough to be received into ſuch pampered, tender, fleſhy hearts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth ground</hi> is, a <hi>general humour</hi> that is gotten in the World,
<hi>To take care of nothing, but our reputations:</hi> Nor <hi>God,</hi> nor life, nor
ſoul, nor any thing can weigh with it in the ballance. Now it is a
ſcandalous thing, a foul blot to ones name to be counted an Atheiſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
an arrant Infidel, where all are <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and therefore for faſhions
ſake we will believe, and yet ſometime the Devil hath turned this
humor quite the contrary way, and made ſome men as ambitious of
being counted Atheiſts, as others of being Chriſtians. It will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grow into a gentile garb, and part of courtſhip, to diſclaim all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in ſhew, as well as deeds. Thus are a world of men in the World,
either profeſt Atheiſts, or Atheiſtical Profeſſors, upon the ſame
grounds of <hi>vain-glory;</hi> the one to get, the other to ſave their <hi>reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
in the World. Thus do many men ſtand up at the <hi>Creed,</hi> upon
the ſame terms as Gallants go into the field; that have but ſmall maw
to be killed, only to keep their honor, that they might not be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and mocked for cowards. And yet certainly in the truth, theſe
are the verieſt daftards under <hi>Heaven;</hi> no worldly man ſo fearful of
death, or pious man of hell, as theſe are of diſgrace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt ground</hi> I ſhall mention, and indeed the main of all, is,
<hi>The ſubtlety and wilineſs of the Devil.</hi> He hath tried all his ſtratagems <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
in the World, and hath found none like this, for the undermining and
ruining of Souls, to ſuffer them to advance a pretty way in <hi>Religion,</hi>
to get their heads full of knowledg, that ſo they may think they have
faith enough, and walk to hell ſecurely. The <hi>Devil</hi>'s firſt policies
were by <hi>Hereſies,</hi> to corrupt the Brain, to invade &amp; ſurprize <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:47754:57"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by force: but he ſoon ſaw this would not hold out long; he was fain
to come from batteries, to mines, and ſupplant thoſe Forts that he
could not vanquiſh. The Fathers (and amongſt them chiefly <hi>Leo,</hi> in
all his writing) within the firſt Five hundred years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
him at this ward, <hi>Ut quos vincere ferro flammiſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>

irretiret, &amp; ſub falſâ Chriſtiani nominis profeſſione corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret.</hi>
He hoped to get more by luſts, than hereſies, and to plunge
men deepeſt in an high conceit of their holy Faith. He had learned
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by experience from himſelf, that all the bare knowledg in the World
would never ſanctifie: it would perhaps give men content, and make
them confident and bold of their eſtate; and by preſuming on ſuch
grounds, and preſcribing merit to Heaven by their <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> even
<hi>ſeal them up to the day of damnation;</hi> and therefore it is ordinary with
<hi>Satan</hi> to give men the teather a great way, left they ſhould grumble
at his tyranny, and prove <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from him upon hard uſage. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
is pleaſant, and books are very good Company; and therefore if
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Devil ſhould bind men to ignorance, our Speculators and Brain-Epicures
would never be his Diſciples; they would go away ſadly,
as the young man from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was well affected with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but could not part with his riches,<note place="margin">Mat. xix. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> xix. 22. So then you ſhall
have his leave, to know, and believe in <hi>God,</hi> as much as you pleaſe,
ſo you will not obey him; and be as great Scholars as <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf,
ſo you will be as prophane. The heart of Man is the Devils Palace,
where he keeps his ſtate; and as long as he can ſtrengthen himſelf
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there by a guard and band of luſts, he can be content to afford the
out-works to God, divine ſpeculation, and never be diſturbed or
affrighted by any enemy at ſuch a diſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus have you the grounds alſo whereupon <hi>true Faith</hi> (which is
beſt defined a <hi>ſpiritual prudence,</hi> an application of <hi>ſpiritual knowledg</hi>
to holy practice) ſhould be ſo often wanting in men which are very
knowing, and the faireſt Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now leſt this diſcourſe alſo ſhould reach no further than your
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ears, leſt that which hath been ſaid, ſhould be only aſſented to in the
general as true, not applied home to your particular practiſes, and ſo
do you no more good, than theſe general profeſſions did here to the
<hi>Jews,</hi> only to prove you perjur'd Hypocrites, <hi>ſwearing falſly, whilſt
you ſay the Lord liveth;</hi> we will endeavour to leave ſome impreſſion
upon your hearts, by cloſing all with <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that ſhall be in brief, meekly to deſire you; and if that will
not ſerve the turn, by all the mercies of Heaven, and horrours of Hell,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to adjure you to examine your ſelves on theſe two interrogatories,
which my Text will ſuggeſt to you, Firſt, <hi>Whether you are as good as

            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> here ſaid the <hi>Lord liveth,</hi> were very

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47754:58"/>
for us to be no worſe than <hi>Jews.</hi> Let there go a ſevere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
inquiſition out from the <hi>Royal Majeſty,</hi> over the whole Court, or at
leaſt from every particular man upon himſelf; and bring in an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
verdict, whether there be not ſome amongſt you, that are not
come thus far as to ſay, <hi>The Lord liveth.</hi> Some are ſo engaged in a
trade of miſhapen, horrid, monſtrous Vices; have ſo framed and
faſhioned the whole fabrick of their lives, without any bluſh, or line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
of <hi>God</hi> in them, that they are afraid ever to mention him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
for fear of putting them out of their courſe; they dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
too much of <hi>God,</hi> leſt it ſhould be their undoing; a little ſenſe
of him, would take off many of their tricks of ſinning, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſpoil their thriving in the world; like <hi>Diana</hi>'s <hi>Silver ſmith,</hi>
Act. xix. 24.<note place="margin">Act. xix. 24.</note> 
               <hi>for by this craft they have their wealth.</hi> The leaſt glimpſe
of <hi>God</hi> in theſe mens hearts; nay, one ſolemn mention of him in their
mouths, were enough to bring them into ſome compaſs, to upbraid
their ways, &amp; reprove their thoughts. Were theſe men taken to task
according to the <hi>Canon Laws</hi> of our Kingdom, and not ſuffered to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
live any longer amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> till they underſtood clearly the
promiſe of their <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> till they durſt come, and make the ſame
Vow in their own perſons, before all the Congregation, which in
their infancy their Sureties made for them; were our Canon of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi>
duly put in execution, and every one, as ſoon as he were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
either perſwaded, or forced to fit himſelf for the receiving of it,
(as it is ſeverely required by our <hi>Rubrick,</hi> though much neglected in
the practice;) I doubt not, but there would be fewer ſins amongſt us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
much more knowledg of <hi>God,</hi> and mentioning of his Name, without
the help of <hi>Oaths,</hi> &amp; <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> to which <hi>God</hi> now is in a kind behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ever he comes into our mouths. But now men having a
great way to go in ſin, and nothing in the world to ſtop them, begin
their journey as ſoon as they are able to go, and make ſuch haſte (like
the Sun, or Gyant in the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) to run their courſe, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the task the Devil hath ſet them; that they can never ſtay
to ſee or hear of <hi>God</hi> in their lives, which yet is legible and palpable in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
every ſyllable of the World. If they are ſo well brought up, as to have
learned their <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> they have no other uſe for it, but to
break jeſts, and ſwear by; and would ſoon forget <hi>God</hi>'s very <hi>Name</hi> or
<hi>Attributes,</hi> did they not daily repeat them over, (as School-boyes
their parts) and often comment on them by Oaths &amp; Prophanations:

            <p>Thus have I heard of ſome that have ſought earneſtly for an

phancy it notably; and becauſe they cannot expect to have it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, they will be ſure of it in this.</p>
            <p>Hence do they advance to ſuch a pitch of ſenſuality, as Heatheniſm
was never guilty of; their whole life is a perpetual ſtudy of the arts
of <hi>death,</hi> and their whole Souls an Holocauſt, or burnt Sacrifice to

never ſo ordinary; that holy Volume was never ſo violently and
courſly handled, even raviſhed and defloured by unhallowed lips. 'Tis

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> piece of ſcurrilous Wit in, and the beſt of us can ſcarce chuſe but give
it ſome applauſe. Beloved, there is not a ſin in the World that ſticks
cloſer to him that once entertained it; the leaſt indulgence in it, is a
deſperate ſign. 'Tis called the <hi>chair of ſcorners,</hi> Pſal. 1. a ſin of eaſe
and pleaſure: a man that uſes it, that is once a <hi>merry Atheiſt,</hi> ſeldom,
if ever, proves a ſad. <hi>ſober Chriſtian. Julian,</hi> and many others, have

be worthy our enquiry and examination; (and <hi>God</hi> grant your own
impartial Conſciences may return you not guilty:) However this
will but prove you no worſe than <hi>Jews,</hi> for they here acknowledg

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> every action of your lives will bring in an Evidence againſt you.
'Twere an accuſation perhaps that you ſeldom hear of, to be challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

with <hi>God,</hi> to be thus profuſe and prodigal in our profeſſions,
which we never mean to perform? Then is it to be called belief, when
it is ſunk down into our hearts, when it hath taken root in a well-tempered
ſoil, and begins to ſpring above ground, and haſten into an
ear. That which grows like Moſs on the tiles of an houſe, which is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47754:59"/>
ſet no deeper than the phancy, will never prove either permanent, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſolid nouriſhment to the ſoul. 'Twere a new hours work, to ſhew

earth,</hi> either in our lives or almoſt in our books; there might be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a ſeaſonable complaint in this place, were I not already other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
imbarked. By ſome prepoſſeſſions and prejudices infus'd into
us, as ſoon as we can conn a <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of that making, it comes to paſs
that many men live and die reſolved that faith is nothing but the
aſſurance of the merits of Chriſt applied to every man particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and conſequently of his ſalvation: that I muſt firſt be ſure
of Heaven, or elſe I am not capable of it; confident of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
or elſe neceſſarily damned. <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> being ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
in natural magick, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in mineral extractions, <hi>Plato</hi>
full of his Idea's, will let nothing be done without the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
brought up with numbers perpetually in their ears, and the

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> one will define the ſoul an <hi>harmony,</hi>

And ſo are many amongſt us, that take up fancies upon truſt for
truths, never laying any contrary propoſals to heart, come at laſt
to account this <hi>aſſurance</hi> as a <hi>principle</hi> without which they can do
nothing; the very <hi>ſoul</hi> that muſt animate all their obedience,
which is otherwiſe but a carcaſs or heathen vertue; in a word,
the only thing by which we are juſtified or ſaved. The confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this popular error I leave to ſome grave learned tongue,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that may enforce it on you with ſome authority; for I conceive
not any greater hindrance of Chriſtian obedience, and godly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
among us, than this: for as long as we are content with this
aſſurance as ſufficient ſtock to ſet up for Heaven, there is like to
be but little faith upon the earth. <hi>Faith</hi> if it be truly ſo is like
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, when he was <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God upon the earth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
an incarnate faith, cut out and ſquared into limbs and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments;
not only a ſpiritual inviſible faith, but even fleſh and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> blood, to be ſeen and felt, organiz'd for action, 'tis to ſpeak, and
breath, and walk and run the ways of Gods Commandments.
An aſſent not only to the promiſes of the Goſpel, but uniformly
to the whole word of God, commands and threats as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
And this not in the brain or ſurface of the ſoul, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt</hi>
ſeats it, but in the heart, as regent of the hand and tongue
in the concurrence of all the affections. Where it is not only a
<hi>working</hi> faith, an obeying faith, but even a work, even <hi>obedience</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it ſelf;<note place="margin">Rom. i. 5.</note> not only a <hi>victorious</hi> faith,<note place="margin">1 Jo. v. 4.</note> but even <hi>victory it ſelf,</hi> 1 Jo. 5. 4.
<hi>This is our victory even our faith:</hi> to part with this as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which is our only buſineſs, is ſure an unreaſonable <hi>Theſis.</hi> Any
faith but this, is a faith in the clouds, or in the air, the upper regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſoul, the brain; or at moſt but a piece of the heart; a
magical faith, a piece of ſorcery and conjuring; that will teach
men to remove mountains, only by thinking they are able; but
will never be taken by Chriſt for this faith upon the earth: if it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> do walk here, it is but as a Ghoſt, 'tis even pity but it were laid.
Let me beſeech you meekly, but if this would not prevail, I
would conjure you all in this behalf; the ſilly <hi>weak Chriſtian</hi> to
fly from this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

paſtors, to find out the deceit; and the more <hi>knowing illuminate
Chriſtian,</hi> to examine ſincerely and impartially by feeling and
handling it throughly, whether there be any true ſubſtance in it or
no. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> looking upon himſelf ſuperficially thought he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> had gone on, on very good grounds; very unqueſtionable terms

the <hi>rational importance</hi> of them, as they are part of a rhetorical

though men think that there is a great deal, yet there is indeed
like to be but little Faith upon the earth. And the iſſue from

himſelf with notorious ſinners, he was thus proud and cenſorious.</p>
            <p>And of theſe in their order, as powerfully and effectually to

deceivable perſwaſions of our ſelves, <hi>God I thank,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The black ſin that hath dyed the Phariſees ſoul ſo deep, as to
become his <hi>characteriſtick</hi> inſeparable property, a kind of <hi>agnomen,</hi>
a perpetual acceſſion to his name, is <hi>hypocriſie.</hi> The proper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
natural importance of which word, ſignifies the perſonating or
acting of a part, putting on another habit than doth properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to him. But by the liberty we ordinarily allow to words,
to enlarge themſelves ſometimes beyond their own territories,
to thrive and gain ſomewhat from their Neighbours, it is come
vulgarly to ſignifie all that ambitious outſide, or formality the
colour and varniſh of religion, by which any man deceives either
others or himſelf; and accordingly there is a twofold <hi>hypocriſie,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the firſt <hi>deceiving others;</hi> the ſecond <hi>himſelf.</hi> That by which he
impoſeth upon others is the ſin we commonly declaim againſt,
under that name, moſt fiercely, ſometime <hi>by juſt reaſon,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been circumvented by ſuch glozes, ſometime in a natural zeal
to truth, preferring plain downright impiety, before the ſame
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47754:61"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> transfigured by a varniſh. <hi>Reatus impii pium nomen,</hi> his being
counted innocent is an acceſſion to his guilt. But then ſometimes
too, under this odious name we may wound ſincere and pure
devotion; as the Primitive Chriſtians were by the tyrants put in
wild beaſts skins that they may be torn in pieces; men may be
deterr'd from all the leaſt appearance of purity, for fear they
ſhould be counted hypocrites. However this <hi>firſt</hi> ſort of <hi>hypocriſie</hi>
may deſerve its ſeaſonable reprehenſion, this parable in my text
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doth not take it in; but inſiſts mainly upon the other, that colour
of piety by which a man deceives himſelf, and cheats and glozes
with his own ſoul. That <hi>firſt</hi> ſort, were it not for ſome hurtful
conſequences, might for ought I can gainſay, paſs for an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
quality in a ſinner. For what great injury doth that man
do to any other, or himſelf? what grand ſin againſt God or the
World, by deſiring to ſeem better than he is; by labouring to
conceal thoſe ſins in himſelf, which could not be known without
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> diſhonour to God, and ſcandal to his neighbour? 'Twas a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
anſwer being queſtioned whether it were lawful for a woman
to take money for proſtituting her ſelf, that indeed 'twas a ſin
to proſtitute her ſelf; but that being ſuppoſed as in ſome kingdoms
it is permitted, he thought 'twas no great fault to get her living
by it.</p>
            <p>Not to juſtifie his opinion, but apply it by accommodation:
In like manner arraign an hypocrite, and muſter up all the ſins
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he hath commmitted in ſecret, and all theſe I will acknowledge
worthy of condemnation, becauſe ſins: nay, if his end of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
them be to circumvent a welbelieving Neighbour, that
ſhall be ſet upon his ſcore alſo, but for the deſire itſelf of keeping
his ſin from, the eyes of men; ſo that he do not from the eyes of
God, and his miniſters upon occaſion: for a cautiouſneſs in
any one not to ſin ſcandalouſly, or on the houſe top, take this
by it ſelf, abſtracted from the ſin it belongs to, and I cannot ſee
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> why that ſhould be either a part, or aggravation of a ſin. There is
nothing that deſerves the tears, yea and holy indignation of a
godly ſoul, more than the ſight of an immodeſt boaſting ſinner,
that makes his crimes his reputation; and his abominations his
pride, and glory. 'Tis that which we lay to the <hi>Devils</hi> charge
in the times of heatheniſm; that he ſtrove to bring ſin in credit
by building temples, and requiring ſacrifices to luſt, under the
name of <hi>Venus, Priapus,</hi> and the like; that incontinence might
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſeem an act of religion; and all the prophaneſs in the world a
piece of adoration. And it begins now to be revived in the
world again, when baſhfulneſs is the quality of all others moſt
creditably parted with; and the only motive to the commiſſion
of ſome ſins is, to be in the faſhion, to be ſeen of men; when men
put on affected errors, affected vanities, affected oaths, juſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47754:62"/>
as they do gay cloaths, that they may be the better counted of:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
this indeed is a damnable hypocriſie, when men are fain to act
parts in ſin, that they are not naturally inclined to; and to force
their conſtitutions, and even to offer violence to their own
tender diſpoſitions, that ſo they may not be ſcoffed at for punies,
or preciſe perſons, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his daughter, which being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
of a ſin that beaſts would never have committed, anſwer'd
that that was the reaſon they omitted the enjoyment of ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a delight, becauſe they were beaſts; as if innocence were more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
beſtial than luſt, and ignorance of ſome ſins the only guilt. The
horrour and deteſtation that this ſin ſtrikes into me, makes me, I
confeſs, willing almoſt to become an advocate of the firſt kind of
hypocriſie, whereby men retain ſo much modeſty in their ſins
(I hope of weakneſs) as to be willing to enjoy the charitable mens
good opinion though undeſerved.</p>
            <p>But for the <hi>ſecond kind</hi> of hypocriſie, this couzening of a mans
own ſoul, this tyring and perſonating in the cloſet, this inventing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of arts and ſtratagems to ſend himſelf comfortably and believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Devil,</hi> this civil inteſtine treachery within, and againſt

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then if an <hi>Angel</hi> ſhould make a ſong of exultance to ſet himſelf out

            <p>The Phariſees <hi>ſecond miſconceit</hi> is a favourable overprizing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

where you may ſee thoſe colours reflected by the cloud, which no
Philoſopher will aſſert to be exiſtent there. And all this brings
more evidence to the Phariſees indictment, and demonſtrates
his opinion of his own actions or merits, to be commonly deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

make you keep down this boyling and tumultuouſneſs of the ſoul,
leſt it make you either a prey, or elſe companions for Devils;
and that's but a hard choice, nay a man had far better be their food
than their aſſociates, for then there might be ſome end hoped for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by being devoured; but that they have a villanous quality in their
feeding, they bite perpetually but never ſwallow, all jaws and
teeth, but neither throats nor ſtomachs; which is noted perhaps
by that phraſe in the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Death gnaweth upon the wicked;</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
a gnawing, but never devours or puts over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride</hi> in our <hi>education</hi> is a kind of tenderneſs and chilneſs in the
ſoul, that ſome people by perpetual ſoftneſs are brought up to,
that makes them uncapable and impatient of any corporal or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hardneſs; a ſqueaſineſs and riſing up of the heart againſt
any mean vulgar or mechanical condition of men; abhorring the
foul cloaths and rags of a beggar, as of ſome venemous beaſt:
and conſequently as ſupercilious and contemptuous of any piece
of Gods ſervice, which may not ſtand with their eaſe and ſtate,
as a ſtarcht gallant is of any thing that may diſorder his dreſs.
Thus are many brought up in this City to a loathing and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many Chriſtian duties, of alms-deeds, and inſtructing their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> families in points of religion; of viſiting and comforting the ſick,
nay even of the ſervice of God, if they may not keep their ſtate
there; but eſpecially of the publick prayers of the Church, nothing
ſo vulgar and contemptible in their eyes as that. But I ſpare you,
and the Lord in mercy do ſo alſo.</p>
            <p>The third kind of <hi>pride</hi> is a ſupercilious <hi>affected</hi> haughtineſs,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47754:68"/>
that men perhaps meekly enough diſpoſed by nature, are fain to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
take upon them for ſome ends, a 'ſolemn cenſorious majeſtick
garb, that may entitle them to be patriots of ſuch or ſuch a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to gain a good opinion with ſome, whoſe good opinion may
be their gain. Thus was <hi>Mahomet</hi> fain to take upon him to be a
<hi>Prophet,</hi> and pretend that 'twas diſcourſing with the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi>
made him in that caſe, that his new wife might not know that
he was <hi>Epileptical,</hi> and ſo repent of her match with a beggar, and
a diſeaſed perſon. And upon theſe terms <hi>Turciſm</hi> firſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the world, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> was cried up <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the

tells us, that we have out of <hi>Euthymius.</hi> Thus are imperfections
and wants, ſometimes even diſeaſes both of body and mind aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and affected by ſome men to get authority to their perſons,
and an opinion of extraordinary religion; but rather perhaps
more oyl to their cruiſe, or cuſtom to their trading. But not
to flutter thus at large any longer, or purſue the common-place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in its latitude, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> pride here expreſſeth it ſelf in three
things; 1 his <hi>poſture,</hi> ſtanding apart; 2. his <hi>manner of</hi> praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
by way of thankſgiving: 3. his malicious <hi>contemptuous</hi> eye
upon the Publican. The firſt of theſe may be aggravated againſt
the <hi>ſchiſmatick</hi> that ſeparates from the Church or cuſtoms, but
eſpecially Service and Prayers of the Church. 'Tis pride certainly
that makes this man ſet himſelf thus apart, whereas the very firſt
ſight of that holy place ſtrikes the humble <hi>Publican</hi> upon the knees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of his heart a far off; as ſoon as he was crept within the gates of
the Temple, he is more devout in the porch than the Phariſee
before the Altar. The 2d. againſt thoſe that come to God in the
<hi>pomp</hi> of their ſouls, commending themſelves to God as we ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily

acceptance; not as objects of his pity, but as rich ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents;
not tears to be received into his bottle, but jewels for his
treaſure. Always upon terms of ſpiritual exultancy, what great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

not to entice, but to incenſe him the more againſt the ſin; not to

to gain nothing upon him by bringing him in love with their ſin,
he may yet inveigle him by bringing him in hatred with their
perſons; and plunge him deeper through uncharitableneſs,
than he could hope to do by luſt. He knows well the Phariſees
conſtitution is too auſtere to be caught with an ordinary bait, and
therefore puts off his title of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> prince of flies, as ſeeing that

therefore drives him as far back as he can; that ſo he may be the
more ſure of him at the rebound; as a skilful woods-man,
that by wind-laſſing preſently gets a ſhoot which without taking
a compaſs and thereby a commodious ſtand, he could never have

with a colour of zeal, and tenderneſs in Gods cauſe, and
then the very deviliſheſt part of the Devil his malice and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs,

They indeed went more probably to work, which uſed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

To this purpoſe did <hi>Socrates</hi> the firſt and wiſeſt Moraliſt furniſh

that <hi>corruption of its birth,</hi> that impurity born with it, which the
ſoul contracts by its converſation with the body, and from which
they ſay only Philoſophy can purge it. For it is <hi>Philoponus</hi> his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,

the ſoul contemn the commands,</hi> and arm it againſt the influences and

was to this purpoſe, to take off the ſoul from thoſe corporeal depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and ſo in a manner reſtore it to its primitive ſelf; that
is, to ſome of that divine perfection with which it was infuſed,
for then is the ſoul to be beheld in its native ſhape, when 'tis ſtript <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of all its paſſions. At other times you do not ſee the ſoul, but

fleſhly imployment, and retire and collect it ſelf unto its

Their profeſſion was incompatible with many vices, and would
not ſuffer them to be ſo rich in variety of ſins as the vulgar: and

an habit in a voluptuous ſettled courſe of ſinning, an indefatigable

you would wonder to ſee Chriſt a niggard in his own countrey,

a hundred to one he will do ſome miſchief at his departure,

him, that he ſhall be called and ſaved; of ſuch a one we are to
judge far more comfortably, and expect more confidently than
of another more habituate ſinner, negligent of the commands of
either God or nature. And this I conceive I have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

which I conceive to be of dangerous conſequence, and therefore
worth opening to you. In ſetting down the pitch that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate

of morality; but an abſolute defection from the rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;

and therefore whatſoever proceeds either as an effect, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
from pride or confidence cannot yet be imputed to mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
at all, or to the moral men <hi>per ſe,</hi> no more than the thundring

ſtrive againſt the motions of the ſpirit, and ſo to render converſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
more difficult, is an effect perhaps of pride or truſt, but yet is not
to be imputed to morality, though the moral man be proud or
ſelf-truſting, becauſe this pride or ſelf-truſting is not an effect,
but an accident of morality; and therefore their judgment ſhould
be able to diſtinguiſh and direct their zeal againſt the accidental
vice, not the eſſential innocent vertue, againſt pride not morality.
Beſides, this pride is alſo as incident to him who is morally evil;
nay, either ſuppoſes or makes its ſubject ſo, being formally a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>'Tis obſervable in the temper of men, that the <hi>cowardly</hi> are moſt

to foreſee any danger, and yet for the moſt part they have not
ſpirit enough to encounter, and they are ſo ſtupid and ſluggiſh
that they will not get out of its way when they have foreſeen it:
the ſame baſeneſs and timerouſneſs makes them a ſort of men moſt

Thus in iiii. <hi>Dan. 5. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> dreams and is affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and a proclamation is made for all the Wiſdom of the World
to come in and conſult and ſit upon it, and give their verdict for
the interpretation of the dream, and when he had at laſt got the
knowledge of it by <hi>Daniel,</hi> that his fears were not in vain, that the
greateſt judgement that ever was heard of was within a twelve
moneth to fall on him, then as though he had been a beaſt before
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47754:86"/>
his time, without all underſtanding he goes and crowns himſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

he was ſenſible of his danger, and now he ſees it before his

when his ruine was at hand, <hi>ver. 29. he walked in the Palace of the
Kingdom of Babylon, and the King ſpake and ſaid, Is not this great
Babylon that I have built,</hi> &amp;c. In brief he that was moſt earneſt
to underſtand the dream, is moſt negligent of the event of it, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
makes no other uſe of his knowledge of God's Will, but only
more knowingly and wilfully to contemn it. And this generally
is the ſtate of corrupt nature, to keep a diſtance and a bay betwixt
our <hi>knowlege</hi> and our <hi>wills,</hi> and when a truth hath fully conquer'd

and engaged in Peripatetical Philoſophy: that however they
might be perſwaded to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> they will not believe the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi>
'Twas too plain a contradiction to philoſophical reaſon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ever to enter theirs. Thus in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 21.<note place="margin">1 Cor. I. 21.</note> 
               <hi>the World by wiſdom

not concur with their old Principles. But this reſiſtance which
reaſon makes is not ſo ſtrong, but that it may eaſily be ſuppreſt,
and therefore <hi>Syneſius</hi> was made a Biſhop before he explicitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47754:87"/>
the reſurrection, becauſe they were confident that he which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
had forſaken all other errors, would not long continue perverſe
in this, and ſo good a Chriſtian in other things, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>could not chooſe but be illuminated</hi> in time, in ſo neceſſary a
point of faith: and indeed ſo it happened in them both. But
there are other more dangerous <hi>engins,</hi> more inſidious courſes
which learning uſes to ſupplant or undermine belief: other <hi>ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems</hi>
to keep us out of the way, to anticipate all our deſires or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
or thoughts that way-ward: and theſe are <hi>ſpiritual pride</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and <hi>ſelf-content.</hi> Men are ſo elevated in height of contemplation,
ſo well pleaſed, ſo fully ſatisfied in the pleaſures and delights of it,
that the firſt ſort ſcorn to ſubmit or humble themſelves to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and diſparagement of believing in Chriſt; the ſecond are
never at leaſure to think of it. For the firſt, <hi>ſpiritual pride,</hi> 'tis
ſet down as a reaſon that <hi>the natural man receives not the things of
the ſpirit, 1 Cor.</hi> ii. 14. receives them not, <hi>i. e.</hi> will not take them,
will not accept of them, though they are freely given him; <hi>for they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
are fooliſhneſs unto him, i. e.</hi> ſo his proud brain reputes them. The
pride of Worldly wiſdom extremely ſcorns the fooliſhneſs of
Chriſt, and conſequently is infinitely oppoſite to faith which is
wrought by ſpecial humility.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for <hi>ſelf-content:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>
in <hi>Heſych: Wiſe men need no friends,</hi> they are able to ſubſiſt
by themſelves without any help: they will have an happineſs of
their own making, and ſcorn to be beholding to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
inheritance, they are already ſo fully poſſeſt of all manner of
contents. Let any man whiſper them of the joys of the new
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the <hi>Interceſſor</hi> that hath ſaved, of the way thither
and made it paſſable, of all the priviledges and promiſes of our
<hi>adoption,</hi> they will hear them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as old wives fables;</hi> they
have the <hi>fortunate Iſlands</hi> too, their exacteſt tranquillity and ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind in a perpetual contemplation, and all the <hi>golden Apples</hi>
in Paradiſe ſhall not tempt or allarm them out of it. 'Tis ſtrange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to ſee when ſuch a man is called, what a doe there is to get him
out of his dream to hale him out of his <hi>ſtudy</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> how
ſleepy, and drowſy, and lethargical he is in matters of Religion:
how ſoon a little devotion hath tired him out, that could have pored
over a book inceſſantly all his life long, and never thought thus to
have been interdicted the delights of humane learning, thus to
have been pluckt and torn from the embraces of his <hi>Athenian Idol.</hi>
His converſion is much unlike another mans: that which calls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
others into compaſs ſeems to let him looſe, thruſts him abroad
into the world, teaches him to look more like a man then ever
he meant, makes him a member of the Commonwealth that was
formerly but an <hi>Anchoret,</hi> and forces him to walk and <hi>run the way
of Gods Commandments,</hi> that had once decreed him himſelf to a chair
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47754:87"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for ever. In brief, there is as little hopes of one that indulges
himſelf, and gives himſelf up to the pride and contents of any kind
of learning, of him that terminates knowledge either in it ſelf, or
elſe in the oſtentation of it, as of any other that is captiv'd to any
one ſingle worldly or fleſhly kind of voluptuouſneſs. This of the
<hi>brain</hi> in ſpight of the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> is an intemperance, as well as that
of the throat and <hi>palate,</hi> and more dangerous, becauſe leſs ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and ſeldomer declaimed againſt; and from this <hi>Epicuriſm,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eſpecially of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>Not to heap up reaſons of this too manifeſt a truth, (would
God it were not ſo undeniable) take but this one more, of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency</hi>
of <hi>learning</hi> never ſo well uſed to make a man a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
Let all the knowledge in the world, prophane and ſacred, all the
force and reaſon that all ages ever bragg'd of, let it concur in one
brain, and ſwell the head as big as his was in the Poem that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
of <hi>Minerva:</hi> let all <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> joyn their power
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and efficacy, and they ſhall never by their ſimple activity produce
a ſaving <hi>faith</hi> in any one; all the <hi>miracles</hi> they can work are only
on the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the <hi>will</hi> diſtinctly taken is above their ſphear
or compaſs: or if their faculties are not diſtinguiſht, <hi>and to will
is preſent with me,</hi> Rom. vii. 18. as well as to underſtand, yet they
can produce only an <hi>abſolute</hi> ſimple general <hi>will,</hi> that is, an aſſent
and approbation of the abſolute goodneſs of the thing propoſed,
not a reſolute will to abandon all other worldly purpoſes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that which I will. <hi>Knowledge</hi> and right apprehenſion of
things may convince me firſt of the <hi>hiſtory,</hi> that all that is ſpoken
of, or by Chriſt is true, and then of the <hi>expedience</hi> to apply all his
merits to my ſoul, but when I ſee all this cannot be done without
paying a <hi>price,</hi> without undoing my ſelf, without pawning all
that I have, my learning, my wealth, my delights, my whole
worldly being, without <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> then the general aſſent, that
abſolute will is grown chill and dead; we are ſtill (whatever we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> believe) but infidels; all the Articles of the <hi>Creed</hi> thus aſſented to
are not enough to make us Chriſtians. So that the iſſue of all is,
all knowledge in the world cannot make us deny our ſelves, and
therefore all knowledge in the world is not able to produce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
only the ſpirit muſt breath this power into us of breathing
out our ſelves, he muſt preſs our breaſts, and ſtifle, and ſtrangle
us; we muſt give up the <hi>natural ghoſt,</hi> he muſt force out our
earthly breath out of our earthly bodies, or elſe we ſhall not be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> enlivened by his <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> Thus have you reaſons of the common
<hi>divorce betwixt knowledge and faith, i. e.</hi> the no manner of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
betwixt them in nature. Secondly, the open <hi>reſiſtence</hi> in
ſome points betwixt reaſon and Scripture. Thirdly, the more
<hi>ſecret reluctancies</hi> betwixt the pride and contents of learning and
the ſpirit. And laſtly, the <hi>inſufficiency of all natural knowledge,</hi> and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47754:88"/>
tranſcendency of ſpiritual, ſo that he cannot know them, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
they are ſpiritually diſcerned. I ſhould now in very charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
you, but that there is one word behind of moſt important
neceſſity to a Sermon, and that is of <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That laying to our hearts the important documents of the Text,
<hi>our righteouſneſs and faith may exceed that of the Phariſees,</hi> Mat. v. 20.
our preaching and walking may be like that of Chriſts, <hi>in power,
and as having authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> Mat. vii. 29. and we
not content with a floating knowledge in the brain, do preſs and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſink it down into our inferiour faculties, our ſenſes and affections,
till it ariſe in a full harveſt of fruitful, diligently working faith.

nothing in the World, but the receiving of Chriſt. Chriſt and his
ſufferings and full ſatisfaction was once on the Croſs render'd, and
is ever ſince by the Goſpel and its Miniſters offered to the world:
and nothing required of us but an <hi>hand</hi> and an <hi>heart</hi> to apprehend

the ſons of God,</hi> Joh. i. 12. So that Faith and infidelity are not
acts properly determined to the underſtanding, but indeed to the
whole ſoul, and moſt diſtinctly to the Will, whoſe part it is to
receive or repel, to entertain or reſiſt Chriſt and his promiſes,
the Author and finiſher of our ſalvation. Now this receiving
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47754:90"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Chriſt is the taking or accepting of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,

<hi>is revealed to Faith,</hi> is declared that we might believe; that
finding no life or righteouſneſs in our ſelves, we may go out of
our ſelves, and lay hold on that which is offered us by Chriſt:
and this you will find to be the cleareſt meaning of theſe words,
though ſomewhat obſcured in our Engliſh reading of them. Now
the <hi>accepting</hi> of this righteouſneſs is an act of ours following a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
or <hi>offer</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> and conſummating the match or bargain
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> between Chriſt and us. Chriſt is offered to us as an <hi>Husband</hi> in
the Goſpel, we enquire of him, obſerve our own needs, and his
Excellencies and riches to ſupply them, our ſins and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and if upon advice we will take him, the match is ſtruck, we
are our beloved's, and our beloved is ours; we are man and wife,
we have taken him for our husband, and with him are entituled
to all his riches: we have right to all his righteouſneſs, and enjoy
by his Patent all the <hi>priviledges,</hi> all the <hi>promiſes,</hi> all the <hi>mercies</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> But if the offer being thus made by God to give
us his Son freely, we ſtand upon terms, we are too rich, too
learned, too worldly minded, too much in love with the praiſe
of men, <hi>Joh.</hi> xii. 43.<note place="margin">Joh. XII. 43.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> fixt upon any worldly vanity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
never to forego all theſe, to diſclaim our worldly liberty,
our own righteouſneſs, and to accept of ſo poor an offer as a
Chriſt; then are we the Infidels here ſpoken of, <hi>We will not come
to him that we might have life, Joh.</hi> v. 40. When he is held out to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us, we will not lay hold on him, we have ſome conceit of our
ſelves, and therefore will not ſtep a foot abroad to fetch his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
home to us. And indeed if any worldly thing pleaſe
you; if you can ſet a value upon any thing elſe, if you can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a paramour, a rival, a Competitour in your hearts, if you
can <hi>receive the praiſe of men,how can you believe? Joh.</hi> v. 44.<note place="margin">Joh. V. 44.</note> So that
in brief, Infidelity conſiſts in the not receiving of Chriſt, with a
reciprocal giving up of our ſelves to him, in the not anſwering affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to Chriſts offer of himſelf, in the not taking home and
applying Chriſt to our ſouls. And this is done, either by <hi>denying</hi>
to <hi>take</hi> him at all, or by taking him under a <hi>falſe perſon,</hi> or by <hi>not
performing</hi> the <hi>conditions</hi> required or preſumed in the making of the
match. They that <hi>deny to take</hi> him at all, are the <hi>prophane,</hi> negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
preſumptuous Chriſtians, who either never hearken after
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47754:91"/>
him, or elſe are ſo familiar with the news, as to underprize him:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
have either never cheapned Heaven, or elſe will not come to Gods
price; like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> perhaps offer pretty fair, bring
two parts of their <hi>eſtate and lay them at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> but will give
no more; fall off at laſt for a trifle, and peremptorily deny Chriſt,
if they may not have him on their own Conditions. Some ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities,
ſome vanities, ſome chargeable or troubleſom ſins per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they can ſpare, and thoſe they will be inclinable to part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;

they ſtand not much upon it, they can return as contentedly
without it as they came. And this ariſes from a neglect and ſecurity,
a not heeding or weighing of Gods juſtice, and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of his mercies. They have never felt God as an angry
<hi>Judge,</hi> and therefore they now ſcorn him as a <hi>Saviour:</hi> they have
liv'd at ſuch eaſe of heart, that no legal terrour, no affrightments,
or ghaſtly repreſentations of ſin can work upon them: and if the

inſtruct them in the deſperateneſs of their eſtate, to humble theſe

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> inward terrors inſenſible, to skin not cure the wound, are Infidels
in the firſt or higheſt rank, which deny to take him at all, will
not ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded that they have any need of
him; and therefore let him be offered for ever, let him be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in their ears every minute of their lives, they ſee nothing
in him worth hearkning after; and the reaſon is, they are ſtill
at home, they have not gone a foot abroad out of themſelves, and
therefore cannot lay hold on Chriſt. He that never went to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>ſchool</hi> to the <hi>law,</hi> he that was never ſenſible of his own damned

               </gap>, <hi>will never receive,</hi>
never accept of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſome are come thus far to a ſenſe of their eſtate, and
are twing'd extremely, and therefore <hi>fly</hi> preſently to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
hearing of Chriſt, they faſten, are not patient of ſo much delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as to obſerve whether their hands be empty, they are in
diſtreſs, and Chriſt muſt needs ſave them ſuddenly: they lay
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hold as ſoon as ever they hear a promiſe, and are reſolved to be
ſaved. by Chriſt, becauſe they ſee otherwiſe they are damned.
And theſe take <hi>Chriſt</hi> indeed, but under a <hi>falſe perſon:</hi> either they
take the promiſes only, and let Chriſt alone, or take Chriſt the
<hi>Saviour,</hi> but not Chriſt the <hi>Lord.</hi> Are willing to be ſaved by
him, but never think of ſerving him: are praying for ever for
Heaven and glory, but never care how little they hear of grace:
the end they faſten on, the Covenant they hug and gripe with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their embraces, but never take the condition of repentance and
obedience: this is not for their turn, they abſtract the cheap and
profitable attributes of Chriſt, his Prieſtly office of ſatisfaction
and propitiation: but never conſider him as a King; and ſo in
a word lay hold of the <hi>eſtate</hi> before they have married the <hi>husband,</hi>
which they have yet no more right to, then a meer ſtranger: for
the communicating the riches of a husband being but a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of marriage, is therefore not yet made over till the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>(which is the taking of the husbands perſon) be conſummate.
And this I ſay is a ſecond degree of infidelity ſomewhat more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and leſs diſcernable, when by an Errour of the perſon, by
taking Chriſt the Saviour for Chriſt the Lord, or his promiſes
abſtracted from his perſon, we believe we ſhall be ſaved by him,
but deny to be ruled; deſire to enjoy all the priviledges, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
all the obedience of a Subject.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, they which have accepted and received the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> true perſon of Chriſt as a Maſter, as well as a Jeſus, they which
have taken him on a reſolved vow of performing this condition of
homage and obedience, are not in event as good as their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
when they think the match is faſt, and paſt danger of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling,
when they ſeem to have gotten a firm title to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and are in a manner entred upon the goods and eſtate of their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47754:92"/>
husband, they do begin to <hi>break Covenant,</hi> and either wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
or elſe <hi>divide</hi> their <hi>love;</hi> they married him for his wealth,
and now they have that, they are ſoon weary of his perſon: they
came with the ſoul of an harlot, looking only what they ſhould
get by him, and now they have many other old acquaintances
they muſt needs keep league with; their ſelf-denial, their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
their vows of obedience were but arts and ſtratagems that
want and neceſſity put them upon, and now they have got their
ends, all thoſe are ſoon out-dated; they have faith and ſo are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and ſure of their eſtate, and ſo now they may ſin ſecurely,
<hi>there is no condemnation to them, they are in Chriſt,</hi> and all the ſins,
nay, all the devils in the world ſhall never ſeparate them. And
this is a <hi>ſanctified</hi> religious piece of <hi>infidelity</hi> in men, which think
they have made ſure of the main, and ſo never think of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries;
they have faith, and ſo T'is no matter for good works;
the leaſe is ſealed, the wedding ſolemniz'd, and then never dream
or care for Covenants. And theſe mens fate is like to be the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſpiritually, which we read of <hi>Samſon</hi>'s bodily ſtrength: he vowed
the vow of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> and as long as he kept unſhaven no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
could prevail againſt him; but as ſoon as he broke his vow,
when he had let his Miſtreſs cut his locks, his ſtrength departed
from him. All the <hi>promiſes</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of our being in Chriſt,
are upon <hi>condition</hi> of our obedience, and our vow being broken,
the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> within us will ſoon deprive us of our <hi>eyes</hi>
and <hi>life.</hi> Whatſoever livelihood we preſume we have in Chriſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
we are deceived, we are ſtill <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Thus do
you ſee the three degrees of infidelity frequent amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
1. a not taking him at all; 2. a miſtaking of his perſon; 3. a
breaking off the Covenants: now that you may abhor and fly
from, and get out of each of them by a lively faith, my next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſhall warn you, <hi>the greatneſs of this ſin,</hi> and that firſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
in its ſelf, <hi>it ſhall be very tolerable for that City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> may be conceived in a threefold relation, either to <hi>men</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the <hi>ſubjects</hi> of it, and thoſe ſinners, or 2. to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>objects</hi> of it, with all the effects, remiſſion of ſins, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
attending it: or 3. to <hi>God the Father,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of it, as the only condition annext to all his promiſes.
And conſequently infidelity, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſhall be aggravated
by theſe three depths or degrees, each adding to its exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Faith</hi> reſpects its <hi>ſubject,</hi> and that a ſinful miſerable one, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and fixt in an unremediable neceſſity of ſinning and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ever; ſo is it the only means upon earth, nay in the very
counſel of God, able to do us any help; all the arts and ſpiritual
engins even in Heaven beſides this are unprofitable. Nay, the
<hi>ſecond Covenant</hi> now being <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> and God for ever having eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47754:92"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the rule and method of it; I ſay, things thus ſtanding, God
himſelf cannot be preſum'd to have mercy upon any one, but who
is thus qualified; it being the only foundation on which our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is built, the only ground we have to hope for any thing, as is
manifeſt by that place,<note place="margin">Heb. XI. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 1. being rightly weighed, <hi>Now
faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> where the Greek phraſe,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifies the ground or <hi>foundation</hi> of every
of thoſe things which can be the object of a Chriſtians hope. So
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that where no ground-work, no building; if no faith, no hope,
no poſſibility of Heaven. If the <hi>Devil</hi> could have but ſtoln this
<hi>jewel</hi> out of the world, he had ſhut up <hi>Heaven gates</hi> eternally, and
had left it as empty of Saints, as it is full of glory, not capable of
any fleſh but what <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hypoſtatical <hi>union</hi> brought thither.
And this is no more then I conceive the learned mean by <hi>neceſſitas
medii,</hi> that faith is neceſſary as a means, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is no means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
of power, either abſolutely or <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> of it ſelf, or on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſuppoſition of Gods Covenant, to bring us to Heaven. Nothing is
of force beſides in reaſon to prepare, or morally accommodate;
and God hath not promiſed to accept in mercy of any thing elſe.
For whereas the <hi>promiſes</hi> are ſometimes made to <hi>repentance,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to <hi>obedience,</hi> as whoſoever repenteth ſhall be ſaved; and the
like you are to know, that it is on this ground of the neceſſary
<hi>union</hi> of theſe <hi>graces,</hi> that where one of them is truly and ſincerely,
there the reſt are always in ſome degree, there being no example
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of <hi>penitence</hi> or <hi>obedience</hi> in any ſubject which had not <hi>faith</hi> alſo. <hi>For
he that comes to God muſt believe that he is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. XI. 6.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 6. And he
that heartily believes he is, and is a rewarder of them that ſeek
him, will not fail to ſearch, <hi>purſue,</hi> and follow after him. So
that though the promiſes are made promiſcuouſly to any one
which hath either of theſe graces, yet 'tis upon ſuppoſal of the
reſt; if it be made of faith, 'tis in confidence that <hi>faith works by
love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. V. 6.</note> Gal. v. 6. and as St. <hi>James</hi> enforces it, <hi>is made perfect by works,</hi>

in reſpect of the ſubject; it being a Catholick deſtroyer,
an intervenient that deſpoils him of all means, all hope, all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of ſalvation: finding him in the ſtate of damnation, it ſets
him going, ſuffers him not to lay hold on any thing that may ſtay
him in his precipice; and in the midſt of his ſhipwrack, when
there be planks and refuges enough about him, hath numm'd his
hands, depriv'd him of any power of taking hold of them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> In the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his ſufferings, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of our Faith, ſo Faith is in a manner the Soul of them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them life and efficacy, making things which are excellent in
themſelves prove ſo in effect to others. Thus the whole ſplendor
and <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> the moſt accurate proportions and images
of nature are beholding to the <hi>Eye,</hi> though not for their abſolute
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47754:93"/>
excellency, yet for both the account and uſe that is made of them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
for if all men were blind, the proudeſt workmanſhip of nature
would not be worth the valuing. Thus is a learned piece caſt away
upon the ignorant, and the underſtanding of the auditor is the
beſt commendation of a ſpeech or Sermon. In like manner,
thoſe infinite unvaluable ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if they be not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, are but, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith of divine <hi>knowledge, a moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing, but of no manner of uſe,</hi> if they be not apprehended,
they are loſt. Chriſt'<hi>s</hi> blood if not caught up in our hearts by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Faith, but ſuffered to be poured out upon the earth, will prove
no better then that of <hi>Abel's,</hi>

Heaven for vengeance; only that which is gathered up, as

So that infidelity makes the death of Chriſt no more then
the death of an ordinary man, <hi>in which there is no remedy,</hi> Wiſd.

It doth even fruſtrate the ſufferings of Chriſt, and make him have
paid a ranſom to no purpoſe, and purchaſed an inheritance at an
infinite rate, and no man the better for it. Again, Chriſt is not

is Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi> the Confidence that God ſpeaks true, the relying

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therefore the Infidel is down-right with God; he will not take his
word, he'l never be perſwaded that theſe benefits of Chriſts
death that are offered to all men, can ever do him any good.
Let God call him to accept them, he'l never come, his ſurly,
reſolute carriage is in effect a contradicting of whatever God hath
affirmed, a direct thwarting, a giving the lye to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts:</hi>
and this is an aggravation not to be mentioned without
reverence or horror, the moſt odious affront in the World: the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Lord be merciful to us in this matter.</p>
            <p>Next, this ſin is a ſin of the moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> conſequences of any.
1. It produces all other ſins, and that <hi>poſitively,</hi> by doubting of
his juſtice, and ſo falling into <hi>adulteries, blaſphemies,</hi> and the like,
in ſecurity and hope of impunity, by diſtruſting of his providence
and mercy, and ſo flying to <hi>Covetouſneſs, murmuring, tempting,
ſubtlety,</hi> all arts and ſtratagems of getting for our temporal eſtate,
and ordinary deſpair in our ſpiritual: then <hi>privatively,</hi> depriving
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us of that which is the mother and ſoul of our obedience and good
Works, I mean <hi>faith,</hi> ſo that every thing for want of it is turned
into ſin, and thereby depopulating the whole man, making him
nothing in the World but ruins and noyſomneſs, a confluence of
all manner of ſins, without any concomitant degree of duty or
obedience.</p>
            <p>2. It <hi>fruſtrates</hi> all good <hi>Exhortations,</hi> and forbids all manner of
ſuperſtructions which the Miniſters are wont to labour for in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> moving us to charity and obedience, and joy, and hope, and prayer,
by not having laid any foundation whereon theſe muſt be built;
any of theſe ſet or planted in any Infidel heart will ſoon wither:
they muſt have a ſtock of faith whereon to be grafted, or elſe they
are never likely to thrive. As <hi>Galba</hi>'s Wit was a good one, but
'twas unluckily placed, ill-ſeated, there was no good to be wrought
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47754:95"/>
by it. The proudeſt of our works or merits, the perfecteſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
will ſtand but very weakly, unleſs it be ſounded on that
foundation whoſe <hi>corner ſtone is Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It <hi>leaves no place</hi> in the world for <hi>remedy:</hi> he that is an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
a Sabbath-breaker,</hi> or the like: he that is arraigned at the
law, and found guilty at that Tribunal, hath yet an <hi>Aavocate</hi> in the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> a higher power to whom he may appeal to mitigate his
ſentence: but he that hath <hi>ſinned againſt</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> hath no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go, he hath ſinn'd againſt that which ſhould have remitted all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
other ſins; and now he is come to an unremediable eſtate, to a
kind of hell, or the grave of ſin, from whence there is no recovery.
There's not a mercy to be fetch'd in the world but out of the
Goſpel, and he that hath refuſed them, is paſt any farther treaty:
<hi>He that believeth not is condemned already,</hi>

to him if there had never been a Saviour; and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in his old thraldom; he was taken captive in <hi>Adam,</hi> and
hath never ſince had any other means to reſtore him: the ranſom
that was offered all, he would none of, and ſo he ſticks unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
he is yet in his ſins, and ſo for ever like to continue.
And now he is come to this ſtate, 'twere ſuperfluous farther to

Chriſt, if thou art thus reſolved to have him. If thou wilt not
believe, thou haſt reprobated thy ſelf, and who is to be accuſed
that thou art not ſaved? But if thou wilt come in, there is ſure
entertainment for thee. He that begins in <hi>Gods Councels,</hi> and never
thinks fit to go about any Evangelical <hi>duty,</hi> till he can ſee his name
writ in the book of life, muſt not begin to believe, till he be in
Heaven; for there only is that to be read <hi>radio recto.</hi> The ſurer
courſe is to follow the Scripture; to hope comfortably every one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of our ſelves, to uſe the means, apprehend the mercies, and then
to be confident of the benefits of Chriſts ſuffering: and this is the
way to make our Election ſure, to read it in our ſelves <hi>radio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexo,</hi>
by knowing that we believe to reſolve that we are elected;
thereby we <hi>know that we are paſt from death to life, if we love the

I hope that Gods decrees (were they as abſolute as ſome would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

purchaſed by his Son, ſhould ever fail to any that believes. The

then muſt we fly, and pray to that <hi>ſpirit</hi> of power, to ſubdue, and

to that Throne of Grace, and with the hands of Faith though
feeble ones, with the eye of Faith, though dimly, with a hearty
ſincere reſigning up of our ſelves, we may ſee and apprehend,

only with ſuch opinions of God, as ſhould encreaſe both their

therefore ſeeing the vanities, and making uſe of the helps of all the

he cenſures <hi>Zenophanes</hi> for a Clown for looking up to Heaven,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and affirming that there was one God there the cauſe of all things,
and rather then he will credit him, he commends <hi>Parmenides</hi> for a

            <p>Concerning his knowledge of the <hi>ſoul,</hi>

&amp;c. <hi>But dehorts men of meaner vulgar parts,

defines the <hi>wiſe man to be one who beſides his own accurate knowledg
of hard things, as the Cauſes of the ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is alſo able to teach any body
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> elſe who hath ſuch an habit of knowledg, and ſuch a command over it,
that he can make any Auditor underſtand the abſtruſeſt myſtery in it.</hi>
So then out of his own words he is convinced to have had no skill,
no wiſdom in the buſineſs of the ſoul, becauſe he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
nor communicate this knowledg to any but choice Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
The truth is, theſe were but ſhifts of pride, and ambitious
pretences to cloak a palpable ignorance, under the habit of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious,
deep ſpeculation: when alas poor man! all that which he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> knew, or wrote of the ſoul was ſcarce worth learning, only
enough to confute his fellow ignorant Philoſophers, to puzzle
others, to puff up himſelf: but to profit, inſtruct, or edifie
none.</p>
            <p>In the third place, concerning <hi>happineſs,</hi> he plainly bewrays
himſelf to be a coward not daring to meddle with Divinity. For

and at laſt does not profeſs his ignorance, but takes a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

Where <hi>Andronicus Rhodius</hi> his Greek Paraphraſe tells us he meant
his Tract <gap reason="foreign">

Catalogue of the multitude of his writings we find no ſuch title,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and I much ſuſpect by his other carriages that the man was not ſo
valiant as to deal with any ſo unwieldy a ſubject, as the Providence
would have proved. Sure I am he might, if he had had a mind to
it, have quitted himſelf of his engagements, and ſeaſonably
enough have defined the fountain of happineſs there, in <hi>Ethicks,</hi>

not a care of deferring it to a fitter place, but a neceſſary
ſilence, where he was not able to ſpeak. For there mentioning
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> happineſs and miſerableneſs after death, (where he might have
ſhewed his skill if he had had any) he plainly betrays himſelf an
arrant naturaliſt in defining all the felicity, and miſery <hi>to be

which are to them being dead, happineſs or miſeries, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47754:101"/>
it is plain that the heathen never looked after God of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

of their ſtudy, which from the ſecond cauſes, neceſſarily lead
them in a chain to ſome view of the firſt mover, and then ſome
of them either frighted with the light, or deſpairing of their own
abilities, were terrified or diſcouraged from any farther ſearch,
ſome few others ſought after him but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith the <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi>

conducible to the ordering, or bettering of their lives: they had an

whenſoever any action drove them on any ſubject which

were the chief promoters of idolatry; making the Heathens
worſhip them as Gods, whom they were acquainted with, and
knew to be but men, as might be proved variouſly and at large.
If I could inſiſt upon any or each of theſe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chryſoſt. Hom. 1. p.</hi> 15.</note> it would be moſt evident,
what I hope now at laſt is proved enough, that the ignorance of
thoſe times was not ſimple, <hi>blind ignorance,</hi> but <hi>malign,</hi> perverſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſacrilegious, affected, ſtubborn, wilful, I had almoſt ſaid, knowing
ignorance in them, which being the thing we firſt promiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
we muſt next make up the Propoſition which is yet
imperfect, to wit, <hi>that ignorance in theſe Heathen, in Gods juſtice, might
have provoked him to have pretermitted the whole world of ſucceeding
Gentiles,</hi> which I muſt diſpatch only in a word, becauſe I would
fain deſcend to <hi>Application,</hi> which I intended to be the main, but the
improvident expence of my time hath now leſt only to be the cloſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of my diſcourſe. The <hi>ignorance</hi> of thoſe times being of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
both in reſpect of the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of their worſhip, which
was <hi>perverſe,</hi> as hath been proved, and the <hi>prophaneneſs</hi> of their
lives, being <hi>abominable</hi> even to nature (as might farther be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
is now no longer to be called ignorance, but prophaneneſs,
and a prophaneneſs ſo <hi>Epidemical</hi> over all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo inbred and
naturalized among them, that it was even become their property,
radicated in their <hi>mythical</hi> times, and by continual <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> down to them by their generations. So that if either a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man with the eye of reaſon, or a ſpiritual man by obſervation
of Gods other acts of juſtice, ſhould look upon the Gentiles in that
ſtate which they were in at Chriſts coming, all of them <hi>damnable</hi>
ſuperſtitious, or rather idolatrous in <hi>their worſhip:</hi> all of them
<hi>damnable</hi> prophane in their <hi>lives,</hi> and which was worſe, all of them
peremptorily <hi>reſolved,</hi> and by a law of homage to the <hi>cuſtoms</hi> of
their fathers neceſſarily <hi>engaged</hi> to continue in the road of <hi>damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he would certainly give the whole ſucceſſion of them over as
<hi>deſperate</hi> people, infinitely beyond hopes or probability of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this may appear by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 10.<note place="margin">Acts X.</note> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where
this very thing, that the Gentiles ſhould be called, was ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
a myſtery, that he was fain to be caſt into a trance, and to
receive a viſion to interpret it to his belief: and a firſt or a ſecond
command could not perſwade him <hi>to ariſe,</hi>

               <hi>verſe 45. And they of the Circumciſion which believed were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
becauſe that on the Gentiles alſo was poured out the gift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt.</hi> Nay, in the 3. to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> verſe 10. it is plain, that
the calling of the Gentiles was ſo ſtrange a thing, that the <hi>Angels</hi>
themſelves knew not of it till it was effected. <hi>For this was the myſtery
which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God,</hi> verſe 9.
<hi>which was now made known by the Church to principalities and powers,</hi>
v. 10. The brief plain meaning of which hard place is, that by S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
preaching to the Gentiles, by this new work done in the Church,
to wit, the calling of the Gentiles, the Angels came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
ſomewhat, which was before too obſcure for them, till it
was explained by the event, and in <hi>it the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi>
And this Propoſition I might prove to you by many <hi>Topicks:</hi> 1. by
<hi>ſymtoms,</hi> that their eſtate was deſperate, and their diſeaſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>very, very mortal;</hi> as that <hi>God</hi> when he would <hi>mend</hi>
a people he puniſheth them with <hi>afflictions,</hi> when he intends to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>ſtop</hi> a current of impetuous <hi>ſinners,</hi> he lays <hi>the ax to the root,</hi> in a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or total ſubverſion of them: but when his <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as they were here, when he ſtrikes neither with
the rod nor with the ſword, but makes one ſin the puniſhment of
another, as unnatural luſt of <hi>idolatry,</hi> and the like; when he leaves
a nation to it ſelf, and the very <hi>judgment</hi> laid upon them makes
them only leſs capable of <hi>mercy;</hi> then is it much to be feared that
God hath little mercy intended for that people, their deſertion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
being a forerunner of judgment without mercy. 2. I might prove
it <hi>ab exemplo,</hi> and that exactly with a <hi>nec datur diſſimile</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the nine <hi>Monarchies</hi> which the learned obſerve in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were each of them deſtroyed for idolatry, in which ſin the
<hi>Heathen</hi> now received to mercy, ſurpaſs all the precedent world,
and for all their many deſtructions, ſtill uniformly continued in
their provocation. Theſe and the like arguments I purpoſely
omit, as concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s viſion mentioned before out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
10. of the <hi>Acts</hi> ſufficiently to clear the point, and therefore judging
any farther enlargment of proofs ſuperfluous, I haſten with full
ſpeed to <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt from the <hi>conſideration</hi> of our eſtate, who being the <hi>off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> might in the juſtice of God have been left
to Heatheniſm, and in all probability till St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s viſion diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the contrary, were likely to have been pretermitted eternally;
to make this both the motive and buſineſs of our <hi>humiliation:</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
there is ſuch a Chriſtian duty required of us, for which we ought
to ſet apart ſome tithe, or other portion of time, in which we are
to call our ſelves to an account for all the <hi>general guilts,</hi> for all thoſe
more <hi>Catholick engagements</hi> that either our <hi>ſtock,</hi> our <hi>nation,</hi> the ſins

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47754:103"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> common corruption of our <hi>nature</hi> hath plunged us in. To paſs by
that ranker guilt of actual ſins (for which I truſt every man here
hath daily ſome ſolemn Aſſizes to arraign himſelf) my Text will
afford us yet ſome farther indictments; if 1700 years ago our
father were then an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and mother an <hi>Hittite,</hi> if we being
then in their loyns, were incloſed in the compaſs of their Idolatry;
and as all in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo beſides that we again in the Gentiliſm of
our Fathers were all deeply plunged in a <hi>double common damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> how are we to <hi>humble</hi> our ſelves infinitely above meaſure; to
ſtretch, and wrack, and torture every power of our ſouls to its
extent, thereby to inlarge and aggravate the meaſure of this guilt
againſt our ſelves, which hitherto perhaps we have not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of? There is not a better <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the world, no more
powerful medicine for the ſoftning of the ſoul, and keeping it in a
Chriſtian <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> then this lading it with all the <hi>burdens</hi> that its
common or private condition can make it capable of; this tiring
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of it out, and bringing it down into the <hi>duſt</hi> in the ſenſe of its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
engagements. For 'tis impoſſible for him, who hath fully
valued the weight of his general guilts, each of which hath lead
enough to ſink the moſt corky, vain, fluctuating, proud, ſtubborn
heart in the world; 'Tis impoſſible, I ſay, for him either wilfully

to approve and ſecond the force and method of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s

ſo here in this Chapter, having diſcourſt over their ignorance,
he makes that a motive of our repentance, and that back't with
a ſpecial <hi>Item</hi> from God, <hi>Who now commands every man every where
to repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have heretofore divided theſe words, and in them hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
already the <hi>ignorance</hi> of the ancient <hi>Heathen,</hi> which in the
<hi>juſtice of God</hi> might have provoked him to have pretermitted the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whole world of ſucceeding Gentiles. We now come to the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> part;
<hi>the mercy of God,</hi> not imputing their ignorance to our charge, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
every where to the end of the world ſhall repent. And in
this you muſt conſider, firſt <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> made with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
or the receiving them into the Church, deduced out of theſe
words, <hi>But now commands,</hi> for all to whom God makes known his
commands, are by that very cognizance known to be parts of his
Church; and with all theſe he enters covenant, he promiſeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> upon performance of the condition required by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
Repentance. Secondly the <hi>condition it ſelf,</hi> in the laſt

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable in our common affairs, that we do not uſe to lay
our <hi>commands</hi> on any, but thoſe who have ſome <hi>relation</hi> to us: a
<hi>King</hi> will not vouchſafe to imploy any in any peculiar ſervice,
but thoſe whom he hath entertained, and by oath admitted into
his <hi>Court.</hi> And 'tis the livery by which one is known to belong
to ſuch a family, if he be imployed in either common or ſpecial
ſervice by the maſter of it. To expreſs it more generally, they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
call'd natural members of a Kingdom, who are tyed to obedience,
to all <hi>laws</hi> or cuſtoms national, who are engaged in the common
burthens, as well as priviledges, the ſervices, as well as benefits
of a ſubject. The Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Canons</hi> are meant and exhibited
only to thoſe, who are either in truth, or profeſſion parts of the
Church: the <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> profeſs'd is not honoured ſo much as
to be bound to them. The orders and peculiar laws of a City or
Country are directed to thoſe who are either <hi>cives,</hi> or <hi>civitate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

               </gap>, to be members of this

do <hi>belong,</hi> whoſoever is thus entertained, and admitted
into ſervices, is partaker alſo of all <hi>advantages</hi> which belong to
a member of a family; and is by covenant to receive all emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in as ample a manner as any other of his quality. And this
briefly is the ſtate of the Gentiles here in the Text, who, in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
God commands them here to repent (which is the law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the New Teſtament) are judged upon theſe grounds
to be received into the covenant of the New Teſtament; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
made members of the Church. For as once it was an
argument that only <hi>Jury</hi> was Gods people, becauſe they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Commands, and the <hi>Heathen had not knowledge of his
Laws;</hi> ſo now was it as evident a proof that the heathen were
received into his Church (<hi>i. e.</hi>) into the number of thoſe whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
he had culled out for ſalvation, becauſe he made known his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to them, entertained them in his ſervice, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them every one every where to repent. <hi>Appian</hi> obſerves in
his Proeme to his Hiſtory, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were very coy in taking
ſome nations into their dominions; they could not be perſwaded
by every one to be their Lords: he ſaw himſelf many Embaſſadors

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>and the King would not
receive ſuch low unprofitable ſervants.</hi> 'Twas eſteemed a preferment,
which it ſeems every nation could not attain to, to be under the
Roman government, and commanded by the Roman laws: and
there were many <hi>reaſons,</hi> if we may judge by the outſide, why
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47754:106"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould not be likely to obtain this <hi>priviledge</hi> from
God, to be vouchſafed his commands. For 1. they had been
neazled up in ſo many centuries of <hi>ignorance,</hi> they had been ſo
ſtarved with thin hard fare, under the tyranny of a continued <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi>
which gave them no ſolid nouriſhment, nothing but
husks, and acorns to feed on, that they were now grown horrid,

guilt in the crucifying of Chriſt, and ſo by ſlaying of the Son, as
it is in the parable, provoked and deſerved the implacable revenge
of the Father. And yet for all this, God enters league, and
truce, and peace with them, thinks them worthy to hear and
obey his laws; nay above the eſtate of ſervants, takes them into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

<hi>ver.</hi> 10. 'tis expreſly read, <hi>For thy violence againſt thy brother Jacob,
ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt be cut out for ever.</hi> How I ſay,
from that place, amongſt others, this truth may be deduced, I
leave to the <hi>revealers</hi> of <hi>Revelations,</hi> and that undertaking ſort of
people, the peremptory expounders of depths, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> In the mean time we have places enough of plain predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
beyond the uncertainty of a gueſs, which diſtinctly foretold
this bleſſed Catholick Truth, and though <hi>Peter</hi> had not mark't
or remembred them ſo exactly, as to underſtand that by them,
the Gentiles were to be preach't to, and no longer to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
prophane and unclean, <hi>Acts</hi> x. yet 'tis more then probable,
that the <hi>devil,</hi> a great contemplator, and well ſeen in Prophecies,
obſerv'd ſo much; and therefore knowing Chriſts coming to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the ſeaſon for fulfilling it, about that time drooped, and ſenſibly
decayed: loſt much of his courage, and was not ſo active amongſt
the Genti'es as he had been; his oracles began to grow ſpeechleſs,
and to ſlink away before hand, leſt tarrying ſtill they ſhould have
been turned out with ſhame. Which one thing, the ceaſing of
Oracles, though it be by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and ſome other of the devils
champions, refer'd plauſibly to the change of the <hi>ſoyl,</hi> and failing
of Enthuſiaſtical <hi>vapours</hi> and exhalations; yet was it an evident
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> argument that at Chriſts coming, Satan ſaw the Gentiles were
no longer fit for his turn, they were to be received into a more
honourable ſervice under the living God, neceſſarily to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of the weight and ſlavery of his ſuperſtitions, and therefore
it concern'd him to prevent violence with a voluntary flight, leſt
otherwiſe he ſhould with all his train of oracles have been forced
out of their coaſts: for <hi>Lucifer</hi> was to vaniſh like <hi>lightning,</hi> when
the <hi>light to lighten the Gentiles</hi> did but begin to appear; and his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> laws were outdated, when <hi>God</hi> would once be pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Now that (in a word) we may more clearly ſee, what
calling, what entring into covenant with the Gentiles, is here
meant by Gods <hi>commanding</hi> them; we are to rank the commands
of God into two ſorts, 1. common <hi>Catholick</hi> commands, and
theſe extend as far as the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, 2. <hi>peculiar commands,</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:47754:108"/>
inward operations of the ſpirit, theſe are both priviledges and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
characters, and properties of the <hi>inviſible Church (i. e</hi>) the Elect,
and in both theſe reſpects doth he vouchſafe his commands to the

us therein. And this, I ſay, ſounds in the <hi>heart</hi> not in the
<hi>Ear,</hi> and they only hear and underſtand the voice, who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
as well of the effect, as of the news of the covenant. Thus
in theſe two reſpects doth he command, by his word in the Ears of
the Gentiles, by giving every man every where knowledge of his
laws:<note place="margin">

to expreſs ones will, to declare or proclaim. And thus ſecondly,
doth he command by his ſpirit in the ſpirits of the elect <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
by giving them the benefit of adoption, and in both theſe reſpects
he enters a covenant with the Gentiles (which was the thing to be
demonſtrated) with the whole name of them at large, with ſome
choice veſſels of them more nearly and peculiarly; and this was
the thing which by way of doctrine we collected out of theſe
words, <hi>but now commands.</hi>] Now that we may not let ſuch a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

may not float only in our brains, we muſt by way of <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
preſs it down to the heart, and fill our ſpirits with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be in more danger for that former conqueſt, and as 'twas ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in ſtory, by that time we have ſet up our <hi>Trophie</hi>'s, our ſelves be
<hi>overcome.</hi> I might preſcribe you many courſes, which it would
concern you to undertake, for the right managing of this victory,
which this our Commander, hath not by his fighting, but by his
very commanding purchaſed us. But becauſe my Text requires
haſt, and I go on but ſlowly, I muſt omit them, and only inſiſt
on that which is ſpecified in my Text, repentance, which drives
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the condition of the covenant, the matter of the command
which comes next to be diſcuſs'd.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Repent</hi>] may in this place be taken in a double ſenſe;
1. <hi>generally</hi> for a <hi>ſorrow</hi> for our ſins, and on that, a disburdening of
our ſelves of that load which did formerly preſs down the ſoul;
for a ſenſe of our former ill courſes, and a deſire to fit our ſelves
for Gods ſervice; for an humbling our ſelves before God, and
flying to him as our only ſuccour, and ſo it well may be called
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the condition of Gods covenant with us, that which God requires
at our hands under the Goſpel: for it was the firſt word at the
firſt preaching of the Goſpel, by <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>Repent, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is at hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. III. 2.</note> Matth. iii. 2. which, ſaith the Text, was in
effect, <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight,</hi> verſe 3.
So that briefly, this repent is a ſtraightning and rectifying all
crookedneſs, every diſtortion of the ſoul, and thereby a preparing
of it for the receiving of Chriſt and embracing his Goſpel. 2. In
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a <hi>nearer relation</hi> to the firſt words of the verſe, repentance is
taken more ſpecially by way of oppoſition, for a <hi>mending</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking</hi>
of that which of old was the fault, and guilt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
a reforming of every thing which was either formally or
virtually contain'd in their ignorance, and what that is you ſhall
briefly judg.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſerved by Interpreters, that <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>ſuffering,</hi> action
or paſſion are expreſt in Scripture by the word <hi>knowing;</hi> ſo to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <hi>know</hi> ſin is to <hi>commit ſin,</hi> to know a woman, and the like. So
<hi>Peter</hi> to the maid, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxvi. 70. <hi>I know not what thou ſaiſt (i. e.</hi>)
<hi>I am not guilty</hi> of the doing what thou imputeſt to me. According
to which Hebraiſm to <hi>know God</hi> and his laws, is <hi>to worſhip</hi> him,
and perform them: and conſequently to be ignorant of both,
is neither to worſhip God, nor practiſe any thing which his laws
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47754:110"/>
command: and ſo knowledge ſhall contain all piety and godly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
obedience, or love of Gods commandments, as God is ſaid to
know thoſe whom he loves; and ignorance, all prophaneneſs and
neglect, yea and hatred either of God or goodneſs. According
to which Expoſition are thoſe two ſayings, the one of <hi>Hermes</hi> in
his 10. Book called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>repentance is a great piece of knowledge</hi>
or wiſdom. So that briefly the recovering of the ſoul to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
pure knowledge of God and goodneſs, the worſhipping,
loving, and obeying of God, is the thing here meant by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which yet we may preſs into a nearer room, into one
ſingle duty, the directing all our actions to his glory: for this
is in effect to worſhip, to obey, to love God, to worſhip for <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
ſake, becauſe he commands it, to obey him for <hi>love</hi>'s ſake,
becauſe we deſire he ſhould be glorified in our obedience. And
this is the excellency and perfection of a Chriſtian, infinitely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
above the reach of the proudeſt moraliſts: this is the <hi>repentance</hi>
of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> whereby he makes up thoſe defects, which were moſt
eminently notorious in the <hi>Heathen:</hi> this is the impreſſion of that
<hi>humbling ſpirit,</hi> which proud heathen nature was never ſtamp't
with, for 'twas not ſo much their <hi>ignorance</hi> in which they offended
God, (though that was alſo full of guilt, as hath been proved)
as their <hi>miſuſing</hi> of their <hi>knowledge</hi> to ungainly ends, as either
<hi>ambition, ſuperſtition,</hi> or for ſatisfying their <hi>curioſity,</hi> as partly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hath, and for the preſent needs not farther to be demonſtrated,
Only for us whom the command doth ſo nearly concern, of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for, and reforming their abuſes; how ſhall we be caſt at
the bar, if we ſtill continue in the ſame guilt? The orderly

<hi>engagements to us and pawns to oblige us to a pious worſhip of God.</hi>
For what <hi>Philoponus</hi> obſerves of the doctrine of the ſoul, is in like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
manner true of all kind of learning, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>they extend and have an influence over all our converſation;</hi>
and if they be well ſtudied, and to purpoſe, leave their characters
and impreſſions in our lives, as well as our underſtandings: and
from thence aroſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> guilt, who did only enrich their
<hi>intellectual part</hi> with the knowledge and contemplation of them,
no whit better their <hi>lives,</hi> or glorifie God which made them. But
for us whoſe knowledge is much elevated above their pitch, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſtudy and ordinarily attain to the underſtanding of thoſe depths
which they never fathom'd, the reading of thoſe riddles which
they never heard of, the expounding of thoſe myſteries which
they never dream't of; for us, I ſay, who have ſeen a marvellous
light, thereby only to enlighten our brains and not our hearts, to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47754:110"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> divert that precious knowledge to ſome poor, low, unworthy ends;
to gather nothing out of all our ſtudies which may advance Gods
Kingdom in us, this is infinitely beyond the guilt of Heatheniſin;
this will call their ignorance up to judgment againſt our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and in fine make us curſe that light, which we have uſed
to guide us only to the Chambers of death. Briefly, there was
no one thing lay heavier upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then the not directing
that meaſure of knowledge they had, to Gods glory, and a vertuous
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> life: and nothing more nearly concerns us <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to amend
and repent of. For the moſt exquiſite knowledge of nature, and
more ſpecially the moſt accurate skill in Theological myſteries,
if it float only in the brain, and ſink not down into the heart, if
it end not in reformation of erroneous life, as well as doctrine,
and glorifying God in our knowledge of him, it is to be reputed
but a glorious, ſpecious curſe, not an enriching, but a burthening of
the ſoul, <hi>Aurum Tholoſanum,</hi> an unlucky merchandiſe, that can never

direct our ſtudies to the advancement either of Gods glory in

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it ſelf in the like extenſive latitude? Yes no doubt, for

            </epigraph>
            <p>-IN this moſt accurate <hi>Epiſtle</hi> that ever the Pen of
man could lay title to, in which all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and proceedings, and methods of God in
the work of our ſalvation are deſcribed, our
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> in his diſcourſe goes on the ſame way
that God is ſaid to do in his Decree; lays the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> foundation of it as low and deep as poſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with them as it were in <hi>Maſſa,</hi> and though they were already
Romans and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet before he openeth Heaven gates to
them, and either teaches or ſuffers them to be <hi>Saints,</hi> he ſtays them
a while in the contemplation of their impurity, and damn'd neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
eſtate of the ſtock they come from; looks upon them as <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
or troden down in their own blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. XVI. 6.</note> as the phraſe is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 6. He
plows and harrows, and digs as deep as poſſible, that the <hi>ſeed</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which he meant to ſow might be firm rooted, that their <hi>Heaven</hi>
might be founded in the <hi>Center</hi> of the earth; and their <hi>faith</hi> being
ſecur'd by the depth of its foundation, might encreaſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
both in height and fruitfulneſs. Thus in the latter part of
this firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> doth he ſhew them the eſtate and rebellions, and
puniſhment of their <hi>heathen Anceſtors,</hi> that the unregenerate man
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47754:114"/>
may in that glaſs ſee his picture at the length, the regenerate hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
himſelf in a thankful horrour, over-joyed, and wondring to
obſerve himſelf delivered from ſuch deſtruction. And that all may
be ſecured from the danger of the like miſcarriage, he ſets the
whole ſtory of them diſtinctly before their eyes, 1. How the law
and light of nature was ſufficient to have inſtructed them into the
ſight and acknowledgement of God, and therefore that they
could not pretend want of means to direct them to his worſhip.
2. That they contemn'd and rejected all the helps and guidances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
that God and nature had afforded them, and that therefore, 3. God
had deſerted, and given them up unto the pride, and luxury, and
madneſs of their own hearts, all vile affections: for this is the
force of the illation, They abuſed thoſe inſtructions which God
had printed in the creature to direct them, and therefore he will
beſtow no more pains on them to ſo little purpoſe, their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
convinced them there was but one God, and yet they could
not hold from adoring many, and therefore he'l not be troubled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to rein them in any longer; for all his ordinary reſtraints they
will needs run riot, <hi>And for this cauſe God gave them up to vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
So that in the Text you may obſerve the whole ſtate and <hi>hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of a heathen, natural, unregenerate life, which is a <hi>progreſs</hi> or
travel from one ſtage of ſinning to another, beginning in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the light of nature, and ending in the brink of Hell, all
vile affections. For the diſcovery of which we ſhall ſurvey,
1. The <hi>Law</hi> or light of <hi>nature,</hi> what it can do; 2. The <hi>ſin</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
this law or light, both noted in the firſt words (<hi>for this
cauſe</hi>) that is, becauſe they did reject that which would have ſtood
them in good ſtead; 3. The <hi>effect</hi> or puniſhment of this contempt,
ſottiſhneſs leading them ſtupidly into all vile affections; And
laſtly, the <hi>inflicter</hi> of this puniſhment, and manner of inflicting of it,
<hi>God gave them up:</hi> and firſt of the firſt, <hi>the law and light of nature
what it can do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe a man born at large, left to the infinite liberty of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
creature, without any terms or bounds, or laws to circumſcribe
him, were to bring a River into a plain, and bid it ſtand on end,
and yet allow it nothing to ſuſtain it; were to ſet a babe of a day
old into the world, and bid him ſhift for a ſubſiſtence; were to
beſtow a being on him, only that he may loſe it, and periſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can ever be ſaid to live. If an infant be not bound in, and
ſqueez'd, and ſwathed, he'l never thrive in growth or feature,
but as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> for want of girdles, run all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
out into breadth and uglineſs. And therefore it cannot agree either
with the mercy or goodneſs of either God or nature, to create
men without laws, or to beſtow a being upon any one without a
guardian to guide and manage it. Thus, leſt any creature for
want of this law any one moment ſhould immediately ſin againſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47754:114"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> its creation, and no ſooner move then be annihilated; the ſame

obſerve what you are about: but this unwritten law, which no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

not in words, but ſence, and therefore I cannot avoid the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
'tis impoſſible either to deny or doubt of it, it being
written as legible in the tables of our hearts, as the print of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in our foreheads. The commands of either <hi>Scripture</hi> or
<hi>Emperour</hi> may be either unknown or out of our heads, when any

of the mind is at home for ever, and either by intimation or loud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
voice, either whiſpers or proclaims its commands to us, be it
never ſo gag'd, 'twill mutter and will be ſure to be taken notice
of, when it ſpeaks ſoftlieſt. To <hi>define</hi> in brief what this <hi>law of

that at that grand forfeiture of all our inheritance, (goods truly
real and perſonal) all thoſe primitive endowments of ſoul and

a natural motion of the ſoul to the end of its creation, remains
in them, though it move not, like a Ship at hull and becalmed,
is very ſtill and quiet, and though it ſtir not evidently, yet it hath

            <p>Now that the moſt ignorant, clouded, unnurtured brain amongſt
you may reap ſome profit from this Diſcourſe, let him but one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

him the law and light of nature in himſelf, which before he never
dreamt of. Of thoſe of you that ever ſpared one minute from your

ſuddenly comes upon you, and makes ſhort work of all that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
care of your ſelves. You conceive that you are of your ſelves
utterly unable to underſtand, or think, or do any thing that is
good, and therefore you reſolve it a great pain to no purpoſe ever
to go about ſo impoſſible a project. God muſt work the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
in you, you are not able of your ſelves ſo much as either ſee,

as ſoon as ſhook off again, and being reſolved you never had any

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be a means to procure us as many? I told you that God had written
a law in the hearts of every one of you, which once was able, and
is not now quite deprived of its power to furniſh with knowledge
of good and evil: and although by original, and actual, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
ſin this inheritance be much impaired, this ſtock of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
drawn low; yet if you would but obſerve thoſe directions
which it would yet afford you, if you would but practice whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that divine light in your ſouls ſhould preſent and commend to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you, you might with ſome face petition God for richer abilities,
and with better confidence approach and beg, and expect the
grace that ſhould perfect you to all righteouſneſs. In the mean
time bethink your ſelves how unreaſonable a thing it is that God
ſhould be perpetually caſting away of alms on thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to be perpetually bankrupts: how it would be reckoned
prodigality of mercies, to purchaſe new lands for him that ſcorns
to make uſe of his inheritance. As ever you expect any boon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from God, look, I conjure you, what you have already received,
call in your eyes into your brains, and ſee whether your <hi>natural
reaſon</hi> there will not furniſh you with ſome kind of profitable,
though not ſufficient directions, to order your whole lives by;
bring your ſelves up to that ſtay'dneſs of temper, as never to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on any thing, till you have askt your own ſouls advice whether
it be to be done or no; and if you can but obſerve its dictates, and
keep your hands to obey your head; if you can be content to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> abſtain when the ſoul within you bids you hold, you ſhall have no
cauſe to complain that God hath ſent you impotent into the world;
but rather acknowledge it an unvaluable mercy of his, that hath
provided ſuch an eye within you to direct you, if you will but
have patience to ſee; ſuch a curb to reſtrain and prevent you, if
thou wilt only take notice of its checks. 'Tis a thing that would
infinitely pleaſe the Reader to obſerve, what a price the <hi>Heathens</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was much more dimmed and obſcured in them by their idolatry
and ſuperſtition, then I hope it can be in any Chriſtian ſoul, by
the unrulieſt paſſion. Could ever any one ſpeak more plainly

he that would behold the Sun muſt ſtay till the cloud be
over; he that would receive from the fire, either light or warmth,
muſt take the pains to remove the aſhes. There be ſome encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
which may hinder the moſt active qualities in the world
from working, and abate the edge of the keeneſt metal. In ſum,
there is a cloud, and gloom, and vail within thee, like that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
on the face of the deep, when the earth was <gap reason="foreign">

form and void,</hi> Gen. i. 2. or like that at <hi>Lots</hi> door among the
<hi>Sodomites,</hi> or that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> thick and palpable: and this have we
created to our ſelves, a sky full of tempeſtuous, untamed affections;
this cloud of vapors have we exhaled out of the lower part of our
ſoul, our ſenſitive faculty; and therewith have we ſo fill'd the
air within us with ſad, black <hi>meteors,</hi> that the Sun in its <hi>Zenith,</hi> the
height or pride of its ſplendor would ſcarce be able to pierce
through it. So that for to make a ſearch for this light within thee,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
before thou haſt removed this throng, and croud of paſſions which
encompaſs it, and ſtill to complain thou canſt not meet with it,
were to bring news that the Sun is gone out, when a tempeſt hath
only masked it, or to require a candle to give thee light through
a mud-wall. Thou muſt provide a courſe to clear the sky, and
then thou ſhalt not need to entreat the Sun to ſhine on thee, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if this cloud fall down in a ſhowr, if thou canſt melt ſo
thick a viſcous meteor as thoſe corrupt affections are, into a ſoft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
rain, or dew of penitent tears, thou mayeſt then be confident of
a fair bright Sun-ſhine. For I dare promiſe that never humble,
tender, weeping foul, had ever this light quite darkned within it,
but could at all times read and ſee the will of God and the law of
its creation, not drawn only, but almoſt engraven and woven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its heart. For theſe <hi>tears</hi> in our eyes will ſpiritually mend our
ſight; as whatever you ſee through <hi>water,</hi> though it be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſomewhat dimly, yet ſeems bigger and larger then if there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
were no water in the way, according to that Rule in the <hi>Opticks,</hi>
Whatever is ſeen through a thicker <hi>medium</hi> ſeems bigger then it is.
And then by way of <hi>Uſe,</hi> ſhall we ſuffer ſo incomparable a mercy
to be caſt away upon us? Shall we only ſee and admire, and not
make uſe of it? Shall we fence, as it were, and fortifie our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man with walls and bulwarks, that the inner man may not
ſhine forth upon it? Or ſhall we like ſilly improvident flies make
no other uſe of this candle, but only to ſinge, and burn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
our ſelves by its flame; receive only ſo much light from it
as will add to our hell and darkneſs? 'Tis a thing that the flintieſt

Thus that <gap reason="foreign">

any natural power of doing good, (God knowes) it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
departed, and therefore this thin meaſure of knowledge
or judgment, betwixt good and evil that was left them (which
my awe to Gods ſincere love of his creature makes me hope and
truſt he beſtowed on them for ſome other end then only to increaſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their condemnation, to ſtand them in ſome ſtead in their lives,
to reſtrain and keep them in from being extreamly ſinful.) This,
I ſay, they horribly rejected, and ſtopt their ears againſt that

which God had ſtill placed within them, to upbraid their

of Gods juſtice, what an incentive of his wrath, may appear by
that terrible promulgation of the Ten <hi>Commandments</hi> at Mount
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>Sinai.</hi> They deſpiſed the law in their hearts where God and

ſo that all the people that was in the Camp trembled.</hi> Thus upon their

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Privy</hi> Seal turned into a Proclamation, and that a dreadful one,

is now put into Tables, that they may have eyes to ſee,
that would not have hearts to underſtand, that the perverſe may
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be convinced, and that he that would not before ſee himſelf bound,
may find, and read himſelf accurſed. And after all this yet is
not the old law within them, either caſt away or cancel'd by the
promulgation of the other: for all the book is printed, the old
copy is kept in <hi>archivis,</hi> though, perhaps, as it alwayes was, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
ſoil'd, and moth-eaten, and he ſhall be cenſured either
for ambition or curioſity, that ſhall ever be ſeen to enquire, or
look after it. Still I ſay, throughout all their wayes, and arts,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and methods of rebellions, it twing'd, and prick't within, as Gods
<hi>judgments</hi> attended them without, and as often as <hi>ſword,</hi> or <hi>plague</hi>
wounded them, made them acknowledge the juſtice of God,
that thus rewarded their perverſneſs. Nay you ſhall ſee it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
break out againſt them, when perhaps the written law
ſpake too ſoftly for them to be underſtood. Thus did <hi>Davids</hi>

his own conſcience told him that he had done it either for diſtruſt,

and glorying in that arm of fleſh, or paid not the tribute appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God on that occaſion. To conclude this diſcourſe of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> every rebellion and idolatry of theirs was a double breach,
of a double law, the one in tables, the other in their heart; and
could they have been freed from the killing letter of the one, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
wounding ſenſe of the other would ſtill have kept them bound, as
may appear in that buſineſs of crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where no humane
law-giver or magiſtrate went about to deter them from ſhedding
his blood, or denying his miracles, yet many of their own hearts
apprehended, and violently buffetted, and ſcourged, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
them. At one time when they are moſt reſolved againſt

At another time at the top and complement of the buſineſs, <hi>Pilate</hi>
is deterr'd from condemning, and though the fear of the people
made him valiant, yet, as if he contemn'd this voice of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
againſt his will, with ſome reluctance, he waſhes his hands
when he would have been gladder to quench the fire in his heart,
which ſtill burnt and vext him. Laſtly, when <hi>Judas</hi> had betray'd

out of the world, haunted him, would not ſuffer him to live, whom

            <p>Laſtly, even we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not likely to clear our ſelves of

ſmall acceſſion to our torment, to remember and tremble at that
light which before we ſcorn'd. Thus, I ſay, do we in a manner
uncreate our ſelves, and by the contempt of this law of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even fruſtrate and bring to nothing our creation it ſelf, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
this is chiefly by ſins of ſloth, and ſtupid, ſluggiſh, unactive vices,
which, as I ſaid, make our whole life a continued paſſion, never
daring, or venturing, or attempting to act or do any thing in
Church or Commonwealth, either toward God or our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and of ſuch a condition'd man no body will be ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
as to gueſs he hath any ſoul, or light of reaſon in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is ſo far from making uſe of it, unleſs it be ſuch a ſoul as
<hi>Tully</hi> ſaith a Swine hath, which ſerves it only inſtead of ſalt, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
keep it from ſtinking. For 'tis <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> obſervation, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the elements,<note place="margin">

that 'twas <hi>air,</hi> ſome <hi>water,</hi> but never any man was ſo mad, as to
maintain the <hi>earth</hi> to be it, becauſe 'twas ſo heavy and unweildy.
So then this heavy, motionleſs, unactive Chriſtian, this clod of
earth, hath, as I ſaid, uncreatured himſelf, and by contemning
this active reaſon within him, even deprived himſelf of his ſoul.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Again, how ordinary a thing is it to unman our ſelves by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

theſe (I ſay) our whole life almoſt affords minutely ſins which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
would not argue us men, but ſome other creatures. There be few

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> once a perfect glorius rule, but is now diſtorted and defaced;
it once was <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> almoſt an <hi>Angel</hi> of light, it ſhone as

the neceſſity</hi> of ſome brighter light, then this of nature
can afford us, and with all the care and vigilancy of our hearts, all
the means that Scripture will lend us, and at laſt with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
and groans, and violence of our ſouls, to petition and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſollicit, and urge Gods illuminating ſpirit to break out and ſhine
on us. To undertake to interpret any antient Author, requires,
ſay the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> a man of deep and various knowledge,
becauſe there may be ſome paſſage or other in that book, which
will refer to every ſort of learning in the world, whence 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

Thus certainly will not any ordinary skill ſerve turn to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
and explain many dark ſayings, which were at firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in the book of our hearts, but are now almoſt paſt reading;
only that omniſcient <hi>Spirit,</hi> that hath no ſhadow of ignorance, the
finger that firſt writ, muſt be beſeeched to read and point out the
riddle. We muſt make uſe of that rotten <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of nature, as far
as its ſtrength will bear, and that very gingerly too, never daring
to lean, or lay our whole weight upon it, leſt it either wound
with its ſplinter, or elſe break under us: our help and ſtay, and
ſubſiſtence, and truſt muſt be in the <hi>Lord,</hi> our eyes muſt wait on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
his inlightning Spirit, and never loſe a ray that falls from it.
Fourthly, to clear up as much as we can, <hi>and reinliven</hi> this light
within us. And that firſt,</p>
            <p>By <hi>ſtirring up and blowing,</hi> and ſo nouriſhing every ſpark we find

               </gap>edulity, and the breath of prayers, may

God. In brief, whatever thou doſt, let not any the leaſt

quench not the weakeſt motion, or inclination even of reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

            <p>By <hi>removing all hindrances,</hi> or incumbrances that may any way
weaken or oppreſs it, and theſe you have learnt to be corrupt
affections. That <hi>democracy,</hi> and croud, and preſs, and common

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and purge the ſtomach, which hath been thus long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,

to diſſolve this dung of affections which an habit of ſin hath baked
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> within thee, the ſcales will fall off from thine eyes, and the blind
<hi>Tobit</hi> ſhall be reſtored to his ſight. In brief, do but fortifie thy
reaſonable ſoul againſt all the undermining, and faction, and
violence of theſe ſenſual paſſions, do but either depoſe, or put
to the ſword that Atheiſtical Tyrant, and Uſurper, as <hi>Iamblichus</hi>
calls the affections, do but ſet reaſon in the chair, and hear, and
obſerve his dictates, and thou haſt disburthened thy ſelf of a great
company of weights, and preſſures: thou wilt be able to look more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> like a man, to hold thy head more couragiouſly, and bend thy
thoughts more reſolutely toward Heaven: and I ſhall expect,
and hope, and pray, and almoſt be confident, that if thou doſt
perform ſincerely what thy own <hi>ſoul</hi> prompts thee to, <hi>Gods ſpirit</hi>
is nigh at hand to perfect, and crown, and ſeal thee <hi>up to the day of

            </p>
            <p>In the next place, thou maiſt ſee thine own guilts the clearer,

lookeſt narrowly, I am afraid thou wilt ſpy thine own <hi>picture</hi> in
that <hi>glaſs,</hi> and find thy ſelf in many things as arrant a <hi>Gentile,</hi> as
any of them. For any ſincere care of God, or Religion, how
few of us are there, that ever entertained ſo unpleaſant a gueſt in
their hearts: we go to Church, and ſo did they to their Temples:
we pray, and they ſacrificed; they waſhed and bathed themſelves

we mean towards God there, for any inward purity of the heart,
for any ſincere worſhip of our ſoul, we are as guiltleſs, as free

verſe of the Chapter, <hi>As many as deſire to make a fair ſhew in the

that will ſtand us in ſtead, and appear to be of any weight in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
balance of the ſanctuary. If you obſerve all the commands, and
ſubmit your ſelves to all the burden of both Law and Goſpel, and
bear it upon your ſhoulders never ſo valiantly, if you be content
to be circumciſed as Chriſt was, or becauſe he hath now abrogated
that, make uſe of Chriſtian liberty, and remain uncircumciſed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all inducements to the contrary: In brief, be you

and that you have omitted; <hi>For neither circumciſion availeth any

            <p>The particle <hi>but</hi> in the front of my Text is <hi>excluſive</hi> and <hi>reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi>
it excludes every thing in the world from pretending to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
any thing, from being believed to do us any good. For by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
the Church of the Jews, and by uncircumciſion the whole
profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion being underſtood, when he ſaith
neither of theſe availeth any thing, he forcibly implies that all other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
means, all profeſſions, all obſervances that men think or hope to
get Heaven by are to no purpoſe, and that by conſequence it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
reſtrains to the <hi>new creature;</hi> there it is to be had, and no

all the gray hairs and wrinkles fall off from him, as the ſcales
from blind <hi>Tobits</hi> eyes, and he comes forth a refin'd, glorious, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
new creature, you would wonder to ſee the change. So
that you find in general, that the Scripture preſumes it, that there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is a renovation, a caſting away of the old coat, a youth and ſpring
again in many men from the old age and weak bed-rid eſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Now that you may conceive wherein it conſiſts, how this
new man is brought forth in us, by whom it is conceived, and in
what womb 'tis carried, I will require no more of you, then to
obſerve and underſtand with me what is meant by the ordinary
phraſe in our Divines, a new principle, or inward principle of
life, and that you ſhall do briefly thus. A mans body is naturally
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a ſluggiſh, unactive, motionleſs, heavy thing, not able to ſtir or
move the leaſt animal motion, without a ſoul to enliven it; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that 'tis but a carcaſs, as you ſee at death, when the ſoul is
ſeparated from it, it returns to be but a ſtock or lump of fleſh,
the ſoul beſtows all life and motion on it, and enables it to perform
any work of nature. Again, the body and ſoul together conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in relation to ſomewhat above their power and activity, are
as impotent and motionleſs, as before the body without the ſoul.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Set a man to remove a mountain, and he will heave perhaps to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
your command, but in event will do no more towards the
diſplacing of it, then a ſtone in the ſtreet could do: but now let an
omnipotent power be annext to this man, let a ſupernatural ſpirit
be joyned to this ſoul, and then will it be able to overcome the
proudeſt, ſtouteſt difficulty in nature. You have heard in the
primitive Church of a grain of faith removing mountains, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, all miracles are not yet out-dated. The work of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the beſtowing of a ſpiritual life on one dead in treſpaſſes
and ſins, the making of a carcaſs walk, the natural old man to
ſpring again, and move ſpiritually, is as great a miracle as that.
Now the ſoul in that it produces life and motion, the exerciſe of
life in the body is called a principle, that is, a ſpring or fountain
of life, becauſe all comes from it; in like manner, that which

or baniſhment, it either fetters, or elſe expels all inſolent rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
luſts. Now the new principle, by which not the man, but the
new man the Chriſtian lives, is, in a word, the ſpirit of God,
which unites it ſelf to the regenerate heart, ſo that now he is ſaid
to be a godly man, a ſpiritual man from the God, from the ſpirit,
as before a living reaſonable man from the ſoul, from the reaſon
that inform'd and ruled in him; which is noted by that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in Scripture betwixt the regenerate and unregenerate, expreſt
by a natural or animal, and a ſpiritual man. Thoſe creatures
that have no ſoul in them are called naturals, having nothing but
nature within to move them, others which have a ſoul, animals,
or living creatures, by both which the unregenerate is ſignified
indifferently, becauſe the ſoul which he hath ſtands him in little
ſtead, his fleſh rules all, and then he is alſo called a carnal man,
for all his ſoul he is but a lump of fleſh, and therefore, whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
you ſay he hath a ſoul, and ſo call him an animal, or hath not a
ſoul, and ſo call him a meer natural, there is no great difference
in it. But now the regenerate man which hath more then a ſoul,
Gods ſpirit to enliven him, he is of another rank, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
man, nay, only he properly a Chriſtian, becauſe he lives
by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. II. 20.</note> 
               <hi>He lives, yet not he, but Chriſt liveth in him,</hi> Gal. ii. 20.
This being premiſed, that now you know what this new creature
is, he that lives and moves by a new principle, all that is behind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
will be clearlieſt preſented to you by reſolving theſe four queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
1. whence it comes; 2. where it lodges; 3. when it enters;
4. what works it performs there. To the firſt, <hi>whence it comes,</hi> the

then any thing elſe. Since Chriſts aſcenſion the Holy Ghoſt of
all the perſons in the Trinity is moſt frequently employed in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
work of deſcending from Heaven, and that by way of miſſion

this ſpirit being preſent every where in its <hi>eſſence,</hi> is ſaid to come
to us by <hi>communication of his gifts,</hi> and ſo to be peculiarly reſident
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47754:130"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in us, as God is in the Church, from which Analogy our bodies
are called the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt which is in us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. VI. 19.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi.
19. <hi>God ſends then his Spirit into our hearts;</hi> and this, I ſaid, by a
<hi>peculiar</hi> manner, not by way of <hi>emiſſion,</hi> as an arrow ſent out of a
bow, which loſes its union which it had with the bow, and is
now faſtned in the But or white; nor properly by way of <hi>infuſion,</hi>
as the ſoul is in the body, infus'd from God, yet ſo alſo, that it is
in a manner put into our hands, and is ſo in the man's poſſeſſion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that hath it, that it is neither in any mans elſe, nor yet by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
tye annext to God from whom it came: but by way of
<hi>irradiation,</hi> as a beam ſent from the Sun, that is in the air indeed,
and that ſubſtantially, yet ſo as it is not ſeparated from the Sun,
nay, conſiſts only in this, that it is united to the Sun; ſo that if
it were poſſible for it to be cut off from the Sun, it would deſiſt
to be, it would illuminate no longer. So that you muſt conceive
theſe beams of Gods Spirit at the ſame time in the Chriſtians heart
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and in the ſpirit, and ſo uniting that Spirit to the heart, as you
may conceive by this proportion. I have a javelin or ſpear in my
hand, if I would miſchief any thing, or drive it from me, I dart
it out of my hand at it, from which Gods judgments are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſhooting and lightning, <hi>He hath bent his bow, he hath ſent
forth his arrows,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. XVIII. 14.</note>

any thing that I meet with, if I would have it to me, I reach out
my ſpear and faſten in it, but ſtill hold the ſpear in my hand, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> having pierct it draw it to me. Thus doth God reach forth his
graces to us, and as I may ſo ſay, by keeping one end in his hand,
and faſtning the other in us, plucks and unites us to himſelf, from
which regeneration is ordinarily called an union with Chriſt, and
this union by a ſtrong able band, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To the ſecond queſtion, <hi>where it lodges,</hi> my anſwer is, in the
heart of man, in the <hi>whole ſoul;</hi> not in the underſtanding, not in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the will, (a diſtinction of faculties invented by Philoſophers, to puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
and perplex Divines, and put them to needleſs ſhifts) but, I ſay,
in the whole ſoul, ruling and guiding it in all its actions, enabling
it to underſtand and will ſpiritually; conceived, I ſay, and born
in the ſoul, but nurſed, and fed, and encreaſed into a perfect ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by the outward Organs and actions of the body, for by them
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47754:131"/>
it begins to expreſs and ſhew it ſelf in the world, by them the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
is exerted and made perfect, the ſeed ſhot up into an ear, the
Spring improved to Autumn, when the tongue diſcourſes, the
hands act, the feet run the way of Gods Commandments. So, I
ſay, the ſoul is the mother, and the operations of ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the nurſe of this Spirit in us, and then who can hold in his Spirit
without ſtifling, from breaking out into that joyful acclamation,
<hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bears this incarnate Spirit,</hi>

               <hi>and the paps that

though it be ſeated in the whole ſoul, as it is an habit, yet as it is
an operative habit producing, or rather enabling the man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſeveral gracious works, ſo it is peculiarly in every part, and
accordingly receives divers names according to ſeveral exerciſes
of its power in thoſe ſeveral parts. As the ſoul of man ſees in the
eye, hears in the ear, underſtands in the brain, chooſes and deſires
in the heart, and being but one ſoul, yet works in every room,
every ſhop of the body in a ſeveral trade, as it were, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
called a ſeeing, a hearing, a willing or underſtanding
ſoul: thus doth the habit of grace ſeated in the whole, expreſs
and evidence it ſelf peculiarly in every act of it, and is called by
as ſeveral names as the reaſonable ſoul hath diſtinct acts, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
In the <hi>underſtanding</hi> 'tis firſt, <hi>ſpiritual wiſdom,</hi> and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

an unapproving, as well as unapproved or reprobate mind, and
frequently in Scripture ſpiritual blindneſs. Then as a branch of this,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
it is <hi>belief</hi> or aſſent to the truth of the promiſes, and the like; in
the <hi>practical judgment</hi> 'tis ſpiritual <hi>prudence</hi> in ordering all our holy
knowledge to holy practice; in the <hi>will</hi> 'tis a regular <hi>choice</hi> of
whatſoever may prove available to ſalvation, a holy love of the
end, and embracing of the means with courage and zeal. Laſtly,
in the <hi>outward man</hi> 'tis an ordering of all our actions to a bleſſed
<hi>conformity</hi> with a ſanctified ſoul. In brief, 'tis one principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us doth every thing that is holy, believes, repents, hopes, loves,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
obeys, and what not? And conſequently, is effectually in every
part of body and ſoul, ſanctifying it to work ſpiritually, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtrument of a divine inviſible cauſe, that is, the Holy Ghoſt
that is in us and throughout us.</p>
            <p>For the third queſtion, <hi>when this new principle enters;</hi> firſt, you
are to know, that comes into the heart in a three-fold condition;
1. as an <hi>harbinger;</hi> 2. as a private ſecret <hi>gueſt;</hi> 3. as an <hi>inhabitant,</hi>
or houſe-keeper. As 'tis an <hi>harbinger,</hi> ſo it comes to fit and prepare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
us for it ſelf; trims up, and ſweeps, and ſweetens the ſoul, that it
may be readier to entertain him when he comes to reſide; and
that he doth (as the ancient <hi>gladiators</hi> had their <hi>arma praeluſoria</hi>)
by skirmiſhing with our corruptions before he comes to give them
a pitch-battel; he brandiſhes a flaming ſword about our ears,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47754:131"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and as by a flaſh of lightning, gives us a ſenſe of a diſmal hideous
ſtate; and ſo ſomewhat reſtrains us from exceſs and fury; firſt,
by a momentary remorſe, then by a more laſting, yet not purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flame, the <hi>Spirit of bondage.</hi> In ſum, every check of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
every ſigh for ſin, every fear of judgment, every deſire of
grace, every motion or inclination toward ſpiritual good, he it
never ſo ſhort-winded, is <hi>praeludium ſpiritus,</hi> a kind of <hi>John Baptiſt
to Chriſt,</hi> ſomething that God ſent before to prepare the wayes of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Lord. And thus the Spirit comes very often, in every <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
every <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> (which is part of Gods diſcipline to keep us in
ſome order,) in brief, at every <hi>Sermon</hi> that works upon us at the
hearing: then I ſay, the lightning flaſhes in our eyes, we have a
glimpſe of his Spirit, but cannot come to a full ſight of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus he
<hi>appears</hi> to many, whom he will never <hi>dwell</hi> with. Unhappy men that
they cannot lay hold on him when he comes ſo near them! and yet
ſomewhat more happy, then they that never came within ken of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him: ſtopt their ears when he ſpake to them even at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
Every man in the Chriſtian Church hath frequently
in his life a power to partake of Gods ordinary preparing graces:
and 'tis ſome degree of obedience, though no work of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to make good uſe of them: and if he without the <hi>Inhabitance</hi>
of the Spirit cannot make ſuch uſe as he ſhould, yet to make the
beſt he can: and thus I ſay the Spirit appears to the unregenerate,
almoſt every day of our lives. 2. When this Spirit comes a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>gueſt</hi> to lodge with us, then is he ſaid to enter; but till by actions
and frequent obliging works he makes himſelf known to his
neighbours, as long as he keeps his chamber, till he declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be there, ſo long he remains a private ſecret gueſt: and
that's called the <hi>introduction of the form,</hi> that makes a man to be
truly regenerate, when the ſeed is ſown in his heart, when the
habit is infuſed, and that is done ſometimes diſcernibly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not <hi>diſcernibly,</hi> but ſeldom, as when <hi>Saul</hi> was called in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> midſt of his madneſs,<note place="margin">Acts IX.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> ix. he was certainly able to tell a man
the very minute of his change, of his being made a new creature.
Thus they which have long lived in an enormous Antichriſtian
courſe, do many times find themſelves ſtrucken on a ſudden,
and are able to date their regeneration, and tell you punctually how
old they are in the Spirit. Yet becauſe there be many <hi>preparations</hi> to
this Spirit, which are not this Spirit; many <hi>preſumptions</hi> in our hearts
falſe-grounded, many <hi>tremblings</hi> and jealouſies in thoſe that have it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> great affinity between faith <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> ſeeing 'tis a Spirit
that thus enters, and not as it did light on the Diſciples in a bodily
ſhape, 'tis not an eaſie matter for any one to define the time of his
converſion. Some may gueſs ſomewhat nearer then others, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
a ſenſible change in themſelves; but in a word, the ſureſt
diſcerning of it, is in its <hi>working,</hi> not at its <hi>entring.</hi> I may know
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47754:132"/>
that now I have the Spirit better then at what time I came to it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>Undiſcernibly</hi> Gods ſupernatural agency interpoſes ſometimes in
the mothers womb, as in <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt ſpringing in <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at
<hi>Maryes ſalutation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke I. 41.</note> Luke i. 41. and perhaps in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Jer. i. 5.
<hi>Before thou cameſt out of the womb I Sanctified thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. l. 5.</note> and in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
Iſa. xlix. 5.<note place="margin">Iſa. XLIX 5.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord that formed me from the womb to be his ſervant.</hi>
But this divine addreſs attends moſt ordinarily till the time of
our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> when the Spirit accompanying the outward ſign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
it ſelf into their hearts, and there ſeats and plants it ſelf, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
grows up with the reaſonable ſoul, keeping even their moſt luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
years within bounds; and as they come to an uſe of their
reaſon, to a more and more multiplying this <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> into
holy ſpiritual <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> from which 'tis ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
ſaid, that <hi>Infants baptized have habitual Faith,</hi> as they may
be alſo ſaid to have <hi>habitual repentance,</hi> and the habits of all other
<hi>graces,</hi> becauſe they have the root and ſeed of thoſe beauteous
healthful flowers which will actually flouriſh then, when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
come to years. And this, I ſay, is ſo frequent to be performed
at <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that ordinarily 'tis not wrought without that means,
and in thoſe means we may expect it, as our Church doth in our
Liturgies, where ſhe preſumes at every Baptiſm that <hi>it hath pleaſed
God to regenerate the Infant by his holy Spirit.</hi> And this may prove
a ſolemn piece of comfort to ſome, who ſuſpect their ſtate more
then they need: and think 'tis impoſſible that they ſhould be in
a regenerate condition, becauſe they have not as yet found any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſuch notable change in themſelves, as they ſee and obſerve in
others. Theſe men may as well be jealous they are not men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot remember when their ſoul came to them: if
they can find the effects of ſpiritual life in themſelves, let them
call it what they will, a religious education, or a cuſtom of well
doing, or an unacquaintedneſs with ſin; let them comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their eſtate, and be thankful to God who viſited them
thus betimes; let it never trouble them that they were not once as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
bad as other men, but rather acknowledge Gods mercy, who hath
prevented ſuch a change, and by uniting them to him in the cradle,
hath educated, and nurſed them up in familiarity with the Spirit.
Laſtly, the Spirit ſometimes enters into our hearts upon <hi>occaſional
emergencies,</hi> the ſenſe of Gods <hi>judgments</hi> on our ſelves or others,
the reflexion on his <hi>mercies,</hi> the reading good <hi>Books,</hi> falling into
vertuous <hi>acquaintance,</hi> but moſt eminently at, and with the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Word: and this by degrees as it ſeems to us; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
at ſome one eſpecial ſeaſon or other, which yet perhaps
we are not able to diſcern, and here indeed are we ordinarily
to expect this gueſt if we have not yet found him: here doth it
love to be cheriſhed, and refreſhed, and warm'd within us, if
we have it,<note place="margin">Rom. I. 16.</note> 
               <hi>for even it is the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> Rom. i. 16.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47754:132"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The 3. condition in which this Spirit comes into our hearts, is as
an <hi>inhabitant,</hi> or houſe-keeper. The Spirit,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 105. ad Xyſtum.</note> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, firſt is in
us, then dwels in us: before it dwels, it helps us to believe: when it
dwels, it helps, and perfects, and improves our faith, and accompliſhes
it with all other concomitant graces.</hi> So I ſay here, the Spirit is then
ſaid to inhabit, and keep houſe in us, not as ſoon as it is entertained
and received: but when it breaks forth into acts, and declares
it ſelf before all men, <hi>When men ſee our good works, and glorifie our

               <note place="margin">Mat. V. 16.</note> Matth. v. 16. Before we were ſaid to <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> now

walk, that is to go about conſpicuouſly in the ſight of all men,
breaking forth into works, (as the Sun after the diſperſions of a
miſt or cloud) whereby all men ſee and acknowledge his faith
and obedience, and find their own evil wayes reprehended,
and made manifeſt by his good,<note place="margin">Eph. V. 13.</note> as is noted in the 13. <hi>verſe, All

ii. 14. <hi>He is made to reprove our thoughts.</hi> Thus is the third Quere
reſolved alſo, when this inward principle enters. 1. It comes
as an <hi>harbenger,</hi> in every outward reſtraint by which God keeps
us from ſinning. 2. It enters as a <hi>gueſt</hi> in ſome ſeaſon or other,
once for all. In the womb, at Baptiſm, at ſome Sermon, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at a notable tempeſt, ſhaking and ſtirring us violently, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
and for the moſt part not to be diſcerned by us: and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it comes and <hi>dwels</hi> with us, and ſhews it ſelf in its works, yet that
not at any ſet time after his entrance, not conſtantly without
ever covering his face, but when and as often as it pleaſes, and the
fleſh reſiſteth not. To the laſt Quere, <hi>What works it performs,</hi> the
anſwer ſhall be brief; every thing that may be called <hi>ſpiritual,</hi>
Faith, Repentance, Charity, Hope, Self-denial, and the reſt: but
theſe not promiſcuouſly, or in an heap altogether, but by a wiſe
diſpenſation, in time and by degrees. The ſoul being enabled
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by this inward principle, is equally diſpoſed to the producing of
all theſe, and as occaſions do occur, doth actually perform and
produce them; ſo that in my conceit that queſtion concerning the
priority of Repentance, or Faith, is not either of ſuch moment,
or difficulty, as is by ſome diſputers pretended. The ſeeds of
them both are at one time planted in the ſoul: and then there is
no Faith in any ſubject, but there is Repentance alſo; nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
without Faith. So that where it is ſaid, <hi>Without Faith 'tis
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> impoſſible to pleaſe God in any thing elſe,</hi> 'tis true; but argues no
neceſſary precedence of it before other graces, for the habits of
them all are of the ſame age in us, and then alſo will it be as true,
that without <hi>Repentance,</hi> or without <hi>Love, Faith it ſelf cannot pleaſe
God:</hi> for if it be truly acceptable Faith, there is both Repentance
and Love in the ſame womb to keep it company. Thus are we
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47754:133"/>
wont to ſay that <hi>only Faith juſtifieth,</hi> but not Faith <hi>alone:</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
reaſon theſe promiſes in Scripture are made ſometimes to one
grace preciſely, ſometimes to another, is becauſe they are all
at once rooted in the man, and in their habits chain'd together
inſeparably. <hi>Faith</hi> ſaves every man that hath it, and yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving'ſt
man under Heaven ſhall not be ſaved without <hi>Charity.
Charity hides a multitude of ſins,</hi> and yet the charitableſt man in
the world ſhall never have his ſcore croſs't without <hi>Repentance.</hi>
A catalogue of theſe fruits of the Spirit you may at your leiſure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
make up to your ſelves for your tryal,<note place="margin">Gal. V. 22.</note> out of the fifth to the <hi>Gal.</hi>
from the 22. <hi>verſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. I. V.</note> and 1 <hi>Peter</hi> i 5. All theſe graces together,
though ſome belonging to one, ſome to another faculty of the
ſoul, are yet all at once conceived in it, at once begin their life
in the heart, though one be perhaps ſooner ready to walk abroad,
and ſhew it ſelf in the world then another. As in the 2 of <hi>Kings</hi>
iv. 34.<note place="margin">2 Kings IV. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Eliſha went up on the bed and lay on the child and put his mouth
on his mouth, and eyes upon his eyes, and hands upon his hands, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſtretched himſelf upon the child, and the fleſh of the child waxed warm,</hi>
and <hi>verſe</hi> 35.<note place="margin">Verſe 35.</note> the <hi>child ſneezed ſeven times, and opened his eyes.</hi> Thus
I ſay, doth the Spirit apply it ſelf unto the ſoul, and meaſure it
ſelf out to every part of it; and then the ſpiritual life comes at
once into the ſoul (as motion beginning in the centre, diffuſes
it ſelf equally through the whole ſphere, and affecteth every part
of the circumference) and the fleſh <hi>of the child waxed warm;</hi> where
the fleſh indefinitely ſignifieth <hi>every part</hi> of it together, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the ſpiritual ſenſe the whole ſoul; and this is when the inward
principle, when the habit enters. Then for acts of life, one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſhews it ſelf before another, as the child firſt <hi>ſneezed ſeven
times,</hi> a violent disburthening it ſelf of ſome troubleſom humors
that tickle in the head; to which may be anſwerable our ſpiritual
<hi>clearing</hi> and purging our ſelves by <hi>Self-denial, the laying aſide every
weight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. XII. 1.</note> Heb. xii. 1. then <hi>opened his eyes,</hi> which in our ſpiritual
creature, is ſpiritual <hi>illumination,</hi> or the eye of <hi>Faith;</hi> theſe I ſay,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
may firſt ſhew themſelves as acts, and yet ſometimes others
before them, yet all alike in the habit, all of one ſtanding, one
conception, one plantation in the heart: though indeed ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(like <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) the <hi>rougher</hi> come out firſt. We begin our
ſpiritual life in Repentance and contrition, and with many harſh
twinges of the Spirit; and then comes Faith like <hi>Jacob</hi> at the heels,
<hi>ſmooth</hi> and ſoft, applying all the cordial promiſes to our penitent
ſouls. In brief, if any judgment be to be made, which of theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
graces is firſt in the regenerate man, and which rules in chief;
I conceive <hi>Self denial</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> to be there firſt, and moſt eminent,
according to that notable place,<note place="margin">Matth, XVI. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Matth,</hi> xvi. 24. where Chriſt
ſeems to ſet down the order of graces in true Diſciples. <hi>Let him
deny himſelf, and take up his croſs,</hi> that is, forgo all his carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47754:133"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and embrace all manner of puniſhments and miſeries,
prepare himſelf even to go and be crucified, and <hi>then follow me;</hi>
that is, by a lively faith believe in Chriſt, and prize him before
all the world beſides: and indeed in effect theſe two are but one,
though they appear to us in ſeveral ſhapes: for Faith is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Self-denial, it cannot work till our carnal affections be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it. Believe a man may, and have fleſh and fleſhly luſt in
him, but unleſs Faith have the pre-eminence, Faith is no Faith.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The man may be divided betwixt <hi>the law of his members, and
the law of his mind;</hi> ſo many degrees of fleſh, ſo many of ſpirit:
but if there be conſtantly but an even balance, or more of fleſh then
ſpirit, if 3 degrees of ſpirit, and 5 of fleſh, then can there not
be ſaid to be any true Self-denial, and conſequently any Faith,
no more then that can be ſaid to be hot, which hath more degrees
of cold, then heat in it. In brief, 'tis a good meaſure of Self-denial
that ſets his faith in his Throne, and when by it faith hath conquered,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> though not without continual reſiſtance, when it hath once got
the upper hand, then is the man ſaid to be regenerate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it is that the regenerate ſtate is called the <hi>life of Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. II. 20.</note> Faith
is become a principle of the greateſt power and activity in the ſoul.
And ſo much for theſe 4 Queries; from which I conceive every
thing that is material, and directly pertinent to inſtruct you, and
open the eſtate of a new creature, may be reſolved. And for
other niceties, how far we may prepare our ſelves, how co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and joyn iſſue with the ſpirit, whether it work irreſiſtibly
by way of phyſical influence, or moral perſwaſion, whether
being once had, it may totally or finally be loſt again, and the
like; theſe I ſay, if they are fit for any, I am reſolved are not
neceſſary for a Countrey Auditory to be inſtructed in. 'Twill be
more for your profit to have your <hi>hearts</hi> raiſed, then your <hi>brains</hi>
puft up; to have your ſpirits and <hi>ſouls</hi> inwardly affected to an
earneſt <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>longing after it,</hi> which will perhaps be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> performed, if we proceed to ſhew you the neceſſity of it,
and unavailableneſs of all things elſe, and that by way of <hi>Uſe</hi> and
<hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the neceſſity of <hi>renewedneſs of heart,</hi> to demonſtrate
that, I will only crave of you to grant me, that the performance
of any one duty towards God is neceſſary, and then it will
prove it ſelf; for it is certain no duty to God can be performed
without it. For 'tis not a fair outſide, a ſlight performance, a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bare work done that is accepted by God: if it were, <hi>Cain</hi> would
deſerve as much thanks for his ſacrifice as his brother <hi>Abel;</hi> for
in the outſide of them there was no difference, unleſs perhaps
on <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſide, that he was <hi>forwardeſt</hi> in the duty, and <hi>offered firſt,</hi>
Gen. iv. 3. But it is the inſide of the action,<note place="margin">Gen. IV. 3.</note> the marrow and
bowels of it that God judges by. If a ſum in groſs, or a bag
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47754:134"/>
ſealed up, would paſs for payment in Gods audit; every man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
would come and make his accounts duly enough with him: and
what he wanted in gold for his payment, ſhould be made up in
counters. But God goes more exactly to work, when he comes
to call thee to an account of thy ſtewardſhip: he is a <hi>God of thoughts,</hi>
and a <hi>ſearcher of the heart and reins,</hi> and 'twill then be a harder bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to be found juſt when he examines, or <hi>clear when he will judge.</hi>
The leaſt ſpot and blemiſh in the face of it, the leaſt maim or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in the offering, the leaſt negligence or coldneſs in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
performance, nay the leaſt corruption in the heart of him that
doth it, hath utterly ſpoiled the ſacrifice. Be the bulk and skin
of the work never ſo large and beautiful to the eye, if it come not
from a ſanctified, renewed, gracious heart, it will find no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but that in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath required it at your hands?</hi>
This is not it that God is taken with, or ſuch as he commanded,
it may paſs for a complement, or a work of courſe, but never be
valued as a duty or real ſervice. Reſolve thy ſelf to dwell no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
where but in the Church, and there (like <hi>Simeon</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in <hi>Euſeb.</hi>)
plant thy ſelf continually in a Pillar, with thy eyes, and words,
fixt, and ſhot up perpetually towards Heaven. If there be not
a ſpirit within thee to give light to the eyes; to add ſighs and
groans to the voice, all this that thou haſt done is nothing but
as a blind mans pretenſions to ſight, and a dumb mans claim to
ſpeech; and ſo in like manner in all our duties which the world
and carnal men ſet a price on. And the reaſon is, becauſe every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſeeming work done by a natural man, is not truly ſo:
'tis nothing leſs then that which it is ſaid to be; his <hi>prayers</hi> are not
prayers, lip-labour perhaps, but not devotion; his <hi>ſerving</hi> of
God is <hi>formality,</hi> not obedience; his <hi>hope</hi> of Heaven, not a hope
but a <hi>phancy.</hi> If God, or Satan, a judge, or a tempter, ſhould
come to reaſon with him about it, he would ſoon be worſted,
never be able to maintain his title to it. In brief, the faireſt part
of a natural man, that which is leaſt counterfeit, his <hi>deſire</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
good affections to ſpiritual things (which we call favourably
<hi>natural deſires</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual obedience,</hi>) theſe I ſay, are but falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
falſe affections. 1. They have no ſolidity or permanency
in the will, only fluid and tranſitory, ſome flight ſudden wiſhes,
tempeſts and ſtorms of a troubled mind, ſoon blown over: the
leaſt temptation will be ſure to do it. They are like thoſe waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prayers without any ſtay of faith,<note place="margin">Jam. I. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Jam. 1. 6. like a wave of the
ſea driven by the wind and toſt.</hi> 2. That <hi>being</hi> which they have is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
counterfeit, they are not that which they are taken for. We are
wont to ſay, that <hi>acts</hi> are diſtinguiſhed by their <hi>objects,</hi> he ſees
truly which judges the thing to be that that it is: 'tis true indeed that
another man ſees, he that takes blew for green, but he does not
ſee truly: ſo alſo he only willeth a good thing, that wills that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47754:134"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in it, which is truly good. Now the <hi>natural</hi> man, when he is ſaid
to chuſe ſpiritual things, as Heaven, Happineſs and the like, he
deſires not a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> but a <hi>carnal</hi> thing: in deſiring <hi>Heaven,</hi> he
deſires ſomewhat that would free him from miſery in <hi>happineſs,</hi> a
natural or moral good, that would be acceptable to any creature
under Heaven: and ſo a <hi>Turk</hi> will deſire <hi>paradiſe,</hi> and that very
impatiently, in hope that he ſhall have his fill of luſt there. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
you may mark that in ſuch deſires of ſpiritual things, 'tis
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſome carnality that moves unregenerate men: ſomewhat it is that
may pleaſe the fleſh, and then 'tis not the ſpiritual but the carnal
part of it that is their object which they woo, and make love too:
which you may judge of by this, that they are frequent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
in their wiſhes for glory, ſeldom or never for grace
(though that alſo may be wiſhed for carnally, to make us more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
and better eſteemed in the world.) For the moſt part, I ſay,
they deſire glory, for that will make them happy, and out of danger
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of worldly misfortunes: remiſſion of ſins, for theſe lie heavy on
their conſciences, and give them many a twinge that they would
fain be eaſed of: but ſeldom petition for grace, as if holineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other conveniencies or gains, were not worth the having. And
this ariſes from hence, that our <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> grows by <hi>ſending out</hi>
and faſtning our affections on him as an object <hi>fitteſt for</hi> our <hi>turns,</hi>
that will advantage us moſt; but not by <hi>receiving</hi> in his <hi>Image</hi> and
ſhape into our ſouls: this indeed would make us not only love, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> imitate him, and having once taſted, long after him, this would
ſanctifie our ſouls, whereas the other doth but only ſatisfie our gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
affections.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid 'tis plain enough (though it might be
much more amplified) that <hi>grace</hi> is of abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of any <hi>holy work</hi> acceptable to God: that without it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is done in ſpiritual matters is carnal, not indeed ſpiritual,
but <hi>equivocally</hi> and abſurdly ſo called. The natural mans deſires
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Heaven, are not deſires of Heaven: his faith, no faith: his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of the Scripture, infidelity; becauſe he doth not apply
them particularly to himſelf to obey them. In ſum, when he
prayes, hopes, or give alms, he does ſomewhat indeed, and 'tis
well done of him: but he doth not truly either pray, or hope, or
give alms, there is ſome carnality in them that hath poyſoned
them, and quite altered the complexion, the conſtitution, and
inward qualities of the work. And then indeed how impatient
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſhould every Chriſtian be of this <hi>Coloquintida</hi> within him? There's
<hi>mors in ollâ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings.</note> as the Prophet once ſpake, that's death in the pot, that
ſo infects and kills every thing that comes out of it. How ſhould
we abhor, and loath, and deteſt this old leaven that ſo beſowres
all our actions? this Heatheniſm of ungenerate carnal nature,
which makes our beſt works ſo unchriſtian? To inſiſt longer
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47754:135"/>
upon this, were but to encreaſe your thirſt, not to ſatisfie it: to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
you ſenſible of that <hi>maraſmus</hi> and deſperate drought that hath gone
over your ſouls, but not to help you to any waters for the cure:
that ſhall come next, as the laſt work of this <hi>exerciſe</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
in a word.</p>
            <p>Having learnt what this <hi>new creature</hi> is, and how abſolutely <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
to a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> O let us not defer one minute longer to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine</hi>
our eſtates, whether we are yet renewed or no, and by the
acts which we daily perform, obſerve whether the ſanctifying ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
be as yet infuſed into our ſouls. If the grounds of our beſt
duties, that which moves us in our holieſt actions, be found upon
ſearch to be but carnal; if a careful religious education, cuſtom
of the place which we live in, fear of humane laws, nay perhaps
a good ſoft tender diſpoſition, and the like, be the things that
make thee love God, and perform holy duties, and not any inward
principle of ſanctity within thee: I counſel thee to think better
of thine eſtate, and conſider whether the like motives, had it ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
hapned that thou hadſt been born and brought up in <hi>Turky,</hi> might
not have made thee worſhip <hi>Mahumet.</hi> I would be ſorry to be
rigid; I fear thou wilt find they might: well then, a new courſe
muſt be taken, all thy former heathen, carnal, or at beſt good moral
life, all thy formal performances, the beſt of thy natural deſires
muſt be content to be rank't here with <hi>circumciſion</hi> and <hi>uncircumciſion
availing nothing,</hi> there is no truſt, or confidence to be placed on
theſe <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſtaves <hi>of reed, Eſ.</hi> xxxvi. 6. And then if thou wilt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
not live heartleſs for ever, if ever thou meanſt to move or walk,
or do any thing, you muſt to that <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Lover</hi> of
<hi>Souls,</hi> and never leave ſolliciting, till he hath <hi>breathed</hi> another
<hi>breath</hi> into your noſtrils, another <hi>Soul</hi> into your Soul: you muſt
lay your ſelf at his feet, and with all the violence and Rhetorick,
and humility, that theſe wants will prompt thee to, and woo,
and importune the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to overſhadow thee, to conceive all
holy graces ſpiritually in thee: and if thou canſt not ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
a gracious anſwer, that the Holy Ghoſt will come in unto
thee, and lodge with thee this night: yet learn ſo much patience
from thy beggarly eſtate, as not to challenge him at thy own times,
but comfortably to wait his leiſure. There is employment enough
for thee in the while to prepare the room againſt his coming, to
make uſe of all his common graces, to cleanſe and reform thy foul
corruptions, that when the Spirit comes it may find thee <hi>ſwept and
garniſh't.</hi> All the outward means which God hath afforded thee,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
he commands thee to make uſe of, and will require it at thy hands
in the beſt meaſure, even <hi>before</hi> thou art <hi>regenerate,</hi> though thou
<hi>ſin</hi> in all thy <hi>unregenerate</hi> performances, for want of inward ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie,
yet 'tis better to have obeyed imperfectly, then not at all:
the firſt is <hi>weakneſs,</hi> the other deſperate <hi>preſumption;</hi> the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47754:135"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> partial obedience, the ſecond total diſobedience. Yet whilſt
thou art preparing, give not over praying, they are acts very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible;
thou maiſt do them both together. Whilſt thou art a
ſortifying theſe little kingdoms within thee, ſend theſe Embaſſadors
abroad for help, that thou maiſt be capable of it when it comes.
But above all things be <hi>circumſpect,</hi> watch and obſerve the Spirit,
and be perpetually ready to receive its blaſts, let it never have
breathed on thee in vain; let thine ear be for ever open to its

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a bugbear, or fable to keep men
in awe, and therefore laugh at it, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did at the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
Acts</hi> xvii. 32. and when they heard of the reſurrection of
the dead, ſome mocked, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> diſputed ſarcaſtically and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly
againſt it, that certainly there was no ſuch matter. And
thus alſo is the ſame word uſed of thoſe which joyned their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

            <p>Thirdly, to ſcoff is ſometimes without words or actions to
ſhew a contempt or neglect of any body. So <hi>Herods</hi> mocking of
Chriſt, is ſet as an expreſſion that he did not think him worthy
talking with, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 11. <hi>He ſet him at nought, and mockt him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and ſent him back to Pilate,</hi> he would not vouchſafe to take notice of

            <p>So that now you have ſeen the outſide of the Text, and lookt it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
over in the groſs, 'tis time to ſurvey it more particularly in its
parts, and thoſe are two: 1. The ſin of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and the ſubjects
in which it ſhews it ſelf, <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt dayes ſcoffers.</hi>
2. The <hi>motive</hi> and impellent to this ſin, <hi>a liberty which men give
themſelves, to walk after their own luſts.</hi> And firſt of Atheiſm, and
the ſubjects in whom it ſhews its ſelf, <hi>In the,</hi> &amp;c. Where you may
note that the words being in a form of a <hi>prophecy,</hi> do note a ſort of
people which were to come in reſpect of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who writes it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
And though in its firſt aſpect it refer to the <hi>period</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> takes in the <hi>parallel</hi> ſtate of
things under the laſt age, and dotage, and declination of the
world. Accordingly we ſee at the 24. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of both, as it were <hi>interwoven</hi> and twiſted into each other; ſo
that what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith ſhall be, we may juſtly ſuſpect is fulfilled
amongſt us, his <hi>future</hi> being now turned into a <hi>preſent,</hi> his <hi>prophecy</hi>
into a <hi>ſtory.</hi> In the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, when Chriſtianity was in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
cradle, and wanted years and ſtrength to move, and ſhew it ſelf
in the world, there were but very few that would acknowledge it,
many ſects of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who peremptorily reſolved themſelves
againſt this profeſſion, joyn'd iſſue with the Apoſtles in aſſiduous
diſputation, as we may find in the 17. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Amongſt
thoſe the <hi>Epicureans</hi> did plainly deny that there was any God that
governed the world, and laught at any proof that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
<hi>Prophets</hi> could afford for their conviction. And here a man might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
think that his prophecy was fulfilled in his own dayes, and that he
needed not to look beyond that preſent age for ſtore of ſcoffers.
Yet ſo it is, that the infidelity which he foreſaw ſhould in thoſe
laſt ages reign confidently in the world, was repreſented to him in
a larger ſize and uglier ſhape, then that of the preſent <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>
The <hi>Epicurean unbelief</hi> ſeem'd nothing to him, being compared to
this <hi>Chriſtian Atheiſm,</hi> where men under the vizard of religion and
profeſſion of piety, are in heart arrant Heathens, and in their faireſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
carriages do indeed but ſcoff, and delude, and abuſe the very God
they worſhip. Whence the <hi>note is,</hi> that the <hi>profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is mixed with an infinite deal of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and that in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
above the Heatheniſm of the perverſeſt <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> There
were in St. <hi>Peters</hi> time <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and all ſects of ſcoffers at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47754:137"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and yet the ſcoffers indeed, the higheſt degree of Atheiſm
was but yet a heaving; it would not riſe and ſhew it ſelf till the
laſt daie.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth obſerving what variety of <hi>ſtratagems</hi> the Devil hath
alwaies had, to keep us in defiance with God, and to nouriſh in
us that hoſtility and enmity againſt Heaven, which is ſo deep and
predominant in himſelf. He firſt ſet them a work to rebel and
fortifie themſelves againſt God, and make themſelves by building
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of a <hi>Tower</hi> ſo impregnable, that God himſelf could not be able to
diſperſe them. <hi>Gen.</hi> xi. 4. Afterwards, when by the puniſhment
and defeating of that deſign, the world was ſufficiently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that no arm of fleſh, no bodily ſtrength could make reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
againſt Heaven; when the body could hold out in rebellion
no longer, he then inſtructs the inward man, the <hi>ſoul</hi> to make its
approaches, and <hi>challenge Heaven.</hi> Now the ſoul of man conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of two faculties, the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>Will,</hi> he firſt deals
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with the Underſtanding, and ſets that up againſt God in many
monſtrous faſhions; firſt, in deluding it to all manner of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
worſhip,</hi> in making it adore the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the
whole Hoſt of Heaven, which was a more generous kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
Afterwards, in making them worſhip <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Cats, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
and <hi>Garlick,</hi> for ſo did the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and this was a more
ſottiſh ſtupid affection, a man would wonder how the Devil
could make them ſuch fools. Afterward he wrought ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their underſtanding, in making them (under pretence of two
laudable qualities, <hi>admiration</hi> and <hi>gratitude,</hi> admiration of any
kind of vertue, and gratitude for any good turn) to deifie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
as gods any men which had ever done, either their Nation, or
private perſons any important <hi>good</hi> or <hi>favour.</hi> So that every
<hi>Heros</hi> or noble, famous man, as ſoon as he was dead was worſhipt.
'Twere long to ſhew you the variety of ſhifts in this kind, which
the Devil uſed to bring in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Gentiles, <hi>i. e.</hi> their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> worſhipping of many Gods. In brief, this plot laſted thus till
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> came into the world, and turn'd it out of doors, and
at Chriſts Reſurrection all the gods of the Heathen expired. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Devil ſtill ſtuck cloſe to that faculty of the ſoul, which
he had been ſo long acquainted with, I mean the underſtanding,
and ſeeing through the whole world almoſt the Doctrine of Chriſt
had ſo poſſeſt men, that he could not hope to bring in his Heathen
gods again, he therefore hath one deſign more on the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſeeing 'tis reſolved to believe Chriſt in ſpight of heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm;
he then puzzles it with many doubts about this very Chriſt
it is ſo poſſeſt with. He raiſes up in the firſt ages of the
Church variety of <hi>Hereſies</hi> concerning the <hi>union</hi> of his <hi>natures,
equality</hi> of his <hi>perſon</hi> with the Father, and the like: and rung as
many changes in mens opinions as the matter of faith was capable
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47754:138"/>
of. There was no truth almoſt in Chriſtianity, but had its Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to contradict and damn it. Now ſince at laſt, <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi>
and the power of <hi>Scripture</hi> having out-lived in a good degree fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
error in opinion, hath almoſt expuls'd the <hi>Devil</hi> out of
the <hi>head,</hi> or upper part of the ſoul, the Underſtanding, his laſt
plot is on the <hi>heel, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> and that he hath
bruiſed terribly,<note place="margin">Gen. III. 15.</note> according to that prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. He
deals mainly on our manners, and ſtrives to make them, if it be
poſſible, ſinful beyond capability of mercy. And this deſign hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
thrived with him wonderfully: he hath wrought more oppoſition
againſt God, more <hi>hereſie</hi> againſt Chriſt in our <hi>lives,</hi> then ever he
was able to do in our <hi>doctrine.</hi> In a Kingdom, where the cuſtom
of the Country and education hath planted purity of faith in the
underſtanding, he there labours to ſupplant and eradicate charity
and devotion in the will; and crucifies Chriſt more confidently
in our corrupt heatheniſh practiſes, then ever the Jews did in their
incredulity. And on this plot he hath ſtuck cloſe, and inſiſted a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
long while, it being the laſt and moſt dangerous ſtratagem that the
policy of Hell can furniſh him with, to <hi>corrupt,</hi> and curſe, and
make abominable a ſincere <hi>belief</hi> by an Atheiſtical <hi>converſation.</hi>
And this doth prove in general, that 'tis the Devils aim, and from
thence probably the Chriſtians curſe, to have more hoſtility againſt
God in our Wills, and ſo to be more horrible Atheiſts, then ever
the Heathen had in their Underſtandings. Now that we may the
more diſtinctly diſcover the Chriſtian Atheiſt, who is very ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
in his opinion, very heretical in his practice; we will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
how every part of his life, every piece of his converſation
doth directly contradict his doctrine, and pluck down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
the very fabrick of godlineſs, expunge thoſe very notions of
piety, which Reaſon and Scripture hath erected in the ſoul. And
firſt,</p>
            <p>He is in his knowledge ſufficiently <hi>Catechiz'd</hi> in the knowledge
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and is confident that all its dictates are to be believ'd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and commands practis'd. But if you look to find this aſſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by his practice, and expreſt in his carriage, you are much
miſtaken in the buſineſs. Is he ſuch a fool as to order his life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rigour of them? No, no doubt, 'tis not one mans
work to believe the Scripture and obey it. Suppoſe I ſhould tell
you, that there are but a few of you that read Scripture to that
purpoſe, that obſerve any edict of piety or virtue, only becauſe
the Scripture hath commanded it. There be many reſtraints that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
keep unregenerate men from ſinning, a good <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> religious
<hi>education,</hi> common <hi>cuſtom</hi> of the place or times where we live,
human <hi>laws,</hi> and the like; and each or all of theſe may curb our
forwardneſs, and keep us in ſome order. But who is there amongſt
us, that being tempted with a fair, lovely, amiable vice, which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47754:138"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he may commit without any regret of his good nature, ſcandal to
his former carriages, fear or danger of puniſhment, either future
or preſent, or any other inconvenience. Who is there, I ſay, that
from the meer awe and reſpect that he bears to Scripture, retires
and calls himſelf off from that ſin which he had otherwiſe faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
If I ſhould ſee all manner of conveniences to <hi>ſin</hi> in one <hi>ſcale,</hi>
and the bare authority of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> quite out-weighing
all them with its heavineſs, I ſhould then hope that our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hearts were catechiz'd as well as our brains in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this truth, that Scripture is to be believed and obeyed.
But I much fear me, if I ſhould make an enquiry in every one of
our hearts here ſingle, the greateſt part of the <hi>Jury</hi> would bring in
an evidence of <hi>guilt,</hi> that in any our moſt entire obediences ſome
other reſpect caſts the ſcales: and this is one piece of direct Atheiſm,
that though our Underſtandings affirm, yet our Will and affections
deny that Scripture is for its own ſake to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Secondly, Our brains are well enough adviſed in the truth of the
doctrine of <hi>Gods Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi> our Underſtandings have
a diſtinct conceit of awe and reverence, to anſwer every notion
we have of God; and yet here alſo our converſation hath its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
of defiance, its <hi>ſcoffs</hi> and arts of <hi>reviling,</hi> as it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
and ſcrape out every of theſe notions out of our Wills, and to
perſwade both our ſelves and others, that that knowledge doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> deep into our hearts; to glance at one or two of theſe: we <hi>believe,</hi>
or at leaſt pretend to, we do ſo, the <hi>immenſity, i. e.</hi> the <hi>ubiquity</hi> and
<hi>omnipreſence</hi> of God, that he indeed is every where, to fill, to ſee,
to ſurvey, to puniſh, and yet our lives do plainly proclaim, that
in earneſt we mean no ſuch matter; we ſhut up our hearts againſt
God, and either as the <hi>Gadarens</hi> did Chriſt, being weary of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
fairly entreat, or elſe directly baniſh him out of our coaſts,
becauſe he hath been or is like to be the deſtruction of ſome <hi>Swine,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> i. e.</hi> beaſtial affections in us. And in ſum, thoſe <hi>bodies</hi> of ours,
which he hath markt out for his <hi>Temples,</hi> we will ſcarce allow him
for his <hi>Inn</hi> to lodge with us one night. Again, can we expect to
be credited, when we ſay we believe the ubiquity and omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, and yet live and ſin as confidently, as if we were
out of his ſight, or reach? Do we behave our ſelves in our <hi>out-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
in our <hi>luxury,</hi> nay, even in our graveſt <hi>devotions,</hi> as if God
were within ken? Without all doubt in every minute almoſt of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> our lives we demonſtrate that we doubt either of his <hi>omnipreſence</hi>
to ſee, or elſe his <hi>juſtice</hi> to puniſh us: for thoſe very things which
we dare not to venture on in the ſight of an earthly <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> that
may puniſh us, nay, of a <hi>ſpy</hi> that may complain of us, nay, of an <hi>enemy</hi> that will upbraid us, nay, of a <hi>friend</hi> that will check and
admoniſh us; we never doubt, or demur, or delay to practiſe in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47754:139"/>
private, or the dark, where ſtill God is preſent to overſee and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
puniſh. And if this be not a ſcoffing, a deluding, a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
of God, to do that without any fear or regret in his ſight,
which we never offer to attempt before a man, nay, a friend, I
know not what may be counted <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> In like manner, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
God to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>all-ſufficient;</hi> and if we ſhould be
examined in earneſt, we would confeſs that there is no ability in
any creature to beſtow or provide any good thing for us: and yet
our will here alſo hath its ways and arguments of contradiction.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Our whole life is one continued confutation of this piece of our
faith, our <hi>tremblings,</hi> our <hi>jealouſies,</hi> our <hi>diſtruſts,</hi> our <hi>carefulneſs,</hi>
our worldly <hi>providence,</hi> and importunate <hi>carking,</hi> our methods and
ſtratagems of <hi>thrift</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> and the whole buſineſs of our
lives in wooing, and ſolliciting, and importuning every power of
nature, every trade and art of the world, to ſuccour, to aſſiſt and
provide for us, are moſt egregious evidences that we put no truſt
or confidence in Gods all-ſufficiency, but wholly depend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
upon the arm of fleſh, both to raiſe and ſuſtain us. This very
one faſhion of ours, in all our diſtreſſes, to fly to and call upon
all manner of <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> without any raiſing or elevating our
eyes or thoughts toward <hi>God,</hi> from whom cometh our help,
plainly ſhews that God ſtill dwells abroad in tents: we have ſeen
or heard of him, but have not yet brought him home into our
hearts, there to poſſeſs, and rectifie, and inſtruct our wills, as
well as our underſtandings.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The whole myſtery of Chriſt articulately ſet down in
our <hi>Creed</hi> we as punctually believe, and to make good our names,
that we are Chriſtians in earneſt, we will challenge and defie the
fire and fagot to perſwade us out of it: and theſe are good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if our practices did not give our faith the lye, and utterly
renounce at the Church door whatſoever we profeſt in our pews.
This very one thing, that he which is our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſhall be our
<hi>Judge,</hi> that he which was <hi>crucified, dead, and buried, ſits now at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
right hand of God, and from thence ſhall come to judge the world;</hi> this
main part, yea, ſum of our belief, we deny and bandy againſt
all our lives long. If the ſtory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> coming to <hi>judgment,</hi> ſet
down in the xxv.<note place="margin">Mat. XXV. 30.</note> of <hi>Matthew</hi> after the 30. verſe, had ever entred
through the doors of our ears to the inward cloſets of our hearts,
'tis impoſſible but we ſhould obſerve and practiſe that one ſingle
duty there required of us. <hi>Chriſt</hi> there as a Judge exacts and calls
us to account for nothing in the world, but only <hi>works of mercy,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
according to the ſatisfaction which we are able to give him in that
one point, he either entertains or repels us; and therefore our
care and negligence in this one buſineſs, will prove us either Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
or Infidels. But alas! 'tis too plain, that in our actions we
never dream either of the judgment or the arraignment: our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47754:139"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> neglect of this one duty, argues us not only unchriſtian but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.
Beſides our <hi>Alms-deeds,</hi> which concern only the <hi>outſide</hi>
of our <hi>neighbour,</hi> and are but a kind of worldly mercy, there are
many more important, but cheaper works of mercy, as good <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi>
ſpiritual <hi>inſtructions,</hi> holy <hi>education</hi> of them that are come out
of our loyns, or are committed to our care, ſeaſonable <hi>reproof,</hi>
according to that excellent place, <hi>Lev</hi> xix. 17.<note place="margin">Lev. XIX. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate
thy brother in thine heart, but in any wiſe reprove him:</hi> a care of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our ſelves that we may not ſcandal, or injure, or offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the ſoul and tender conſcience of him that is flexible to
follow us into any riot. Theſe and many other works of mercy in
the higheſt degree, as concerning the welfare of other mens ſouls,
and the chief thing required of us at the day of judgment, are
yet ſo out-dated in our thoughts, ſo utterly defaced, and blotted
out in the whole courſe of our lives, that it ſeems we never expect
that Chriſt in his Majeſty as a Judge, whom we apprehend, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> embrace, and hug in his humility as a Saviour. <hi>Beloved,</hi> till by
ſome ſevere hand held over our lives, and particularly by the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtudy and exerciſe of ſome <hi>work of mercy</hi> or other, we demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the ſincerity of our belief, the <hi>Saints</hi> on Earth, and <hi>Angels</hi>
in Heaven will ſhrewdly ſuſpect, that we do only ſay over that
part of our <hi>Creed,</hi> that we believe only that which is for our turn,
the <hi>ſufferings</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactions</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which coſt us nothing, but
do not proceed to his office of a Judge, do not either fear his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> judgments, or deſire to make our ſelves capable of his mercies.
Briefly, whoſoever neglects or takes no notice of this duty of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
<hi>works of mercy,</hi> whatſoever he brags of in his <hi>theory</hi> or ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in his heart either <hi>denies</hi> or contemns <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Judge, and
ſo deſtroys the ſum of his Faith, and this is another kind of ſecret
Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our Creed leads us on to a belief and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and 'tis well we have all conn'd his name
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there, for otherwiſe I ſhould much fear that it would be ſaid of
many nominal Chriſtians, what is reported of the <hi>Epheſian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,</hi>
Acts xix. 2.<note place="margin">Acts XIX 2.</note> 
               <hi>They have not ſo much as heard whether there be an
Holy Ghoſt or no.</hi> But not to ſuſpect ſo much ignorance in any
Chriſtian, we will ſuppoſe indeed men to know whatſoever they
profeſs, and enquire only whether our lives ſecond our profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or whether indeed they are meer Infidels, and Atheiſtical in
this buſineſs concerning the Holy Ghoſt. How many of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
ſort which have learnt this name in their Catechiſm or
Creed, have not yet any further uſe to put it to, but only to make
up the number of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> have no ſpecial office to appoint for
him, no ſpecial mercy, or gift, or ability to beg of him in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of their ſalvation, but mention him only for faſhion ſake,
not that they ever think of preparing their bodies or ſouls to be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47754:140"/>
               <hi>Temples</hi> worthy to entertain him, not that they ever look after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the <hi>earneſt of the Spirit</hi> in their hearts,<note place="margin">2 Cor. l. 22.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 22. Further yet,
how many better learned amongſt us do not yet in our lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him in that <hi>Epithet</hi> annext to his title, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,
i. e.</hi> not only eminently in himſelf holy, but <hi>cauſally,</hi> producing
the ſame quality in us, from thence called the <hi>ſanctifying</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
<hi>Spirit?</hi> How do we for the moſt part fly from, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and reſiſt, and ſo violently deny him, when he once appears
to us in this <hi>Attribute?</hi> When he comes to ſanctifie us, we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
not patient of ſo much ſowreneſs, ſo much humility, ſo much non-conformity
with the <hi>world,</hi> as he begins to exact of us, we ſhake
off many bleſſed motions of the Spirit, and keep our ſelves within
<hi>garriſon,</hi> as far as we can out of his reach, leſt at any turn he
ſhould meet with, and we ſhould be converted. Laſtly, the
moſt ordinary morally qualified tame Chriſtians amongſt us,
who are not ſo violent as to profeſs open arms againſt this Spirit,
how do they yet reject him out of all their thoughts? How ſeldom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
do many peaceable orderly men amongſt us, ever obſerve their
wants, or importune the aſſiſtance of this Spirit? In ſum, 'twas a
ſhrewd ſpeech of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which will <hi>caſt</hi> many fair out-ſides
at the bar for Atheiſts, <hi>That the life of an unregenerate man is but the
life of an Heathen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Clem. Al.</note> and that 'tis our regeneration only that raiſes us
up <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Strom.</hi> p. 281.</note> from being ſtill meer <hi>Gentiles.</hi> He that believes in
his Creed the perſon, nay, underſtands in the Schools the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and yet ſees them only in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>fountain,</hi> neither finds nor ſeeks for any <hi>effects</hi> of them in his own
ſoul; he that is ſtill unregenerate, and continues ſtill gaping and
yawning, ſtupid and ſenſeleſs in this his condition, is ſtill for all
his Creed and learning in effect an Atheiſt. And the Lord of
Heaven give him to ſee, and endeavours to work, and an heart to
pray, and his Spirit to draw and force him out of this condition.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Not to cramp in every Article of our Creed into this
Diſcourſe, we will only inſiſt on two more. We ſay therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
that we <hi>believe the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> and 'tis a bleſſed confidence,
that all the treaſures in the world cannot equal. But do our ſelves
keep equipage, and hand in hand accompany this profeſſion?
Let me catechize you a while. You believe the forgiveneſs of
ſins, but I hope not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> that the ſufferings of Chriſt ſhall
effectually clear every mans ſcore at the day of judgment: well
then, it muſt be meant only of thoſe that by <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> are
grafted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſhall appear at that great marriage in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <hi>wedding garment,</hi> which ſhall be acknowledged the livery and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> But do our lives ever ſtand to this explication,
and reſtriction of the Article? Do they ever expect this beloved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
by performing the condition of repentance? Do we ever
go about to make our ſelves capable of receiving this mercy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47754:140"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> offer'd us? Nay, do we not by our wilful ſtupidity, and
pertinacious continuing in ſin, nullifie in reſpect of us all that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Chriſt, and utterly abandon thoſe means which muſt
bring home this remiſſion to us? The truth is, our faith runs only
on general terms, we are willing to lay all our ſins on Chriſts
ſhoulders, and perſwade our ſelves ſomewhat ſlightly and coldly,
that he will bear them in the root, and in the fruit, in the bullion,
and in the coyn, in the groſs, and in the retail, <hi>i. e.</hi> both our <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and our <hi>actual</hi> tranſgreſſions: but we never take any courſe
to reſt ſatisfied, that we in particular ſhall participate of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
This requires the humiliation of the whole man, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of bondage for a while, afterwards a ſecond purity and virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the ſoul recovered by <hi>repentance,</hi> and then a ſoberly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>faith</hi> and confidence, and an expreſſing of it by our own forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of others. And till this piece of our Creed be thus explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and interpreted in our converſation, we remain but confident
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Atheiſts, not able to perſwade any body that hears us that indeed
we believe what we profeſs.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, <hi>The reſurrection of the body,</hi> and its conſequent,
<hi>everlaſting life,</hi> is the cloſe of our Faith, and end, and prop, and
encouragement, and conſummation of our hope; and yet we take
moſt pains of all to prove our ſelves Infidels in this: our whole
carriage, both in the choice and obſervance of our Religion ſhew
that we do not depend on it, that we put no confidence in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> If we went on this aſſurance, we ſhould contemn
any worldly encouragement, and make the ſame thing both the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and end of our ſervice. We ſhould ſcorn to take notice of ſo
poor a thing as <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>convenience</hi> is in a matter of ſo high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
knowing and expecting that our reward ſhall be great
in <hi>Heaven.</hi> This one thought of a reſurrection, and an infinite
reward of any faithful undertaking of ours, would make us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and almoſt be afraid of any <hi>temporal</hi> recompenſe for our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> worſhip of God, for fear it ſhould by paying us before-hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of that <hi>everlaſting</hi> one. We ſhould catch and be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of that expreſſion of <hi>devotion,</hi> which were moſt <hi>painful</hi> and
<hi>leaſt profitable</hi> as to worldly advantage: and yet we in the ſtupidity
of Atheiſtical hearts are ſo improvidently covetous, ſo haſty and
impatient in our Religion, that unleſs ſome preſent gain allure and
draw us, we have no manner of life, or ſpirit, or alacrity to this,
as we count it, unprofitable ſervice of God. The leaſt incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in the world will fright us from the greateſt forwardneſs,
and nimbleneſs, and activity in Religion: and the leaſt appearance
of <hi>promotion,</hi> or other like encouragement, will produce and raiſe
in us theſe affections and expreſſions of <hi>zeal,</hi> which the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> could never work in us. Our <hi>Religion</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like that of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> before <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, either <hi>Jews</hi> or
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47754:141"/>
               <hi>Heathens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſ. Ant. Jud. l. 12. c. 7. l.</hi> 11. 8.</note> according as their King <hi>Antiochus</hi> would have them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>Chriſts</hi> time were perpetually either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the <hi>Romans,</hi> their new Lords and Maſters either threatned,
or granted <hi>priviledge</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi> If there were any thing to be
gotten by the profeſſion, they would be as ſolemn Chriſtians as
any. So when the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> over-run <hi>Italy,</hi> and (whether
upon good affection or compulſion from God, I know not) ſpared
them that fled to the <hi>Baſilica</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> the place where the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
exerciſed: then, I ſay, they which formerly perſecuted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the Chriſtians, now bore them company very friendly to their
<hi>Churches,</hi> and to ſave their lives fled to the Temple for a <hi>refuge,</hi>
which before they abomin'd; and made uſe of Chriſtianity for
their <hi>ſafe-guard,</hi> which they would not own for their <hi>Religion,</hi> and
hurried to that <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for their lives, which they would not <hi>viſit</hi>
for their <hi>Souls.</hi> The condition of our Religion is like that which is
upbraided to <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. X. 11.</note> Hoſ. X. 11. <hi>Ephraim is like an Heifer that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to tread out the Corn.</hi> 'Twas prohibited by the law to muzzle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the Ox or Heifer that treadeth out the Corn; 'twas allowed them
to feed as long as they did the work, and that made <hi>Ephraim</hi> love
the toil ſo well, becauſe that at the very time he performed the
labour, he enjoy'd the fruit of it; had, as we ſay, his wages in
his hand; had ſome preſent emolument that would ingratiate his
work to him; was not left to ſuch a tedious expectation, to ſo
long a date as to wait for his reward till the reſurrection: thoſe
were too hard terms for him, he could not endure to be ty'd ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
long up to the empty rack, or feed upon the bit. And thus haſty
are we in the exacting of our reward for our ſervice of God: we
will never ſet our hands to it, unleſs we may make our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
we are reſolved not to be ſuch fools, as <hi>to ſerve God for nought,</hi>
to ſpend the quickeſt of our ſpirits in a ſowre crabbed profeſſion,
and expect our thanks at dooms-day. This plainly demonſtrates,
that however our <hi>theory</hi> be poſſeſt, our practice places no truſt, no
confidence, no aſſurance in that part of our Creed, the <hi>reſurrection.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Again, 'twas an excellent argument to perſwade doubtful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in the youth and non-age of the <hi>Church,</hi> of the certainty of
the reſurrection, that religious men, and thoſe whom undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
God loved, were full of <hi>ſufferings</hi> in this world, and lived
and died many of them without any expreſſion of Gods favour to
them, which made them certainly to conclude, that no doubt
God hath ſome other courſe to exhibit himſelf in the riches of his
mercy to them; and ſeeing there was no hope but in another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
world, <hi>Verily there ſhould be a reward for the righteous, doubtleſs there
is a God that judgeth the Earth:</hi> and by this argument we may try our
ſelves for the ſincerity of our faith in this buſineſs. If we can be
patient to endure afflictions here, and not complain or grumble
for a reſpite and deliverance, but keep all our hopes to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47754:141"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> defer all our happineſs to be performed to us at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrection,
and though God kill us, yet truſt in him, and be able
to ſee through death, in a truſt <hi>That our Redeemer lives, and that
with theſe eyes we ſhall behold him,</hi> then may we chear up, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
our ſelves on good grounds, that our hearts and lives do
aſſent to the reſurrection,<note place="margin">Ecclus. XXXVIII. 20.</note> which our tongues brag of: <hi>Take no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs
to heart, but drive it away and remember the end.</hi> But if this
conſideration cannot digeſt the leaſt oppreſſion of this life, cannot
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> give us patience for the lighteſt encumbrance, but for all our
Creed we ſtill fly out into all outrages of paſſion and extacies of
impatience, we plainly betray our ſelves men of this preſent
world, whoſe happineſs or miſery is only that which is tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and before our eyes, are not able by the perſpective of <hi>faith</hi> to
behold that which eaſily we might, all our wants relieved, all
our injuries revenged, all our wounds bound up in the day of the
reſurrection: but all our life long we repine and grumble, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are diſcontented <hi>as men without hope;</hi> and whilſt we do thus, what
do we but act the part of theſe Atheiſts here in my Text, ſcoffing
and ſaying, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming,</hi> in the next verſe to
my Text. This very impatience and want of skill in bearing the
brunts of this our warfare, is but a piece of cowardly Atheiſm,
either a denying or mocking at the reſurrection. Every <hi>ſigh</hi> is a
<hi>ſcoff,</hi> every <hi>groan</hi> a <hi>gibe,</hi> every fear a ſly art of laughing at the
ſtupidity of thoſe who depend upon the fulfilling of the promiſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of his coming. Laſtly, ſay we what we will, we <hi>live</hi> as if there
were no reſurrection, as <hi>Sadduces,</hi> if not as <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
look no further then this life, all our contrivances are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
and fruſtrate in the grave; we manage our ſelves with ſo
little underſtanding, that any ſpectator would judge by our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that 'tis no injury to compare us to <hi>the beaſts that periſh</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return again. Certainly if we had any deſign upon Heaven or
another life, we would here make ſome proviſion for it, <hi>Make
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our ſelves friends of our unrighteous Mammon, that when we fail, they
may receive us into everlaſting habitations, i. e.</hi> uſe thoſe good things
that God hath given us with ſome kind of providence, that they
may ſtand us in ſtead when we have need of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only as
<hi>inſtruments</hi> to <hi>ſin</hi> (for that is to get us more enemies) but as <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers</hi>
to be ſent before us to <hi>Heaven.</hi> 'Twas a bitter Sarcaſm of
the <hi>fool</hi> to the <hi>Abbot</hi> on his death-bed, that the <hi>Abbot</hi> deſerved
his ſtaff, as being the verier fool of the two, that being ſtraight
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to die, to remove his <hi>Tent</hi> to another world, he had ſent none of
his <hi>houſhold-ſtuff</hi> before him. The truth is, we live generally as
men that would be very angry, much diſpleaſed if any ſhould
perſwade us there were a reſurrection, the very mentioning of it
to us might ſeem to upbraid our ordinary practices, which have
nothing but the darkneſs of death, and ſilence of the grave to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47754:142"/>
them. I may juſtly ſay, that many ignorant <hi>Heathens,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
which were confident there was nothing beyond this life, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certainly with death to be <hi>annihilated,</hi> and turn again into a
perpetual nothing, yet either for the awe they bore to <hi>vertue,</hi> or
fear of <hi>diſgrace</hi> after death, kept themſelves more regularly,
lived more carefully then many of us Chriſtians. And this is an
horrid accuſation, that will lye very heavy upon us, that againſt
ſo many illuminated underſtandings the ignorance of the Gentiles
ſhould riſe up in judgment, and the learned Chriſtian be found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the moſt deſperate Atheiſt. I have been too large upon ſo rigid
a Doctrine as this, and I love, and pray God I may always have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to come up to this place upon a more merciful Subject: but
I told you even now out of <hi>Lev.</hi> xix. 17. that 'twas no ſmall work
of mercy, 'twas the moſt friendly office that could be performed
any man, to reprehend, and as the Text ſaith, <hi>Not to ſuffer ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy neighbour,</hi> eſpecially ſo ſly a covert lurking ſin as this of
Atheiſm, which few can diſcern in themſelves. I ſhall now come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to <hi>Application,</hi> which becauſe the whole Doctrine ſpoke morally
to your affections, and ſo in a manner prevented <hi>Uſes,</hi> ſhall be
only a recapitulation and brief knitting up of what hitherto hath
been ſcattered at large.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the <hi>Devils policy</hi> of deluding, and bewitching, and
diſtorting our <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> either with variety of <hi>falſe gods,</hi> or
hereſies raiſed upon the <hi>true,</hi> is now almoſt clearly out-dated, and
his skill is all bent to the deforming of the <hi>Will,</hi> and defacing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
character of God, and the expreſſion of the ſincerity of our faith
in our lives, we muſt deal with this enemy at his own weapon,
learn to order our munition according to the aſſault, and fortifie
that part moſt impregnably, toward which the tempeſt binds and
threatens. There is not now ſo much danger to be feared from
the inrode of Hereticks in <hi>opinion</hi> as in <hi>practice,</hi> not ſo much Atheiſm
to be dreaded from the infidelity of our brains, as the Heatheniſm
and Gentiliſm of our luſts, which even in the midſt of a Chriſtian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
profeſſion deny God even to his face. And therefore our chiefeſt
<hi>Frontiers</hi> and <hi>Fortifications</hi> muſt be ſet up before that part of the
ſoul, our moſt careful Watch and Centinel placed upon our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
leſt the Devil enter there and depopulate the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and plant the Atheiſt in his room. To this purpoſe we
muſt examine what ſeeds are already ſown, what treachery is a
working within, and no doubt moſt of us at the firſt caſt of the eye
ſhall find great ſtore, unleſs we be partial to our ſelves, and bring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
in a verdict of mercy, and conſtrue that <hi>weakneſs,</hi> which indeed
ſignifies <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When upon <hi>examination</hi> we find our lives undermining our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
our practices denying the authority of Scripture, and no whit
forwarder to any Chriſtian duty upon its commands. When we
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47754:142"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> find <hi>Gods eſſence</hi> and Attributes reviled and ſcoffed at in our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi>
his <hi>omnipreſence</hi> contemned by our confidence in <hi>ſinning,</hi>
and argued againſt by our baniſhing God out of all our <hi>thoughts,</hi>
his <hi>all ſufficiency</hi> doubted of by our <hi>diſtruſts,</hi> and our ſcorn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it. When we perceive that our carriages do fall off at
this part of our belief in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he ſhall come again to be our
<hi>Judge,</hi> and by our neglect of thoſe works eſpecially of <hi>mercy,</hi>
which he ſhall then require of us, ſhew that indeed we expect him
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not, or think of him as a Judge, but only as a Saviour. When we
obſerve our <hi>Wills</hi> reſiſting the <hi>gifts,</hi> and falſifying the <hi>Attribute,</hi>
whilſt our <hi>Creed</hi> confeſſes the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſee how
little, how nothing of the <hi>ſanctifying</hi> ſpirit, of the <hi>earneſt</hi> of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
is in our hearts, and we ſtill ſtupidly ſenſleſs of the want.
When we believe <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of ſins, and that only upon condition
of <hi>repentance,</hi> and yet abhor ſo much as to hear or think of the
performing of it, or to make good that mercy to others which our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſelves challenge of God. Laſtly, when we prove to our
ſelves, and all the world beſide, by our requiring of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>reward</hi> for all our goodneſs, and ruling our Religion to our
earthly <hi>profit,</hi> by our <hi>impatience</hi> of any <hi>affliction,</hi> by our heatheniſh
neglect and ſtupidity, and riot, that we do not in earneſt look for
the reſurrection to life. When, I ſay, by a juſt, but exact ſurvey and
inqueſt we find theſe ſo many degrees of ſecret <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in us, then
muſt we ſhrift, and purge, and cleanſe, and rinſe our ſouls from theſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dregs of Heatheniſm; then muſt we humble our ſelves below the
duſt, and not dare to look the verieſt <hi>Gentile</hi> in the face, 'till we
have removed this plague from us. <hi>And do thou,</hi> O Lord, <hi>aſſiſt our
endeavours, and by the violence of thy</hi> Spirit <hi>force and raviſh us in
our lives, as well as belief, to a ſincere acknowledgment and expreſſion
of every minute part of that Religion which is purely Chriſtian, that
we may adore thee in our hearts as well as our brains, and being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
throughout, from any tincture, or colour, or ſuſpition of irreligion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in either power of our ſouls, we may glorifie thee here, and be glorified

is elevated infinitely above the ordinary pitch; that whatever
contentments any other ſort of people can glory or delight in, is but
ſome imaginary, ſlight, poor happineſs that men are fain to ſolace
themſelves withal, to keep them from melancholy, all far enough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
below the ſize of their felicity, which all agreeable circumſtances
have conſpired to make exactly complete. Hence it is that you
ſhall ordinarily obſerve the rich man, in this confidence of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that no man is happy but himſelf, either <hi>contemn</hi> or pity the
poverty, and improvidence, and perhaps the ſottiſhneſs of ſuch

the price of all things elſe, that which can eaſily purchaſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe we can ſtand in need of; and therefore the rich man if
he could think Learning and Religion worth any thing, having his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> money by him (which is in effect every thing) thinks he can call
for them when he pleaſes. In the mean, he hath more wit then to

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> What we have hitherto noted to you concerning the rich man is
applyable on the ſame grounds to any fort of people which have
fixt upon any worldly content, and reſolved upon ſome one object,
beſide which they will never value or prize any thing. Thus the
<hi>Epicure</hi> or voluptuous man, who hath ſet up his Idol luſt, to whom
he owes all his ſacrifice, and from whom he expects all his good
fortune, that hath fixt his <hi>Pillars,</hi> and caſt his <hi>Anchor,</hi> and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
conſtant in his courſe, that he is reſolved for ever to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> walk in. This man I ſay, being poſſeſt with an opinion of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
which he is placed in, like the Sun in his pride, <hi>rejoyces to
run his courſe,</hi> and ſcorns any contrary motion that he meets or hears
of, and only obſerves the wayes of vertue, and religion, to hate and
laugh at them: and the farther he walks, the deeper he is engaged
in this humor of ſelf-content, and contempt of others, of ſecurity,
and ſcoffing. For this is the force and implicite argument, covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained in the cloſe of theſe words, <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> dayes, ſcoffers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> this reſolution to walk on in their own luſts,
hath brought them to this pitch of Atheiſm, to ſcoff and deride both
God and Goodneſs. <hi>There ſhall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We have heretofore divided theſe words, and in them obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and handled already the ſin of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> together with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in which it works, Chriſtians of the laſt times, noted from
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47754:144"/>
this prophetick ſpeech, <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt dayes ſcoffers.</hi> We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
now come to the ſecond particular, the motive, or <hi>impellent</hi> to this
ſin, a <hi>liberty</hi> which men give themſelves, and a <hi>content</hi> which <hi>they
take to walk after their own luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond chapter of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> is an excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the <hi>Atheiſt:</hi> and though it be of Apocryphal authority,
yet 'tis of moſt divine Canonical truth. I could find in my heart,
nay, I can ſcarce hold from reading, and paraphraſing the whole
chapter to you: 'tis ſo ſolid, ſo ſtrong, ſo perfect a diſcourſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
upon this theme, it contains ſo many ſtrains of Atheiſtical reaſon,
in oppoſition to godlineſs, and the root, and growth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
of this tree of knowledge, and death, that the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of that one place might ſuffice without any enlargement of
proofs or expreſſions. But for brevity ſake, and on promiſe that
you will at your leiſure ſurvey it, I will omit to inſiſt on it: only
in the end of the 21. verſe, after all the expreſſions of their Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical
counſels, you have the reaſon, or motive, or firſt worker of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
all, <hi>For their own wickedneſs hath blinded them:</hi> their ſtupid <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
in thoſe dark wayes, in that black <hi>Tophet</hi> on earth, habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
cuſtom of ſinning, had ſo thickned their ſight, had drawn ſuch a
film over their eyes, that in the judgment of divine affairs, they
were ſtark blind: they could ſee nothing in all the myſtery of
godlineſs which was worth embracing: and therefore had no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
but to walk on after their own luſts, and to ſcoff at thoſe
that were ſo fooliſhly friendly to them, as to call them out of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
way: they were well enough acquainted with their own paths, they
could walk them blindfold, and therefore had more wit then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the road for a nearer by-way. The iſſue of all is this, that a
<hi>voluptuous</hi> courſe of <hi>life</hi> is a great <hi>promoter</hi> and advancer of <hi>Atheiſm:</hi>
there had never been ſo many ſcoffers in the Chriſtian world, had
there not been alſo thoſe that were reſolute to walk after their own
luſts.</p>
            <p>In the firſt verſe of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> there be ſteps, and rounds, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
gradations of a ſinner ſpecified, 1. <hi>Walking in the counſel of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi>
2. <hi>Standing in the way of ſinners, 3. Sitting in the ſeat of the
ſcorner.</hi> The two firſt being degrees in his motion, ſeveral ſtages
of his journey to this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or top pitch of ſinning in the laſt.
Walking in the counſel of the ungodly is the firſt entrance to his
courſe: and he that hath ſuch a riſe as this, hath a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of all other ſinners; he will perform his race with ſpeed, and
come ſuddenly to his goal. This deliberate <hi>walking</hi> in the wayes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and with the companions and contrivers of ungodlineſs, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
and proſecuting of the counſels, the enjoying this familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with ſin, proves a ſtrong engagement to continue and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and delight in its acquaintance. Yet becauſe walking is a
laborious motion, and will tire the ſinner in time, he is fain to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47754:144"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> betake himſelf to an eaſier poſture, and that is ſtanding in the
way of ſinners, continuing in a ſtill, ſober, quiet, ſtupid tranqil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of ſinning, ſtanding like a <hi>Mercury</hi>'s poſt in the midſt of a rode,
never removed or ſtirred an inch, though never ſo juſtled by the
paſſengers. Let all the contrary vertues never ſo thwart and croſs
him, he hath fixed his ſtation, and neither force, nor allurements
ſhall make him move. Yet becauſe ſtanding alſo is a painful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
with which the valianteſt legs will at laſt be nummed, if not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> tyred, he hath in the laſt place his chair of eaſe and ſtate, and
here he ſets up his reſt, here he ſins with as much Majeſty as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
1. In <hi>cathedrâ,</hi> as a feat of greatneſs, lording it, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>imperiouſly,</hi> commanding every ſpectator to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of ſcoffing at God and goodneſs. 2. In <hi>cathedrâ,</hi> as a ſeat of
<hi>authority,</hi> ſinning doctorally, and magiſterially, by his practiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
the lawfulneſs of theſe ſcoffs, even ſetting up a ſchool of
Atheiſm. And 3. in <hi>cathedrâ,</hi> as a ſeat of <hi>reſt,</hi> and eaſe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which he is reſolved never to riſe out of, which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
himſelf in, that he may laugh at eaſe, and without any pains
or trouble, or charges blaſpheme God for ever. And for the moſt
part indeed he proves as bad as his reſolution, having once given
himſelf this licence of laughing at and deriding Religion, he ſeldom
ever recovers himſelf to a ſober countenance, like men whoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of ſcoffing hath made wry-mouthed, he lives and continues,
and for the moſt part dyes ſcoffing. He comes as it were laughing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into hell, and ſeldom forſakes this habit of prophaneneſs, till hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
hath put ſmiling out of date. There is not a ſin in the world
that ſits cloſer to him which hath once entertained it, and he that
is once a <hi>merry Atheiſt,</hi> ſeldom, if ever proves a ſad <hi>ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
He is ſeated in his chair of ſcorning, and contemns the
mercy of that ſpirit that ſhould take him out of it. Thus you ſee,
that walking in the ſteps, and ſtanding in the way, <hi>i. e.</hi> following
the commands of their own luſts, they are ſoon arrived to the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pitch of Atheiſts, to the chair of ſcorners, and then there is but
little preferment more that they are capable of, unleſs they will
ſtrive with <hi>Lucifer</hi> for preeminence in hell, or elſe challenge <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh</hi>
to rail, or <hi>Julian</hi> to blaſpheme. But this is the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſcoffers, and I hope the devil hath but few ſuch valiant,
bold, forward Champions in the world, ſince <hi>Julian</hi> or <hi>Lucian</hi>'s
time. And therefore I hope I have prickt no mans conſcience here,
whilſt I have ſpoke of them: but I have formerly proved,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that there be ſome lower, tamer, ſecret degrees of Atheiſm,
which every man may chance to ſpy in ſome angle or corner of
his ſoul, ſome implicite artificial wayes of ſcoffing, or aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God, which moſt of us are guilty of: and 'twill be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

and animated by a licentious life.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerves of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47754:145"/>
               <hi>Scythians</hi> that they do not ſwathe themſelves, nor bind in their loins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
with any kind of girdle, but go with their bodies very looſe, that
they may ride the eaſier, which is the only exerciſe they uſe: and
from hence, ſaith he, they grow ſo corpulent and fleſhy, ſo bread
and bulky, that they are both ugly and unweildy, an eye-ſore to
others, and cumberſome to themſelves: thoſe acceſſions which in
other people extend themſelves proportionably in length, and
breadth, in height as well as bulk, in them grow all into thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
ſo that you ſhall ſee a Pygme in ſtature, as big as a Gyant in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the girt. Thus is it with thoſe whoſe affections are not ruled, and
reſtrained in order, and within limits, are not ſwathed and kept
in, have not ſome ſet terms of temperance, and other vertues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which they ſuffer not themſelves to fly out. If I ſay, theſe
affections within us be by the owners left ungirt to their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
they will never grow upward toward Heaven: they will
ſtill be dwarfiſh, of ſmall growth in Religion: but yet like thoſe
<hi>Scythians,</hi> they will run into a ſtrange bulk and corpulence, into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſome unweildy miſhapen forms of Atheiſin, or the like. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they will grow into a greater breadth then the reaſonable
ſoul will be able to manage: unleſs the ſpirit vouchſafe to come
down and contract, and call it into bounds, it will encreaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all proportion, beyond all acknowledgment of God or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
We are uſed to ſay in nature, that all <hi>moiſt</hi> things are
apt to be conteined in <hi>other terms,</hi> but hardly in their own: the
<hi>water</hi> is eaſily cooped up in a glaſs or bucket, where there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
bounderies to keep it in, but being let looſe on a table or a floor,
it flyes about and never ſtayes again till it meet with ſome <hi>Ocean,</hi>
or hollow place which may incloſe, and beſtow the conſiſtency
on it which it has not of it ſelf. Thus may you ſee a river whilſt
it is kept within the channel, go on in its ſtream and courſe very
ſoberly and orderly, but when it hath over-ſwelled the banks
which before kept it in, then doth it run about the paſtures, ſcorns
to be kept within any compaſs. Thus is it with the ſoul of man,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
if it be ordered within terms and <hi>bounds,</hi> if it have a ſtrict hand
held over it, if it be curb'd and brought to its poſtures, if it have
reaſon and grace, and a careful tutor to order it, you ſhall find it
as tame a creature as you need deal with: it will never ſtraggle
or ſtray beyond the confines which the ſpirit hath ſet it; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe though it be in it ſelf fluid, and moiſt, and ready
to run about like water, yet <hi>Deus firmavit Aquas,</hi> God hath made
a firmament betwixt the waters,<note place="margin">Gen. l. 7.</note> as he did, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 7. <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
eſtabliſht it, and given it a conſiſtency, that it ſhould not flow or
pour it ſelf out beyond its place. But if this ſoul of man be left
to its own nature, to its own fluid, wild, incontinent condition, it
preſently runs out into an <hi>Ocean,</hi> never ſtayes, or conſiders, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults,
but ruſhes head-long into all inordinacy, having neither the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47754:145"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reins of reaſon nor God to keep it in, it never thinks of either of
them, and unleſs by chance or by Gods mercy it fall into their
hands, 'tis likely to run riot for ever. Being once let looſe it ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as if there were neither power on earth to quell, nor in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to puniſh it. Thus do you ſee how fluid, how inconſtant the
ſoul is of its own accord, how prone it is, how naturally inclined
to run over like a ſtream over the banks, and if it be not ſwathed,
and kept in, if it be left to the licentious condition of it ſelf, how
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ready is it to contemn both Reaſon and God, and run head-long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Atheiſm. Nay we need not ſpeak ſo mercifully of it, this very
<hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> is the actual renouncing of Religion, this very walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after their own luſts, is not only a motive to this ſin of ſcoffing,
but the very ſin it ſelf.</p>
            <p>A <hi>falſe Conception</hi> in the womb is only a rude, confuſed, ugly
<hi>Chaos,</hi> a meer <hi>lump</hi> of fleſh, of no kind of figure or reſemblance,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>'Tis the <hi>ſoul</hi> at its entrance which defines, and trims, and poliſhes
into a <hi>body,</hi> that gives it eyes, and ears, and legs, and hands, which
before it had not diſtinctly and ſeverally, but only rudely altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with that maſs or lump. Thus is it with the Man, till Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath entred into him as a ſoul to inform, and faſhion him, as long
as he lives thus at large, having no terms, or bounds, or limits to
his actions, having no form, or figure, or certain motion defined
him, he is a <hi>Mola,</hi> a meer lump of man, an arrant Atheiſt: you
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cannot diſcern any features or lineaments of a Chriſtian in him;
he hath neither eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear, nor hands to practiſe
any duty that belongs to his peace. Only 'tis <hi>Religion</hi> muſt take
him up, muſt ſmooth and dreſs him over, and according to its
Etymon, muſt <hi>religare,</hi> ſwathe and bind up this looſe piece of
fleſh, muſt animate and inform him, muſt reduce him to ſome ſet
form of Chriſtianity, or elſe he is likely after a long and fruitleſs

be any but a Gentile, who hath abandoned all love, all awe, all
fear, all care of God (any one of which would much contract
and draw him into compaſs) who hath utterly put off every garb
of a Chriſtian, who hath enjoy'd the reins ſo long, that now he is

The <hi>Heathen</hi> are noted not ſo much that they worſhipt <hi>no God</hi>

cringe which we make to any creature, is the wooing and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of an Image at beſt, in plain terms of an Idol, nothing.
What degree then of Idolatry have they attained to, who every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of their lives bow down and worſhip, make it their trade and
calling for ever to be a ſolliciting ſome pleaſure or other? Some
exquiſite piece of ſenſuality to bleſs and make them happy, which
have no other ſhrines to ſet up, but only to their own luſt, to which
they do ſo crouch, and creep, and crawl, that they are never able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſtand up right again: like thoſe trees which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> talk of,
which by bowing to our <hi>Ladies houſe,</hi> when in walks by the wood
toward <hi>Loretto,</hi> have ever ſince ſtood ſtooping. Thus do you ſee
how the latter part of my Text hath overtook the former: the
<hi>walking</hi> after his own <hi>luſts,</hi> becomes a <hi>ſcoffer,</hi> the <hi>licentious</hi> man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and that with eaſe, his very voluptuous life is a kind
of Atheiſm, and the reaſons of this are obvious, you need not ſeek
or ſearch far for them.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> this <hi>walking</hi> in their own luſts, notes <hi>an habit</hi> gathered
out of many acts: he hath walked there a long while, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now hath the skill of it, walks on confidently, and careleſly
without any rub or thought of ſtopping. And contrary to this
the worſhip of God, of which Atheiſm is a privation, is an
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47754:146"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> holy, religious habit of Piety and Obedience. Now we know
two contrary habits cannot conſiſt or be together in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
An <hi>habit</hi> and its oppoſite <hi>privation</hi> are <hi>incompetible,</hi> light, and
darkneſs at the ſame time, though they may ſeem to meet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as in twilight: but for two oppoſite <hi>poſitive habits,</hi> never any
mans conceit was ſo bold or phantaſtical as to joyn them: you
cannot imagine one, but you muſt remove the other. You may
ſuppoſe a man diſtempered or <hi>weak,</hi> which is a privation of health,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and yet ſuppoſe him pretty <hi>healthy,</hi> as long as his natural ſtrength
is able to overcome it; but can you ſuppoſe a man in a violent
<hi>feaver</hi> actually upon him, and yet ſtill imagine him in perfect
health? Thus is it with a ſinner, who hath given himſelf over
to the tyranny, and impotency of his luſts, he hath utterly put off
all degrees, all ſparks of any habit of Religion, according to that
of our Saviour, <hi>You cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> where <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſignifying in a vaſt extent the god of this World, imports all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> luſts, all earthly vanities, which any habituate ſinner deifies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every <hi>habit</hi> notes a <hi>delight,</hi> an acquieſcence, and joy
in enjoying of that which through many actions, perhaps ſome
brunts and rubs he hath at laſt arrived to. Now this delight and
contentation, that is may be compleat, is impatient of any other
incumbrance, which at any time may come in to interrupt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
it. If any thing ſo happen, 'tis never quiet, till it have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
it. The <hi>Scholar</hi> that hath all his life laboured, and at laſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> attained to ſome habit of knowledge, and then reſolves to enjoy
the happineſs and fruits of learning, in the quiet and reſt of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>contemplation,</hi> is impatient if any piece of ignorance croſs
or thwart him in his walk, he'l to his books again, and never reſt
till he hath overcome and turned it out. Thus doth the <hi>ſenſual
man</hi> being come to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and pitch, and enter'd into the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi>
of his worldly joys, if he do but meet with any jar, if he
feel any pluck or twinge from his conſcience, any grudge or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the ſpirit within him, any ſpark or heat, or warmth
of religious fear in his breaſt, he'l never reſt till he hath aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
it, he is impatient of ſuch a qualm of godlineſs, he muſt
needs put it over, he is ſick at heart till he hath diſgorged himſelf
of this choler, and then returns ſecurely godleſs to his walk,
having baniſhed <hi>God out of all his thoughts.</hi> Thus ſhall you ſee
the Atheiſt on his humor, for want of ſome compunction at
hone, grumble at every godly man or action which they ſaw in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the ſtreet.<note place="margin">Wiſd. II. 14.</note> In the 2. of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> at the 14. <hi>He is grievous unto us to

to their content, they are not pleaſed again till they have gotten
him into their <hi>inquiſition,</hi> to examine him with deſpitefulneſs
and torture, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. Thus do they abhor and ſtifle, and ſtrangle
every godly action in others, or motion in themſelves, becauſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47754:147"/>
the holineſs of the one is an exprobration to their prophaneneſs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and the other was a pang of conſcience, made as it were on
purpoſe by God to reprove their thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This <hi>walking</hi> in the Text, though it be with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet it is a ſlow one, a kind of walking in ones <hi>ſleep,</hi> or that
of a <hi>melancholy man,</hi> that can walk till he be wet through, and
not mark that it rained. I ſay, it notes here an heavy, drowſie,
unactive habit expreſt by the Pſalmiſt by ſitting in a <hi>chair,</hi> as
we ſhewed you: it notes a kind of churliſh reſoluteneſs, to walk <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
on whatever come in his way; he is grown even a paſſive to his
luſts, he doth not ſo much <hi>act</hi> as <hi>ſuffer</hi> them, he walks on ſnorting
in his road, do what you can, you ſhall neither turn nor wake
him. Now this ſlow, drowſie, unactive habit begets a kind of
numbneſs in him, a ſluggiſh, ſullen ſtupidity over all his faculties, that
even a ſpur or goad cannot rouze him; all the pores as it were
and paſſages, and entries to the ſoul are ſo ſtopped, and bung'd
up, all his affections are grown ſo groſs and brawny, ſo hardned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and incraſſate, that no air or breath from Heaven can pierce it.
He that tells him of <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> is as he that <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>
one from a ſound <hi>ſleep:</hi> he that telleth ſuch a fool a tale of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
ſpeaketh to one in a <hi>ſlumber, and when he hath told his tale,
he will ſay, What is the matter?</hi> Ecclus. xxii. 8. Thus do you
ſee, 1. The repugnance and inconſiſtence of a voluptuous life and
Religion, 2. The delight, 3. The ſtupidity of this habit. Each
of which have made a place for the <hi>Libertine,</hi> and ſet him in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
chair of the ſcorner. And all this while me thinks I have but
talkt to your <hi>ears:</hi> Now that your <hi>hearts</hi> and affections may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the ſound, that the ſofter waxy part of you, may receive ſome
impreſſion from this diſcourſe, let us cloſe all with an <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt from the <hi>guilt</hi> and dangerous condition of a <hi>licentious
life,</hi> to <hi>labour</hi> by all means poſſible to <hi>keep out of it.</hi> He that is
once engaged in it, goes on with a great deal of content, and in
the midſt of his pleaſures on the one ſide, and carnal ſecurity on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the other, his <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Senſes</hi> are lull'd into
a <hi>lethargy,</hi> nay the very <hi>phancy</hi> in him is aſleep, which in other
ſleeps is moſt active: he never imagines, never dreams of any
<hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>danger,</hi> either <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Devil.</hi> O what a lamentable
woful eſtate is it to be thus ſick beyond a ſenſe of our diſeaſe, to
be ſo near a ſpiritual death, and not ſo much as feel our weakneſs!
Oh what an horrid thing it were to paſs away in ſuch a ſleep, and
never obſerve our ſelves near death, till Satan hath arreſted beyond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
bail, to ſleep on and ſnort, as men without dread or danger, ill
the torments of Hell ſhould awake us! You cannot imagine how
eaſie a thing it is for an habituate ſinner to fall into the Devils pavs,
before he thinks of it, as a melancholy man walking in the dark
may be drowned in a pit, and no man hear him complain that he
is faln.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:47754:147"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Again, We are wont to ſay that <hi>cuſtom</hi> is another <hi>nature,</hi> and
thoſe things which we have brought our ſelves up to, we can as
ill put off, as our <hi>conſtitution,</hi> or diſpoſition. Now thoſe things
which ſpring from the nature of any thing, are inſeparable from
the ſubject; baniſh them as oft as you will, <hi>uſque recurrent,</hi> they
will return again as to their home, they cannot ſubſiſt any where
elſe, they dwell there. So <hi>wallowing</hi> in the <hi>mire</hi> being a condition
natural to the <hi>Swine,</hi> can never be extorted from them: waſh
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them, rinſe them, purge them with <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> as ſoon as ever they
meet with mire again, they will into it. Their ſwiniſh nature hath
ſuch an influence on them, that all care or art cannot forbid, or
hinder this effect of it. So that a cuſtomary ſinner, who hath as
it were made luſt a part of his nature, hath incorporated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs,
and grafted it into his affections, can as hardly be
rid of it, as a ſubject of his property; 'tis poſſible for fear, or
want of opportunity ſometime to keep him in, and make him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the <hi>load-ſtone</hi> may lye quiet, whilſt no <hi>iron</hi> is within ken, or
it may be held by <hi>force</hi> in its preſence; but give it materials and
leave to work, and it draws incontinently. So for all his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<hi>forbearance,</hi> upon ſome either policy or neceſſity, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate
<hi>ſinner</hi> hath not yet given over his habit. Leave him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
give him room and opportunity, and he will hold no longer.
If he be once advanced to this pitch of ſin to be walking after his
own <hi>luſts,</hi> he may poſſibly be driven back with a <hi>ſtorm,</hi> or <hi>thunder:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but he will hardly give over his walk, he'l forward again as ſoon
as ever the <hi>tempeſt</hi> is over. Nay farther, even when he wants
objects and opportunities, he will yet ſhew his condition, he will
betray the deſire and good affection he bears to his old luſts; his
diſcourſe or faſhions argue him incontinently bent, even when
he is at the ſtancheſt. As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves of the fearful man,
that even when no formidable object is near, he falls into many
frights: ſo the <hi>voluptuous</hi> mans phancy is perpetually poſſeſt with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the meditation of his own ways, when ſome diſeaſe or neceſſity
will not let him walk. In brief, unleſs this <hi>ſecond nature</hi> be quite
taken out of him, and another holy ſpiritual nature created in its
room, unleſs a ſtronger come and bind this <hi>Devil</hi> and diſpoſſeſs
him of it, he hath ſmall hopes of getting himſelf out of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and tyranny: there is a great deal more ſtir in the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one cuſtomary ſinner, then of a thouſand others, 'tis not to
be accompliſhed without a kind of death, and reſurrection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> a new Creation of another nature. So that (if we ſhould
judge of Gods actions by our own) the Spirit ſhould ſeem to be
put to more pains and trouble with this one habituate, then in the
ordinary buſineſs of converting many a tamer ſinner. This is
enough by the <hi>deſperateneſs</hi> of the <hi>cure</hi> to move you to ſtudy ſome
art, ſome phyſick of <hi>prevention,</hi> leſt when it is grown upon you,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47754:148"/>
it be too late to enquire for remedies. How ſhould we dare to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
entertain and naturalize ſuch an evil ſpirit within us, which if
ever he be raviſht out of us again, cannot without tearing, and
torturing, and rending even our whole nature in pieces? If we
muſt needs be ſinful, yet let us keep within a moderation, let us
not ſo follow the <hi>Devils</hi> works, as to <hi>tranſubſtantiate</hi> our ſelves
into his <hi>nature;</hi> let us not put off our manhood with our integrity,
and though we cannot be <hi>Saints,</hi> let us keep our ſelves <hi>men?</hi> 'Tis
a degree of innocence not to be extreamly wicked, and a piece <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of godlineſs not to be Atheiſts. Our luſt is an infinite thing, ſaid
a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi>(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Iambl.</hi>) and he that walks
after it hath an <hi>endleſs journey:</hi> there is no hope that he that hath
ſo far to go, will ever have leiſure to ſit ſtill. And therefore
I ſay if we muſt needs ſin, yet let us not engage our ſelves to ſin
for ever: if our being <hi>men</hi> lays a neceſſity of ſinning on us, let our
care to ſtay whilſt it is poſſible for us, prove that we do not ſin
like <hi>Devils,</hi> whoſe ſin is their glory, and their reſolution peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
never to give over ſinning; and ſo may ours ſeem, and in
all likelihood prove to be, if we give our ſelves liberty to <hi>walk
after our own luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If our luſts be ſuch <hi>dangerous</hi> paths to walk in, and
this in that very reſpect as they are our <hi>own</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Gods
commands,</hi> if they are the ſtraight direct way to Atheiſm, nay
Atheiſm it ſelf: then what care and circumſpection is required
at every ſetting down of our feet, at every entrance on any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
leſt there be a <hi>Serpent</hi> in the way, ſome piece of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in every enterprize we enter on of our ſelves? How ought we
to fear, to ſuſpect, and balk any way that is our own? For
where it is Atheiſm to walk, there ſurely 'tis a ſin to tread: and
where we have once ventured to tread, we ſhall be ſhrewdly
tempted to walk; every ſtep we have ſafely taken being an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to a ſecond. <hi>Verebar omnia opera mea,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> I feared
all my works: whatever action I could entitle my ſelf to, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
there was ſome danger in it, I was afraid it was not right
as it ſhould be, I ſhould never be able to juſtifie it. This is an
excellent <hi>trial</hi> of all our ſerious deliberate <hi>actions,</hi> to mark whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are our <hi>own</hi> or no, whether we went about them on our
own heads, without our warrant or directions from God: if we
did, 'tis much to be doubted there is ſome <hi>poyſon,</hi> ſome guilt in
them, ſomething that deſerves to be feared, and fled from. This
very ſuſpecting of our own ways, will alien us from our own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
luſts, will bend us nearer to God, and never ſuffer us to dare to
venture where he hath not ſecured us; will joyn us as it were in
an engine to God himſelf, where the lower wheels never begin
to move without the example and government of the higher. If
you can but perſwade your ſelf to fear your own ways, 'twill be
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47754:148"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a good ſtop of your progreſs to Atheiſm. I am confident the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
will never get you to walk in your own luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If <hi>walking</hi> in our own luſts be direct <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> what ſhall
we think of them who make it a piece of <hi>Religion,</hi> and holy policy
to do ſo? <hi>Beloved,</hi> there be ſome learned <hi>Catechiſed Atheiſts,</hi> who
upon confidence of an abſolute eternal <hi>predeſtination</hi> of every man
in the world that ſhall ever poſſibly be ſaved, ſet up their reſt
there, and expect what God will do with them. 'Tis to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to hope <hi>God</hi> will alter the <hi>decree,</hi> they are reſolved to leave
all to God, and if they periſh, they periſh. Mark with me, is
not this a religious Atheiſm to attribute ſo much to God as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
careleſs of him, ſo to depend as never to think on him, and
by granting his decree in our underſtanding, to deny his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in our converſation? He that lives negligently on confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that his care may be ſpared, that if there be any <hi>ſalvation</hi>
for him, God will <hi>work it out</hi> without his <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>trembling:</hi> he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that believes Gods <hi>election</hi> ſo <hi>abſolute,</hi> that himſelf hath nothing to
do in the buſineſs, whilſt he expects <hi>mercy,</hi> makes himſelf <hi>uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of it, and though he acknowledge a <hi>reſurrection,</hi> lives as though
he looked to be <hi>annihilated.</hi> Certainly he that expects God ſhould
ſend him a fruitful <hi>harveſt,</hi> will himſelf <hi>manure</hi> the ground; he
that <hi>hopes,</hi> will <hi>labour,</hi> according to that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 3. <hi>He that
hath this hope in him purifies himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. So that whoſoever relyes
on God for ſalvation, and in the midſt of his hopes ſtands idle,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and walks after his own luſts, by his very actions confutes his
thoughts, and will not in a manner ſuffer God to have elected him,
by going on in ſuch reprobate courſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If it be this confident <hi>walking</hi> after our own <hi>luſts,</hi> which
is here the expreſſion of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> then here's a <hi>comfort</hi> for ſome
fearful ſinners, who finding themſelves not yet taken up quite
from a licentious life, ſuſpect, and would be in danger to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of themſelves as <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> 'Tis a bleſſed tenderneſs to feel
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> every ſin in our ſelves at the greateſt advantage; to aggravate and
repreſent it to our conſcience in the horridſt ſhape, but there
is a care alſo to be had, that we give not our ſelves over as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
<hi>Cain</hi> ly'd when he ſaid his ſin was greater then could be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
born or forgiven. When the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have given one over,

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Philop. 1. de an.</note> 
               <hi>nature hath its ſpring and plunge,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
quits and <hi>overcomes the diſeaſe.</hi> If thou art in this dangerous
walk, and ſtriveſt and heaveſt, and canſt not get out of it, yet
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſorrow not as one without hope: this very regret and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
this ſtriving and plunging is a good ſymptome. If thou wilt
continue with a good courage, and ſet thy ſelf to it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
be confident thou ſhalt overcome the difficulty. If this
<hi>ſin</hi> be a <hi>walking,</hi> then every <hi>ſtop</hi> is a <hi>ceſſation,</hi> every check a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to integrity, every godly thought or deſire a pawn from God
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47754:149"/>
that he will give thee ſtrength to victory: and if thou do but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and cheriſh every ſuch reluctancy, every ſuch gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thy ſelf, thou maiſt with courage expect a gracious calm

<hi>labour,</hi> and <hi>endeavour,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> that we may be <hi>looſed</hi> from theſe
toyls and gins, and engagements of our own <hi>luſts,</hi> and being

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to you for the clearing of my Text. For this whole verſe at the firſt
view ſeems only a meer <hi>Theſis</hi> or point of belief, that Chriſt came into
the world to ſave ſinners, illuſtrated and applied by the ſpeaker as
one, and the chief of the number of thoſe ſinners to be ſaved. But
it contains a moſt Rhetorical powerful <hi>Exhortation</hi> to both <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>
and <hi>Will;</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> this faithful ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt came,</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:47754:150"/>
&amp;c. and to <hi>accept,</hi> lay hold of, and with all our might to embrace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and apply to each of our ſelves this great mercy, toward this great
ſalvation beſtowed on ſinners, who can with humility confeſs
their ſins, and with faith lay hold on the promiſe. And this is the
buſineſs of the Verſe, and the plain matter of this obſcure double
Exhortation to every mans <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> that he <hi>believe</hi> that
Chriſt, &amp;c. to every mans <hi>affections,</hi> that he <hi>humble himſelf,</hi> and
teach his heart, and that his tongue to <hi>confeſs,</hi> Of all ſinners, &amp;c.
This Text ſhall not be divided into parts (which were to diſorder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and diſtract the ſignificancy of a Propoſition) but into ſeveral
conſiderations; for ſo it is to be conceived either abſolutely as a
<hi>profeſſion</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf, and there we will enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and how <hi>Paul</hi> was the chief of all ſinners. Secondly, <hi>reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
to us,</hi> for whom this form of confeſſing the ſtate and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſalvation of ſinners to our ſelves is ſet down. And firſt,
whether and how <hi>Paul</hi> was the chief of all ſinners, where we are
to read him in a double eſtate, <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>unconverted,</hi> expreſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to us by his double name <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Saul, Paul</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>Saul</hi> a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> mad againſt the Chriſtians; and that
both theſe eſtates may be contained in the Text, although penn'd
by <hi>Paul</hi> regenerated, may appear, in that the Pronoun <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> I, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the whole compleat perſon of <hi>Paul,</hi> reſtrains not the
ſpeech to his preſent being only, but conſiders alſo what he had
been; more eſpecially ſet down at the 13. verſe, <hi>Who was before a
blaſphemer,</hi> &amp;c. So then <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Saul</hi>-ſhip being ablaſphemer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a perſecuter and injurious, and in ſum, a moſt violent, perverſe,
malicious unbeliever, was a chief ſinner, rankt in the front of the
Devils army; and this needs no further proof or illuſtration.
Yet ſeeing that that age of the world had brought forth many
other of the ſame ſtrain of violent unbelief, nothing inferiour to
<hi>Saul,</hi> as may appear by thoſe many that were guilty of Chriſts
death (as <hi>Saul</hi> in perſon was not) and thoſe that ſo madly ſtoned
St. <hi>Stephen</hi> whilſt <hi>Saul</hi> only <hi>kept the witneſſes clothes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts VII. 58.</note> and as the Text <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſpeaks, <hi>was conſenting unto his death;</hi> ſeeing, I ſay, that others of
that age equalled, if not exceeded <hi>Sauls</hi> guilt, how can he be ſaid
above all other ſinners to be the chief. I think we ſhall not wreſt
or enlarge the Text beſide or beyond the meaning of the Holy
Ghoſt or Apoſtle, if in anſwer unto this we ſay that here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not ſo much the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>ſins</hi> above all ſinners in the
world, but the greatneſs of the <hi>miracle</hi> in converting ſo great a
ſinner into ſo great a Saint and Apoſtle. So that the words ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
run, Of all ſinners that Chriſt came into the world to ſave, and
then prefer to ſuch an eminence, I am the chief, or as the word
primarily ſignifies <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I am the firſt, <hi>i. e. Paul</hi> was the
chief of all converts, and <hi>Paul</hi> was the firſt, that from ſo great a
perſecuter of Chriſt was changed into ſo great, ſo glorious an
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47754:150"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Apoſtle. For ſo it follows in the verſes next after my Text, <hi>For
this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt Chriſt Jeſus might ſhew
forth all long ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. The iſſue of all is this, that <hi>Saul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
was a very great ſinner, yet not the greateſt of ſinners
abſolutely, but for ought we read in the New Teſtament, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and firſt that was called from ſuch a degree of infidelity; a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,
a perſecuter, to ſo high a pitch of ſalvation, a Saint, an
Apoſtle, yea, and greater then an Apoſtle; whence the <hi>obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is, that though <hi>Saul</hi> were, yet every blaſphemous ſinner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect to be called from the depth of ſin to regeneracy and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Although <hi>Saul</hi> being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the chief of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
was called and ſaved; yet <hi>Saul</hi> was alſo in another ſenſe, for
ought we read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and perhaps the laſt that from ſo great a riot
of ſin obtained ſo great ſalvation. Wherefore, O ſinner, be not
preſumptuous from <hi>Pauls</hi> example, but from <hi>Pauls</hi> ſingle example
begin to ſuſpect thy ſtate, and fear that ſuch a miracle of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhall not be afforded thee. There hath been an opinion of late
reviv'd, perhaps original among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is the more likely object of Gods mercy, or ſubject of his grace
then the mere moral man, whom either natural fear, or the like,
not ſpiritual reſpects hath reſtrained from thoſe out-rages of ſin.
The being of this opinion in the primitive Romans, and the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it is ſufficiently prov'd by that expoſtulation of St. <hi>Paul,
Shall we continue in ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. VI. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that grace may abound? God forbid.</hi> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to ſome, who, hearing that Chriſt came into the world to
ſave ſinners, thought that the exceſs of <hi>ſin</hi> was the beſt <hi>qualification,</hi>
and only motive to provoke and deſerve a more abundant <hi>grace</hi>
and certain <hi>ſalvation.</hi> As if that ſpirit which once to manifeſt its
power called <hi>Saul</hi> in the midſt of his madneſs breathing out
threatnings and ſlaughters againſt the Church, would not call any
but thoſe who had prepared themſelves by the ſame degree of
madneſs, but required that men ſhould make themſelves almoſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Devils</hi> that they might be called into <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as if that <hi>God</hi>
which could out of <hi>ſtones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John XI. 39.</note> could not alſo out of <hi>men</hi> raiſe up <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto Abraham;</hi> as if that Chriſt which raiſed up <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
being dead four dayes, and as they thought ſtinking in his grave,
could not as eaſily have heal'd him whilſt he was yet <hi>alive:</hi> whereas
we read that Chriſt dealt more on the <hi>cures</hi> of the impotent, then
<hi>reſurrections</hi> of the dead; that is in a ſpiritual application heal'd
more from the bed of languiſhment, of their weakneſſes and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> then he raiſed out of the graves of treſpaſſes and ſins, though
ſome alſo hath he out of death quickned to exalt the power and
miracle of his mercy. Yet hath not this doctrine too, been moſt
confidently maintained among ſome of our times? That there is
more hope of the <hi>debauch'd</hi> man, that he ſhall be called or ſaved,
then of the mere <hi>moral, honeſt</hi> man, who yet is in the ſtate of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47754:151"/>
Have not ſome men defining this <hi>moral</hi> man by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>hypocrite</hi> ſet him in the greateſt oppoſition to Heaven? As if
that degree of innocence, or rather not being extremely ſinful,
which a moral care of our wayes may beſtow on us, were a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hindrance then promotion toward the ſtate of grace, and the
natural man were ſo much the further from <hi>God,</hi> the nearer he were
to <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and no man could hope to come to <hi>Heaven</hi> but he that
had knockt at <hi>Hell</hi> gates. I confeſs indeed that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
where he means to inhabit hath no need of pains to prepare him a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
room, but can at his firſt knock open and cleanſe, adorn and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the moſt uncouth, ugly, and unſavory heart in the world.
That omnipotent convincing <hi>Spirit</hi> can at the ſame inſtant <hi>ſtrike</hi>
the moſt obdurate heart, and ſoften it, and where it once enters
cannot be repuls'd by the moſt ſturdy habituate ſin, or Deval. I
confeſs likewiſe, that ſome have been thus rather <hi>ſnatch'd</hi> then
call'd, like the <hi>fire-brands</hi> out of the <hi>fire,</hi> and by an extaſie of the
Spirit inwardly in a minute chang'd from incarnate Devils into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Saint. So was <hi>Mary</hi> diſpoſſeſt of ſeven Devils, who was
after ſo highly promoted in Chriſts favour, that ſhe had the honor
to be the firſt <hi>witneſs</hi> of the reſurrection.<note place="margin">Mark XVI. 9.</note> So that <hi>Gadarene</hi> who
had intrencht and fortified himſelf among the Tombs, and was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon'd
with an army of Devils, ſo that he brake fetters and chains,
and could not be tam'd or kept in any compaſs, yet in a minute at
Chriſts word ſent forth a legion of Fiends ſufficient to people and
deſtroy a Colony of Swine. And ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> in my Text, in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
minute at Chriſts call delivered of a multitude of blaſphemous
malicious <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and ſtraight became the joy of <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
of the Gentiles.</hi> Yet mean time, theſe miraculous, but rarer
examples muſt not preſcribe and ſet up, muſt not become a rule and
encourage any one to <hi>Sauls</hi> madneſs on confidence of <hi>Pauls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
to a more impetuous courſe of ſinning, that he may become
a more glorious Saints. 'Tis a wrong way to Heaven to dig into
the deep, and a brutiſh arrogance to hope that God will the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
eagerly woo us, the further our ſins have divorc't us from him. If
ſome (as hath been ſaid) have been caught or ſtrucken in the
height of their rebellions, or in the fulneſs of the evil ſpirit
called to a wane (as diſeaſes in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or top-pitch, are wont
to decay and weaken into health again) if there have been ſome
of theſe, as my <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> rais'd from the depth of ſin, as <hi>Lazarus</hi>
from the ſtench of the grave, yet theſe in reſpect of others more
ſoftly and ordinarily called, are found few in number; and ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
as were appointed for the miracles as well as the objects of Gods
mercy. Hence it is, that a ſtrange diſorder hath moſt times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
this extraordinary converſion of more violent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
ſinners. Our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (to go no farther) was to be caſt
into a <hi>trance,</hi> and his regeneration not to be accompliſht without a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47754:151"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> kind of death and reſurrection, whereas others who are better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
qualified, or rather are leſs hardned in the ſins of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
do anſwer at the ſofteſt knock or whiſpering'ſt call of the
Spirit, and at his becken will come after him. More might be ſaid
of this point, how St. <hi>Paul</hi> was moſt notably converted; that he
had the alleviation of <hi>ignorance,</hi> for which cauſe (as he ſayes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
he <hi>found mercy,</hi> and that others are not probably to expect
the like miracle, who have not thoſe inſuperable prepoſſeſſions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from <hi>cuſtom</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> but that this is not the buſineſs of the Text,
but a <hi>praecognoſcendum</hi> or paſſage to the clearing of it. Briefly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to conclude this note, <hi>Paul</hi> is the chief <hi>example</hi> mentioned in
Scripture, and there be not many, though ſome more, that were
called from the height of impiety, from the gall of bitterneſs, to
this myſtical third Heaven, or ſo high degree of Saint and Apoſtle.
The more ordinary courſe of Gods proceeding (if we may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
judge of the Decree by events and examples) is to call ſuch
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the ſtate of grace, and ſo conſequently of glory, who have
paſſed their unregeneracy moſt innocently, and kept themſelves
leaſt polluted from the ſtains of habituate wickedneſs, that is, have
lived as much as natural men can do, in the plaineſt, honeſteſt
courſe of morality, it being preſuppoſed that among all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
vertues they have purchaſed <hi>humility,</hi> the beſt (if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>preparative</hi>) for the receiving of <hi>grace.</hi> Mean while we are
not to be miſtaken, as if we thought <hi>Gods purpoſes</hi> tyed to <hi>mans
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> good behaviour,</hi> or mans moral goodneſs to woo and allure Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as that the Almighty is not equally able to ſanctifie the fouleſt
ſoul by his converting grace, and the leſs polluted, or that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
mans preparation: but our <hi>poſition</hi> is, that in ordinary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
reaſon we ought to judge more comfortably, and hope more
confidently of a meer moral man naturally more careful of his
wayes, that he ſhall be both called and ſaved, that God will with
his Spirit perfect and crown his morally good, though imperfect
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> endeavours, then of another more debauch't ſinner utterly negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the commands of either God or Nature. Which <hi>poſition</hi> I
have in brief proved, though nothing ſo largely as I might, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of them who do utterly condemn unregenerate <hi>morality,</hi>
and deject it below the loweſt degree of <hi>prophaneneſs,</hi> as if they
would teach a man his way to Heaven by boaſting <hi>arrogantly,</hi> what
<hi>Paul</hi> converted confeſſes <hi>humbly,</hi> I am the nearer to Chriſts Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
becauſe of all ſinners I am the chief. The <hi>Uſe</hi> in brief
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of this <hi>Theſis</hi> ſhall be for thoſe who not as yet find the power of
the regenerating ſpirit in them (for I am to fear many of my <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi>
may be in this caſe, and I pray God they feel, and work,
and pray themſelves out of it) the Uſe, I ſay, is for thoſe who
are not yet full poſſeſſors of the ſpirit, to labour to keep their
<hi>unregeneracy</hi> ſpotleſs from the <hi>greater offence,</hi> that if they are not yet
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47754:152"/>
called to the preferment of <hi>Converts</hi> and Saints, the ſecond part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Heaven, that earthly <hi>City of God,</hi> that yet they will live orderly in
that lower regiment, wherein they yet remain, and be ſubject to
the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> till it ſhall pleaſe God to take them into a new
Common-wealth under the <hi>law of grace,</hi> to improve their natural
abilities to the height, and bind their hands and hearts from the
practice and ſtudy of outragious ſins, by thoſe ordinary reſtraints
which nature will afford us; ſuch as are a <hi>good diſpoſition, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and the like; not to leave and refer all to the miraculous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
working of God, and to encreaſe our ſins for the magnifying of
the vertue in recalling us. <hi>God</hi> requires not this <hi>glory</hi> at our hands
that we ſhould peremptorily over-damn our ſelves, that he may
be the more honoured in ſaving us. His mercy is more known to
the world then to need this woful foil to illuſtrate it. God is not
wont to rake Hell for converts, to gather Devils to make Saints
of; the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> would ſuffer great <hi>violence,</hi> if only ſuch
ſhould take it. If <hi>Saul</hi> were infinitely ſinful before he proved an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Apoſtle (though by the way we hear him profeſs,<note place="margin">Acts XXIII. 1.</note> he had lived in
all good conſcience) yet expect not thou the ſame miracle, nor
think that the exceſs of ſins is the cue that God ordinarily takes to
convert us. The <hi>Fathers</hi> in an obedience to the diſcipline and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogy
of the old Law poſſeſt their ſoule in patience, expecting
the prophecied approach of the new, did not by a contempt of
<hi>Moſes</hi> precipitate and haſten the coming of the <hi>Meſſias. Cornelius</hi>
liv'd a long while devoutly,<note place="margin">Acts X. i.</note> and gave much alms, till at laſt God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
call'd him, and put him in a courſe to become a Chriſtian: and do
thou, if thou art not yet called, wait the Lords leiſure in a ſober
moral converſation, and fright not him from thee with unnatural
abominations. God is not likely to be wooed by thoſe courſes
which nature loaths, or to accept them whom the world is aſhamed
of. In brief, remember <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Cornelius; Saul,</hi> that he, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
were called from a profeſt blaſphemer; <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that before
he was called, he prayed to God alway: and do thou endeavour to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
deſerve the like mercy, and then in thy prayer confeſs thine unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
and petition <hi>grace,</hi> as grace, that is not as our <hi>merit,</hi> but
as his free-will <hi>favour,</hi> not as the deſert of our morality, but a
ſtream from the bounty of his mercy, who (we may hope) will
crown his common graces with the fulneſs of his Spirit. And now,
O powerful <hi>God,</hi> on thoſe of us which are yet unregenerate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
thy reſtraining grace, which may curb and ſtop our natural
inordinacy, and by a ſober, careful, continent life, prepare us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
to a better capability of thy ſanctifying Spirit, wherewith in good
time thou ſhalt eſtabliſh and ſeal us up to the day of redemption.
And thus much concerning <hi>Saul</hi> unconverted, how of all ſinners
he was the chief, not abſolutely, that he ſurpaſſed the whole world
in rankneſs of ſin, but reſpectively to his later ſtate, that few or
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47754:152"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> none are read to have been tranſlated from ſuch a pitch of ſin to
Saint-ſhip. Now follows the ſecond conſideration of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proceeded <hi>Paul, i. e.</hi> converted, and then the queſtion is,
Whether, and how <hi>Paul</hi> converted may be ſaid the chief of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>'Twere too ſpeculative a depth for a popular Sermon to diſcuſs
the inherence and condition of ſin in the regenerate; the buſineſs
will be brought home more profitably to our practice, if we drive
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it to this iſſue, That <hi>Paul</hi> in this place intending by his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to direct others how to believe the truth, and embrace, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
on the efficacy of Chriſts Incarnation, hath no better motive
to incite himſelf and others toward it, then a recognition of his
ſins, that is, a ſurvey of the power of ſin in him before, and a ſenſe
of the relicks of ſin in him ſince his converſion. Whence the note
is, That the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of ones <hi>ſins</hi> makes the <hi>regenerate</hi> man apply
himſelf more fiercely to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>faithful ſaying</hi> was therefore
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to <hi>Paul worthy of all acceptation,</hi> becauſe of all ſinners he was the
chief. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as every <hi>regenerate man,</hi> is to be obſerved in a
<hi>treble poſture,</hi> either caſting his eyes backward, or calling them in
upon himſelf, or elſe looking forward and aloof; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be conceived in a treble meditation, either of his <hi>life paſt,</hi>
or <hi>preſent ſtate,</hi> or <hi>future hopes.</hi> In the firſt poſture and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you may ſee firſt <hi>Paul</hi> alone, who was before a blaſphemer, a
perſecuter and injurious; ſecondly, all the regenerate together:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For when we were in the fleſh the motions of ſin did work in our
members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many the like. In the ſecond poſture and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation

carriages of the regenerate man fully prove our obſervation: for
if either of the two former ſights could afford him any content; if
either his former or preſent ſtate did not ſufficiently terrifie him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he would not be ſo eager on the third, it being the folly of humane

that redeem'd him from ſo poor a guilt; if he could obſerve in his
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47754:153"/>
preſent ſtate any natural firmneſs or ſtability, any inherent purity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
any eſſential juſtice, he might poſſibly <hi>ſacrifice to his</hi> own <hi>nets,</hi> and
reckoning himſelf in perfect peace with God, neither invoke and
ſeek, nor acknowledge a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> But when in his <hi>former life</hi>
he ſhall find nothing but the matter and cauſe of <hi>horrour</hi> and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nothing but hideous ghaſtly affrightments, yea, and a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of damnation: when in hope to mend himſelf, and eaſe his fears,
he ſhall fly to the comfort of his <hi>preſent</hi> converted <hi>ſtate,</hi> and yet
there alſo eſpy many thorns of <hi>temptations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. XII. 7.</note> how can he but be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
frighted out of himſelf? How can he but fly from the ſcene of
thoſe his torments, and ſeek out and importune the mercy of a
Saviour, which may deliver him out of all his fears? After the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in my Text, where he does more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
apprehend Chriſt, and more bodily believe, <hi>That he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world to ſave ſinners, becauſe of all ſinners he was chief,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his own ſinfulneſs (being the object and external motive of
Gods mercy) an argument and internal motive of his own faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and confidence.<note place="margin">I.</note> The plain meaning of this <hi>Theſis</hi> is, that among
men things are not alway <hi>valued</hi> according to the <hi>merit</hi> of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for then each commodity ſhould be equally prized by all
men, and the man in health ſhould beſtow as much charges on phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
as the diſeaſed: but each thing bears its ſeveral eſtimation by
its <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> and the riches of every merchandize is encreaſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as men to whom it is proferred do either uſe or want it.
Moreover, this <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> is not to be reckoned of according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>truth,</hi> but <hi>opinion,</hi> not according to mens real wants, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſenſe which they have of their wants; ſo a man <hi>diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
becauſe he hath not ſo much reaſon about him as to obſerve
his diſeaſe, will contemn <hi>Hellebore,</hi> or any other the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>Recipe</hi> for this cure: and generally no man will haſten to the
<hi>Phyſician,</hi> or juſtly value his art and drugs, but he whom miſery
hath taught the uſe of them. So then unleſs a man have been in ſome
ſpiritual danger, and by the converting Spirit be inſtructed into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
a ſenſe and apprehenſion of it, he will not ſufficiently obſerve the
benefit and uſe of a deliverer: unleſs he feel in himſelf ſome ſtings
of the relicks of his ſin, ſome pricks of the remaining <hi>Amorite,</hi> he
will not take notice of the want and neceſſity which he hath of
<hi>Chriſts</hi> mediation. But when he ſhall with a tenderneſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ſurvey the guilt of his former ſtate, from the <hi>imputation,</hi> not
<hi>importunity</hi> whereof he is now <hi>juſtified,</hi> when he ſhall ſtill feel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him <hi>the buffetings of Satan,</hi> and ſenſibly obſerve himſelf not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <hi>ſanctified,</hi> then, and not before, will he with a zealous earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
apprehend the profit, yea, neceſſity of a Saviour, whoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
ſo nearly concerns him.<note place="margin">II.</note> The <hi>ſecond</hi> ground of this poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, That an extraordinary undeſerved <hi>deliverance</hi> is by an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
man received with ſome <hi>ſuſpition:</hi> the conſideration of the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47754:153"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the benefit makes him doubt of the <hi>truth</hi> of it, and he
will ſcarce believe ſo important an happineſs befaln him, becauſe
his miſery could neither expect nor hope it. Hence upon the firſt
notice of it he deſires to aſcertain it unto his ſenſe, by a ſudden
poſſeſſion of it, and not at all to defer the enjoying of that mercy
which his former miſery made infinitely <hi>worthy of all acceptation.</hi>
Thus may you ſee a <hi>ſhip-wrackt</hi> man recovered to ſome refuge, cling
about, and almoſt <hi>incorporate</hi> himſelf unto it, becauſe the fortune
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of his life depends on that ſuccour. The new <hi>regenerate</hi> man find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Scripture the promiſe of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> which ſhall free
him from thoſe engagements which his former bankrupt eſtate had
plung'd him in, cannot delay ſo great an happineſs, but with a
kind of tender fear and filial trembling, runs (and ſtrives as the
<hi>Diſciples</hi> to the Sepulchre) to aſſure his neceſſitous ſoul of this
acceptable <hi>ſalvation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. XX. 4.</note> even ſets upon his <hi>Saviour</hi> with a kind of
<hi>violence,</hi> and will ſeem to diſtruſt his promiſe, till his ſeal ſhall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and confirm it. Thus did the greatneſs of the work of the
unexpected <hi>reſurrection</hi> beget in <hi>Thomas</hi> a ſuſpition and incredulity,
<hi>I will not believe,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">John XX. 25.</note> where our charity may conjecture, that he
above all the reſt was not abſolutely reſolved not to believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
but that he being abſent at the firſt apparition, would
not take ſo important a miracle upon truſt, but deſired to have
that demonſtrated to his <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which did ſo nearly concern his
<hi>faith;</hi> that ſo <hi>by putting his finger into the print of the nails, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thruſting his hand into his ſide,</hi> he might almoſt conſubſtantiate and
unite himſelf unto his Saviour, and at once be aſſured of the truth
and partake of the profit of the reſurrection. Hear but the voice
of the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and any further proofs ſhall be ſuperfluous, where
in violence and jealouſie of love ſhe importunes the Eternal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Beloved,<note place="margin">Cant. VIII. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart, as a ſeal upon
thine arm, for love is ſtrong as death, jealouſie as cruel as the grave:
the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a vehement flame.</hi> She
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had before often loſt her beloved, which made her ſo fiercely faſten
on him,<note place="margin">Cant III. 4.</note> for having rouſed him, <hi>ruit in amplexus,</hi> ſhe ruſht into his
embraces, ſhe held him and would not let him go. Thus you ſee
the <hi>jealouſie</hi> and eagerneſs of <hi>love</hi> produc'd by either a former <hi>loſs,</hi>
or preſent more then ordinary <hi>want</hi> of the object, both which how
pertinent they are to the regenerate man, either obſerving his paſt
ſins, or inſtant temptations, this diſcourſe hath already made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.
The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this <hi>Theſis</hi> (to wit, that the greatneſs of ones
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſins makes the regenerate man apply himſelf more fiercely to
Chriſt) is firſt by way of <hi>caution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I.</note> that we miſtake not a <hi>motive</hi> for
an <hi>efficient,</hi> an impulſive for a principal cauſe. For where we
ſay, <hi>It makes him apply himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.] we mean not that the encreaſe
of ſin produces faith <hi>formally,</hi> but only <hi>inciteth</hi> to believe by way
of inſtruction, by ſhewing us what diſtreſs we are in, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47754:154"/>
in what a neceſſity of a deliverer. The meditation of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſinful courſes may <hi>diſcloſe</hi> our miſery, not <hi>redreſs</hi> it; may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore,
not mend a ſinner, like a <hi>touchſtone</hi> to try, not any way to
alter him. It is the controuling <hi>Spirit</hi> which muſt effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
our ſpirits, and lead us to the Chriſt which our ſins told us we
had need of. The ſenſe of ſin may rouze the ſoul, but it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God that layes the toils; the feeling of our guilt may beat
the waters, but it is the great fiſher of our ſouls which ſpreads the
nets, which entraps us as we are in our way to Hell, and leads us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>captive</hi> to <hi>ſalvation.</hi> The mere gripings of our <hi>Conſcience</hi> being not
produced by any <hi>Pharmacon</hi> of the ſpirit, but by ſome diſtemper
ariſing from ſin, what anxiety doth it cauſe within us? What pangs
and twinges to the ſoul? O Lord, do thou regenerate us, and then
thy Holy Spirit ſhall ſanctifie even our ſins unto our good; and if
thy <hi>grace</hi> may <hi>lead</hi> us, our <hi>ſins</hi> ſhall purſue and <hi>drive</hi> us unto <hi>Chriſt.
Secondly,</hi> by way of <hi>character,</hi> how to diſtinguiſh a <hi>true convert</hi>
from a <hi>falſe.</hi> A man which from an inveterate deſperate malady <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſhall meet with a miraculous unexpected cure, will naturally
have ſome art of <hi>expreſſion</hi> above an ordinary joy; you ſhall ſee
him in an extaſie of thankſgiving and exultancy, whilſt another,
which was never in that diſtreſs, quietly enjoys the ſame health,
and gives thanks ſoftly by himſelf to his preſerver. So is it in the
diſtreſſes of the ſoul, which if they have been exceſſive, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
beyond hope of recovery, as the <hi>miracle</hi> muſt, ſo will the
<hi>expreſſion</hi> of this deliverance be ſomewhat extraordinary. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſoul which from a good moral or leſs ſinful natural eſtate, is <hi>magis
immutata quam genita,</hi> rather chang'd then regenerate into a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
goes through this buſineſs without any great noiſe, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
entring into it in a ſtill <hi>ſmall voice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. XX. 22.</note> or at a <hi>breathing:</hi> but when
a robuſtous obdurate ſinner ſhall be rather apprehended then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
when the Sea ſhall be commanded to give up his ſhip-wrack't,
and the Sepulchre to reſtore her dead, the ſoul ſurely which thus
eſcapeth ſhall not be content with a mean expreſſion, but will pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
all the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and <hi>Magnificats</hi> which the triumphant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
of the Saints can afford it. Wherefore, I ſay, if any one
out of a full violent courſe of ſinning conceive himſelf converted
and regenerated, let him examine what a degree of ſpiritual exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
he hath attained to, and if he find it but mean, and ſlight,
and perfunctory, let him ſomewhat ſuſpect that he may the more
confirm the evidence of his calling. Now this ſpiritual exultancy of
the regenerate conſiſts both in a ſolemn humiliation of himſelf,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and a ſpiritual rejoycing in God his Saviour; both expreſt in
<hi>Maries Magnificat,</hi> where ſhe ſpecifies in the midſt of her joy
<hi>the lowlineſs of his handmaid,</hi> and in St. <hi>Pauls victory-ſong</hi> over death.
So that if the converſion of an inordinate ſinner be not accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with unwonted joy and ſorrow, with a godly ſenſe of his paſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47754:154"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> and a godly triumph for his <hi>delivery;</hi> if it be not followed
with a violent <hi>eagerneſs</hi> to faſten on Chriſt; finally, if there be
not ſomewhat above ordinary in the <hi>expreſſion,</hi> then I counſel not
to <hi>diſtruſt,</hi> but <hi>fear,</hi> that is, with a ſollicitous, not ſuſpicious
trembling to labour to <hi>make thy calling and election ſure:</hi> to pray to
that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to ſtrike our hearts with a meaſure of holy joy and
holy ſorrow, ſome way proportionable to the ſize of thoſe ſins,
which in our unregeneracy reigned in us; and for thoſe of us whom
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our ſins have ſeparated far from him, but his grace hath called home
to him, that he will not ſuffer us to be content with a diſtance,
but draw us cloſe unto himſelf, make us <hi>preſs toward the mark,</hi>
and faſten our ſelves on that <hi>Saviour,</hi> which hath redeemed us from
the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> of this ſo great <hi>death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">III.</note> The third <hi>Uſe</hi> is of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
and confirmation to ſome tender ſouls who are incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, yet finding not in themſelves that exceſſive meaſure of
humiliation which they obſerve in others, ſuſpect their own ſtate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and infinitely grieve that they can grieve no more. Whereas this
doctrine being obſerved will be an allay to their ſorrow, and wipe
ſome unneceſſary <hi>tears</hi> from their eyes. For if the greatneſs of ſin
paſt, or the plentiful relicks of ſin remaining, do require ſo great
a meaſure of ſorrow, to expiate the one, and ſubdue the other;
if it be a deliverance from an habituate ſervitude to all manner of
ſin, which provokes this extraordinary pains of expreſſion; then
certainly they who have been <hi>brought up</hi> with the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> from their <hi>baptiſm</hi> never wholly deprived of it, need not to be
bound over to this trade of ſorrow, need not to be ſet apart to
that perpetual humiliation which a more ſtubborn ſin or Devil is
wont to be caſt out by. I doubt not but a <hi>ſoul</hi> educated in familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with the ſpirit, may at once enjoy her ſelf and it; and, ſo
that if it have an humble conceit of it ſelf, and a filial of God,
may in earth poſſeſs God with ſome clearneſs of look, ſome ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of affections, ſome alacrity of heart, and tranquility of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>God</hi> delights not in the <hi>torment</hi> of his <hi>children,</hi> (though ſome
are ſo to be humbled) yea, he delights not in ſuch burnt offerings
as they beſtow upon him, who deſtroy, and conſume, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
themſelves; but <hi>the Lords delight is in them that fear him</hi>
filially, <hi>and put their truſt, i. e.</hi> aſſurance, confidence <hi>in his mercy;</hi>
in them that rejoyce, that make their ſervice a pleaſure, not an
affliction, and thereby poſſeſs Heaven before they come to it. 'Tis
obſerved in <hi>husbandry,</hi> that ſoil, laid on hard, barren, ſtarved
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ground doth improve it, and at once deface and enrich it, which
yet in ground naturally fruitful, and kept in heart, and good
caſe, is eſteemed unneceſſary and burthenſome. You need not
the <hi>application.</hi> Again, the <hi>husbandman</hi> can mend a dry, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
wayward, fruitleſs earth, by overflowing of it, and on
ſuch indeed is his ordinary requiſite diſcipline, to puniſh it for its
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47754:155"/>
amendment. But there is a ground otherwiſe well tempered, which
they call a weeping ground, whence continually water ſoaks out,
and this proves ſeldom fruitful (if our learned husbandmen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
aright) whereof there is ſometime need of <hi>draining,</hi> as well
as <hi>watering.</hi> The <hi>application</hi> is, that your ſoul which either hath
been naturally dry and barren, or elſe over-wrought in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the world, needs a flood of tears to ſoften and purge it. But
the well temper'd ſoul which hath never been out of heart, but hath
alwayes had ſome inward life, ſome fatneſs of, and nouriſhment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
from the ſpirit, is rather oppreſt then improved by ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow.
The Chriſtian is thereby much hindred in his progreſs of
good works, and cannot ſerve the Lord with alacrity, that ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
hangs down his head like a Bulruſh. Wherefore, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
rule is, that that ground is beſt which is <hi>mellow,</hi> which being
cruſht will break but not crumble, diſſolve, but not exceſſively.
Hence, I ſay, the <hi>habituate believer</hi> need not ſuſpect his eſtate, if
he find not in himſelf ſuch an extremity of violent grief, and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
as he obſerves in others; knowing that in him ſuch a meaſure
of tears would both ſoil the face of his devotion, and clog the
exerciſe of it. His beſt mediocrity will be to be <hi>habitually hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi>
but <hi>actually lively</hi> and alacrious in the wayes of godlineſs;
not to be too rigid and ſevere a tyrant over his ſoul, but to keep
it in a temper of Chriſtian ſoftneſs, tender under the hand of God,
and yet man-like and able both in the performance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and his own calling. And whenſoever we ſhall find our ſelves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
in either extreme, either too much hardned, or too much melted,
too much elevated, or too much dejected; then to pray to that
Holy Spirit ſo to faſhion the temper of our ſouls, that we neither
fail in humbling our ſelves in ſome meaſure for our ſins, nor yet
too cowardly deject and caſt down our ſelves, below the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and comfort, and ſpiritual rejoycing <hi>which he hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
us. O Holy Lord, we are the greateſt of ſinners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we humble our ſelves before thee, but thou haſt ſent thy Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
into the world to ſave ſinners, and therefore we raiſe up our ſpirits
again, and praiſe, and magnifie thy name.</hi> And thus much of this
point, and in brief, of the firſt conſideration of theſe words,
to wit, as they are abſolutely a profeſſion of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, to
which end we beheld him in his double eſtate, <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.</hi>
In his <hi>unconverted</hi> ſtate we found, though a very
<hi>great</hi> ſinner, yet not abſolutely greater then thoſe times brought
forth, and therefore we were to think of him relatively to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
future eſtate, and ſo we found him the greateſt ſinner that ever was
called in the New Teſtament into ſo glorious a Saint. Whence
we obſerve the <hi>rarity</hi> of ſuch <hi>converſions,</hi> that though <hi>Saul</hi>
were, yet every blaſphemous ſinner could not expect to be
called from the depth of ſin to regeneracy and ſalvation: and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47754:155"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this we proved both againſt the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> and modern <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of morality,</hi> and applied it to the care which we ought to have
of keeping our unregeneracy ſpotleſs from any reigning ſin. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
we came to <hi>Paul converted,</hi> where we balk't the diſcourſe of
the condition of ſin in the regenerate, and rather <hi>obſerved the effect
of it;</hi> and in it, that the greatneſs of his ſin made (as <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
regenerate man more eagerly to faſten on Chriſt. Which being
proved by a double ground, we applied firſt by way of <hi>caution,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> how that propoſition was to be underſtood; 2. by way of <hi>character,</hi>
how a great ſinner may judge of his ſincere certain converſion;
3. by way of <hi>comfort</hi> to others, who find not the effects of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
and the like in themſelves, in ſuch meaſure as they ſee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and ſo we have paſt through the firſt <hi>conſideration</hi> of theſe
words, being conceived abſolutely as St. <hi>Pauls profeſſion</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
we ſhould come to the other <hi>conſideration,</hi> as they are ſet down
to us as a <hi>pattern</hi> or form of confeſſing the eſtate, and applying the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſalvation of ſinners to our ſelves, which buſineſs requiring the pains,
and being worthy the expence of an entire hour, we muſt defer to
a ſecond exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Now the God which hath created us, hath elected, redeemed, called,
juſtified us, will ſanctifie us in his time, will proſper this his ordinance,
will direct us by his grace to his glory. To him be aſcribed due the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the praiſe, the glory, the dominion, which through all ages of the
world have been given to him that ſitteth on the Throne, to the Holy
Spirit, and Lamb for evermore.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of confeſſing the eſtate, and applying the ſalvation of ſinners unto
ourſelves, teaching each of us for a cloſe of our Faith and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to confeſs, <hi>Of all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where firſt the cadence or manner how <hi>Paul</hi> falls into theſe
words, is worthy to be both obſerved and imitated: the chief
and whole buſineſs of this verſe being the truth, the <hi>acceptable truth</hi>
of Chriſts <hi>Incarnation,</hi> with the <hi>end</hi> of it, the <hi>ſaving of ſinners.</hi> He
can no ſooner name this word <hi>ſinners,</hi> but his exceeding melting
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> tenderneſs abruptly falls off, and ſubſumes, <hi>Of all ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. If
there be any thing that concerns ſinners, I am ſure I have my part
in that, for of that number I am the <hi>chief.</hi> The <hi>note</hi> by the way
briefly is, That <hi>a tender conſcience never hears of the name of ſinner,
but ſtraight applies it to it ſelf.</hi> It is noted by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the maſter
of Human Learning, that that Rhetorick was very thin and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
very poor and like to do little good upon mens affections,
which inſiſted on general matters,<note place="margin">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as if one ſhould diſcourſe of ſin in general, and ſinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reference to this or that particular ſin or ſinner; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his note was, becauſe men are not moved or ſtirred with
this eloquence. The <hi>intemperate</hi> perſon could hear a declamation
againſt vice, and never be affected with it, unles it ſtooped to
take notice of his particular enormities, and ſo is it with other
criminals. This reaſon of his was grounded upon the <hi>obdurateneſs</hi>
of mens hearts, which would think that nothing concerned them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but what was framed againſt the individual offender, all ſuch
being as dull and unapt to underſtand any thing that being applied
might move or prick them, as men are to take notice of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
national judgment, which we never duly weigh, till we
ſmart under it in particular. This <hi>ſenſleſneſs</hi> may alſo ſeem to
have been amongſt St. <hi>Paul's Corinthians,</hi> which made him uſe

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47754:157"/>
in applying the either commands or threatnings of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
law to ones ſelf, is by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we
ordinarily tranſlate a <hi>reprobate</hi> mind, but may be brought to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
a <hi>mind without judgment,</hi> that hath no faculty of diſcerning, that
cannot in a general threatning obſerve ſomething that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the danger of his particular ſtate: or as it may be rendred, a
mind without ſenſe, not apprehenſive of thoſe things which are
manifeſtly propoſed to them, like thoſe walking <hi>Idols</hi> deſcribed
by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm CXV.</note> 
               <hi>Eyes have they and ſee not, ears and hear not, noſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and ſmell not,</hi> only beautiful carcaſſes of Chriſtians, which have
nothing but their ſhape and motion to perſwade you that they live:
unleſs we add this moſt unhappy ſymptom, which indicates a ſtate
more wretched far then death it ſelf, that there is ſtrength and
vigour to oppoſe recovery, that amidſt death there yet ſurvives a
hatred, and antipathy to life. In ſuch a ſoul as this there is a perpetual
reaction, an impatience of the preſence of any thing which may
traſh, incumber, or oppreſs it: a <hi>judgment</hi> or denunciation is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
but caſt away upon it, it ſhall be ſure to return unprofitably, and
neither move nor mend it. This hath been, and much more
might be obſerved to you, of the carriage of the <hi>hard,</hi> ſtupid <hi>heart</hi>
toward either <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Preacher,</hi> to the plain opening of this
point; for you ſhall more clearly underſtand the <hi>tender heart</hi> by
obſerving the <hi>obdurate,</hi> and learn to be affected aright with Gods
law or puniſhments, by knowing and hating the oppoſite ſtubborn
ſenſleſneſs. Now in brief, this <hi>tender heart</hi> in the diſcovery of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a ſin, or denunciation of a judgment needs not a particular, <hi>Thou
art the man</hi>] to bring it home to his perſon. The more wide, and
general the propoſal is, the more directly and effectually is this
ſtrucken with it. In a common ſatyre or declamation againſt ſin in
general, it hath a ſuddain art of <hi>Logick</hi> to anatomize and branch
this ſin in general into all its parts; and then to lay each of them to
its own charge; it hath a skill of making every paſſage in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a glaſs to eſpy ſome of her deformities in, and cannot ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
much as mention that ordinary name of ſin or ſinner, without an
extraordinary affection, and unrequired accuſation of it ſelf. <hi>Of
all ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. The plain reaſon of this effect in the tender heart
is, firſt becauſe it is <hi>tender.</hi> The ſoft and accurate part of a mans
body do ſuffer without reaction, <hi>i. e.</hi> do yield at the appearance
of an enemy, and not any way put forward to repel him. Theſe
being fixt on by a <hi>Bee,</hi> or the like, are eaſily penetrated by the
ſting, and are ſo far from reſiſting of it, that they do in a manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
draw it to them, and by their free reception allure it to enter ſo far,
that the owner can ſeldom ever recover it back again. Whereas
on a dead carcaſe, a thick or callous member of the body, a <hi>Bee</hi>
may fix and not forfeit her ſting. So doth a <hi>tender heart</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
or defend it ſelf againſt a ſtroke, but attenuates its ſelf, layes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:47754:157"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wide open its pores, to facilitate its entrance, ſeems to woo a
threatning, to prick, and ſting, and wound it ſharply, as if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in, and did even court thoſe torments which the ſenſe of ſin
or judgment thus produced.</p>
            <p>Again, a <hi>tender heart</hi> ordinarily meets with more blows, more
<hi>oppreſſions</hi> then any other: its very paſſiveneſs provokes every ones
malice; the fly and duſt, as if it were by a kind of natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
drive directly at the eye, and no member about you ſhall be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> oftener rubb'd or diſordered then that which is raw or diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the reaſon being becauſe that which is not worthy notice to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
part is an affliction to this, and a <hi>mote</hi> which the <hi>hand</hi> obſerves
not, will torment the <hi>eye.</hi> So is it with the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
doth tempt every piece of Scripture to afflict it, and is more
incumbred with the leſt <hi>atome</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> or threat, then the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>ſinner</hi> is with a <hi>beam</hi> or <hi>Mountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> one that hath any ſolemn <hi>buſineſs</hi> to do will not paſs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by any <hi>opportunity</hi> of means which may advantage him in it. One
that hath a <hi>ſearch</hi> to make, will not ſlip any evidence which may
concur to the helping of his <hi>diſcovery,</hi> one that hath any <hi>Treatiſe</hi>
to write, will be ready to apply any thing that ever he reads to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
<hi>Theme</hi> or purpoſe. Now the <hi>ſearch,</hi> the <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> the whole <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi>
of a tender heart, is the enquiry after the multitude of its
<hi>ſins,</hi> and in ſum the aggravation of each particular guilt, in and
againſt it ſelf, that ſo having ſufficiently loaded it ſelf, and being
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tired with the weight and burthen of its ſins, it may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
perform the condition which <hi>Chriſt</hi> requires of them which
come to him and be prepared to receive that eaſe which Chriſt
hath promiſed to the <hi>weary and heavy laden.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. XI. 26.</note> So then if the tender
<hi>Conſcience</hi> doth never <hi>repel,</hi> or reverberate any mention of ſin, but
doth draw out the ſting of it to its length, if it be much <hi>affected</hi> with
the leſt atome of ſin, and therefore meets with frequent diſorders,
if laſtly it make its <hi>imployment</hi> to gather out of all the Scripture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thoſe places which may advantage her in the ſight and ſenſe of her
ſins: then certainly doth ſhe never hear of the <hi>name of ſinner,</hi> but
ſtraight ſhe applies it to her ſelf, which was the point we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to ſhew. The direct <hi>uſe</hi> of this Propoſition is for a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or judgment of our eſtate. 'Tis obſerved in the <hi>body,</hi> that the reſt
of the <hi>ſenſes</hi> may be diſtempered, and loſt without impairing of
it, but only the <hi>touch</hi> cannot, which therefore they call the ſenſe
of life, becauſe that part or body which is deprived of feeling,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> is alſo at deaths door, and hath no more life in it, then it hath
reliques of this ſenſe. So is it alſo in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> matters: of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſymptomes this of <hi>ſenſleſneſs</hi> is moſt dangerous, and as the
Greek <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are wont to ſay of a deſperate diſeaſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>very very mortal.</hi> This feeling tenderneſs is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the life of grace, and is an inſeparable both effect and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47754:158"/>
of it. Wherefore I ſay for the judgment of your ſelves, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
how every piece of <hi>Scripture</hi> works upon you. If you can
paſs over a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of ſins and judgments without any regret, or
reluctancy, if you can read <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Babylon</hi> and the
Harlot <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not be affected with their ſtories, if thou
canſt be the Auditor of other mens <hi>faults</hi> without any ſenſe or gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of thine own, if the name of <hi>ſin</hi> or ſinner be unto thee but as
a jeſt or fable, not worthy thy ſerious notice, then fear thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
want of that temper, which the ſoftning ſpirit is wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
where it reſts, and accordingly as thou findeſt this tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
increaſing or waining in thee, either give thanks or pray:
either give thanks for the plenty of that ſpirit which thou enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
or in the ſenſe of thy wants importune it, that God will give
us ſoftned relenting hearts, that the recital of other mens ſins may
move us, other mens judgments may ſtrike us, other mens repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
melt us with a ſenſe, with a confeſſion, with a contrition of
our own. But above all, <hi>O Holy Spirit,</hi> from hardneſs of heart,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
from an undiſcerning, reprobate ſpirit, from a contempt, nay neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
a not obſerving of thy Word, as from the danger of hell, <hi>Good
Lord deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much of this point, of this effect of a tender heart,
noted to you out of the cadence of the words. I now come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſomewhat more real out of the main of the words themſelves,
<hi>Of whom,</hi> &amp;c. We find not our Apoſtle here complementing with
himſelf, either excuſing or attenuating his guilt, but as it were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
glorying in the meaſure of his ſins, ſtriving for preeminence above
all other ſinners, challenging it as his right, and as eager upon the
preferment, as his fellow labourer <hi>Peter</hi> his ſucceſſor for a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
(as he profeſſes) of all Biſhops, yea the whole Church; ſo
our Apoſtle here, <hi>Of all ſinners I am the chief.</hi> The <hi>note</hi> briefly
is this, <hi>That every one is to aggravate the meaſure and number of his
ſins againſt himſelf,</hi> and as near as he can obſerve how his guilt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
other mens. This was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe and our pattern <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
not to be gazed on but followed, not to be diſcuſt, but imitated.
In the diſcourſe whereof I ſhall not labour to prove you the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of this practiſe, which yet I might do out of <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in his penitential Pſalms, eſpecially 51. out of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi>
confeſſion, and the like, but taking this as ſuppoſed, I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mix <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>uſe,</hi> altogether in preſcribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome forms of aggravating our ſelves to our ſelves, yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to a particular diſſection of ſin into all its parts, but deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
only on general heads, equally appliable to all men, briefly
reducible to theſe two, 1. <hi>Original ſin,</hi> or the ſin of our nature, of
which we are all equally guilty, 2. <hi>Perſonal ſin,</hi> grounded in and
terminated to each mans perſon. For <hi>Original ſin,</hi> it is the
<hi>Fathers</hi> complaint, and ought more juſtly to be ours of theſe times,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47754:158"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that <hi>there is no reckoning made of it,</hi> 'tis ſeldom thought worthy to
ſupply a ſerious place in our humiliation, 'tis mentioned only for
faſhions ſake, and as it were to ſtop Gods mouth, and to give him
ſatisfaction, or palliate the guilt of our wilful rebellions, not on
any real apprehenſion that its cure and remedy in Baptiſm is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
benefit, or the remanant weakneſs (after the killing
venom is abated) were more then a trivial diſadvantage. So
that we have a kind of need of original clearneſs of underſtanding,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to judge of the foulneſs of original ſin, and we cannot ſufficiently
conceive our loſ, without ſome recovery of thoſe very faculties
we forfeited in it. But that we may not be wilfully blind in a
matter that ſo imports us, that we may underſtand ſomewhat of
the nature and dangerous condition of this ſin, you muſt conceive
<hi>Adam</hi> who committed this firſt ſin, in a doub'e reſpect, either
as <hi>one particular man,</hi> or as containing in his loyns the whole <hi>nature
of man,</hi> all mankind, which ſhould ever come from him. <hi>Adams</hi>

to contain a breach of almoſt each moral law, all which were
then written in the tables of his heart, and therefore concluding
it to be an aggregate or mixture of all thoſe ſins which we have
ſince ſo reiterated, and ſo many times ſinn'd over. So then this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> perſonal ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was of no mean ſize, not to be reckoned of as
an every days offence, as an ordinary breach, or the meer eating
of an <hi>apple.</hi> In the next place, as <hi>Adam</hi> was no private perſon,
but the whole humane nature, ſo this <hi>ſin</hi> is to be conſidered either
in the <hi>root,</hi> or in the <hi>fruit,</hi> in its ſelf, or in its effects. In its ſelf,
ſo all mankind, and every particular man, is, and in that name
muſt humble himſelf as concerned in the eating of that fruit, which
only <hi>Adams</hi> teeth did faſten on; is to deem himſelf bound to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> humbled for that pride, that curioſity, that diſobedience, or
whatſoever ſin elſe can be contained in that firſt great tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and count you this nothing to have a ſhare in ſuch a ſin,
which contains ſuch a multitude of rebellions? T'is not a ſlight,
perfunctory humiliation that can expiate, not a ſmall labour that
can deſtroy this monſter which is ſo rich in heads, each to be cut
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47754:159"/>
off by the work of a ſeveral repentance. Now in the laſt place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
as this <hi>ſin</hi> of all mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> is conſidered in its <hi>effects,</hi> ſo it
becomes to us <hi>a body of ſin and death,</hi> a natural diſorder of the whole
man, an hoſtility and enmity of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, and
the parent of all ſin in us, as may appear <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. and <hi>Jam.</hi> i. 14.
Which that you may have a more compleat underſtanding of,
conſider it as it is ordinarily ſet down, conſiſting of three parts,
1. <hi>A natural defect, 2. A moral affection, 3. A legal guilt.</hi> 1. A
guiltineſs of the breach of the law, for theſe three (whatſoever you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
may think of them) are all parts of that ſin of our nature, which
is in, and is to be imputed to us, called ordinarily original ſin in
us, to diſtinguiſh it from that firſt act committed by <hi>Adam,</hi> of
which this is an effect. And firſt that <hi>natural defect</hi> is a total loſs,
and privation of that primitive juſtice, holineſs and obedience,
which God had furniſht the creature withal; a diſorder of all the
powers of the ſoul, a darkneſs of the underſtanding, a perverſneſs
of the will, a debility, weakneſs, and decay of all the ſenſes, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in ſum, a poverty and deſtruction, and almoſt a nothingneſs of
all the powers of ſoul and body. And how ought we to <hi>lament</hi>
this loſs with all the veins of our heart? to labour for ſome new
ſtrain of expreſſing our ſorrow, and in fine to <hi>petition</hi> that rich
grace, which may build up all theſe ruines? to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God</hi> that
his <hi>Chriſt</hi> may purchaſe and beſtow on us new abilities? that the

graces then we had, but forfeited in the firſt? The following part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

into nature find to be the rudiment of <hi>animation,</hi> and pants not
then for life, but luſt, and endleſs death. So that the ſaying of St.
<hi>James,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. l. 15.</note> chap. i. 15. ſeems a deſcription of our natural birth, <hi>When

bringeth forth death.</hi> Nor does this haſty inmate leave us when

mixes with <hi>cuſtom, paſſion,</hi> and <hi>example,</hi> and whatever thing is apt

brutal part, till it become at laſt an equal and profeſt
enemy, making open hoſtility, ſetting up its ſconces, fortifying it
ſelf with munition and defence, as meaning to try the quarrel with
God, and pretending right to man, whom God doth but uſurp.
Thus ſhall you ſee it encampt, and ſettingup its <hi>banners for tokens,</hi>
under that proud name of <hi>another law,</hi> Rom. vii. 23. <hi>I ſee another
law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind,</hi> and as if it had
got the better of the day, <hi>bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
which is in the members, i. e.</hi> unto its ſelf. And ſhall we feel ſuch
an enemy within us, laying ſiege at God and grace in us, and
fiercely reſolving, whether by deceit or battery to captivate us unto
himſelf, and ſhall we not take notice of him? Shall we not
think it worthy our pains and expence to defeat him, or ſecure
our ſelves? Beloved, that will be the beſt ſtratagem for the
taking of this enemy, which is now adays moſt ordinary in ſieges,
to block up all paſſages, and hinder all acceſs of freſh proviſion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and ſo by denying this greedy devourer all nouriſhment from
without, to ſtarve and pine him into ſuch a tameneſs, that he
may be taken without reſiſtance; which how really you may
perform by theſe means of <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> preſcribed
you in Scripture, you ſhall better learn by your own practice then
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47754:160"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> my diſcourſe. The fourth <hi>aggravation</hi> of this <hi>guilt</hi> is, that is, that its
<hi>minera</hi> and fewel lurks even in a <hi>regenerate</hi> man,<note place="margin">1 Cor. IX. 27.</note> 
               <hi>wretched,</hi> &amp;c.
and enforceth <hi>Paul</hi> into a conflict, a war againſt himſelf. And
is it poſſible for one otherwiſe happy (as the regenerate man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſurely is) to ſleep ſecurely, and never to try a field with
the Author of its ſo much miſery, or finding it to be within its
ſelf part of it ſelf, not to think it a ſin worthy repentance, and
ſorrow, by which Gods Holy Spirit is ſo reſiſted, ſo affronted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and almoſt quelled and caſt out? Fifthly and laſtly, the <hi>guilt</hi> of
it appears by the <hi>effects</hi> of it, 1. <hi>inclination, 2. conſent</hi> to evil: for
even every inclination to ſin without conſent is an irregularity and
kind of ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> an averſion of ſome of our faculties from God;
all which ſhould directly drive amain to him and goodneſs. That
ſervant which is commanded with all ſpeed and earneſtneſs, to go
about any thing, offends againſt his Maſters precept, if he any way
incline to diſobedience, if he perform his commands with any
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> regret or reluctancy. Now ſecondly, <hi>conſent</hi> is ſo natural a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
of this evil inclination, that in a man you can ſcarce diſcern,
much leſs ſever them. No man hath any inordinate luſt, but doth
give ſome kind of conſent to it, the whole will being ſo infected with
this luſt, that that can no ſooner bring forth evil motions, but
this will be ready at hand with evil deſires: and then how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a guilt, how plain a breach of the law it is you need not <hi>mine
eyes</hi> to teach you. Thus have I inſiſted ſomewhat largely on the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> branches of Original ſin, which I have ſpread and ſtretcht the
wider, that I might furniſh you with more variety of aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on each member of it, which I think may be of important
uſe, for this or any other popular Auditory, becauſe this ſin ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
is ſo little thought of, even in our ſolemneſt humiliations.
When you profeſs that you are about the buſineſs of repentance,
you cannot be perſwaded that this common ſin, which <hi>Adam,</hi> as
you reckon, only ſinned, hath any effect on you. I am yet afraid
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that you ſtill hardly believe that you are truly, and in earneſt to
be ſorry for it, unleſs the Lord ſtrike our hearts with an exact
ſenſe, and profeſt feeling of this ſin of our nature, and corruption of
our kind. <q>And ſuffer us not, O Lord, to nouriſh in our ſelves
ſuch a torpor, a ſluggiſhneſs and ſecurity, leſt it drive us head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to all manner of hard-heartedneſs to commit actual ſins,
and that even with greedineſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I come briefly to a view of each mans <hi>perſonal ſins, I am
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the chief:</hi> where I might rank all manner of ſins into ſome forms
or ſeats, and then urge the deformity of each of them ſingle and
naked to your view, but I will for the preſent preſume your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
ſufficiently inſtructed in the hainouſneſs of each ſin
forbidden by the Commandments. For others who will make
more or leſs ſins then the Scripture doth, I come not to ſwatisfie
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47754:161"/>
them, or decide their Caſes of Conſcience. In brief I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to your practice only two forms of <hi>confeſſing</hi> your ſins, and
humbling your ſelves for them, which I deſire you to aggravate
to your ſelves, becauſe I have not now the leiſure to beat them
low, or deep to your conſciences. Beſides original ſin already
ſpoken of, you are to lay hard to your own charges, 1. your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>chief</hi> ſins, 2. all your <hi>ordinary ſins</hi> in groſs. For the firſt,
obſerve but that one admirable place in <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer at the

plague, whatſoever ſickneſs, what prayer or ſupplication ſoever
be made by any man, or by all thy people Iſrael, which ſhall know every
man the plague of his own heart, and ſpread forth his hand to this houſe,
then hear thou in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Where the condition of obtaining
their requeſts from God is excellently ſet down, if they ſhall
<hi>know, i. e.</hi> be ſenſible of, be ſorry for, and confeſs to God every
man the <hi>plague of his own heart,</hi> that is, in the bulk and heap of their

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the peſtilential, <hi>reigning,</hi> ſweeping <hi>offence,</hi> on which all the lower
train of petty faults do wait and depend, do miniſter and ſuppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
matter to work. If, I ſay, they ſhall take this captain ſin, and
anatomize, and cut up, and diſcover every branch of him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any fraud or concealment before the Lord, and then ſacrifice
that dear darling, and with it their whole fleſhy luſt as an Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſt,
or whole burnt-offering before the Lord: then will he
hear from Heaven his dwelling place, and when he heareth, forgive even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
their other concealed ſins, becauſe they have diſcloſed ſo entirely,
and parted ſo freely from that. For there is in every of us one
<hi>maſter ſin</hi> that rules the rabble, one fatling which is fed with the

the plague in every mans heart. This being ſincerely confeſt and

are to aggravate your ſins, eſpecially your original ſin againſt your

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hearts to that purpoſe. Only take one pertinent <hi>Uſe</hi> for a <hi>cloſe,</hi>
which hath not been touched in the former diſcourſe. If every

            <p>And ſo much of this Doctrine of aggravating our ſins to our

thoſe ſinners which Chriſt came into the world to ſave: and ſo
St. <hi>Paul</hi> here is changed from the chief of <hi>ſinners</hi> to the chief of

this Point at large, as being too wide to be comprehended in

He that by Gods inward effectual working is come to a clear ſight

of circumſtance for the diſcovery of them, not one point of
aggravation for the humbling of himſelf, he that being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

then take his flight and keep upon the <hi>wing,</hi> till he fix firmly on
him, may be as ſure that he ſhall die the death, and reign the life
of a Saint, as he is reſolved that God is faithful in his promiſes:
then may he live with this <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> of confidence, not preſumption
in his mouth, <hi>'Tis a faithful ſaying, that Chriſt came into the world</hi> to

juſtifie, ſanctifie, and <hi>ſave believing humbled ſinners;</hi> but I find my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſelf an humble and believing, and conſequently, a juſtified, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
ſinner, therefore 'tis as certain a truth, that I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And thus you ſee <hi>Pauls, I am the chief</hi>] interpreted by that
