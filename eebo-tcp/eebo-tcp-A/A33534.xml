            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52808:38"/>
bread we had no cau≈øe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his bounty.</p>
                     <p>'Tis generally ≈øuppos'd to be of a cold and moi≈øt temper; but being nothing el≈øe but white blood, I rather think it (as blood is) temperately hot and moi≈øt, and ≈øo like the blood of our bodies, that nothing can exceed it for nouri≈øhment, and therefore 'tis that Milk in acute di≈øtempers is accounted offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive, unle≈øs alaid with water: A≈ø≈øes Milk for Medicinal u≈øe is in greate≈øt repute, becau≈øe 'tis not ≈øo thick, to ob≈øtruct, nor ≈øo thin as not to nouri≈øh: both which may be performed by Cow-milk, either by taking from it the Cream, call'd Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk, or putting to it a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Whey, e≈øpecially if the Whey be fir≈øt well boil'd, and put to it cold, and then it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52808:39"/>
will an≈øwer all the intents of A≈ø≈øes milk: But ≈øuch as are ≈øound, and under no manife≈øt di≈øtemper, ≈øtand in no need of the≈øe cautions and directions, nor can err in eating it, only ob≈øerving: 1. That they do not eat it raw and cold, when they are hot: 2. Not to eat it on a full ≈øtomach, or mingled with other meats: this makes children ≈øo ≈øubject to Worms: 3. U≈øe no violent motion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after it.‚ÄîA draught of warm Milk from any Cow; ('tis but conceit and opinion to count on a red-Cow, more than a red-Woman: the brown and black of both Kine are be≈øt, ≈øo that they are young, well fed, and well fle≈øh'd) their Milk, I ≈øay, taken in bed about an hour before you ri≈øe, is an ab≈øolute refection for a hot,

lean and dry con≈øtitution, if you put a little Sugar, or Salt in it, you need not fear its curdling or corrupting. This trifle made of Milk is plea≈øant: Take a quart of Milk; boil in it a blade of Mace: then take it from the fire, and di≈ø≈øolve in it two or three ≈øpoonfuls of fine Sugar: then when 'tis blood-warm, put to it about a ≈øpoonful of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, ≈øtir it, and di≈øh it out for a whole≈øome repa≈øt: ≈øome do it with Cream in≈øtead of Milk, they are both good: There are many of the like nature, which this ≈øhort E≈ø≈øay will not permit of.</p>
                     <p>Fi≈øh of all ≈øorts is al≈øo cold and moi≈øt, e≈øpecially tho≈øe that live in fre≈øh waters, but Fi≈øh that dwell in ≈øalt waters, and among Rocks, and gravel Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are be≈øt. Fre≈øh-cod,

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52808:40"/>
to few: 'tis made thus: Take half a peck of Oatmeal, take from it the ≈øuper≈øine flowre, put it to ≈øoke three or four days in a ≈øtand, or any earthen Ve≈ø≈øel, with ≈øo much water as will more than cover it, ≈øhift the water every day to take away the bitterne≈øs of the Oatmeal, let it ≈øtand in the la≈øt water till it ≈øowre: and when you would u≈øe it, ≈øtir it well together, and ≈øtrain ≈øo much as you would u≈øe at once: then boil it up to the con≈øi≈øtence of a gelly, and eat it at any time cold or hot, with a little White-wine or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Sack, Claret, Sider or Oat-Ale; though it ≈øeems wor≈øt, that ≈øort of Flumory is be≈øt which looks cleer and ≈øheer, and ta≈øtes ≈øharp and ≈øowre: Thus al≈øo may be made Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Wheat, Rice, French

barley, &amp;c. Frogs and Snailes are counted good food in <hi>France,</hi> ≈øo may Toads, Spiders, or any Vermine, if they come from thence: Our Engli≈øh Hens, Cocks, Veal, Lamb, Chickens, Kid and Capons, are, I think, every whit as good for ≈øaline, hot and dry bodies: If your Lamb and Veal be very young, you ought to ≈øtick it with Cloves or Ro≈øemary, as you do Beef; and it eats more plea≈øant, and is more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome. The brains of mo≈øt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals are over moi≈øt and Phlegmatick: But the Rumps, Tails and Tongues of all Bea≈øts, (but one) are temperate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtorative. The Lungs al≈øo of Fle≈øh and Fowl are good for hot and dry con≈øtitutions: So are the Eyes, Gizards, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breads, and feet of mo≈øt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

e≈øpecially boil'd. Ca≈ø≈øia or Currants boil'd in Chicken or Veal-broth, cools, moi≈øtens, and loo≈øneth the belly: This is al≈øo a good, cool, moi≈øt, cheap and nouri≈øhing potage: boil any Mutton or Veal in water, with or without Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal; when the Meat is a little more than half boil'd, put in it a bundle of ≈øweet Herbs, and the green leaves of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golds, Sorrel, Spinage, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, pur≈ølain, Violet, and Strawberry leaves: add to the≈øe a ≈øufficient quantity of the tender part of A≈øparagus, or a good quantity of green Pea≈øe will do as well, e≈øpecially if you brui≈øe ≈øome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you put them in: Or boil Damask Pruens in two quarts of water; after they have boil'd a quarter of an hour,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52808:42"/>
put to them a ≈øaucer full of wheaten bran; let your bran only ≈øteep in the hot water till 'tis cold, then ≈øtrain it, and ≈øweeten it with Sugar, and drink it frequently: Or ≈øteep a pound of Pruens, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Liquori≈øh in three or four pints of cold water<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> thirty or forty hours, and drink it for common drink: Or this Emul≈øion: Take Rai≈øins of the Sun ≈øton'd, and Currants of each a ≈ømall handful, Lettice and Pur≈ølain ≈øeed of each brui≈øed two or three drachms, boil them in a Gallon of Spring water to a Pottle; then blanch two or three ounces of Almonds, and bray them in a ≈øtone Morter: ≈øtrain the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and put into it the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; then ≈øtrain it again, and with ≈øine Sugar make an

                  <p>
                     <hi>STtoving</hi> and <hi>Bathing</hi> are two different things: the fir≈øt may not improperly be call'd a dry Bath, the other a wet; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52808:67"/>
when ever you meet with the word Bath, you are to under≈øtand ≈øwearing in ≈øomething that is liquid, as luke-warm Milk, Milk and Water, or only warm water, or water prepared with ingredients proper for the di≈øea≈øed per≈øon.</p>
                  <p>Note al≈øo, that a Bath with very hot water, drys more than it moi≈øtens, and contracts the skin and pores, rather than relax or open them; and ≈øerves to ≈øupply the intention of a cold Bath; or bathing in cold water with ≈øuch parts &amp; per≈øons, as cannot ≈øafely go into cold water: But a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52808:67"/>
Bath of <hi>heated,</hi> tepid, or <hi>warm</hi> water, is of ≈øo great a latitude, that it extends it ≈øelf to mo≈øt Di≈øea≈øes, and ≈øerves (to u≈øe the words of a learned Author on this ≈øubject, Dr. <hi>J. F.)</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more than any thing Phy≈øick is pre≈øcribed for, to defecate the blood and humours, to mollifie the hardne≈øs of the Spleen and bowels, to moi≈øten, cool, and nouri≈øh a hot and dry con≈øtitution and liver, to rarifie and re≈øolve al≈øo all cold congealed humours, and to prevent Barrenne≈øs and mi≈øcarrying, that is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned by any <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52808:68"/>
of cold, heat or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>When you meet with the word Stove, you are to under≈øtand ≈øweating as in a Hot-hou≈øe, <hi>without</hi> any thing that is moi≈øt and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid: You will al≈øo ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find the word <hi>Vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarium</hi> u≈øed in this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, the meaning of which will be known here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>The Romans were mo≈øt addicted to Bains or Baths; the Lacedemonians, Ru≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Germans, and mo≈øt <hi>Northern</hi> Nations to Stoves: The Turks, French and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians, u≈øe both Baths and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52808:68"/>
Stoves: and as ≈øoon as they come out of the Stove, they enter into a Bain or Bath of warm water, to wa≈øh away the recrements, ≈ølime, mador or mud (as it were) that ≈øtoving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bathing is apt to leave upon the skin.</p>
                  <p>By this means al≈øo, the skin is not only made pure, clean and ≈ømooth, but al≈øo plump and fle≈øhy: and according as the Bath may be dulcified and prepared, it will nouri≈øh, feed and refre≈øh the limbs and mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous parts, more than food: nor is there any thing to be done by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52808:69"/>
natural Baths at <hi>Bathe,</hi> but may be al≈øo performed by artificial Baths of Sulphur, Bitumen, Nitre, &amp;c. and being advi≈øedly u≈øed, they do as manife≈øtly an≈øwer the expectation of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as any remedies whatever; in order to which ob≈øerve the≈øe few Directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Never Stove when the blood wants ferment, or (according to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chymi≈øt) when the fixed ≈øalts of the blood have over-ruled the volatil, as in Drop≈øies, and ≈øome ≈øorts of Scurvies: But when the Sulphur of the blood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52808:69"/>
is too much exalted (the fomes of mo≈øt acute di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes) or acrimony and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity has in≈øinuated it ≈øelf into the Ma≈øs, and yet the blood not vapid, then the Stove is a proper, and mo≈øt effectual remedy: Or, more plainly, according to the ≈øignificant, apparent, and practical meaning of the Galeni≈øt; Stoving is not ≈øo proper and beneficial, for weak, lean, hot, hectick, dry, cholerick, maciated, melancholy and ≈øqualid bodies, as bathing; nor bathing for cold, moi≈øt, fat, corpulent, plethorick, phlegmatick &amp; hydropick
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52808:70"/>
con≈øtitutions and di≈øea≈øes, as ≈øtoving: The Stove is mo≈øt proper for the Spring, Autum and Winter; the Bath for the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: the <hi>Vaporarium</hi> is neither bathing nor ≈øtove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but differing from both, and to be u≈øed by all ≈øorts of per≈øons at any time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Before you Bathe, or enter into the Stove; if your body be not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øoluble, be ≈øure it be made ≈øo by Art: Take a gentle Cly≈øter over night, if you intend to ≈øweat next morning, or take the like Cly≈øter in the afternoon,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52808:70"/>
if you intend to ≈øweat at night. An hour before bed-time, and two or three hours after you have eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a light ≈øupper, is the be≈øt time both for bathing and ≈øtoving, becau≈øe you may lie all night after in your bed, and have your body well refre≈øh'd and ≈øettled by morning. Note al≈øo, that while you are ≈øweating in a Stove, Bath or Bed, you may refre≈øh your ≈øelf with Mace-ale, Egg - caudle, Chicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broth, or any convenient Bocheet, ≈øupping or liquid Aliment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you come out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52808:71"/>
of any Stove or Bath, take great care you take not cold: For preventing which, and many other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, nothing hath ever yet been invented compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this <gap reason="foreign">

any bed-chamber, with as much conveniency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, as a well wrought Che≈øt of Drawers or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Italy, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Turkie,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, they are ≈øo curious, and (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good cau≈øe) ≈øo addicted to ≈øtoving and bathing, that they count their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations not compleatly furni≈øh'd, and well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and cared for, until they have them in their hou≈øes, e≈øteeming them the mo≈øt commendable and nece≈ø≈øary furniture that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them: and ≈øcarce
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52808:72"/>
a Family of any remark and quality is to be found without them; and if our Engli≈øh Gentry, e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tho≈øe that live in the Country, remote from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicians, did al≈øo take up this cu≈øtom, they would have no cau≈øe to repent them of their care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration: Be≈øides, not only their healths, but intere≈øt and good husbandry might induce them to it, it being the mo≈øt profitable Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician and Apothecary they can make u≈øe of.</p>
                  <p>Another benefit of having them in their hou≈øes, is the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52808:72"/>
of their ≈øevants, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, bedding and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and the avoiding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accidents by lying, bathing or ≈øtoving after ≈øtrangers: by this means al≈øo, they will be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to u≈øe them the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; at lea≈øt 'tis likely it will induce them not to fail, ≈øpring and fall; tho≈øe being (though no time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øs) the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary times to prevent Di≈øea≈øes, and pre≈øerve their bodies in a perfect <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, health and integrity the whole year after.</p>
                  <p>I know, and am well a≈ø≈øured, that Phy≈øicians
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52808:73"/>
would frequently advi≈øe their Patients to ≈øtoving and bathing, had they them in their own hou≈øes, but the charge and trouble on all occa≈øions of providing them, does too often di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage both the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Phy≈øician. By this means al≈øo you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Spring and Fall, the u≈øe of Diet-Drinks, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting blood al≈øo in the Spring, may by this means be prevented, only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52808:74"/>
of life) not prodigally to be expended, le≈øt like the fooli≈øh Virgins we have our Oyl to buy, when we ≈øhould have it to burn.</p>
                  <p>The particular benefits of bathing and ≈øtoving are not ea≈øily to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a tran≈øient di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, but that which they are ≈øo generally fam'd for, is to depurate the bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the blood, the la≈ø≈øitude, and lumpi≈øhne≈øs of the limbs, and to make the whole body brisk, nimble, light and airy.</p>
                  <p>They prevent and cure all Agues, and Fevers of all ≈øorts, both ardent, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52808:74"/>
putrid and pe≈øtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and in times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, are of ab≈øolute u≈øe, provided the place they ≈øweat in (as it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happeneth) be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; which (if for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe) were enough to encourage per≈øons to have the≈øe Stoves in their Hou≈øes.</p>
                  <p>And as there is nothing more effectual to prevent the Plague, than ≈øweating moderately in the≈øe ≈øorts of Stoves, once or twice a week: So al≈øo, if <hi>infected,</hi> nothing can exceed them for a Cure, taking at the ≈øame time convenient Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials:
