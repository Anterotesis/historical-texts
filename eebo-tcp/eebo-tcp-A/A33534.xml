         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHereas divers perſons in, and about <hi>London.</hi> Some under the name and notion of <hi>Chymiſts:</hi> Others under the pretenſe of Charity, do delude and entice people to their daily deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make uſe of their cheap, ſafe, and harmleſs Medicines (as they call them) though indeed (as hath been often made appear;) both <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>deadly;</hi> promiſing alſo, and warranting cures, though incurable: And whereas alſo, 'tis the opinion of divers ſober
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52808:5"/>
and conſiderate perſons that one great cauſe hereof, is, becauſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Phyſicians, and ſuch as are approved, and have been Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, do not take more care of the poor; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in their power to pay both for <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Phyſick.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THis is therefore to certifie all perſons whom it may concern, that there are ſeveral Phyſicians, and Perſons of known integrity, who have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, for the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the poor; undertaken to give all perſons advice <hi>gratis</hi> that ſhall come unto them: And to write them bills to what Apothecaries they themſelves think ſit; or give them inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions what to do, or how to prepare Medicines themſelves, that are not able or willing to make uſe of the Apothecary.</hi>

                     <p>All that I have elſe to add in favour of my ſelf, and for the Errata's of the Printer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, that from my firſt peruſing a late Book, entituled all in Greek <hi>A Direct</hi> (though in truth an indirect) <hi>method of curing Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically;</hi> to the time of fitting this for the preſs, was not above eight or nine days; ſo that I hope all my own, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Preſs, will at moſt amount to no more than a nine days wonder.</p>
                     <p>If any one think, I need not have been thus concern'd for this affair, I can tell him, if all

                     <p>What Diſeaſe is there that proceeds not from ſome of the ſimple or compound <hi>qualities;</hi> and though no man is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly wiſe, as to explicate them in all their cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which makes <hi>Mempſis</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deny, their is any ſuch thing as <hi>qualities,</hi> which is <hi>no leſs</hi> abſur'd, than to affirm there's no ſuch thing as Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter, or Fire and Water, becauſe in all things we know not their cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and yet 'tis certain, they really exiſt, and are (by the Suns abſence, or more immediate preſence) made up of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as we call, hot, dry, cold and moiſt: and as certain 'tis,

that all eſſential Diſeaſes are cauſed, and all Medicines cure thoſe eſſential Diſeaſes, by ſome or all of thoſe four <hi>qualities,</hi> hot, cold, dry or moiſt: And what meats are there not, as well as Medicines, that are not in one degree or other oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to thoſe cauſes? And if ſo, as ſo it is, what hinders then (as ſtrange as the Chymiſt makes it) that food may not perform thoſe cures, and if you pleaſe, not improperly be call'd Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, there being this only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Food and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that in health Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> his <hi>Archeus,</hi> requires things <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal,</hi> or of <hi>like</hi> qualities and temper to its ſelf; but in ſickneſs, things <hi>Heterogeneal,</hi> or of <hi>contrary</hi> qualities to the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> the neglect of which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and neceſſary diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on makes the Chymiſt ſo ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical as he is.</p>

hot; yet when we do accuſtom them to things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, as much Wine, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Tobacco, &amp;c.

This Cullis is counted excellent.</p>
                     <p>Take a large Cock, Capon, Sparrows, Partridge, Snipes or Wood-cocks, boil all, or any of them, in a gallon of Spring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till they fall in pieces, or come to a Pottle: then take off all the fat when 'tis cold, and

Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Calves-feet, Cow-heel, freſh Pig-pork, Veal or Trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, let them ſimper ten or twelve hours by a ſoft fire, in a ſufficient quantity of Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52808:38"/>
bread we had no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his bounty.</p>
                     <p>'Tis generally ſuppos'd to be of a cold and moiſt temper; but being nothing elſe but white blood, I rather think it (as blood is) temperately hot and moiſt, and ſo like the blood of our bodies, that nothing can exceed it for nouriſhment, and therefore 'tis that Milk in acute diſtempers is accounted offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, unleſs alaid with water: Aſſes Milk for Medicinal uſe is in greateſt repute, becauſe 'tis not ſo thick, to obſtruct, nor ſo thin as not to nouriſh: both which may be performed by Cow-milk, either by taking from it the Cream, call'd Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk, or putting to it a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Whey, eſpecially if the Whey be firſt well boil'd, and put to it cold, and then it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52808:39"/>
will anſwer all the intents of Aſſes milk: But ſuch as are ſound, and under no manifeſt diſtemper, ſtand in no need of theſe cautions and directions, nor can err in eating it, only obſerving: 1. That they do not eat it raw and cold, when they are hot: 2. Not to eat it on a full ſtomach, or mingled with other meats: this makes children ſo ſubject to Worms: 3. Uſe no violent motion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after it.—A draught of warm Milk from any Cow; ('tis but conceit and opinion to count on a red-Cow, more than a red-Woman: the brown and black of both Kine are beſt, ſo that they are young, well fed, and well fleſh'd) their Milk, I ſay, taken in bed about an hour before you riſe, is an abſolute refection for a hot,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52808:39"/>
lean and dry conſtitution, if you put a little Sugar, or Salt in it, you need not fear its curdling or corrupting. This trifle made of Milk is pleaſant: Take a quart of Milk; boil in it a blade of Mace: then take it from the fire, and diſſolve in it two or three ſpoonfuls of fine Sugar: then when 'tis blood-warm, put to it about a ſpoonful of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, ſtir it, and diſh it out for a wholeſome repaſt: ſome do it with Cream inſtead of Milk, they are both good: There are many of the like nature, which this ſhort Eſſay will not permit of.</p>
                     <p>Fiſh of all ſorts is alſo cold and moiſt, eſpecially thoſe that live in freſh waters, but Fiſh that dwell in ſalt waters, and among Rocks, and gravel Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are beſt. Freſh-cod,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52808:40"/>
Whiting, Shads, Place, Floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Sole, Bream, Barbel, Smelts, Carps, Gudgeon, Pearch, Pikes, Roche, Mullets, Jacks, or broths made with theſe, and Oyſters, Cockles, crums of bread, and yolks of Eggs are ſine feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſick maciated peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>Fruit of all ſorts, Pears, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Prunes, &amp;c. Stew'd, roſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, boil'd or bak'd, are good alſo againſt dry Diſeaſes; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, Cowſlips, Purſlain, Letice, Aſparagus, ripe Mulberries, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nache, Strawberries, Dates, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let leaves, Sweet-almonds, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Beets, Endive, Succory, Borage, Burnet, Liquoriſh, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera, Raiſins, Currants, Whey, Wheat, French barley, Oatmeal Puddings, Frumety; but above all things Flumory, the worth of which is known
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52808:40"/>
to few: 'tis made thus: Take half a peck of Oatmeal, take from it the ſuperſine flowre, put it to ſoke three or four days in a ſtand, or any earthen Veſſel, with ſo much water as will more than cover it, ſhift the water every day to take away the bitterneſs of the Oatmeal, let it ſtand in the laſt water till it ſowre: and when you would uſe it, ſtir it well together, and ſtrain ſo much as you would uſe at once: then boil it up to the conſiſtence of a gelly, and eat it at any time cold or hot, with a little White-wine or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Sack, Claret, Sider or Oat-Ale; though it ſeems worſt, that ſort of Flumory is beſt which looks cleer and ſheer, and taſtes ſharp and ſowre: Thus alſo may be made Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Wheat, Rice, French
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52808:41"/>
barley, &amp;c. Frogs and Snailes are counted good food in <hi>France,</hi> ſo may Toads, Spiders, or any Vermine, if they come from thence: Our Engliſh Hens, Cocks, Veal, Lamb, Chickens, Kid and Capons, are, I think, every whit as good for ſaline, hot and dry bodies: If your Lamb and Veal be very young, you ought to ſtick it with Cloves or Roſemary, as you do Beef; and it eats more pleaſant, and is more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The brains of moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals are over moiſt and Phlegmatick: But the Rumps, Tails and Tongues of all Beaſts, (but one) are temperate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative. The Lungs alſo of Fleſh and Fowl are good for hot and dry conſtitutions: So are the Eyes, Gizards, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breads, and feet of moſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52808:41"/>
eſpecially boil'd.

put to them a ſaucer full of wheaten bran; let your bran only ſteep in the hot water till 'tis cold, then ſtrain it, and ſweeten it with Sugar, and drink it frequently: Or ſteep a pound of Pruens, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Liquoriſh in three or four pints of cold water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thirty or forty hours, and drink it for common drink: Or this Emulſion: Take Raiſins of the Sun ſton'd, and Currants of each a ſmall handful, Lettice and Purſlain ſeed of each bruiſed two or three drachms, boil them in a Gallon of Spring water to a Pottle; then blanch two or three ounces of Almonds, and bray them in a ſtone Morter: ſtrain the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and put into it the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; then ſtrain it again, and with ſine Sugar make an

and in his morals tells us, that when he would entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more ſplendidly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his chear with a little Milk, and found ſo much ſatisfaction by it, that he bids defiance to the pleaſures, which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſenſual world ſo much like, and cry up in magnificent feaſts, great entertainments, rich Wines, coſtly Meats and Junkets: and certainly ſays our wiſe man, moſt that have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themſelves to variety, extravagancy and exceſs, have thereby either loaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with new cares, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted new vices; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obnoxious to various and great troubles, and frequently commit Rapines, Cheats, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Juſtice, Faith and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and many times precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themſelves into grievous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52808:44"/>
Diſeaſes, loſſes and diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which by Frugality, Temperance and Sobriety they might have avoided: Nature requires little, opinion much, and he that has not this faculty of abdicating from his deſires, his mind is like a Veſſel full of holes ever filling, but never full; and to him, that is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a little, nothing will ever be enough: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever covets no more, than that little he enjoys; however the world (deceived by vain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) may account him poor, yet he really is the richeſt man alive; and the way to make ones ſelf truly great and rich, is not by adding to ones riches, but by detracting from our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and what reaſon is there, then ſays our brave Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that any man ſhould ſtand

in fear of Fortune, or court it's favour, ſince few or none are ſo poor, as to want long theſe things, or ever was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a lower ebb, than Sallets, Bread and Water; nor know I, whether more than this, with a quiet mind, and good appetite, (without which none need eat) is worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for. How many by high drinks and dyet, riot, and luxurious compotations have dyed on their Cloſe-ſtools, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in privies, and took their leaves of this baſe world over a Chamber-pot, or at leaſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out-liv'd the conflict, with Gouts, Palſies, Catarrhs, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, and many other ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Diſeaſes: and what great matter can be expected in Church or State, from that man whoſe joynts are infeebled,

his ſinews relaxed, his head clowded, eyes bleered, and mouth full of curſes and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and all by reaſon of debauchery, exceſs and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which chokes rather than cheriſheth Nature, and clogs the Veins and Veſſels with ſuch ſuperfluous moiſture, that no Meats nor Medicines can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe unmanly Diſeaſes, that are the effects of it: and though Bread will do as much as any thing, yet, unleſs tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, abſtinence, or a ſpare diet be joyned with it, all that Phyſick or Food can do is in vain. No perſons are more offended with Crudities, Worms, Fluxes, and Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than thoſe that eat none, or too little Bread: No Fleſh, Fiſh or Fruits that we can feed on, but putrifie and convert
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52808:46"/>
to ſlime and water for want of it: No country, no place, no people; (in ſome ſort or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) are without it: Some bake it, ſome broil it; others fry, toſt and boil it; ſome make it of dry'd Fiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome with roots of Plants, and Barks of Trees: ſome with Seeds, Nuts Acorns: Among our ſelves 'tis made of Barley, Rye, Oats, Miſceline, Wheat; of all which Barley Bread is worſt, and Wheaten beſt, eſpecially if it be not too fine, and without leven, or ſpoil'd in making or baking: The crum is beſt for Cholerick, the cruſt for Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and moiſt conſtitutions; or they may eat it toſted: the newer it is; the more it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth; the older it is, the more it drys: I have known Children cured of the Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52808:46"/>
by drinking little, and eating much Bread; 'tis good alſo againſt the Rickets: and the reaſon why Fluxes, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, Fevers and many other Diſeaſes, are ſo rife in Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, is, becauſe Bread is not eaten with them: the more moiſt and liquid our meats are, the more Bread is to be eaten with them: dry houſhold Bread, Manchet or Bisket, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for a Breakfaſt, for Supper or laſt at meals, with a little Wine, is the only refuge for Rheumatick and moiſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. <hi>Galen,</hi> by much ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was troubled with diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but preſerved himſelf many years by eating no other Breakfaſt or Supper, than Bread dipt in Wine, and with good Odours.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52808:47"/>
in Wine or ſtale ſtrong Beer, and then boil'd or bak'd with a little Pepper, Seeds, or Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is good, ſo are all ſpiced, and Aromatick Aliments: Eggs roſted and eaten with Pepper, much Salt or Cinamon, and a glaſs of Wine or good Drink after them, nouriſh and dry much: All Wild Fowl, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, old Pigeons, Ducks and Geeſe; Stares, Thruſhes and Black-birds; Larks, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Teel and Widgeon, Rabbets, Beef, Mutton, Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Hare dry roſted, dry up Rheum: Broth made with Rabbets, Rice, Sorrel, Sage, Sparrows, &amp;c.

to apply them: and therefore it is, that <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> and all the five parts of Phyſick, are more abſolutely neceſſary, than the moſt exalted, and accurate Medicines of the Chymiſt: and though by ſome (who know the vulgar neither do, nor will know any thing but what is vulgar) the Galeniſt and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt are repreſented, as two diſtinct, different and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent things, yet 'tis certain, they both ſerve but to make up one intire Artiſt: And I could tell you <hi>Eugenius</hi> not only of ſome Phyſicians, but ſome alſo of your own profeſſion, that can compare, if not out-do the greateſt Don and Heroes (as they think themſelves) of the Chymical and Hermetick Sect: And becauſe you may depend upon it for a Truth, that all

Diſeaſes and Remedies, may as well and better be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under ſome of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or compound Qualities, than any other invented <hi>Idea,</hi> Name or Notion whatever of the conceited Chymiſt, to this very end, the foregoing Chapters in the firſt Part, have given you a practical account of ſuch things, as do <hi>preſerve</hi> by their <hi>agreement</hi> with Nature, and <hi>cure</hi> by their <hi>contrariety</hi> to the Diſeaſe; and not to adviſe people to a Diet, that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their Diſeaſe and Phyſick they are preſcribed, is to ruine them: nor are they by any but conceited Prac<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52808:57"/>
Spirits of Brandy, Punch and <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> which, though at firſt they ſeem to content Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and exalt the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or vital and natural heat of our bodies, yet they ſo alter alſo the natural tone, temper and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the pancreas, blood and ſtomach, that (in a little time) they leave them languid, faint and vappid: By theſe things the Chymiſt may for a while, ſeemingly make his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> or Nature blaze the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but (like a Torch with often beating) it will certainly burn out the ſooner: and 'tis rare to find any accuſtomed Brandy, or <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> Bubber, when once ſick ever to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe the frequent uſe of ſuch things, make all other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials uſeleſs and invalid in time of ſickneſs, <hi>and</hi> when Nature

                     <hi>ſhould</hi> ſtand moſt in need of them.

                  <p>In ſhort, our blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may as well be too much <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated</hi> as <hi>idle,</hi> and the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salts may ſtand in as much need of fixing, as the fixed Salts of volatizing, nor is their leſs danger in one than the other: and how the Chymiſt, only with his hot fiery Cordial Spirits at one and the ſame time, can

Lets hear what <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> upon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this affair of Aliments: <q>This grave Philoſopher in his Book <hi>De Elementis,</hi> tells us, that by a diſſent of the firſt <hi>qualities</hi> (not from the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum latens,</hi> the little Atoms in the <hi>Archeus,</hi> and Seminal <hi>Idaeas</hi> in the <hi>Materia primâ,</hi>
                     </q> as our inſpired <hi>Mempſis</hi> will have it) but from the diſſent of theſe firſt Qualities, ſays our Author, which proceeds immediately from the Elements themſelves, and the Aliments; man is born for the Phyſician, and were it not for the defects proceeding from theſe two, man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye.</p>
                  <p>From the four Elements, come the four Qualities of heat, cold, drineſs and moiſture: from theſe ariſe the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52808:63"/>
peraments of Aliments; and from our Aliments, come the four humours, call'd Choler, Phlegm, Blood and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and out of theſe humours the parts; and from thoſe parts the whole, or what we call a humane body: and when any of theſe four temperaments or humours are extinct, deprav'd or hurt in Quantity, Quality, or Motion, then follows Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death: So that in effect, Life and Death, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans temper and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, depends more or leſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aliments he feeds on; and the humours themſelves are nothing more than the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of food, <hi>v..g Choler</hi> is the <hi>fomes</hi> of blood made of <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> over digeſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and ſerves to ferment, agitate, or <hi>brisk up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipated</hi>

Blood is made of <hi>Food,</hi> perfectly elaborated to augment and nouriſh the parts: good Food makes good Blood; and good Blood makes good Fleſh: So that in effect, Fleſh and Blood is only good Food.

                  <head>AN APPENDIX: OR Practical Cautions AND DIRECTIONS To be obſerved about STOVING AND BATHING.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>STtoving</hi> and <hi>Bathing</hi> are two different things: the firſt may not improperly be call'd a dry Bath, the other a wet; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52808:67"/>
when ever you meet with the word Bath, you are to underſtand ſwearing in ſomething that is liquid, as luke-warm Milk, Milk and Water, or only warm water, or water prepared with ingredients proper for the diſeaſed perſon.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that a Bath with very hot water, drys more than it moiſtens, and contracts the skin and pores, rather than relax or open them; and ſerves to ſupply the intention of a cold Bath; or bathing in cold water with ſuch parts &amp; perſons, as cannot ſafely go into cold water: But a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52808:67"/>
Bath of <hi>heated,</hi> tepid, or <hi>warm</hi> water, is of ſo great a latitude, that it extends it ſelf to moſt Diſeaſes, and ſerves (to uſe the words of a learned Author on this ſubject, Dr. <hi>J. F.)</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more than any thing Phyſick is preſcribed for, to defecate the blood and humours, to mollifie the hardneſs of the Spleen and bowels, to moiſten, cool, and nouriſh a hot and dry conſtitution and liver, to rarifie and reſolve alſo all cold congealed humours, and to prevent Barrenneſs and miſcarrying, that is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by any <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52808:68"/>
of cold, heat or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>When you meet with the word Stove, you are to underſtand ſweating as in a Hot-houſe, <hi>without</hi> any thing that is moiſt and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid: You will alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find the word <hi>Vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarium</hi> uſed in this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, the meaning of which will be known here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>The Romans were moſt addicted to Bains or Baths; the Lacedemonians, Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Germans, and moſt <hi>Northern</hi> Nations to Stoves: The Turks, French and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians, uſe both Baths and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52808:68"/>
Stoves: and as ſoon as they come out of the Stove, they enter into a Bain or Bath of warm water, to waſh away the recrements, ſlime, mador or mud (as it were) that ſtoving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bathing is apt to leave upon the skin.</p>
                  <p>By this means alſo, the skin is not only made pure, clean and ſmooth, but alſo plump and fleſhy: and according as the Bath may be dulcified and prepared, it will nouriſh, feed and refreſh the limbs and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous parts, more than food: nor is there any thing to be done by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52808:69"/>
natural Baths at <hi>Bathe,</hi> but may be alſo performed by artificial Baths of Sulphur, Bitumen, Nitre, &amp;c. and being adviſedly uſed, they do as manifeſtly anſwer the expectation of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as any remedies whatever; in order to which obſerve theſe few Directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Never Stove when the blood wants ferment, or (according to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chymiſt) when the fixed ſalts of the blood have over-ruled the volatil, as in Dropſies, and ſome ſorts of Scurvies: But when the Sulphur of the blood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52808:69"/>
is too much exalted (the fomes of moſt acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes) or acrimony and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity has inſinuated it ſelf into the Maſs, and yet the blood not vapid, then the Stove is a proper, and moſt effectual remedy: Or, more plainly, according to the ſignificant, apparent, and practical meaning of the Galeniſt; Stoving is not ſo proper and beneficial, for weak, lean, hot, hectick, dry, cholerick, maciated, melancholy and ſqualid bodies, as bathing; nor bathing for cold, moiſt, fat, corpulent, plethorick, phlegmatick &amp; hydropick
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52808:70"/>
conſtitutions and diſeaſes, as ſtoving: The Stove is moſt proper for the Spring, Autum and Winter; the Bath for the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: the <hi>Vaporarium</hi> is neither bathing nor ſtove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but differing from both, and to be uſed by all ſorts of perſons at any time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Before you Bathe, or enter into the Stove; if your body be not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoluble, be ſure it be made ſo by Art: Take a gentle Clyſter over night, if you intend to ſweat next morning, or take the like Clyſter in the afternoon,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52808:70"/>
if you intend to ſweat at night. An hour before bed-time, and two or three hours after you have eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a light ſupper, is the beſt time both for bathing and ſtoving, becauſe you may lie all night after in your bed, and have your body well refreſh'd and ſettled by morning. Note alſo, that while you are ſweating in a Stove, Bath or Bed, you may refreſh your ſelf with Mace-ale, Egg - caudle, Chicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broth, or any convenient Bocheet, ſupping or liquid Aliment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you come out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52808:71"/>
of any Stove or Bath, take great care you take not cold: For preventing which, and many other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, nothing hath ever yet been invented compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,</hi> and <hi>vaporarium,</hi> now all in one preſented to you; which is ſo ſafe, ſo commodious and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, both for preventing and curing almoſt all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that nothing ever was, or can be adviſed better, for private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies than to have one of them conſtantly in their houſes; it being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that it may ſtand in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52808:71"/>
any bed-chamber, with as much conveniency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, as a well wrought Cheſt of Drawers or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Italy, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Turkie,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, they are ſo curious, and (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good cauſe) ſo addicted to ſtoving and bathing, that they count their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations not compleatly furniſh'd, and well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and cared for, until they have them in their houſes, eſteeming them the moſt commendable and neceſſary furniture that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them: and ſcarce
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52808:72"/>
a Family of any remark and quality is to be found without them; and if our Engliſh Gentry, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that live in the Country, remote from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, did alſo take up this cuſtom, they would have no cauſe to repent them of their care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: Beſides, not only their healths, but intereſt and good husbandry might induce them to it, it being the moſt profitable Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and Apothecary they can make uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Another benefit of having them in their houſes, is the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52808:72"/>
of their ſevants, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, bedding and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and the avoiding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accidents by lying, bathing or ſtoving after ſtrangers: by this means alſo, they will be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to uſe them the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; at leaſt 'tis likely it will induce them not to fail, ſpring and fall; thoſe being (though no time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs) the moſt neceſſary times to prevent Diſeaſes, and preſerve their bodies in a perfect <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, health and integrity the whole year after.</p>
                  <p>I know, and am well aſſured, that Phyſicians
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52808:73"/>
would frequently adviſe their Patients to ſtoving and bathing, had they them in their own houſes, but the charge and trouble on all occaſions of providing them, does too often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage both the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Phyſician. By this means alſo you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Spring and Fall, the uſe of Diet-Drinks, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ale, and the like, which being at thoſe times ſo raſhly and promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly uſed as they are, do more hurt than good. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting blood alſo in the Spring, may by this means be prevented, only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52808:73"/>
then a <hi>ſpare</hi> and <hi>cool</hi> Diet, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients call'd their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>ſuccedaneum</hi> to blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting: Abſtinence rather than bleeding being their way to abate blood, and prevent diſeaſes: and to deal uprightly in a matter of ſo great concernment, for a preventive, 'tis to be preferred before opening of a Vein, which I do not much fancy, but in caſes of extreme neceſſity, and not upon every trivial diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and occaſion that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf: Bood being that which makes blood, and (as the oyl and lamp
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52808:74"/>
of life) not prodigally to be expended, leſt like the fooliſh Virgins we have our Oyl to buy, when we ſhould have it to burn.</p>
                  <p>The particular benefits of bathing and ſtoving are not eaſily to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a tranſient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but that which they are ſo generally fam'd for, is to depurate the bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the blood, the laſſitude, and lumpiſhneſs of the limbs, and to make the whole body brisk, nimble, light and airy.</p>
                  <p>They prevent and cure all Agues, and Fevers of all ſorts, both ardent, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52808:74"/>
putrid and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and in times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, are of abſolute uſe, provided the place they ſweat in (as it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happeneth) be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; which (if for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe) were enough to encourage perſons to have theſe Stoves in their Houſes.</p>
                  <p>And as there is nothing more effectual to prevent the Plague, than ſweating moderately in theſe ſorts of Stoves, once or twice a week: So alſo, if <hi>infected,</hi> nothing can exceed them for a Cure, taking at the ſame time convenient Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52808:75"/>
Nature by a Metaſtaſis, being thereby aſſiſted to throw off the poyſon and venom of the blood, from the Center, to the remote parts of the body, which is the only intention of the cure, the like is to be ſaid of the Small-pox, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevers, and all conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It relieves or cures all ſorts of pains and aches, as Sciatica's, Gouts, &amp;c. it cures alſo limbs, that are weak and relax'd, and all cold, and moiſt diſeaſes got by cold.</p>
                  <p>Bathing by the mildneſs of its heat, mollifies and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52808:75"/>
relaxes, ſoftens &amp; ſmooths, and on this account is very proper, and very prevalent to cure contracted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and parts obſtructed, either outward or inward, as the breaſt, ſpleen, liver.</p>
                  <p>Bathing alſo, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relieves and eaſeth Nephritick pains, and ſuch as are tortured and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Stone, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick pains, Hemorrhoids, ſtopping of Urine and Courſes, and makes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive belly ſoluble and looſe.</p>
                  <p>All diſeaſes of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, and all internal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes proceeding from a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52808:76"/>
cold and moiſt cauſe, are prevented &amp; cured by <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> as Rheumes, Palſies, Lethargies, Cramps, Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, weakneſs, ſwelling and numbneſs of the joynts: 'tis alſo a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick againſt the Kings-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Jaundies, Scabs, Itch, Chilblains, and all effloreſcences of the skin. In ſhort, it ſo alters and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecates the blood, that you may alter as you will by them and diet, the whole habit of the body, &amp; make it another thing than what it is; like the ſhip at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> though it continued ſtill a ſhip, yet had it not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52808:76"/>
by often reparation, one foot of the timber it was firſt built with.</p>
                  <p>And not only ſick and diſeaſed perſons, but ſuch as are in health may receive profit, but no prejudice in the leaſt by them: and my ingenuous friend Mr. <hi>H. H.</hi> has told me, that in his travels to <hi>Ruſſia, Sclavonia,</hi> and other Eaſtern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> he obſerved that in thoſe Countries, it was not poſſible for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to live (for want of ventilation) were it not for their Stoves, but by the continual and frequent uſe of them, no people are to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52808:77"/>
be found more ſound and healthful; and are thereby ſo little beholden to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that the name is ſcarce known among them: and not a place of any note, but has one in them</p>
                  <p>So alſo the Scorbute or Scurvy, by often and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Stoving, is never heard of among thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (though for want of perſpiration) they would elſe be inclin'd to it more than we in <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis their only refuge alſo to prevent Fevers, Gouts, Palſies, &amp;c. after they have debauch'd themſelves with high drinking, which theſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52808:77"/>
people, to the great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of their Country, are moſt infamouſly addicted unto.</p>
                  <p>Many people, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are Hyſterick and Hypocondriack, by Stoving in common Stoves and Hot-houſes, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fumes, head-ach, ſwounings, and ſuffocating vapours: But in this ſort of Stove, (the head being in the open Air, all the while they ſweat) theſe and many other evil acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are prevented, nor are they at all offended with any noiſome vapours or ſuffocating fumes.</p>
                  <p>

                     </gap>re Veſſels remov'd; and the neck-board ſlided away, and ſo ſlip down into the wet Bath and there waſh off the recrements, the ſlime and filth of your former ſweat, with balls invented for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52808:78"/>
that purpoſe: Then (after you have bathed about half an hour) ſtand upon your feet, and wipe your body dry &amp; ſtep out of the Bath into a warm Bed, and lye warm till your body be well ſettled, and afterwards riſe, and having taken ſome warm broth, you may go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, renewed to admiration, and ſufficiently recompenced for what you have done.</p>
                  <p>That which we call <hi>vapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> is a place in the Stove, contriv'd chiefly for diſeaſes of the Womb, <hi>Anus,</hi> and diſeaſes of the inferiour belly; as Dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteries, Hemorrhoids, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and fiſtulated Ulcers, Scyrrhous tumours, Barrenneſs, Abortion, Menſes, Secundines, and every <gap reason="foreign">
