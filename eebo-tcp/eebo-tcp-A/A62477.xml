            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT is now the second time of my appearing in Print in this nature, I should not have troubled you, but that I believe you will be as well pleased as my self; I am sure that when I applied my self to buying and reading of Books, I was very well satisfied when I could purchase a new Play. I have promised you three this Tearm,</hi> A Cure for a Cuckold <hi>was the first, this the second, and the third,</hi> viz. Gamer Gurtons Needle <hi>is ready for you. I have several others that I intend for you suddenly: I shall not (as some others of my profession have done) promise more then I will perform in a year or two, or it may be never; but I will assure you that I shall never leave printing, so long as you shall continue buying. I have several</hi> Manuscripts <hi>of this nature, written by worthy Authors, and I account it much pity they should now lye dormant, and buried in oblivion, since ingenuity is so likely to be encouraged, by reason of the happy Restauration of our Liberties. We have had the private Stage for some years clouded, and under a tyrannica! command, though the publick Stage of</hi> England <hi>has produc'd many monstrous villains, some of which have deservedly made their</hi> exit. <hi>I believe future Ages will not credit the transactions of our late Times to be other than a</hi> Play, <hi>or a</hi> Romance: <hi>I am sure in most Romantick Plays there hath been more probability, then in our true (though sad) Stories. Gentlemen, I will not further trouble you at this time, onely I shall tell you, that if you please to repair to my Shop, I shall furnish you with all the</hi> Plays <hi>that were ever yet printed. I have</hi> 700<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>several</hi> Plays, <hi>and most of them several times over, and I intend to increase my Store as I sell; And I hope you will by your frequent buying, encourage</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:59005:8"/>
free access into the Palace, without demanding whence, or what I came for; the strangeness of their looks and fearful action, makes me imagine that I am transformed: would I could meet but with a Water-spring, to see if I retain my wonted shape.

If that the King had known they had bin married, questionless he would have been more merciful; but that rests in suspicion, his sentence was pronounc'd as they were guilty, not as man and wife, and then what punishment can be too great? his supposed ill was so much lenity, to live had been to die a lingring death, for reputation is the life of honor, and that once lost, the Mother hates the childe, curses the man she did commix withal, and like a shame-fac'd Felon, seeks to shun the face of every one that knows her guilt.</p>

                  <p>You cannot be so shallow, as to think I took her with a lustful appetite? This honored Badge proclaims that lust is past. Our seizing her was motive to your good, if you conceive it. List, and Ile explain it: Within our Land our foes are resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Scicilla's</hi> King, under whose Government these many years you have been Servitors. The reason this: When he did first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, we found our self too weak to make resistance, and under show of satisfaction we did resign to him our Dignity, pretending search of <hi>Radagon</hi> his son; which he accepted, and did back return to <hi>Scicillia,</hi> leaving Deputy to Govern here. And though <hi>Pallatio</hi> bore the name of Rule, it was by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. Do but weigh the servile yoke of foreign Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what danger may ensue, what priviledge you loose in <hi>Thrace,</hi> if we be dispossest, the time of Truce expired, and he's returned to take possession? For without his son, our Crown and Kingdom both are forfeited into his hands; which yet we may prevent, if you'l agree to joyn your Force with ours, and back expulse him. We'l not onely grant your Queen her liberty, but we'l enlarge your former Priviledge; give you choice of State, Honor, and Dignity, make you Lords and Knights, and in remembrance of the Shepherds Wars, adde a new Festival; which at your charge shall yearly be performed. Consider on't.</p>
