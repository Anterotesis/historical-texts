            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In them may be learnyd how to temper in proſperitye, how to endure in aduerſytye, &amp; after what maner men ſhould vſe them ſelues both in tyme of peace &amp; warre. As in all artes there be certeyne prynciples and rules for men to folowe, ſo in hyſtoryes there be enſamples paynted out of all kynde of vertues, wherin both the dignitye of vertue, &amp; foulenes of vyce, appeareth much more lyuelye then in eny morall teachyng: there beyng expreſſed by way of enſample, all that Philoſophy doth teach by waye of precepts.

And he whyche can reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth ſuch iudgement, waiyng the tymes wyth the cauſes and occaſions of thynges, ſhall bothe ſee moſte deepelye in all matters, beſt declare hys opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp; wynne moſt eſtymacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prudence &amp; wyſdome.

For in them men may beholde as it were before there eies, both the whole worlde, and the gouerment therof, with the policies and lawes, the diſcipline cuſtomes &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of al people from the begynnyng. Thys is ſuche a thyng, that who ſo euer is clerely voyde of it, though he be endued wyth neuer ſo greate a wytte otherwiſe, with ſuch aptnes of nature, or other goodly vertues. Yet when he ſhall haue to do in weyghtye affaires, he ſhall fynde a certeigne mayme and imperfection, not onely in ciuyll gouerment, but alſo in the matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to the warre.</p>
            <p>For al though in an excellent capitaine nature muſt geue the chiefeſt partes, that is to ſay: hardines, ſtowte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of ſtomacke, wyth a natural wiſdome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: by which qualities onely (experience therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adioyned) diuers haue become famous capitaines.</p>
            <p>Yet thys is a thynge that geueth a greter policye, groundeth a deaper Iudgemente, addeth a further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and glory, and formeth a perfitnes &amp; an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in a ſhorter ſpace. The ſhortnes of a mans liefe ſhortened beſides by ſo manye caſualties, is the cauſe that men be taken awaye before the canne get ſuche an actual experience as may make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfite, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly become rotten, before they canne attayne to a rypenes in knowledge. But by thys kynd of learning in youth a man is become aged, he hathe knowledge wythout experience, he is wyſe before it is loked for, he is become a councelour the firſte houre, and a man of warre the fyrſte daye. The ſame thynge hath bene
<pb facs="tcp:29057:4"/>
verified in manye, whych in young age haue bene pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente councellours, and in ſmall experience politique capitaynes. Alexander hereof is an euidente enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, brought vp vndre Ariſtotle in learnynge, and ſo geuen to this kinde of ſtudye, that he had Homer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes laied vnder his beddes hede (wherby he myght be admoniſhed of the vertues and offyce of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prynce) entered into hys kingdome, whan he was but .xx. yeares of age: and neuertheleſſe bothe eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hys owne eſtate wyth ſuche prudence, that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhorte ſpace (beſides the enlargynge of hys owne boundes) he ſubdued the greateſt parte of the worlde. And albeit he began ſo young, and continued ſo ſmale tyme: yet no mans actes be comparable to his: beinge counted the moſt excellente captayne from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. But if eny man wyl impute the greatnes of his doynges to the perfyte diſciplyne the Macedons vſed in the warres, and to the politique Capitaynes, and expert ſouldiers, left to hym by hys father Phyllyp: it ſhal appeare euyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly by the decaye of Realmes when they haue bene gouerned by imprudent Prynces, and by the ouerthrowes the Romaynes receyued when they were conducted by euyll Capitaines, that no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of counſellours can take place, nor eny dyſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne or experience of the ſouldiours can auayle, if the heade be not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertue. There is nothing newe vnder the Sunne (as the wyſe man faith) and it is impoſſible for eny thing to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce either in the war or in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon policye, but that the lyke maye be founde to haue chaunced in times paſt. Al which thinges laied vp in memorye, as in a place of ſtore: me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may alwayes be furniſhed for all chaunces that maye occurre. Seing hiſtories be then ſo good and neceſſary, it were
<pb facs="tcp:29057:4"/>
muche requiſite for mens inſtruccion, that they were tranſlated into ſuche tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges as moſt men myght vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them: and ſpecially the hiſtories of antiquitye, whych both for the greatnes of the actes done in thoſe daies, and for the excellencie of the writers haue much maieſtye and many enſamples of vertue. I therfore hauyng alwayes deſired that we engliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be founde as forwarde in that behalfe as other nations, which haue brought all worthie hiſtories into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall language, did a fewe yeares paſte attempte the tranſlacion of Quintus Curtius, and lately vpon an occaſion performed &amp; accompliſhed the ſame. Whych auctour treating of thactes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, being figured in the Prophetes, Ieremie &amp; Danyel, &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned in the firſt boke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Machabies, ſeme to haue bene borne, and brought forth into the world, not with out a mooſte ſpeciall prouidence and predeſtinacion of god: who proſpered ſo his procedinges that (as Iuſtine writeth (he neuer encountred with eny enemyes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ouercame not, he beſeiged no citye that he wanne not, nor aſſailed nation that he ſubdued not. Thys ſo worthie a matter I thoughte good to dedicate vnto youre grace, folowyng their enſample that haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyled in the like ſtudye, whiche are wonte to declare their good willes, by beſtowing of their labours. Therunto I was alſo moued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rather, by conſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualities of your grace, which ſeme to haue certeine affinitie and reſemblaunce wyth ſuch as were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very vertues in Alexander. For Arianus writeth of hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was of a ſemelie ſtature, bolde in his enterpriſes, ſtowte of ſtomack, moderate in pleaſures, wiſe in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle, and prouident to forſee thynges. That he was excellent in conductyng of an armye, moſte pollitique
<pb facs="tcp:29057:5"/>
in orderyng hys battailes, that he could encourage his ſouldiers wyth apt wordes, and when neade requyred take part of their peril. What partes of this be in your grace, let them iudge that haue knowen your actes in the warres, and your excellent ſeruice done, both in the time of the kinges maieſtie that nowe is, and alſo in his fathers dayes of moſt famous memorye. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in doing hereof I haue not parauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſatiſfied al mens expectacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet my truſt is, that your grace will accept the ſame in good part, and conſider that in a tranſlacion a man can not alwayes vſe is owne vaine, but ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to tread in the aucthores ſteppis: Whyche is harder, and a more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulte thynge to do, then to walke his owne pace.</p>

For thynking to haue made him ſelf ſtrong by thaffinitie of Philip, he was at length by hym depryued of the hole kyngdome, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his life myſerably in exile: Not long after this mariage Kyng Philip dreamed that he ſawe his wiues wombe wonderfully ſwollen,<note place="margin">Philippes dreame.</note> and to his ſeming a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Image of a lion thereuppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by whiche dreame the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyners &amp; dreame readers, did enterprete that his wyfe was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of a chylde that ſhould be of a lions hert and courage: with whiche interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was mitch pleaſed.<note place="margin">Methron.</note> Afterwardes at thaſſault of a citie called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron by ſhot of an arrowe he loſte his right eie.

Then made he a voyage into Cappadoce, where killyng, and takyng all the Princes there aboutes priſoners, reducede the hole prouince to the ſubiection of Macedon.

As ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as tidinges came that the kyng his father had wonne any ſtronge or ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Towne, or obteyned any notable victory.

This Bucephalus was a paſſyng fayre horſe,<note place="margin">Bucephalꝰ</note> fyerſe and full of courage, whiche Philip had brought of a Teſſalien for thirtene talentes, and becauſe of his fierſenes kept hym within a brake of Iron barres, yet for all that he remayned ſo fell &amp; wode that none durſte come nexe to dreſſe hym. Whereof the kyng was ſo wery that he would faine haue bene ridde of the horſe. It fortuned that Alexander came one day with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtable.

So that euen then the foreſeing father did full well perceiue all his poſſeſſion farre inſufficient for his ſonnes harte. After this Kyng Philip determined to make warre againſte all Greace. for the maintenaunce whereof he thought it great auauntage,<note place="margin">Byzancium</note> if he myght firſte wynne Byzancium a famous Citie on the ſee coaſte, wherfore committing the charge &amp; gouernement of his Realme to his ſonne being then .15. yeares olde, he laide ſiege to the Towne whiche made him great reſiſtaunce.

paſſed forwardes, as they could ouerthrowe their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, being weried and trauailed thus with fightyng, they were euer receiued with freſhe enemies: &amp; ſuche as were wounded myght not parte out of the battaille (as it hath bene ſene els where) their enemies aſſayled them ſo fierſſy before, and their fellowes thruſt on ſo hard behind. Alexander did that day not only ſuche thynges as pertained to a Captayne, but aduentured himſelf as farre as any priuate ſouldier, couetyng by al meanes to kill Darius whiche he eſtemed the greateſt honour. Darius did ride alofte vpon his chariot ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing great prouocation both to his enemies to aſſayle hym,<note place="margin">Oxatres Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riꝰ brother.</note> and for his own men to defend him. As Oxatres his brother apeared moſte notable amonges them all in his furniture and perſonage, ſo in hardines and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towardes the kyng he exceaded farre the reſt, ſpecially in that caſe of neceſſitie. For when he ſawe Alexander aproche ſo nere, he thruſte in before Darius with the band of horſemen wherof he had the charge, where as ouerthrowing diuerſe, he put many to flight. But the Macedones ſwarmed ſo about the kyng and were in ſuche a courage by thexhortacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that eche made to other, that they charged againe vpon that band of horſemen.

Macedons alſo ſome were ſlayne of ſuche as preſſed moſte foreward, amonges whome the ryght ſhoulder of Darius was ſomwhat hurte with a ſworde. In this thronge the horſes that drue Darius Chariot, were thruſte in with pykes, whiche beyng woode for payne of their woundes, began to ſtroggle and ouerthrowe their maiſter Darius. He fearyng therfore to be taken a lyue, leaped downe and was ſet vpon a ledde horſe, and ſo fledde away caſtyng from his head his diademe becauſe he would not be knowen.<note place="margin">Dariꝰ ouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>throwen.</note> Then all his men for feare diſparkled, flyeng by ſuche wayes as were open for them, and throwe away their armoure whiche before thei had taken for their defence. Suche a thing is feare, that refuſeth the thyng that ſhould be his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uegarde. When Parmenio ſawe them flee, he ſtraight commaunded the horſemen to purſue them in the chaſe, and put all his enemies to flyght that were on that parte. But on the other hand the Percians dyd put the Teſſaliens horſemen to a ſore ſtreſſe, for at the firſt ſhock they had broken one of their tropes: yet for all that when the Teſſalians ſawe their enemies paſſe through them, they cloſed themſelues together agayne and charged vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Percians, who by reaſon of their onſetgeuing and for that they though themſelues ſure of the victory, became cleane out of ordre, &amp; were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen with great ſlaughter. The Teſſalians had herein a great aduauntage by reaſon that the Percia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beſides that they be armed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues haue their horſes alſo barbed with plates of ſtele, whiche was the cauſe that they could not, either in the vnſet, or retire be ſo quicke as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Teſſalia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were: for by their celeritie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the feate of horſemen chiefly conſiſte, they had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen many of them before they could tourne their

horſes about. When Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der vnderſtode that his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preuailed of their enemies on that parte likewiſe, was bold then to folowe in the chaſe, whiche he durſt not do before he knew the battail to be clerely wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; thenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies repulſed on all ſides. Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der had not about him aboue a .M. horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſlewe innumerable of his enemies.

Thoſe few Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did driue the multitude of their enemies before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like ſhepe. &amp; theſame feare that cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flee, ſtayed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe in their flieng. The Grecians that were on Darius ſide, vnder their capitain Amyntas which ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>time had bene in great aucthoritie with Alexander,<note place="margin">Amyntas.</note> but then againſt him, brake out from the reſt and marched away in ordre of battaill.

The Macedones had deuiſed to ioyne ther gallayes two and two togither in ſuch ſorte that the forepartes met cloſe before, and the hinderpartes lay farre of one from the other. And ouer the ſpaces that remayne betwixt ruppe and puppe they made brydges with maſtes and many yardes laied betwixt Galey and galey, and faſte bounde together to carie ſouldiers vpon, when they had put ther galeis in this ordre they ſet forwardes towardes the Cytie.

Ther was great confuſion, for the ſhippes entangled thus togither could by no means be gouerned in ſuch a tempeſt, the ſouldiers diſturbing the feate of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, and the mariners giuinge impediment to the office of the Souldiers.

Ther was a Tirian which in an open aſſemble declared that Apollo (whom the Tyrians gretlly do worſhyppe) had appered to him in his ſlepe, ſemyng to him that he had forſaken the Cytie and trauſformed the mole that the Macedons had made, into a grate woode.

though the autter were of ſmall credite, yet foraſmuch as men in feare be apte to beleue the worſte, they tied faſte Apolloes Image with a golden cherie, and they bound faſte alſo the aulter of Hercules (to whom the Cytie was dedicate) thinking that by deteaning of thone. to keape ſtill the other.

The neceſſitie that was hanging ouer there heades being more effectuall then aine arte or ſcience, practiſed not onlye ſuche thinges as were accuſtomed for defences, but alſo found one that was neuer enuented before. For to the deſturbours of the ſhippes that approched the wales, they deuiſed longe rafters to the which the faſtened graſples of Iron and great hokes like ſithes which letten downe with ropes by an engyue, ether tare the ſhippes or deſtroyed the men.

For when the hote ſande entered betwene the harnes &amp; the body, there was no meanes to auoyde it away: and where it touched it burned to the bones, ſo that they were enforced to throwe away their harnes, and teare away all thynges they had vpon their bodies.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander ſeyng their obſtinate defence was wery of the matter and determined to rayſe vp his ſiege, and go vnto Egypt. For conſideryng in howe ſhort a ſpace he had ouercome Aſia, it greued hym to be detayned ſo long about the walles of that Cytie, whereby he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the occaſion and oportunitie of greater thynges in the meane ſeaſon.

After this aduenture he reſted his ſouldiers two dayes, and then willed his ſhyppes to be brought forwardes, and the engines in them, to the intent that by aſſaylyng the Tirians on all ſydes, he might put them in extreme feare.

This was thought a matter worthye whereupon the deuyners ſhould conſulte, for he him ſelfe was not free from the ſuperſticon of ſuch thynges. Therefore Ariſtander to whom he gaue moſte credite, did interprete the ſame to be a ſigne of the diſtrucion of that Cytie, but yet there was ſome parill apearing towardes the kynges perſon.

Whiche makynge haſte to paſſe into Egypt ſent Amyntas wyth ten Galies into Macedonia to leuie more ſouldiers.

But it was declared vnto him that the waye he had to go was not paſſable wyth anye great nombre and thoſe ought to be light, and trimmed mete to iourney without bagage or much cariage.

And to encreaſe the power of his horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deliuered many horſes to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges the footemen.

and in fyue dayes conueyed ouer his army as he had done before ouer Euphrates: paſſyng forewardes from thence about foure ſtore forlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges.

The countrey ſerued wonderfull well for the arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng of his battailles in the large playnes, paſſable for horſes euery where, and without ſtubbes, or ſhorte bruſhe, to couer the ground withall, but ſo free a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the eye might decerne thynges a great waye of. And if there appeared any hilles within the playne. Darius cauſed theſame to be caſte downe, and the ground to be made ſmothe. Suche as by coniecture made reporte to Alexander of Darius power coulde not be credited, for he could not thinke after ſo many ſlayne, there coulde be a greater power gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he had before. But he that neuer doubted any perill, and muche leſſe the multitude of men, after the eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th enca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ping came to the riuer of Euphrates, ouer the whiche he made brudges and paſſed ouer his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and afterwardes his footemen. For Mazeus that was ſent againſt him with ſix thouſand horſemen to let his paſſage, durſt not encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with him. When he had continued there a fewe dayes not only to reſte his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diers but alſo to confirme their myndes and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, he ſette forewardes ſtoutly againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, fearyng that he would haue retired back into the inwarde partes of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, whether he ſhould haue bene enforced to folowe by waſte places and deſertes. Therefore the fourth daye he paſſed by Arbella and came vnto the ryuer of Tigre. All the countrey beyond the Ryuer was on a ſmoke newely ſette on fier by Mazeus, who burned all thynges where he came euen as he had bene an enemy. Alexander at the
<pb facs="tcp:29057:57"/>
fyrſte by reaſon of the darcknes of the ſmoke ſtayed for feare of embuſhementes. But when they which were ſent to ſcoure the contrey reported that all thing was clere he apoynted a fewe horſemen to proue the paſſage of the Riuer, who founde the deapnes at the fyrſt entre to come to the horſe breaſte, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the ſtreame to the horſe neckes. There is no Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in all the eaſt partes of the worlde that ronneth ſo viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, which beſides the waters of other riuers that do ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne into it, driueth downe ſtones with the ſtreame ſo that of his ſwiftnes it is called Tigre, whiche in the percian tonge is ſo much to ſay as an arrowe. The footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore deuided into two ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, holdi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g there armour ouer ther heades were encloſed on both ſydes with the horſemen, and ſo paſſed till they came in the deape of the chanell without anye great difficultye. The kinge was the firſte amonge the fotemen that paſſed ouer to the furtherſide, who with his hande (ſeinge his voyre could not be harde) ſhewed the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe places vnto the ſouldiers. But they had muche paine to kepe their footing by reaſon of ſtones wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they ſtumbled, and of the violence of the water that toke their feete away. Suche as caried burthens on their backes had the greateſt trauaill whyche not beinge able to ſtaye them ſelues by reaſon of the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their carriage were borne downe by violence, of the ſtreame. And whiles euery man went about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer agayne his owne, ther fel greater ſtrife amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges themſelues, then they had with the ſtreame. And the heapes of fardelles that fleted euery where vpon the water bare downe many. The king cried to them that it was ſufficyent to keape their armour and lette the reſt go, promyſing to recompence euery man. But they nether folowed his counſell, nor did as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

If their enemies had made but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffer againſte them. they might eaſely haue put them to diſtreſſe. But Alexanders continuall good fortune turned then his enemyes away from hym. Wyth whiche fortune he paſſed the Ryuer of Granyk, when ſo many thouſandes both of horſemen and footemen kept the paſſage againſt him. After that ſort he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the multitude of hys enemies in the ſtreyghtes of Cilicia.

If Mazeus had done his parte and ſet vpon them as they were paſſynge the Ryuer, he myght eaſely haue put them to diſtreſſe, being vnarmed and out of ordre. But after the Macedones had Armed them ſelfes (being then to late) he began to ſhewe himſelfe wyth a thouſande horſemen. When Alexander perceyued the ſmall nombre that came againſt him he cauſed Ariſton cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of Peonians to giue a full charge vpon them.

The ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commonly haue that propertie that when they can not fynde out the truthe, they imagen thorowe feare thinges that be falſe.

able to ſtande ſtill for the feare they were in, nor yet go forwardes beyng ſo fainte of their woundes, yet a fewe of them paſſed through the battaille, wherby ſuch as the wagons did lite vpon, were myſerably ſtayne, lyeng vpon the ground with their members, cut in ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, yet becauſe that through the greneſſe of their wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des they felt litle payne, they kept their weapons ſtill notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they were maimed &amp; without ſtrength, till ſuche tyme as by continuall bleadyng, they ſoncke downe dead. Aretes in the meane tyme had ſlayne the capitaine of the Scythians that were ſpoyling of the cariages and repulſed them back. But ſtreight way came the Bactrians by Darius ſendyng, and turned the fortune of the field agayne. Many Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were ſlayne at the firſt encountrey, but more fled vnto Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander. Then the Percians made ſuche a ſhowte as men are wont to do that wynne the victory, and fierſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſayled their enemies thinkyng that they had in euery place bene put to flyght. When Alexander per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued his men ſhrinke, he rebuked ſuche as he ſawe afrayed, and encouragyng very many that he ſawe alone reſtored the battaille that began to faynt, &amp; geue ground. When he had put them in harte, he required them to preſſe forwardes, and go on frely againſt their enemies. When Alexander perceyuing that the Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians were departed to the defeating of the cariages, and by their going had left the right hande battaille of Darius thinne &amp; naked, he bent his force wholy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way, and there made a wonderfull ſlaughter and deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his enemies, whiche by reaſon of their loſe array were not able to withſtand him. The Percians in the left wynge ſeing this thing, were in hope to haue enclo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed Alexender about, and came forwardes to ſet vpon
<pb facs="tcp:29057:72"/>
his backe parte, wherby greate daunger had enſued to him beyng enuironed both before and behind. If the Agrians had not put their ſpurres to their horſes and geuen a charge to their enemies, that had nere hande enuironed their kyng about, and ſo compelled the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to turne their faces againe towardes them. The battailles thus were ſore trauailed on both ſydes. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander had his enemies bothe before and behynd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his enemies that came on his back were ſore oppreſſed by the Agrians. The Bactrians alſo that had ſpoyled the cariages, were excluded from their own company, and could not recouer their place agayne. Thus the battaylles were deuyded in diuers partes, and fought one againſt an other as their chaunce fell. The two kynges, that ioyned their battaylles hard one to an other renued agayne the fyght. There were moſte of the Percians ſlayne, but the nombre of the wounded were lyke on both ſydes. Darius did ryde in a chariot and Alexander vpon an horſe. They both had a choiſe band about them whiche were careles of their owne lyues. For if their kynges ſhould miſcary, neyther they could be ſaufe, nor yet deſired to lyue. Wherfore euery of them thought it a noble thyng to aduenture them ſelues before the face of their prince. And he that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted moſte to defende his maiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was in moſte pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll, for eche man coueted the honour to kyll the kynge on his contrary parte. There (whether it were an imaginacion of the eyes or a thyng done in dede) ſuche as were about Alexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beleued that they ſawe an Egle flickeryng aboue his head, whiche neyther fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with claſſyng of the harneys, nor by the cryeng of them that were dyeng, honge ſtyll in the ayet a lyttle aboue hym. Then Ariſlander whiche ware a whyte
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29057:72"/>
garment, and caried lawrell in hys hande ſhewed thys thyng vnto the ſouldiers as they were buſye fyghtyng, as a certayne token of victory, whiche thyng did cauſe them, whiche before were in ſome doubte, cherefully and with great confidence, to aſſayle their ennemies. The fyght contynued after thys ſorte vntill the tyme that he was ſlayne whiche gouerned the horſe, that drue Darius chariot. Then neyther the Percians nor Macedons, doubted but that Darius had bene ſlayne. And the Percians vpon that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion made a barbarous noyſe, and a ſorowefull how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, wherewith they ſore troubled and aſtonied their whole hoſte, that were yet fyghtyng with equall vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Darius kynſmen and the Squires for his body that were on his left hand, lefte hym and fled away with a mayn flyght: but ſuche as ſtode in his defence <abbr>dn</abbr> his ryght hande, conuoyed hym into the hart of the battaill. It is ſayd that Darius drue out his ſworde and was determined diuerſe tymes to kyll hymſelfe, rather then to ſuſteine the ſhame of flyeng away. But when he ſawe as he ſat alofte in his chariot, that a great parte of his army remayned yet fighting, he was aſhamed to leue them in ſuche ſorte. And whyles he thus wauered in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt hope and diſpaire, the Percians by little and lytle gaue grounde, and ſhronck from their order.

And thervpon by reaſon he abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with multitude began to encloſe the footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about. Then Parmenio ſent worde to Alexander in what daunger they were in whiche he ſignified to be ſuch, that except they had ſuccour in tyme, they coulde not reſiſte, but he enforced to flye awaye. Alexander was gone farre in the chaſe, when this ſorowfull meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was brought him. Wherfore he commanded the horſemen to ſtaye and chafed wounderfullye, that the victory was thus taken out of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; that Dariꝰ had better fortune in fleing then he in hys folowing. In the meane ſeaſon the fame of Darius ouerthrowe was brought vnto Mazeus. And therefore though he had the vpper hand yet he was ſtriken with ſuch feare of his fellowes miſfortune, that he made aſtarke pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite vpon his enemies. Parmenio was ignorant of the cauſe why the fight did ſlake ſo willingly of there parte,<note place="margin">Parmenio encouraged his ſoldiers</note> but boldly vſing the occacion of the victorie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Teſſalien horeſmen vnto hym and ſayed.

that be ſlaine. Why do you therfore ſtaye? are you not good anoughe for men that be fleing? They ſawe his wordes had an apparaunce of a truthe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore by and by they toke courage, and putting their ſpores to the horſe made a full charge vpon their enemies who retired not by littell &amp; littill, but marched away a great pace. And they wanted nothing of flieng ſauing that they had not yet directly turned their backes: yet for al that inſomuch as Permenio knewe not what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the king, nor of hys battell, ſtayed and woulde not purſue after them. Mazeus hauing leiſure geuen him to flie at his libertie, paſſed the riuer of Tigre, not the next way, but by a further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe about with more ſuretie, and ſo recouered the Citie of Babilon with the remaynes of that vanqueſhed Armye. In the meane ſeaſon Darius with a fewe that accompained him in his flieng came to the Riuer of Licus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher paſſinge ouer he ſtode in doubte, whither he ſhould breake the bridge or no, for it was ſhewed him that his enemies were at hand. But conſidering how many thouſandes of his men by the breakinge therof ſhould be a pray to hys enemies, he left the bridge ſtanding, and at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, ſaid that he had rather open the waye to them that purſued him, then to ſhut it againſt them that fled after him. But Darius lefte not his flieng til he came to Arbilla, where he arriued about midnight.

Fortune heaped to gether that one daye the chaunces of a whole world. Some toke the way that came next to hand, a nother ſort fled vnto

the woods, and ſought out by pathes, to eſcape ſuch as folowed after them. Ther was a confuſion of horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mixed togither without any head, the armed with the vnarmed, and the whole wyth the hurte. At length the compaſſion that one had of an other was turned into feare, and they that could not folow, were lefte bewailing themſelues one to another. But thireſt chieflie afflicted the wounded and weried, which laye alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g euerie where in the waies where any water was gaſping after it with open mouth. And when for gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines they had gulled in the troubled water, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſwell, when the mudde ones entred into their entrayles. And bienge thus not in caſe to moue, the enemie came and ſturred them vp with new wounds. Some when the brookes nere hand, were taken vp by other: ſought out for ſpringes in euery ſecret place. Nor their was no puddle ſo drie nor ſo farre out of the way, that could be hidden from the thireſt of them that ſerched them out. The olde men and women were hard howling and crieng in all the villages nere the waies ſide, how Darius was yet their kinge. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander as it hath bene ſaied before ſtaieng the chaſe, was come to the Riuer of Licus, where as the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the fliers was greater then could paſſe the bridge. So that many when their enemyes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, lept into the water, and their laden wyth their armour, and weried wyth fightyng and flienge were conſumed wyth the ſtreame. But within a while neither the bridge nor the riuer were hable to receyue the companies that continually encreaſed by their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcret flieng. For when feare was once entred into their hartes, they doubted only that, which put them firſt in feare. The Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were eger in the purſute

But he to ſtay them alledgid that their weapons were dull, their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des weried, their bodies faint with long purſute, and that the daye drue towards night. But in veraie dede the care of his other battail which he thought to be yet fighting, cauſed him to returne to their ſocour.

There were ſlayne of the Percians,<note place="margin">The nobre of the dead.</note> whiche came to the knowledge of them that had the victory .xl.M. and of the Macedons leſſe then iii.C. whiche victory Alexander wan more by his own vertue, then by any fortune: and with hardines &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, more then through any aduantage of the ground. For he both ordred his battailles politikely, and fought manfully. With greate wyſdome he contemned the loſſe of the bagage, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideryng the weight of the whole matter to conſiſt in the battaille it ſelf.

And as it chaunſed the more parte of his fryndes and of all other that were eſcaped from the felde were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he called them all togither and made an oracion to this effect: That he doubted not but Alexander and his men, gaping with gredy deſire for the habou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of ſpoyle that was in redines for them, would viſite ſuche cities and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, of his as were moſte notable &amp; plentiful of riches: which thing (he ſaid) conſidering his eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not but turne at length to his auaill. Hys purpoſe was nowe with a ſmall band to repayre into the deſertes. And ſeing the vttermoſte partes of his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e were yet vntouched, he ſhould from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce eaſely repayre hys powre agayne to renue the warre, Let therefore that gredy nacion (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) take my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſatiſfie their great hunger with gold, which ſhortly ſhall cauſe both the ſame and them alſo, to be a pray vnto vs. For he had learned (he ſaid) by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

that the haboudance and exceſſe of ther preciouſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their flockes of Concubines &amp; Eunukes, were nothing els but burdens and impedimentes. Whych Alexander poſſeſſing and carieng about ſhould make him inferior vnto them of whom before he was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. His oracion ſemed to all men to be full of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion. For they ſawe therby that the riche Citie of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon ſhould be geuen vp vnto the Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; Suſa ſhortly after wyth all other ornamentes of the realme that were cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre.

That warres were made wyth iron, and not with gold, wyth men, and not wyth the walles of Cities. For all thinges folowe them that be armed and in ſtrength. He ſhewed that his auntetors were afflicted after this maner in the begining, &amp; yet recouered againe quickly their former eſtate. After he had ſpoken theſe wordes. either for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were therby encouraged, or els that they rather <bibl>obeid</bibl> his autoritie then liked his counſell, folowed hym into the bondes of Media.<note place="margin">Arbella yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did vnto Alexander</note> Shortly after Arbella was geuen vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Alexander, which was full of the kynges ryches and treaſure, of precious ſtuf, and appariell.

He counted no contrey in al Aſia to be more holſome, or to haue more temperat ayer then thys, both by reaſon of ſhadowing mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tein that euermore defendeth the heate, and alſo of the ſea which on the parte being at hand with a certeine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature doth noriſhe the ground.

At length they came to a mounteyne, wher as the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ariobarzanes lay on the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent before by the guiding of ſuch as they had taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Philotas, Cenon, Amintas, &amp; Policarpon wyth a band of the lighteſte Armed, whom he aduiſed that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they had both horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fotemen, and the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey fertell and habound of fodder, that they ſhould make no haſte but paſſe forwardes faire &amp; eaſely.

It was mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, &amp; they were ſo weried, that of neceſſitie they muſt take reſte, for they had ſo farre to go as they had trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all redy, ſauing that the waye was not ſo difficult nor ſo roughe. He refreſhed therefore his men w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meat &amp; with ſleape, &amp; in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d watche, did riſe vp &amp; paſſed the reſte of hys iourney without any great difficultie.

But at length the daie which they ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, demyniſhed wyth his lighte the terrors that the darknes of the night did make. For by fetching of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle compaſſe about, they paſſed the holow gylle, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man began to be aguide. Finally they got vp in the toppe of the hille from whence they might beholde their enemies lieng in campe. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the macedons ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them ſelues ſtoutly in their Armour, appering ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly on their backes, when they miſtruſted no ſuche thyng, and there ſlewe ſuche as came fyrſte to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countre wyth them. So that on the one parte the greuous noyſe of them that were ſlayne, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhowt of ſuche as ran in for ſuccour amonges their owne companye, put the reſt to flyght without making any reſiſtaunce. When the alarome was once hard in the camp wher Craterus lay, the Army by and by paſſed forwards to go through the ſtreightes in the which they were repulſed the day before. Philotas alſo who with Policarpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cenos and Amyntas were gone the other waye arriued at the ſame tyme and gaue a further terror vnto their enemies.

Arriobarzanes with fourty horſemen, &amp; fiue thouſand footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that kept about his perſone, brake through the battaill of the Macedons, to the great ſlaughter both of his owne men and of his enemies, &amp; by makyng of haſte, recouered Perſepolis the chief citie of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But when he was excluded from thence by them that were within, he renued againe the fight with ſuch as were with him, &amp; ſo was ſlayne: by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time Craterus that made all the ſpede he could deuiſe, was come vnto them. Alexander fortefied his campe in theſame place where he did diſconfite his enemies. For though they were all fled, and he certaine of the victory, yet becauſe he found his way ſtopped in many places with great and deape diches, he thought good to vſe circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to make ouer great haſte, not ſo muche for feare of his enemies force, as of the nature of the ground whiche he ſawe apt for them to worke policie againſt hym. As he was paſſing forwardes, he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued letters from Tyrydates the keaper of Darius treaſure,<note place="margin">Tyrydates</note> ſygnifieng that the inhabiters of Percepolis hearyng of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng were about to ſpoyle the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therfore he ſhould make haſte to preuent the matter, for the way was ready enough, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that the ryuer of Araxes was in his way. There was no vertue in Alexander more commendable then his celeritie, whiche he ſhewed in this matter, for leuyng his footemen behynd, trauayled all nyght with his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemen, and by the daylyght came to the ryuer of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos. There he found villages at hande, wherof the tymber they brake downe of the houſes, a brydge was made in a moment, by the helpe of ſtones whiche were layde in the foundacion. When Alexander was paſſed the riuer, and came nere vnto the cytie, a company met
<pb facs="tcp:29057:86"/>
him ſo miſerable, as ſeldome haue bene found in any memory: the ſame were Grekes to the nombre of .iiii. thouſande, whome the Percians before time had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, &amp; afflicted with diuers kyndes of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. For of them ſome had their feete cut of ſome their handes, &amp; other their eares, but all were marked in the fleſh with hote yrons. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Percians mayming &amp; deforming after this maner, had kept &amp; reſerued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, as a memory of the deſpite towardes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. But when thei ſawe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould become vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of another prince, they ſuffred the Grekes to mete Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der. Thei appeared rather to be the Ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of ſome ſtraunge mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters, then of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For nothing could be decerned or knowen in them but their voice. The compaſſion of their wretched eſtate cauſed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders to let fall no fewer teares, then they did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. For it could not appeare whiche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were moſte miſerable, though their afflictions were diuers. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cried out before Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der that Iupiter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of Grece had opened their eies in beholding him that ſhuld deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they iudged then all their grefes as one. Alexander wiped the teares from his eyes, and willed them to be of good chere, for that they ſhuld both ſee their countrey and their frendes, &amp; he encamped in theſame place, where he mette the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being two forlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges from Perſepolis.<note place="margin">Perſepolis.</note> The Grekes drue themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſult what was beſte for them to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of Alexander, and when ſome were of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aſke dwel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling places within Aſia, &amp; others had more minde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne vnto their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis:<note place="margin">Entemeons oracion.</note> Entemeon Cimeus ſpake thus vnto them.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29057:86"/>
of ſuch ſimplicitie, that we preſently deſire to ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Grece as a pleaſant ſpectacle our infirmities &amp; mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, wherof we haue as much cauſe to be aſhamed, as to be ſorowfull, you muſt thinke that ſuche beare their miſeries beſt, which can finde the meanes to hide them moſte, &amp; that there is none ſo familier a countrey to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be vnfortunate as ſolitarines and forgetfulnes of their former eſtate. For they whiche make an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of their frendes pitie &amp; compaſſion, know not howe ſone their teares wil drie vp, no creature can loue faythfully whome they abhorre. For as calamitie of his nature is querelous, ſo felicitie is always proude, &amp; euery one doth vſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider his own fortune, when he determineth of an other mans. For except we had all bene in myſery, one of vs long ago had bene wery of an other. What meruayle is it then though men infelicitie ſeke always their equalies. My opinion is therfore that we as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche long ago were as dead in this lyfe, ſeke vs a place wherein we may hyde our maymed members, and where exyle may hyde our horryble ſcarres. For if we ſhall retourne vnto our countrey, beyng in this caſe, we cannot be but vngrateful to our wyues, whom we maried young, ſhall our chyldren, ſhall our brethren acknowledge vs, beyng priſon ſlaues? and though all thynges ſhould there ſuccede as we would wyſhe, yet there be but a ſmall nombre of vs able to trauayll through ſo many countreys? Howe is it poſſible for vs that be here banyſſhed into the vttermoſte bondes of the Orient, aged, impotent, and maymed, to ſuffre thoſe thynges, whiche haue tyred men then were in force and victorious.

There were but few of his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for cuſtome that is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force then nature, preuailed in that matter. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to demaunde of Alexander that he would geue vnto them ſome place to inhabite in, and there choſed out an hundred to be ſuters vnto hym in that behalfe. Whome when Alexander perceiued coming towardes hym, thynking that they would haue required the thing that he conceiued in his minde. I haue apointed to you (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) beaſtes to cary you, and to euery one a .M. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nires, and when you ſhal come to Grece.

Gold and ſiluer was there fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in heapes, and great plenty of ryche veſtures and furnimentes of houſes, not only for neceſſitie and neceſſary vſe, but for exceſſe and oſtentacion, whiche was ſo great that it gaue the victourers occaſion to fight amonges them ſelues, eche takyng other for enemies that had gotten the rycheſt ſpoyle. The plenty there was ſuche, that they could not employe to their vſe the ryches they found, but when they ſawe thynges of value, eſtemed them rather then toke them away. Till ſuche time that euery one couetyng to haue a parte of euery thyng, tare and brake a ſonder the princely robes, and the precious veſſels of curious workemanſhip, and the Images of gold and ſyluer were either beaton in gobetes or pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in peces, as euery one caught holde: nothing was left vntouched, nor nothing caried away whole.

At length the kyng dyd forbyd any violence to be done to women, and that no man ſhould medle with any thyng pertayning to them.

No, let the gods neuer graunte that it may lye in any mans powre, eyther to take awaye, or gyue vnto me, thys Deadeame vpon my hede, nor that I loſe this Impire ſo longe as I remaine on liue.

For I am reſolued for my part to get my ſelf perpetual fame either by the victorie or by the notable aduenture I will giue for the wynning therof. When Darius had ſpoken theis wordes the repreſentacion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perill ſo amaſyd them all, that they were not able either to ſhew there aduiſe or to ſpeake a worde to the matter,<note place="margin">Artabazus.</note> til ſuch tyme as Artabazus the moſte auncient of his frendes, which before tyme had bene wyth king Philip, began to ſay hys fancie: We are come into the felde (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) with you that is our king, in our moſte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious apparell, and richeſt armoure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the entent to win the victorie, and if neſſeſſitie require, not to refuſe death.

to redeame ſuch thinges as may be ſaued, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction and loſſe of the reſte. But thys matter that I meane is no parſuaſion to loſſe, but a deuice by what meanes ye may preſerue your ſelf &amp; your kingdome. We make a warre wherin the gods ſeme manifeſtly to be againſt vs and fortune ceaſeth not obſtinatly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue vs. It is nedefull therfore that we lay new fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, &amp; ſeke out men which haue other fortune. My opinion is therefore that you deliuer vp your kingdom vnto ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, which ſhal haue the name of king, ſo longe as your enemies remaine within Aſya. And when they be once departed (which my minde ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me to be ſhortly) he ſhal reſtore the ſame vnto you againe. The countrey of Bactria is yet vntouched: the Indians &amp; Saeans be at your apointement, ſo many people, ſo many armes, ſo many thouſandes of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue their force in redines to renue this warre again. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a muche greater force remaineth then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed. Why do we then like beaſtes wilfully runne to a diſtruction that is not neceſſary? It is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ꝓpertie of ſuch as be men of courage, rather to diſpiſe death then hate the life, and oftentymes by we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of trauayll towardes are driuen to take little regarde of them ſelues. But vertue leaueth nothing vnprouided. So that death beynge the ende of all thynges it is ſufficient if we god not to yt lyke ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes. Therefore if we ſhal go vnto Bactria which is now our next refuge: let vs for the times ſake make Beſſus king, who is alredy ruler of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matters be once brought to ſome ſtaie, he ſhal reſtore to you thempire againe as to the righteouſe king.

He turned towardes him, and ſaid: thou vile ſlaue haſt thou now found out a time mete to diſcloſe the treaſon that lyeth in thy harte, and therwyth all pulled out hys ſworde to haue ſlaine him if Beſſus had not ſtraight waye come and the other Bactrians about him and letted his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they pretendyd to be ſory for the matter, But min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in very dede to bind him if he had continued in his purpoſe.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei were departed Artabazus framed his talke according to theſtate of the time then preſent and beganne to pacifie Darius wyth wordes putting him in remembraunce howe hys caſe was ſuche, that it behoued hym to beare quietly the foliſhnes, or rather the error of hys own men: For aſmuch as Alexander was at hande, ouer ſore an enemy for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though there were no diſcord nor diſobedience.

Artabaſus executed the kinges offence, and went amongs the Percians in their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginges admoniſhing and exorting them, ſometyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, and otherwhile all togithers, and lefte them not before it apeared that they would do as the king would haue them. That done with great paine &amp; difficulte he parſuaded Darius to take hys meate, and to ſet hys mynd vpon hys buſines. But Beſſus and Nabar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zanes were ſo gredy to get the gouernement into their handes, that they reſolued to put in excution the thing, they had longe conſpired betwyxt them. For ſo longe as Darius was in ſauegard, thei could not hope to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe nor atteine ſo great powre and auctoritie.

And the reuerens of Darius former fortune, cauſed them to beare the like obedience to him in his aduerſitie. The greatnes and powre of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treies whereof Beſſus and Nabarzanes had the rule, not being inferior to any other nacions in that parte of the world, either in armour, men or largenes of their territory gaue a great encourage vnto their wicked diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſicions in attempting of this matter.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had long deuiſed &amp; debated theſe thinges, they determined to take Darius by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bactria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſouldiers, which were at there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandiment, &amp; then to ſend word to Alexander that they reſerued him on liue to deliuer him vnto his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. And if ſo be that Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould nor accept their doing, (whiche in dede they doubted) then ther purpoſe was to kill Darius, and with their powre to flie into Bactria. But for ſomuche as they ſawe, that Darius could not be taken openly, ſeing there were ſo many thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des redy to aide him. And fearinge alſo the fidelitye of the Greakes, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to work by ſleight, the thing that they could not bring to paſſe by force.

And in the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſent certaine to practiſe with the Percians, &amp; to proue their mindes. The ſouldiers were toſſed to &amp; fro with hope and feare. Sometime thei thought that by leauing of ther king, they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them ſelues to manifeſte ruyne and deſtruccion: and againe they remembred what entertaynment was promiſed them in Bactria that lay open for them, where they ſhould be receyued with ſuch giftes and riches as they coulde not wel imagien.

Artabaſus that he would take vpon him the defence of there cauſe, and cary their requeſte and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the king. The night was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed in this kind of buſines. When it was day Nabarzanes wyth the Bactria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſouldiers ſtode at the entrey of the kinges lodging, colouring hys preuy treaſon with a ſolempne pretence of doing his dutye. Darius cauſed warnyng to be giuen for his remoue, and ſo mounted vpon hys chariot after his accuſtumed manner, Nabarzanes and the other traytores fell vpon the ground to worſhipe him and ſhed teares in token of repentaunce, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they determined ſhortly after to put him in fetters: mens nature is ſo apart to diſſymulacion.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they parceiued what kynd of man, and what maner of prince they went about to deceiue. Darius doubting nothing of his peril that was next at hand, made al the haſte he could to eſcape Alexander, whom he only doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Patron.</note> Patron that was captaine of the Grecians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his ſouldiers to put on their harneys, which they caried before in truſſes, and to be ready and atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to euery thing that ſhould be appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Patron therefore hauing taried long, &amp; interrupted oftentimes as he was about to ſpeak, ſtod in a ſtay betwixt feare and fidelitie, beholding the king in the face. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Darius parceiued that he beheld hym

after that maner he wylled Bubace his Enuche that rode next hym,<note place="margin">Bubace.</note> to enquire of Patron if he had any thyng to ſaye to hym. Patron ſayde ye, but his matter was ſuche as he woulde no man ſhould here. Then he was wylled to come nere, and without any interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. (Darius vnderſtandyng ſomwhat of the Greke tongue) Patron ſayd vnto hym.<note place="margin">Patrons wordes to Darius.</note> Syr of fyfty thouſand Grekes that ſerued you, there is a ſmalle nombre of vs ramaining whiche haue continually folowed you in all fortunes, bearing vnto you theſame fidelitie and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we did in your moſte floryſſhing eſtate. And are determined whereſoeuer you be, to take that for our countrey, and home, both proſperitie and aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath ſo coupled vs together, by whiche inuincible fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie that is in vs. I deſire and require you, that you would vouchſaue to lodge within our campe, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to be the guarde of your perſone. We haue loſt Grece, we haue no Bactria to go vnto, al our hope is in you, and God graunt that other had the lyke. It is not neceſſarye I ſhoulde ſpeake any more, nor would not demaunde the cuſtody of your perſone beyng an alien and a ſtraunger, if I knewe that others were well mynded towardes you. Although Beſſus was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of the Greke tongue, yet his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience pricked him to beleue that Patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had diſcloſed ſome ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; therefore carieng away ſome part of his wordes, by a greke interpretour, became out of doubte. Darius nothing afraid as it appeared by his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, enqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of Patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what moued him to geue him ſuch aduiſe. Wherupon he thought not good to deferre it any le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, but ſaid: Beſſus &amp; Nabarzanes worke treaſon againſt you, ſo that your life and your eſtate ſtand in extreame

peril, and this day ſhalbe the laſt either to the traitours or to you: whoſe wordes if Darius had wel wayed and regarded. Patron had receiued great glory of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuacion of his prince. But let them mocke that lyſt, whiche be perſuaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſtate of man is gouerned at aduenture and by chaunce, but I beleue that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> runneth his race by an immutable ordre, and an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting appointment, by a knitting together of cauſes vnknowen appointed long before.<note place="margin">Darius aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere vnto Parron.</note> Darius aunſwere was: that although the fidelitie of the Greke ſouldiers was ſufficiently knowen vnto hym, yet he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined neuer to departe from his owne nation, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though he might be diſceyued, yet it was harde for hym to miſtruſt them: whatſoeuer ſhould chaunce to him he ſayd. he was mynded rather to ſuffer it amonges his owne ſubiectes, then to parte from them. Not deſiring to liue if his own ſouldiers deſired not his ſauegarde. Whereupon Patron diſpairing of the kinges well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, returned to them of whome he had the charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aduenture any thyng for his ſake. Beſſus in the meane ſeaſon had vtterly determyned to ſlee Darius, but fearing that he could not wynne Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders fauour except he deliuered his enemy into his handes aliue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his purpoſe till y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night folowing. In the meane ſeaſon he came to Darius and gaue him thankes that he had ſo warely and with ſuche wiſdome auoyded the treaſon of that falſe Grecian, who being corrupted by Alexander, ſought nothing but howe to make a preſent of his head: whereat (he ſaid) he could not maruaill that a mercenary ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld leue any thing vndone for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, being without any pledge of his honeſtie, without houſe, home, baniſſhed out of the world, a doubtful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, toſſed here and there at the backe of all men, that
<pb facs="tcp:29057:96"/>
will corrupt hym. And then he fell to purging of hym ſelfe, callyng the Goddes of his countrey to wytnes of his innocentie in the matter. Darius by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce ſemed to beleue hym, yet he doubted not of the truth of the tale that Patron had tolde him, but he was come to ſuche a pointe, that it was as daungerous for hym not to beleue his owne men, as to be deceyued. There were .xxx. thouſand whoſe lytenes was feared to haue conſented to this conſpiracy: and Patron had but foure thouſand, to whome if he had committed his ſauegarde, and thereby condempned the fidelitie of his owne nacion, he ſawe that then they myght haue therof a goodly colour and a pretence to perfourme the thyng they went about, and therefore choſe rather to be killed innocently, then to geue any occaſion whereby he ſhould ſeame to haue deſerued death. And yet when Beſſus purged hymſelfe, he aunſwered that he knewe there was no leſſe iuſtice in Alexander, then manhode, and that they were deceiued that loked for any reward of treaſon at his handes, knowyng that there was no ſorer punyſſher nor reuenger of the breche of fidelitie. When the nyght drewe nere, the Percians after their accuſtomed maner put of their armour, and repayred to the next villages to prouide thynges neceſſary. But the Bactrians as Beſſus had commaunded them ſtode ſtyll armed. In the meane ſeaſon Darius had ſent for Artabaſus and ſhewed hym what Patron had declared. Whereupon Artabaſus made no doubte, but that he ſhoulde ſtrayght wayes commit hym ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the Grekes, thynkyng that the Percians whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kynges perill ſhould be publyſhed abroade, would ioyne with the Grecians. But Darius predeſtinat to his chaunce, could not beare then any holſome counſel

nor ſought for any help in that caſe, but embraſed Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus, as though he ſhould neuer ſee hym more, and being wet with the teares that one of them lette fall vpon another, cauſed Artabazus to be taken away that claue faſte vnto hym, and becauſe he would not ſee his ſorowe in departing from hym, he couered hys head and fell flat vpon the ground. Then ſuche as were accuſtomed to the guarde of his perſone, whiche ſhould haue bene his defence in all perils, fled awaye, thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng themſelues ouer weake, for ſuche nombre of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men, as they ſuppoſed to be commyng. Then there was great ſolitarines within his lodgyng, for none remayned about the kyng but a fewe Enukes, that had no place to repaire vnto. Then he debated and deuiſed with himſelfe alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometyme one thyng, and ſometyme another, and by and by waxed wery of that ſolitarines, whiche before he toke for a comforte, and called Bubace vnto hym, whome he behelde, and ſayd: Go prouyde your ſelues, whiche according to your duties haue bene true to your prince till the laſt howre, Here I doe tary for the fatall lawe of my deſtynie. peraduenture ye do maruayle that I do not ende myne owne lyfe.

their kynge. There were clamours through out the campe of diuers ſortes and tunes, wythout any head, and without any apointment. Such as partayned to Nabarzanes and Beſſus deceiued by ſuch lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion as they harde, brought them worde that the kyng had killed him ſelf. Whereupon the prepaired thither ſo faſt as thei could gallop,<note place="margin">Darius ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner by Beſſus and Nabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes.</note> and ſuch folowed after as thei had choſen to be myniſters of their miſcheife. When they were entred into the kings pauilion, bicauſe the Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches declared that he was on liue, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to be bound. Thus he whych before was caried in a chariot and honoured of his men like a god, was made priſoner by hys owne ſeruauntes, without any foreine powre, and put into a vile cart couered ouer with beaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſkynnes: and ſpoyle was made of the kinges ſtufe in ſuch ſort, as if it had bene taken in the warres. And when they had laden them ſelues with the pray gotten after ſo foule a maner they conuaied them ſelues into their countries. But Artabazus with thoſe of whom he had the charge, and with the Greake ſouldiers, toke the way towardes Parthina thinking to be more ſure any where, then in the felowſhip of thoſe traitors. The Percians whom Beſſus had burdened with ſo many faire promiſes, ſpecially bicauſe thei had no other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to folowe, ioyned them ſelues to the Bactrians, and the third daye ouertoke them. But to thintent Darius ſhould not want ſuch honor as was due vnto his eſtate Beſſus cauſed him to be bound wyth golden fetters. ſuch were the deſpightes that his fortune made him ſubiect vnto. And for that he ſhould not be knowen by his apparell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they couered the carte with foull hides of beaſtes, and cauſed vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to driue it forwards. And leſt by enquiring the Armye he might be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29057:97"/>
ſuch as had the charge of hym folowed afarre of. Whan Alexander hard that Darius was remoued to Echatane, he lefte the way that he was in, and with all the ſpede he could make, folowed after Darius y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſaid to be gone into Media. But when Alexander was come to Taba, which is the cheife Citie of Paratacene,<note place="margin">Taba. Paratacene.</note> it was there ſhewed him by fugitiues that came out of Darius camp, that he was fled with al ſpede into Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria. And afterwardes vnderſtod the matter more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly by Bagiſtenes of Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. who could not affirme directly that Darius was vſed as a priſoner, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that either he was in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of death, or of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie. Alexander vpon thoſe newes called his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines togither, and ſhewed them that he had a greate enterpriſe, but ſuch one as the trauail was verie ſhort. Darius (he ſayd) was not far of, forſaken of his own men, and either take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a preſoner or ſlaine. In whoſe parſon he ſhewed their whole victorye to conſiſte, and the greatnes of the matter, to be reward ſufficient of their haſte making. They all cried with one voice that they were redy to folowe him where he would go, and that he ſhould neither ſpare there labor nor their perill. Wherupon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied his army forwardes with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous ſpede, rather in poſt, then after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ordre of marching, neither reſting daie nor night til they had paſſed .v.c. furlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, &amp; come to the village where Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius was taken. There Melun,<note place="margin">Melun.</note> Darius Interpreter, who by reaſon of his ſicknes could not folowe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was taken through Alexanders celeritie, who fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he fledde awaye from his maiſter, declared the whole matter, but how great ſo euer his deſire was to ouertake his enemies, it was neceſſary for hym to giue his men reſt of their trauayle. So that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:29057:98"/>
to leue the teſte of his army behinde, did choſe out ſix thouſand horſemen, and added to them .iii.c. whiche they cal Dimichas, that were fotemen heuy harniſed, but yet did ride on horſeback, and when the matter and place required, lighted &amp; fought on foote. When Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander was taking ordre about theſe thinges. Orſellos and Mythracenes which for the hatred they bare to Beſſus for his treaſon, fled from him, declared to the kynge that the Percians were but .v.c. furlonges of. and proffered to guide hym by a nearer way. Their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng was gratefull to the king, for by their conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, in the begynning of the nigh, the toke his iourney wyth ſuche horſemen as he had appointed, willing his fote battell to folowe after wyth all ſpede poſſible. He marched forwardes in a ſquare battell, and kept ſuch an ordre that the firſte might ioyne with the laſte, and ſuch as came behind, releue them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> went before. When they had paſſed .ccc. furlonges of their way.<note place="margin">Broculus.</note> Broculus the ſonne of Mazeus that ſometime had bene gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Siria met Alexander and declared that Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was within two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred furlonges marching with his men out of all ordre, as one that did caſte no doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſeming to him that they went towardes Hircania. wherfore yf haſte were made (he ſaid) they myght ſone be ouertaken, &amp; found diſparckled here &amp; ther, out of al aray. He affirmed alſo that Darius was yet aliue, Alex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ander that was hote before in his purſuite, was with his wordes muche more pricked forwardes, ſo that he cauſed them put ſpores to their horſes, and paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes a gallop, and went ſo farre forth, that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght heare the noiſe of their enemies, made as thei mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. But the duſte that dyd ryſe toke awaye their fight, and therefore he ſtayed a while, tyl the duſte was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29057:98"/>
vaniſhed away. And then both Beſſus parceyued the Macedons, and they ſawe the Percians as they fled. Notwithſtanding they had not ben hable to haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with them, if Beſſus had had as great courage to fight, as he had to betraye hys maſter. For beſides that they excedid the Macedons in nombre and powre, who being forweried and ſore trauayled, ſhould haue had to do with them that were iuſtie &amp; freſhe. But the name of Alexander and his fame, which is of great moment, euer in the warres put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch feare, that thei could not ſtaye them ſelues. Then Beſſus and other that were parteners of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracy came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carte, where Darius was, &amp; parſuaded him to leape on horſebacke, and fle from hys enemies that were at hand. But he affirming that the gods were come to his reueng, and calling for the aſſiſtaunce of Alexander,<note place="margin">Darius wounded to death.</note> ſaid that in no wyſe he woulde go wyth traitors: wherewith they were ſo ſturred to wrath, that they threw dartes at him, and left him wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in many places of his body. They thucſt in the beaſtes alſo that driew the cart, to thintent they ſhould not be hable to paſſe forwardes. &amp; ſlew his two ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes that did waite vpon him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted this acte, they thought it expedient to diſperſe them ſelues in their flieng. And ſo Nabarzanes toke the waye to Hircania, and Beſſus to Bactria, with a few horſemen that eche of them had in their company. When their ſouldiers were forſaken of theyr Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, they ſcatered here and there, where hope and feare did lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There were only fiue hundred horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which aſſembled them ſelf togither, and ſtode in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moryng, whither it were better to reſiſte, or to flee. Alexander vnderſtanding the feare his enemies were in ſent Nycanor before wyth parte of hys horſemen,
<pb facs="tcp:29057:99"/>
by keping of them occupied, and he with the reſt folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed after. Where were ſlayn about the nombre of .iii. thouſand that ſtode at their defence, and they dyd dryue before them the reſte of the army like beaſtes, from kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of whome, the kyng gaue commaundement to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine. Amonges all the priſoners there was none that was able to ſhewe which was the cart that caried Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, for euery one was ſo deſirous to fynd him, that as they ſawe any carte thei ſought Darius therin, and yet they could perceyue by no meanes where he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Alexander made ſuche haſte that ſcarſely thre thouſand horſemen folowed hym, of all his nombre, but the whole army of the Percians, fell into their lappes that folowed behynde. It is ſcarſely credible to be bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that there ſhould be more priſoners taken, then there were men to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But fortune in that feare had ſo taken away their ſence, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyder their owne multitude, nor the ſmale nombre of their enemies. In the meane ſeaſon the beaſtes that drewe Darius wagon, hauing no man to gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were ſwarued out of the hyghe way, and wanderyng here and there, had drawen Darius four furlonges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place he was wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, into a valley, where they fain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, by reaſon of their heate and their hurtes.

manifeſtly the vices that were in hym: there he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his continency, and moderacion, being the moſte excellent vertues appearing in any kynde of eſtate, into pryde and voluptuouſneſſe, not eſteamyng hys countrey cuſtomes, nor the holſome temperaunce that was in the vſagies and diſcipline of the kynges of Macedon, whiche iudged their ciuill vſage and maner to be ouer baſe for his greatnes, but did counterfeit the heyghte and pompe of the Kynges of Perce, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the greatnes of the Goddes. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuffre men there to fall downe flat vpon the ground, and worſhyp hym, and accuſtomed the victors of ſo many nacions, by litle and litle, to ſeruile offices, coueting to make them equall vnto his captiues. He ware vpon his head a diademe of purple, interpaled with white, lyke as Darius was accuſtomed, and faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned his apparell of the maner of the Percians, without ſcrupuleſitie of any euell token that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for the victorer to chaunge his habite into the faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of hym whome he had vanquiſſhed. And though he aduaunted that he ware the ſpoiles of his enemies, yet with thoſe ſpoyles he put vpon him their euell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the inſolency of the mynde, followed the pride of the apparell. Beſides he ſealed ſuche letters as he ſent into Europe with his accuſtomed ſeale, but all the letters he ſent abrode into Aſia, were ſealed with Darius rynge. So it appeared that one mynde could not beare the greatnes that apperteyned to two. He apparelled alſo his frendes, his capitaynes, and his horſemen in Percian apparell, wherat though they grudged in their myndes, yet they durſt not refuſe it for feare of his diſpleaſure.

&amp; .lx. that belonged to Darius, &amp; amonges them were flockes of Enukes accuſtomed to perfourme the vſe of women. The old ſouldiers of Philippe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorryng ſuche thinges manifeſtly withſtode to be infected with ſuche voluptuouſnes and ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Wherupon there roſe a general talke and opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throughout the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe: that they had loſt more by the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, then they had wonne by the warre. For when they ſawe themſelues ouercome in ſuche exceſſe, &amp; foreine cuſtomes ſo to preuaile amonges them, they iudged it aſlender reward of their long being abrode, to returne home in the habite of priſoners. They began to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med of their king that was more like to ſuche as were ſubdued, then to them that were victorious, and that of a kyng of Macedon, was become a prince of Perce, &amp; one of Darius courtiers. When he vnderſtode that the chefe of his frendes, and his men of warre, were greuouſly offended with his doynges, he went about to recouer fauour againe with giftes and liberalitie, but it is to be thought that the rewardes of ſeruitude, be vngratefull to fre men. And therfore leſt this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might turne into a ſedicion, he thought good to breake the imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s encreaſed by idlenes, with the exerciſe of warres, wherof an apt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was geuen.

When he had determined this new expedicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he found his army ſo ouercharged and laden with ſpoyle, &amp; other furnime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of voluptuouſnes, that they could

Wherfore he commaunded the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and ſtuf of the whole army to be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, excepting only ſuch thinges as were very neceſſary. The place was large and playne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cartes were brought laden, and when euery one ſtode wayting and muſing what he woulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them to doe, he cauſed the beaſtes to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued firſt out of the way, and then ſet his owne fardels on fyer, and after all the reſte. Whiles theſe thynges were burning the owners were on fyer, to ſee thoſe thinges conſumed, for the ſauing wherof they had oft quenched the flambes in Cyties of their enemies, yet no man durſte lament the price of his owne bloud, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſawe the fyer conſume the kynges ryches, as well as their owne, but the rather to pacefie them, the kyng did mytigate their dolour with a briefe oracion.

Then Dymnus opened vnto him howe there was a treaſon conſpired againſt the kinge, whiche within three dayes ſhoulde be put in execution, wherof (he ſaied) he him ſelfe was prittie with diuers men of nobilitie and eſtimation.

Howe much more will you be moued when I ſhall ſhewe you the authours of ſo horrible a treaſon, the reherſal of whom I yet refrain, as one very loth to diſcouer their names. But I muſt ouercome the memory of my former fauour &amp; vtter the conſpiracie of my vnnatural people, for how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to hide ſo great a treaſon. Parmenio a man of that age ſo depely in my dette, through the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple benefites both of me and my father, and whome I moſte eſtemed of all my frendes, is the captaine &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuer of all this miſchief.

His father is gouernour of Media, and heareth ſuche a ſtroke amonges the capitaines and men of warre thorowe myne aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he hopeth for a great deale more then he hath.

The reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of my father doth put me in mynd, how loth &amp; timerous that I ought to haue bene in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of tales. For when my father was enfourmed that Philip the phiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had prepared poyſon for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, he wrote a letter to warne the king, that he ſhould not receiue the medicine, that his phiſicion had prepared: was my father beleued? was his letter of any auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? I my ſelf when I haue reported ſuch thinges as I hard, how often haue I bene ſhaken of with a check for my light belefe, ſo that when we tel thinges we are hated, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we hold our peace, we are ſuſpected: what would you haue vs do? Then one of the company that ſtode by, cried out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none ought to be traitours to them that put them in truſt. Thou ſaieſt well (<abbr>qd</abbr> Philotas) whoſoeuer thou art.

            </q>
            <p> And as he was ſpeaking ſo, his keapers led him away. There was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges the captai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes one Belon,<note place="margin">Belons eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</note> a hardy man, but very rude of al honeſt maner &amp; ciuilitie, who being an old ſouldier, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lowe eſtate to the rowme of a captain. This Belon preſuming vpon a foliſhe audacitie (when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done) began to tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers had taken vp their lodginges in the campe, how they were thurſt out by the ſeruauntes of Philotas, which would

lay their baggage, where other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were placed before. And how all the ſtreates were ful of his wagons, lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with gold and ſiluer. He added further that Philotas would ſuffre none to lodge nere him, but alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certaine to wayte whiles he ſtept, which ſhould voyde al men alowf to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he ſhould not be diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any noyſe, not ſo much for wakening of him. as for his diſeaſing. And howe he was ſo hault that he diſpiſed the plaine men of Phrigia, and Paphlagonia, &amp; being a Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne, would not be aſhamed to here men of his owne nacion by an interpreter. And where as Philotas had before moued to haue the oracle of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter enquired of, he ſayd it was ment therby to make God a lier, for knowledging Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, to be his ſonne, as though any man ſhould enuie the king for that title whiche the goddes had geuen him. But why (<abbr>qd</abbr> he) did he not aſke counſel of Iupiter afore he did offend, For nowe he would haue vs ſend for an oracle, that in the meane ſeaſon his father which ruleth in Media might raiſe a power vp, &amp; with the money y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath in cuſtody might aſſemble diſperat perſones to the felowſhip of his miſchief.

Then all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany was moued, and amonges the kinges houſhold there began a crye that the traytour ſhoulde be rent in peaces. Whiche thyng Philotas (who feared more greuous punyſhement) was content to heare. The kyng retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng into the preaſe, deferred the counſell till the next day, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit Philotas either to priſon there to be racked, or els in the meane ſeaſon to get further knowledge of thinges.

night yet commaunded he hys counſell to be called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Some of them thought it beſt Philotas ſhould be ſtoned to death after the Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lawes. Epheſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Craterus, and Cenus determined to haue the trouth tried by tormentes, and then they which counſeled the contrary turned to their opynion. Therfore when the counſel was broken vp. Epheſtion, with craterus and Cenus aroſe to take Philotas thexaminacion. The king called Craterus vnto him, and commauding the reſt to auoide, had ſecret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muinicacion with him in the innermoſte parte of his lodging, theffect wherof came not to any mans knowledg.

Craterꝰ mind was that whatſoeuer was confeſſed before, ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed by Philotas againe vpon the racke. Whych whiles he was taken vp. hys eyes bounden, and ſpoyled of his clothes, cried out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lawe of nature, and the gods of the countrey. But al was in vaine to their death eares. Fynally as a condempned man, he was torne wyth moſte extreame torments by his enemies, that wronge him ſore for the kinges pleaſure. And notwithſtanding that at the firſt fire on the one ſide, and ſcourges on thother were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred vnto him, more to payne him then for any exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion ſake, yet he had powre of him ſelf to refraine both from ſpeaking and groning.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29057:126"/>
Then he promiſed if they would torment him no more, he would confeſſe whatſoeuer they ſhoulde require to know. But firſt he would haue them ſwere by the life of Alexander, that thei ſhoulde ceſſe their tormentes, &amp; ſet the racke aſide. The which thing obteyned, he ſaied to Craterus: Tell me what wil ye haue me to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe?

if we can ſuffer this. He doth not onelye deſpiſe men, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods alſo, which wil be reputed a God. We haue loſt Alexander, we haue loſt our kyng.

Our cauſe is ſuche that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not doubt of it, and we are paſſed the feare of fortune. Therfore with your fauoure I wil aunſwere firſt thoſe poyntes wherwith you charged vs laſte. We knowe moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that we be innocent of any kind of wordes ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the derogation of your maieſtie. And durſt affirme that you had ouercome all enuy of men, but that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture you would thinke that I wente aboute wyth faire wordes to excuſe thinges that haue bene malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpoken. Though it were ſo that wordes ſometime did eſcape vs, either when we were fainte, or weried in marchyng, haſardyng our ſelues in fightynge, or elles when we were ſicke, or dreſſyng of our wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt doynges otherwiſe do deſerue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſhoulde rather impute the ſame to the time, then to any euil diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vs. For it is commenly ſene where any thing chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth amiſſe, al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maner become gilty of this fault. We do violence ſometime to our owne bodies whiche we hate not. Yea, the comming of the fathers vnto the children ſometime is bothe vngratefull, and alſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But on the other ſide, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we receiue rewardes or giftes, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home with ſpoyle, who can the ſtay vs? who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſtraine our chearefulnes? or who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſiſt our courage in fighting? The nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nether to kepe meaſure in diſpleaſure, nor in gladnes.

wiues, children, and countrey, call vs backe agayne, &amp; dothe alter our purpoſe. But as ſone as the trumpet bloweth, ſtraight al theſe imaginations do paſſe away, and euerye man then runneth into his araye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon their enemies, the diſpleaſures thei haue conceiued within their lodgynges. I woulde Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas had offended but onelye in wordes, but paſſynge ouer that, I will returne to the other poynte wherof we be accuſed. The frendſhip y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was betwixt Philotas &amp; vs. I will not onely not denye, but alſo confeſſe that we did couet the ſame, &amp; receiued therby great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. Do you maruaile that we did honoure and eſteme the Sonne of Parmenio, whom you did choſe to be next about your perſone, and did auaunce aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des? you your ſelf (if it pleaſe you to heare the trueth) are the cauſe of this our peryl. What other thing moued vs to couet Philotas frendſhyppe, then that wee deſired to pleaſe you. By his preferment we were aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to that degree of your fauour. He ſtode in ſuch caſe wyth you, that it behoued vs as well to ſue for his beneuolence, as to feare to get his diſpleaſure. Haue not we ſworne that we ſhoulde repute your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies our enemies? and honoure your frendes as our owne? Should we haue bene found diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in thys bonde of our dutie? and ſpecially towardes him, whom ye did preferre aboue al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If this be a fault, ye haue fewe innocentes, or ſurely none at all. All men deſired to be Philotas frendes, but all that did couet coulde not be accepted. So if ye will make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the parteners of his treaſon, and ſuche as were his frendes, then ſo many be offenders as would haue bene his frendes. What preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption haue you now that we ſhoulde offende? I thinke becauſe yeſterday Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
<pb facs="tcp:29057:131"/>
talked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs familiarly alone. Therof I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelfe, if yeſterday I chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged any thing of mine accuſtomed maner &amp; liuyng, but if ſo be we vſed euery day to do the like, then cuſtome muſt nedes make it to be none offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But it may be ſaid the horſes were not deliuered to Antiphanes? and the day before Philotas was detected, this matter was betwene Antiphanes &amp; me, for which cauſe if he wold make me to be ſuſpected becauſe I deliuered him not my horſes that day. There ſhal riſe a doubtfull plee betwene the denier &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, ſauing that his cauſe is better that kepeth ſtil his owne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his that requireth another mans. I had ten horſes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which Antiphanes had diſtributed .viii to ſuche as had loſte their owne, ſo there remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind onely two, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would proudly, &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully haue taken away. I was enforced to kepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtil, except I would haue ſerued on fote. I can not denye but this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was had betwene a man of a fre ſtomake, &amp; a perſon of a vile nature, which could do no maner ſeruice, but take away me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s horſes, &amp; geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to other. What miſchef is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at one time I muſt purge my ſelfe both to Alexander and to Antiphanes. But to the other poynte that your mother did write to you of vs, as of your enemies. I would god ſhe had more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly bene careful of hir ſonnes ſafegarde, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubtfully imagined ſuch fained figures. Why doth ſhe not alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of hir feare? Beſides ſhe ſheweth not hir aucthour, nor yet ſignifieth one word wherby ſhe was moued to write to you ſuche letters of feare. O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched eſtate of mine, whiche ſtandeth in leſſe haſarde to howe my peace, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake. Yet howſoeuer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall paſſe. I had rather mine excuſe ſhoulde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you, then my cauſe. If you remembre when ye
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29057:131"/>
ſente me to fetche newe ſouldiours out of Macedon, ye ſhewed me that in your mothers houſe there lurked many luſty yong ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlemen, wherfore ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded me that in executing your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhould ſpare none, but brynge with me perforce all ſuche as refuſed the warres. Whyche thynge I did, and fulfilled your will therin more largelye then was expedient for me. For I brought vnto you Gorgeas, Herateus, and Gorgata, whiche nowe miniſter vnto you right acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. What creature therfore is more wretched the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I? which if I had not fulfilled your will, ſhould rightfully haue ſuffered, and nowe peryſhe becauſe I obeyed you. For truely there was none other cauſe that moued your Mother to perſecute vs, then that we preferred your vtilitie before a womans fauoure. I brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you of Macedons .vi.M. footemen. &amp; .viii. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred horſemen, of the which, the more part woulde not haue folowed me. If I hadde releaſed ſuche as woulde not haue come. It is reaſon therefore, that in as muche as your mother is diſpleaſed wyth vs for your cauſe, that ye mitigate her, in whoſe diſpleaſure ye haue put vs. Whiles Amyntas was thus pleadynge his cauſe, thei y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had purſued his brother Palemon (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpake before) came leadyng him bounde into the place.<note place="margin">Palemon.</note> Then the rage of the people could ſcareſly be pacified, but as the maner was in ſuch cauſes, thei would haue ſtoned Palemon to deathe. Yet he boldelye ſpake to theim and ſaied. I deſire no fauoure for my ſelfe, ſo that my fliynge be not hurteful to the innocency of my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom if ye can not thinke cleare, let the faulte be layed to me. For their matter appeareth the better, becauſe I whyche fled awaye am ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Aſſone as he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe wordes, the whole aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble

were inclined in his fauoure. and reſolued to teares, beyng ſo ſodainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary turned, that now they were al conuerted on his parte, whiche a litle before were al againſt him. He was in the prime ſtoure of his youth, &amp; through other mens feare, fled away amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt thoſe horſemen, which were amaſed at Philotas tormentes. His co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panye had left him behinde, &amp; whiles he was in doubte whether he might turne againe, or fle further forwardes, was taken by theim whiche purſued after him. He the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began to wepe, and beate him ſelfe about the face, not ſo much lamentyng his owne chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe of his brethren beyng in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger for his cauſe, with which his behauour he moued the kyng, and al the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there preſent. Onely his brother Amintas coulde not be pacified, but behelde him with a fierce counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, &amp; ſaied: O madde creature, then oughteſt thou to haue wept, when thou diddeſt put thy ſpores to thy horſe, as a traitour to thy brethren, and a companion of traitours.

Palemon therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confeſſed him ſelfe to haue offended in that pointe, but more greuouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his brethren, then towardes him ſelfe. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multitude coulde not abſtaine from weaping &amp; ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, being tokens wherby men in an aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble are wont to declare their affections, and with one conſent they cried all to the kyng with one voyce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he woulde ſpare innocentes, and men of ſeruice, his frendes alſo vpon that occaſion did riſe, and with wepyng eyes required the kynge of mercye.</p>

In the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the guarde whiche had commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereunto, brought furth his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When the kyng ſawe Poledamas pale for feare, he called hym nere, and commaunding al men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, ſayd vnto hym. Through Parmenios treaſon,<note place="margin">Alexanders wordes to Poledamas</note> we were all in daunger, but chiefly I and thou, whome vnder colour of frendſhip, he diſceiued moſte: In the purſuyng and puniſhement of whome, ſee howe much I truſt thy fidelitie, for I am determined to vſe the as a miniſter therein, and whiles thou goeſt about it, thy brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe thy pledges.

So that when Parmenio ſhall ſee both the, &amp; the letter ſealed with his ſonnes ringe, he wilbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuſpition. Polydamas being thus deliuered of his feare, promiſed his diligence a great deale more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly then he was required. When Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſawe his promptnes in the matter, bothe commended his good will, and rewarded him accordingly. And Polidamas chaunged his owne apparell, and toke other after the Araby faſhion with two men of the ſame countrey, to be his guide, for whoſe truth their wifes and children were pledges in the meane ſeaſon. And ſo they paſſed on Camels through ſuche places as were deſert for lacke of moyſture, and within .xi. dayes came to their iourneys ende, before any knewe of their commyng. Polydamas then toke againe his Macedons appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and in the dead of the night,<note place="margin">Cleander.</note> came into Cleanders lodging, whiche had the chief auctoritie there, next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parmenio.

The capitaines whiche had receiued commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the kynges letters to kyll hym, came to Parmenio, walkyng vnder the ſhadow of the trees, beyng agreed amonges them ſelues to execute the thyng, when he ſhould begynne to rede his letters. So ſone as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio had ſpied Polydamas comming a farre of, with a ſemblaunt of ioye (as it appeared by his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) ranne to embrace hym, and after ſalutacion geuen eche to other, deliuered the kinges letter.

The moſte part departed, ſauing a fewe whiche required inſtantly that at the leſt they might be ſuffred to bury the body. It was denied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> long by reaſon of Cleander, who dreaded the kynges diſpleaſure, but becauſe they beganne to waxe more earneſt, intending to auoyde matter of ſedicion, he cut of the head whiche he ſent to the kyng, and lefte them the body to bury. This was the end of Parmenio, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man both in warre and peace, many thynges had he done valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly without the kyng, but the kyng with out hym did euer any thyng worthy prayſe.

Wherfore he willed ſuche as by their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſcloſed them ſelues to be wery of the trauaill of the warres, for their reproche to be put in a band apart from the reſt. Wherby he both gaue them occaſion to ſhewe their hardines, and beſides remoued the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their tongues, from the credulous eares of the reſt.

the ſnowe is vaniſhed away, they reſtore them agayne to the ayer and to the ſonne.

The armye brought into this countrey deſtitute of all cultiuacion of man, ſuffred all the diſcomodities and miſeries that might be endured, both of hungre, colde, werynes, and diſpayre. There were many of them that died for colde, and the ſnowe deſtroyed their feete, but ſpecially it peryſſhed many mennes ſyght. When they were weried and not able to traueyll any further, they layd themſelues downe vpon the froſen ſnowe. Whiche hauyng once left the mocion of their bodies, whiche ſtored in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their naturall heate.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. And remedy was there none in this matter but to compell them to go forwardes, for then by ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of them ſelues their naturall heat was reuiued, and they recouered agayne ſome ſtrength. Suche as recouered the Cotagies wherin the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treymen dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, were very well refreſſhed. But the darkenes was ſo greate, that the houſes could not be otherwyſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerned then by the ſmoke. The inhabiters that had neuer ſene ſtraungers before amonges them, when they behelde the armed men come ſodaynly vpon them, were amaſed for feare, and brought furth what ſoeuer they had, to ſaue their bodies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He was ſene, one while in the forward, another while in the middes, and ſome tyme in the rereward to the great trauaill of his body. At length they came to places better manured, where he refreſſhed his army with plenty of vittels, &amp; there remained in campe till ſuche tyme as al that were left behinde, came vnto their fellowes. Then he went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes with his army to the mount Caucaſus whiche deuideth all Aſia into two partes.<note place="margin">Caucaſus.</note> For on the one ſyde it ſtretcheth towardes the ſea of Cilicia, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, to the Caſpian ſea, to the ryuer of Araxes, and the deſertes of Scythia.

Some of them ronning into the redde ſea, ſome into the Caſpian and Hircanian ſea, &amp; other into the Sea of Ponte. In .xvii. dayes Alexander with hys army paſſed the mounte Caucaſus, wherin a rocke that is .x. furlonges in compaſſe, and foure in height,<note place="margin">Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus.</note> the antiquitie fayned that Prometheus laye bound.

of the warres beyng at meate. And when thei were wel charged with wine, thei extolled greatly their owne power, and deſpiſyng the raſhenes of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and their ſmall numbre. But chiefelye Beſſus was moſte arrogant in his wordes, who puffed vp with pride by reaſon of the kingdome he had newely gotten by treaſon,<note place="margin">Beſſus wordes.</note> and not maſter of his wyttes began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare howe that Darius by his folye hadde encreaſed his enemies fame, who woulde nedes fight with them in the ſtraightes of Celicia, when by retirynge backe he myght haue drawen them (before they ſhoulde haue ben ware) into deſert places, and there haue put riuers and mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines betwene his enemies and him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the ſaine ſo encloſed them, that they coulde by no poſſibilitye haue fledde away, and much leſſe make any reſiſtaunce. Wherfore (he ſaied) he was become of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go backe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges the Sogdians, wheras the riuer of Oxus ſhoulde be as a walle betwixte him and his enemies, tyll ſuche time as he myghte aſſemble a ſtronge power of the nacions therabout: knowing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that the Choraſmyons, the Dahans, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, the Indians, and Scythyans inhabitynge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the riuer of Tanais, woulde come to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was none ſo little, that any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon with the toppe of his heade coulde reache to his ſhoulders.

and an honeſt man. He making a preamble before his tale:<note place="margin">Cobarus wordes.</note> ſayd. He was not ignoraunt howe muche more better it was to be obedient to others counſell then to be a counſell geuer. For ſuche as be folowers of other mennes deuiſes, are ſure to haue no worſe fortune then the reſt, but ſuche as be authours and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of any matter, commonly prepare their owne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, and therwith deliuered the cup he had in his hand, and proceded thus: The nature of man in this reſpect may be called peruers and euell, becauſe euery one can ſe better in other mennes matters, then in their own. Their counſels muſt nedes be alwayes full of pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacion, whiche take their own aduiſe. For feare is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to ſome, deſire vnto other and to many, the ſelf loue of the thyng that they haue deuiſed, I will not ſpeake of pryde nor impute it vnto you. Ye haue ſene experience howe euery man doth exteme that thyng only to be beſt, whiche he him ſelf hath inuented. The diademe of a kyng that you were vpon your head is a great burden, whiche if it be not borne moderatly, the weight therof will oppreſſe the berer: It is not furye can auayle in this caſe, but wyſe and prudent counſel. When he had ſpoken thoſe wordes, he reherſed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe commonly vſed amonges the Bactrians which is, that the fearfull dogge dothe barcke more then he doth byte, and that the depeſt ryuers doth runne with leſt noyſe.

You ſay that you will drawe your aſſiſtaunce from the ryuer of Tanais, and that you will put ryuers betwixt you &amp; your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I would know if he be not able to folowe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you ſhall flee. If the way be indifferent, it muſt nedes be moſte eaſy and aſſured to the victorer. And though you thinke feare wil make much ſpede, yet hope is more ſwifter. It were therfore me thinkes expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to procure the fauour of hym that is the mightieſt, and yelde your ſelf vnto the ſtronger. Howe ſoeuer he ſhal accept it, your fortune is more lyke to be better that way, then to remayne ſtill an enemy. Conſider that you poſſeſſe another mans kyngdome, and therfore ye may the better departe therwithall. For ye cannot be a iuſt kyng, till you receiue the kyngdome of hym that is able to gyue it, and toke it away. This is a faythfull counſell, wherfore it is not neceſſary to delay the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution therof. The horſe that of noble courage is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with the ſhadowe of a rodde. But the dulle beaſt is not pricked forward with the ſpoores. Beſſus that was fierſe of nature and well ſet forwardes with drynking, became in ſuche a fury with his wordes that he could ſcarſely be holden by his frendes, from the ſleing of Cobares, for he pulled out his ſworde to haue done the dede, and departed out of the feaſt in a greate rage. But Cobares in this ſtore eſcaped away &amp; came vnto Alexander. Beſſus had .viii.M Bactria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s armed attending vpon him.

Then the Arians ſeyng their capitayne ſlaine whom they hadde folowed rather of neceſſitye then of their owne free wylles, called to remembraunce Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders benefites and yelded them ſelues to Erigius.

In the wante of water (that hath bene declared before) deſperation moued theim to thieſt before they had deſire to drinke. For by the ſpace of .iiii.C. furlonges, they founde no water at all.

            <p>But when the daye came and the heate roſe, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drought driyng vp al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natural humoures both their

mouthes and their bowels were enflamed for heate. Then their hartes failed, and their bodies fainted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge in caſe that thei could neither ſtand ſtyl, nor paſſe forwardes. A few that were taught by ſuche as knew the countrey, had gotten water whiche refreſhed them ſomewhat, but as the heate encreaſed, ſo their deſire grewe againe to drinke. Then was there no remedye but to geue amonges the ſouldiours all the wine &amp; oile that remained in ſtore. For drinke was ſo ſwete vnto them, that it toke away the feare of any thirſt to come. But ſuche as had gulled in gredely the water that thei gote, became ſo heauye, that they were neither able to beare their armoure, nor go forwardes, ſo that thei ſemed then moſte happy that had gotten no water at all, for ſuche as had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it inordinately, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by vomit to put vp the ſame againe. As Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander carefull in this calamitie ſtode with his frendes that wer perſwading of him to haue reſpect to him ſelf, for that he onely, and the greatnes of his harte, ſhould be reliefe of this aduerſitie. There came two ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, whiche goynge before wyth ſuche as had taken vp the campe, had founde water, and were cariynge of it in bottelles vnto their ſonnes whiche were ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for wante of drincke behynde in the armye.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to whom they caried that water: they ſaied to their ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes. Then he reſtored to him the cuppe again ful as it was geuen him, and ſaied: I wyl not drynke alone, for ſo lyttle can not be deuided amonges vs all. Make you haſte therefore to carye to your Sonnes that you haue gotten wyth your trauayle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:29057:140"/>But he trauayled ſo long that before night he came to the ryuer of Oxus, the more parte of the army, not able to folowe, for feblenes were left farre behind: to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therefore that ſuche as folowed after, might know where the campe was become. He cauſed a fier to be made in the toppe of an hille, and gaue ordre that when the voward had refreſſhed them ſelues with meate &amp; drinke they ſhould fill their bottels, with water and go back with theſame to releaue their fellowes. The breath of ſuche as dronke intemperatly cloſed vp, and they died immediatly, the nombre of whom was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then euer Alexander loſt in any battayll. But he would neither put of harneys, refreſhe hym ſelf with meate or drinke, nor eaſe his body: but ſtode in the way where his army paſſed, not departing till the laſt man was come into the Campe. He watched all that night, and paſſed it ouer in great trouble of mynd. And the daye that enſued, brought no releaſe of his care. For there were neither bootes to paſſe the ryuer with all, nor he coulde make any brydge ſeyng there was no wood growing nere at hand. But at length he found out a deuiſe whereunto only neceſſitie did dryue hym, they toke beaſtes ſkynnes &amp; ſtuffed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> full of ſtrawe, wherupon they layd them ſelues, and ſome ſwomme ouer the water.

geuen to perfidie and falſhode, whiche in him was the more tollerable becauſe he iudged no miſchief to great for him that hath ſlayne his prince. For the reueng of Darius was a faire colour to his offence, but it is to be thought that his preſent fortune was more enuied, then his doinges by paſt, hated. When it was knowen that Alexander had paſſed the ryuer of Oxus, Spita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes did aſſociate with hym in counſell of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe Dataphernes.<note place="margin">Datapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

They agreed to the matter more redely then he would deſire them, and takyng to them .viii. young men that were ſtrong of perſonage, vſed this kinde of polecy. Spitamenes repayred to Beſſus, and getting hym alone, enformed hym that he had found out howe Dataphernes, and Catenes, had conſpired to deliuer him aliue into Alexanders handes, wheras (he ſaid) he had preuented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiles they were about their purpoſe, hauing taken them both, &amp; put them faſt in priſon.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And for the deſire he had to be reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, willed Spitamenes to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his preſence. He cauſed their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to be bound behind their backes and to be brought by ſuche as were priuy to their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, when they came in Beſſus preſence, he beheld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a fell countenaunce and roſe vp to haue ſtriken at them. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they left their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeiting &amp; ſtreight wayes encloſing Beſſus about, bound him faſt whiche ſtrugled in vayne and pulled the diademe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his head, tearing his garment from his back, whiche was parte of the ſpoyle of his prince, whome he had ſlayne.

by the plague they ſent hym, that bothe they fauoured Darius, and were frendes to Alexander, whoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies euermore preferred his victory. It is vncertain whether the multitude would haue aſſiſted Beſſus or no, but that ſpitamenes had deuyſed the thyng to be done by Alexanders appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherby he put them in feare being yet doubtfull of mynde, and ſet Beſſus vpon an horſe whereupon he brought hym vnto Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.

They had not all together forgotten their countrey cuſtomes, but had myxed their tongue that by little and little they were fallen from their owne language, and yet had not attayned the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſpeache. They receyued the kyng with great ioye, yealdyng them ſelues and their cytie vnto his wyll. Whereupon he called vnto hym the Myleſians that ſerued hym in his warres,<note place="margin">Mileſians</note> (who bare an auncient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the generacion of the Branchidans) &amp; put it in their handes to determine where thei would ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey ſake, or els deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the iniury

The next day when the Branchidans came to mete him, he returned them all againe into the cytie, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding his footemen to encloſe the cytie about, entered with ſuche as he appointed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and by a token geuen put all to the ſworde, and ſpoyled the cytie as a receptacle of traytours. They whiche were without armour and vnprouided were ſlayne in euery place. For neither the affinitie of their tongue, nor any prayer or interceſſion could mitigate their enemies crueltie. Whiche after the deſtruction of the towne, did caſt downe the walles to the foundacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that no memory therof ſhould remayne. That done they did not only cut downe the woodes wherin they vſed their ſacrifice, but alſo plucked vp the trees by the rootes, that the ground might be left barayn as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.

When Spitamenes was come with him in Alexanders preſence, he ſayd: I haue brought here vnto you the kyller of his owne maiſter, after the ſame maner that he him ſelf gaue then ſample, wherin I haue both reuenged Darius that was my king, and

He had no hart to make anſwere, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe his offence: ſauing that he ſayd he toke vpon him to be kyng, becauſe he might deliuer hym poſſeſſion of the countrey. Whiche thing if he had omitted, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue taken in hande.

And though it was a conning not ſo muche to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled at, in a nacion ſo expert in ſhooting, yet was it greatly wondred at of ſuche as did beholde him, &amp; was great honour vnto the doer.

When they were commaunded to ſit downe, they ſaid: that he ring of his hurte, they were as ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it as his owne ſubiectes whiche ſhould welbe knowen, for if they could find out the perſone, that did the dede, he ſhuld be deliuered vnto his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des.

daunting of whome Alexander cauſed Spytamenes and Catenes (the betrayers of Beſſus) to be ſent for, thinking by their meanes to bring the countrey agayn to his obedience and to ſubdue ſuche as had made this ſturre. But they whiche were iudged mete to ſtay the rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and were ſent for to that intent, were the chief authours of all the reuolt, whiche cauſed it to be noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed abrode, that Alexander had ſent for the Bactrian horſemen of purpoſe to kill them all. Whiche commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (they ſayd) being appointed to them, they would not execute becauſe they thought it ouer foull an act to commit againſt their countreymen. And for that cauſe could as il beare then Alexanders crueltie, as in times paſt Beſſus treaſon. By this meanes when feare of death was put into their heades, they were eaſely ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to armes whiche before were ſufficiently enclyned of their owne myndes. When Alexander was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of their doinges, he willed Craterus to beſiege Cyropolis.<note place="margin">Ciropolis.</note> And he him ſelf warme an other city of that countrey by an aſſault whiche he gaue to it on all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes at once, and by a ſigne geuen, cauſed all the chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be put to death, making the reſt a pray for the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. This done the cytie was raſed to the ground, to thintent that others by their enſample might be kept in obedience. There was a valiaunt people called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macenans,<note place="margin">Memace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans.</note> who were determined to abide the ſiege, not only for their honeſties ſake, but alſo for that they thought it moſte for their ſuertie. For the mitigating of whoſe wilfulnes the kyng ſent to them fifty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to declare his clemency towardes ſuche as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them ſelues, and howe inexorable he was to ſuche as he wan by force. Their anſwere was to them, that they neither doubted of the kynges promis, nor of
<pb facs="tcp:29057:144"/>
his power, but after their anſwere geuen, they lodged them without their walles, where as enterteining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great there till it was the depe of the nyght, they ſet vpon them, and ſlewe them all. Alexander was no leſſe moued with this matter, then the caſe required, but made an aſſault vnto the cytie on all partes at once, whiche he found furniſſhed in ſuche wyſe, that he could not take it at the firſt attempt. Wherfore he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Meleager and Perdicas to the ſiege therof, whiche firſt were at the ſiege of Ciropolis, mynding to ſpare theſame, becauſe it was builded by Cyrus. For he had not ſo great admiracion of any kyng that had reigned in thoſe partes as of hym, and Semyramis, whoſe magnaminitie of mynde and fame of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſemed to hym to excede all the reſt. But the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wilfulnes of the inhabitauntes, ſturred vp his wrath. For when he had taken the cytie, he willed the Macedons to ſpoyle it, whiche had great cauſe to be moued againſt them, and ſo returned agayne to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager and Perdicas. There was not one cytie that did more valiauntly abide the ſiege then the ſame did, for both the hardieſt of the ſouldiers were ſlayne, and the kyng was brought in great daunger, being ſtriken in the necke with a ſtone, ſo that he loſt his ſight, and was felled to the earth ſo that he loſt his ſence. The army lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, thinking he had bene dead: but he was inuincible againſt thoſe thinges which put other men moſte in feare. For without tarieng he dreſſed his wounde, and returned to the fyght, and after anger had ſturred vp, the egernes he had of nature, he renued the aſſault againe more fierſely then before. At length a great peace of the wall was ouerthrowen by a myne at the whiche he brake in, and put the whole cytie to

This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt time that Alexander had to do with theſe people, when he ſawe that then he had to entre into a warre, for the which he was not prouided, his enemies riding vp &amp; downe in his ſight, and he diſeaſed of his wound, ſpecially not hauing thuſe of his ſpeach, which failed much by reaſon of this longe abſtinence,<note place="margin">Alexanders wordes to hys friendes</note> and the paine in his necke, called his friendes to counſell, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that he was not troubled with any fear of his ennemies but with the iniquitye of the tyme, the Bactrians rebelling, &amp; the Scithians prouokyng him, when neyther he was able to ſtande vpon the ground, or ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g enough to ryde on horſbacke, or in caſe to geue aduiſe or exhortacion to hys men.

The Bactrians be reuolted, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe ſhoulders yet we ſtande, purpoſing to trie what courage we be of, by our behauour towardes the Scithians.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vpon his wordes was wonderfully troubled both with anger and ſhame, when he ſawe the ſecretes of the religion brought to light, which he thought to haue kept ſecrete to him ſelf: and therfore cauſed Erigius to go aſide, and Ariſtander to be called in vnto him.

And by reaſon the ſwiftnes of the footemen was little inferior vnto the horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they troubled greatly the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre of the horſemans fight.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of an honeſt death. Menedemus rid vpon a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g horſe charging oft times vpon his enemies, wherby he brake their ordre, and made great ſlaughter, till ſuch tyme, that he being laid at on all partes,<note place="margin">Hiſpydes.</note> receiued many woundes, and fainted for want of bloud. Then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted Hiſpides that was one of his frendes to leape vpon his horſe, and eſcape away, and with that worde he ſwounded &amp; fel to the ground from his horſe. Hiſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des might haue got away, but after he had loſt his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d determined there to die, taking no other care but how to ſpend his life, with the loſſe of his enemies.

There were ſlaine in that battaill two .M. footemen, and .iii. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſemen. Whiche miſadue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture Alexander with great policy kept ſecret, commaunding them that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the field, vnder payne of death not publyſhe this matter abrode. But when he could not beare out any lenger a countenaunce contrary to his harte, he went alone vnto his pauilion whiche he had ſet of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuers ſide.

Alexander with ſuche men as he had choſen to be about his perſone, firſt lanched from the land, and directed his courſe towardes the further ſide. The Scythians came againſte them with their horſemen in ordre of battaill, ſtanding upon the brinck of the further ſhore to let their landing: whoſe ſhewe being a terrour to the Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, thei had alſo an other cauſe of feare in their paſſing ouer, for the boatemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were not able to keape their courſe againſte the force of the ſtreame. And the ſouldiers ſwaying to and fro, for the doubte they had to fal in the water, troubled the mariners in doing of their office. By reaſon wher of the Macedons could not haue ſcoope to caſte their dartes with any force, taking more care howe to place them ſelues out of perill, then for to auoyde their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

When the Scithians ſawe them nere the ſhore, they did ſhote an infinite nombre of arrowes into the boates, ſo that there was not in maner any target that had not many heades ſticking in it. At length the boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes arriued at the land, then the target men did ryſe vpon their feete, and hauing more ſcope and ſure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, threw their dartes more certainly &amp; with greater force: wherby when they perceiued their enemies to ſhrinke, and reane backe their horſes, they then leaped

cherefully vnto the land, one exhorting and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging an other, and frely purſued the Scythians who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſawe falle out of aray. By that tyme Alexanders horſemen which had aſſembled them ſelues in tropes, brake vpon their ennemies, and put them to great dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſordre. In the meane ſeaſon the reſt being defended by them that were fighting landed and prepared them ſelues to the battell. Nor Alexander letted not wyth ſtowtnes of courage to ſupplye the impotency of hys bodye. Hys voyce could not be hard when he ſpake &amp; exhorted his men (the ſcarre of his wound not yet clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) but all men might ſe him fighting. Wherefore euery one vſed the office of a captaine in giuing exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion vnto hys fellowes, and ran vpon their ennemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wythout reſpect of their owne liues. Then the Scythians could not endure any lenger the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the force, nor the crye of ther enemies, but being all on horſback fled away vpon the ſpoores.

They would labour not to be ouercome in good will, nor in doyng the thing that pertained to their dutie. Thei were axed what pledge they would laye of their promyſe.

About the ſame time Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus and Menidas brought .iii.M. footemen and a thouſand horſemen of mercenary ſouldiers, and one Alexander came to him out of Licia with .iii.M. foote men and .v.C. horſemen.

When he had thus encreaſed his armye with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of his newe power, he went about in euery place to quiet thoſe ſlures that bene raiſed vp by the rebellion.

Wherewith the king was pleaſed, and content, men ſhuld beleue that theſame was ſent by the gift of god.

Whiche wordes reported to the kyng, did put in ſuche an heate, that ſtreightwayes he called for ſuche as he vſed to conſult with all, declaryng the pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Arymazes, and after what maner he had ſkorned him. But ſhortly (he ſaid) he would deuiſe ſuch waye, that he would make hym thynke the Macedons had wynges.

When they had heard the king ſpeake after that maner, they imagined the thing won, and departing out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, prepared ſtrong ropes and yron hokes, whiche they might aſten to the rockes, and ſo clyme vp. The king brought them about the rock, where as it ſemed leſt ſtepe and moſte plaine to mounte vpon, and in the ſecond watche willed them to paſſe forwardes with good ſpeade. They being furniſſhed with two dayes vitell, and arme only with ſwordes and ſpeares, at the firſt we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forwardes without any great difficulty. But when they came to the ſteapnes of the rock, ſome toke hold of the broken cragges to lift vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; ſome faſtening their hokes on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rockes, clame vp by the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. They were compelled to reſt &amp; ſtay diuers tymes, and ſo conſumed the day in trauaill &amp; in feare. When they had paſſed many difficult places, further difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alwayes appeared, the height of the rock ſeming to to growe more &amp; more. When they failed either of their hold or of their footing, it was a miſerable thing to ſee howe they fell downe hedlong, ſhewing to the other by their miſfortune, an enſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple what was likely to beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was day they wakened

out of their deape ſleape, and beholding the valeis vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath them, were ignoraunt in what parte of the rocke ſo great a multitude of their enemies ſhould lye, but at length thei perceiued by the ſmoke in what place they were. Then vpon the pointes of two ſpeares they ſet vp the ſigne that was appointed them, and founde that in their coming vp, they had loſt of their nombre two and thirty. The kyng being carefull not ſo muche for the deſire he had to winne the rocke, as for to ſaue thoſe whom he had ſent to ſo manifeſt a dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, ſtode all daye beholding the toppe of the mountayne. And when darckenes of the night toke away the proſpecte of the eyes, he departed to refreſhe his body. The next day before it was ful light, he perceiued the white cloth ſet vp in the toppe of the rocke, but the varietie of the ayer, and the ſonne beginning to apeare and yet hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cauſed him to doubte a while whether his ſighte had fayled him or no. But when it was full and open daye, it appeared manifeſtly, and all doubte was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. Then he called Cophes, by whome he had attempted their myndes before, willing him ones agayne to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte them to be better aduiſed. And if ſo be that in truſt of their ſtrength, they would not ſubmit them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that then he ſhould ſhewe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the men that had taken the rocke ouer their heades. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cophes came thether, he beganne to perſuade Arimazes to geue vp his ſtrength, therby to winne the kinges fauour, and not enforce him to ſtay in the ſiege of a rock, hauing ſo many weighty affaires in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: But he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him more obſtinat and proude then he did before, and willed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes to depart and moue him no more in the matter. Then he toke Arimazes by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and required him to go with him out of the caue. When they were come
<pb facs="tcp:29057:155"/>
where as they might loke about, he ſhewed him thoſe that were gotten to the top of the cragge, and ſkorning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pride: axed of him whether Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders ſouldiers had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> winges or no? but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time the tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pettes were blowen in the Macedons campe, &amp; thei might here the alarome that was made in the armye. Whiche matter as many and vaine and trifling thinges are wont in the warres to growe to greate effect, ſo that was the cauſe why they yelded them ſelues. For feare ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, that they could not conſider the ſmalle nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre that were ouer their heades, but called Cophen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in great haſt, who was departed away, and ſent with him Alexander .xxx. of the chief men, authoriſed to yelde vp the rocke with compoſition for to depart in ſauegard. But Alexander not withſtanding that he doubted, leſt his enemies diſcouering the fewnes of his men, might put them to diſtreſſe: yet truſting in the felicitie of his owne fortune, and offended with the pride of Arimazes, would agre to no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, but that they ſhould yelde ſimply. Arimazes therupon diſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more of his eſtate, then he had cauſe. Deſcended downe to the campe with the chiefeſt of the nacion, that were of kinne to him. All the whiche Alexander cauſed to be ſcourged with roddes, and be crucified at the foote of the rocke. The multitude that yelded with the money that there was taken, were geuen in gifte to thinhabiters of the newe cities. And the rule of the ſayd rocke was committed to Artabaſus, with the charge of the countrey there about.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:29057:157"/>
as he began to deface the doynges of Philippe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aduauntynge the notable victorye at Cheroneſe to be his dede. The glorye wherof (he ſaide) was taken from him by the malice and enuy of his father. For he alledged howe in the mutine whiche roſe betwene the Macedons and the Greke ſouldiours, when Philippe lay hurt of a wounde whiche he receiued at that fraye. thought him ſelfe ſure no otherwiſe then to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite to be dead: When he defended his body wyth his buckeler, &amp; ſlewe them with his owne hand that ranne vpon Philip to haue killed him.

Wherupon ther did riſe a contencion betwene the yong men and the old. But the king enforcing a paciens in him ſelf, when he hard Clitus deface his prayſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull wrath in his mind. Yet it ſemed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold haue bridled his affection, if Clitus wold haue made ane and of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous talk. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would not ceaſſe, he gaue occaſion to Alexander to be further moued. Then Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus did procede ſo fareforth, that he durſt defend Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio caſe and prefarred the victory that Philip wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of the Athenyens, before the diſtruccion of Thebes, &amp; going further &amp; further, not only through dronkenſhip but euen of a forwardnes of a contencious minde, at length ſaid: If we muſt dye through the,<note place="margin">Clitus wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.</note> Clitus is the firſt. For they receyue greateſt rewards of thy victory that can moſt ſhamefully deface thy fathers memory. The cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Sogdia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is giuen vnto me, that hath ſo often rebelled, and now not onely vnſubdued, but ſuch one as by no meanes can be brought to ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am placed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs thoſe wild beaſtes, that be of ſuch an vnciuil diſpoſicion.

Ther was nothing that Clitus ſpeak or did in his raſhnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moued more y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honorable mencion made of Parmenio yet for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he kept in his greif &amp; was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund hym only to depart out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feſtnor ſpeake eny euil words againſt Clitus, Sauing that he ſaid: if he ſhould talke a little lenger he would brayde me with the ſauing of his life: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in very dede he wold oftentymes proudly aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him ſelfe. But notwithſtandinge that the king had willed hym to departe, yet he taried ſtil and would not riſe. And therefore ſuch as ſat next him toke him by the armes to leade him away blaming and giuing him exhortacion, for his better vſage. When Clitus ſawe him ſelfe drawn forth againſt his wyll. Ire was added to his dronknes, and declared then alowde: howe that he with his breſte defended the kinges backe, but now when the good turne was paſt, the very memory of his benefit was hated. And therwyth layd to his charge the death of Attalus, and fynally mocked the Oracle of Iupiter whom Alexander claymed to be his father and ſaid, that he told him better truth, then his father did. At thoſe wordes the king was ſturred to ſuche wrath, as he could ſcarſly haue borne being ſobre. But hauing then his ſences ouercome wyth drink leped ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly from the table. His frendes were amaſed wyth throwing down the cups for haſt, riſſe to wayt the end of the thing, they ſawe hym go about in ſuch a fury. He toke a ſpeare out of a ſquires hand and would haue ſtriken Clitus that was yet raging with thintempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of his toung. But he was ſtopped by Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus and Perdicas who tooke him in theyr armes &amp; ſtayed him for all hys ſtriuing. And Lyſimachus and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29057:158"/>
Leonatus toke away the ſpeare. Then he called to hys ſouldiers for ayde, crying out that he was taken by his next fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des as Darius was of late, &amp; willed the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to be blowen, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armed men might aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble vnto the court. Then Perdicas and Ptolomeus fell downe vpon their knees, requiring him that he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in his wrath, whiche he ſo ſodaynely had concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but rather reſpite his diſpleaſure, ſeynge that he might the next day much more better order the matter But his wrath preuayled ſo much, that his eares were ſhutte vp, and he ranne in a fury amonges the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, pluckyng a ſpeare from one of them, which once gotten, he ſtode in the entrye, throughe the whiche they that ſupped with him muſt nedes paſſe. When all the the reſt were come forth, Clitus came laſt without light And becauſe Alexander could not diſcerne him, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what he was, but that was done ſo terribly, that the cruelty of the acte he went about apeared in his voice. But Clitus which ſeyng the king in a fury, had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect howe much he had offended him before, aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was Clitus, whiche was commynge from the kinges banquet. With y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde he ſtrake him throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe the body ſo that he fel downe ſtarke dead, &amp; was al beſprinckeled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his bloud. Go now (quod he) to Philip, Parmenio, &amp; Attalus. Herein it may be ſene that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prouided euill in the diſpoſition of man, which for the more part can not conſider ſo well thinges to come as thoſe that be paſt. For after that Alexanders ire was aſſwaged, and his dronkennes paſt, weying aduiſedlye the foulenes of the acte he had done: conſidered then that thoughe Clitus hadde vſed ouermuch libertie in his talke, that yet he ought not to haue ſlayne ſo noble a manne of warre: yea, and the ſauer of his owne life,
<pb facs="tcp:29057:159"/>
though he were aſhamed to confeſſe it. He ſawe that he beyng a kyng hadde vſed the deteſtable office of an hangman, in reuengyng with wicked ſlaughter the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertye of wordes, whiche might haue bene imputed to wyne. When he behelde the bloude of hym whiche a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he had bydden to his banquet runne ouer all the entrey, and that the watchemen were ſo aſtonied and amaſed that they ſtode a farre of, and durſte not come nere, his ſolitarines cauſed hys repentaunce to be the greater. Then he plucked the ſpeare out of the dead corſe, and would haue thruſte it through his owne bodye, if the watchemen had not come runnynge, and with great ſtriuynge wronge the ſame out of his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. That done they toke hym vp, and caried him into hys lodgynge. Wheras he fell downe flatte vpon the grounde, fillyng full all the courte wyth the miſerable noyſe of hys howlynge and lamentation. He tare hys face wyth his nayles, &amp; required ſuche as ſtode aboute hym, that they woulde not ſuffer hym to lyue in ſuche a ſhame and diſhonoure. In theſe requeſtes he conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the whole nyght, and cauſed diligente ſearche to be made whether it were the ire of the Goddes or no, that had cauſed him to commit ſo haynous an acte. At length it was founde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the yerelye ſacrifice due vnto Bacchus was not done in due tyme. And therfore it appeared manifeſtlye that it ſhoulde be the wrathe of the Goddes, that hadde moued him to committe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon eatynge and drynckyng. But the greateſte thyng that encreaſed his ſorowe, was the amaſement of hys frendes, when he ſawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhrinke from hym, &amp; that none of them after that dede done, woulde gladly vſe ſuche familiar communication as they dyd before.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29057:159"/>
Then he parceyued that he ſhould liue as a wild beaſt in a deſart both fearing others, and alſo afrayed hym ſelfe. The next morning he commaunded the body blody as it was, to be brought into his chambre, which when he ſaw lyeng before him fell in weping and ſayd Shal I after this ſort requit my norſe whoſe .ii.<note place="margin">Alexanders lamentacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the deal of Clitus.</note> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ſlaine for my glory at milatun.

But Spitamenes iudging her not to do this by way of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſail, but of purpoſe to betray him, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe deſiered to ſubmit her ſelfe vnto Alexander in confidence of hir beuty, drew out his ſwerde to haue ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, if he had not bene letted by his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wife perceiued him to be in a depe ſlepe, ſhe pulled out a ſwerde which ſhe had kept ſecretely for that purpoſe, and cut of hys head, deliueryng the ſame being ſprinkeled with bloud vnto her ſeruaunte that was priuye to the facte, and with hym onely as ſhe was enbrued with bloude came vnto the Macedons campe, willynge it to be ſignified to Alexander that there was one come, that hadde to ſpeake with hym.

But when the kynge perceiued it to be a mans heade he departed forth of the tente, and by enquery vnderſtode the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The caſe brought him in greate perplexitie, and was dryuen by diuers imaginations into ſundrye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. He iudged the kyllynge of ſuche one beynge a fugityue and a rebell to be greate benefite vnto him, which liuynge myght haue bene a greate let and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to his proceadynges.</p>

The trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt whiche they leaned, was a great refuge &amp; helpe to manye. And yet they were not ignoraunte when they reſted, that thei choſe them ſelues a place of death, for when they lefte to moue their bodyes, the naturall heate left theim. But eaſe was ſo pleaſaunt to ſuch as were weried that they refuſed not to dye in reſting of them ſelues.

But neceſſity which in aduers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is of more force then any reaſon, founde out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medye for this colde.

Then a man would haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that the whole woode had bene on a flambe. For there was ſcarcely ſpace left betwixt the fires for men to ſtande.

Some recouered the cotagies whyche neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie cauſed them to ſeke out in the furthermoſt part of the woode, &amp; the ceſt recouered the campe, whiche was plonted in a moyſte ground.

But at length when his naturall heate came to hym, and perceiued it to be his kynges ſeate, and the kynge to be there preſente, was afrayed, and ſtarte vp agayne.</p>
            <p>But Alexander behelde hym in the face, and ſayed:

Polycarpon alſo ſubdued the countrey that was called Bubacen.<note place="margin">Bubacen.</note> And ſo hauing ſet all his thinges in ordre, he ſette his whole imagination vpon the warre of Inde, whiche was counted to be a very ryche countrey, and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound bothe with gold, perles, and precious ſtones, thynges more appertenent to voluptuouſnes, then to magnificence, and it was ſayde that the Souldiers there had their targettes made of Iuery, and of gold.

Then euery man preſent reuiled them, and the kyng enquired what he had done to them, why they ſhould conſpire his death. When all the other ſtode ſtyll and held their peace,<note place="margin">The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molaus to the kyng.</note> Harmolaus aunſwered thus. Thou doeſt demaunde this thyng of vs as though thou knoweſt not the matter. We went about to kyll the, becauſe thou beganne to reigne ouer vs, as ſlaues and not free borne. As he was ſpeakyng thoſe wordes his father Perſepolys firſt of all called hym traytour and murtherer of his parentes, ſtoppyng his mouthe with his hande, that he ſhould ſpeake no further. Then the kyng plucked his father backe, and wylled Harmolaus to ſpeake, ſuch thynges as he had learned of his maiſter Caliſtenes. Then Harmolaus proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: I will vſe thy benefite, and declare thoſe thynges whiche I haue learned to the greate myſchief of vs all. Howe ſmalle is the nombre of the Macedons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning, that haue eſcaped thy crueltye? Attalus, Philotas, Parmenio, Lynceſtes Alexander, and Clytus, be nowe deade, but to our ennemyes behoue alyue. They ſtode in the fyghte, and defended the with their ſwordes, receyuing woundes for thy glory and victory, whome thou haſte very well rewarded. The one be ſprynckled thy table
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29057:170"/>
with his bloud, and the other coulde not be ſuffred to dye a ſimple death. Thus the capitaines of thy people be tormented and put to death: a pleſaunt ſpectacle to the Percians, of whome they were victorers, Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio by whome thou diddeſt ſie thine enemy Attalus, was put to death without iudgement. Thus thou vſeſt thy handes of vs wretches, as inſtrumentes one to kill another, and whom thou diddeſt make thy tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, alitle before, ſtraightwayes thou commaundeſt them to be tormented of others. At thoſe wordes the multitude began to ſhout againſt Harmolaus, and his father drewe his ſworde of purpoſe to haue ſlaine him, if he had not bene letted by the kyng, whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Harmolaus to ſpeake, &amp; required the reſt to heare him paciently, whiche (he ſaid) enforced the cauſe of his own puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth with great labour thei held their peace, &amp; then Harmolaus began again: how libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is he to ſuffre rude children to ſpeake? When the voice of Caliſtenes is ſhut vp in priſon, becauſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to tell his tale, and why? becauſe thou fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the freſpeche of an innocent, &amp; becauſe thou canſt not endure to behold his face, &amp; yet I will iuſtifie he is not priuy to this matter. But other there be here that purpoſed with me a noble enterpriſe, of whom there is not any that can accuſe Caliſtenes of conſent, and yet thou that art our pacient and rightuous king haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined here his death. Theſe be the rewardes of the Macedons, whoſe bloud thou doeſt miſuſe as vile and of no valeur. Thou haſt .xxx.M. mules carieng ſpoyle and treaſure, and yet the poore ſouldiers cary nothing with them but vnrewarded woundes and ſkarres. All which thinges we did eaſely ſuffre before thou diddeſt betray vs to the barbarous, and after a newe trade, of

victourers make vs ſlaues. Thou alloweſt the apparell and diſciplyne of the Percians, and deſpyſeſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thine own cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. And therfore we determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kil the, not king of Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but kyng of Perce, and as a fugitiue we perſecuted the by the lawe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Thou wouldeſt haue the Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s knele to the and worſhip the as a god. Thou doeſt refuſe Philip for thy father, &amp; if any God had bene before Iupiter, thou wouldeſt haue refuſed him likewyſe. Doeſt thou maruaille if free men can not beare this thy pryde? what can we hope for at thy handes? ſeyng we muſte either dye as innocentes, or els that is worſe then death, lyue and remayne in boundage as ſlaues. Thou arte greatly in my debte, if by this thou couldeſt amende, for thou haſte begunne to learne of me, the thyng that free hartes cannot endure. Spare them whoſe age ſhalbe ſufficiently tormented with the loſſe of their chyldren, but vpon vs cauſe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be done, to thintent we maye obtayne by our owne death the thynge we ſought for by thyne.

The wall wherwith the citie was encloſed was .xxxv. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes in compaſſe, whereof the nether partes were builded of ſtonne, and the vpper partes of Claye.

And left the earth waſſhed vpon with the raine might fal altogether, there were ſtanchinges of Tymbre put betwixt to ſtay the holle worck: Which couered ouer wyth bordes was a waye for men to go vpon.</p>
            <p>Alexander beholding this kynde of fortificacion was vncertayne what to do, For he ſawe he could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche to the walles but by fylling of thoſe dikes and

Wherefore there could be deuiſed no way to wynne it except thoſe dikes were firſte fylled. There was a woode at hand which the king commaunded to be cut downe, and cauſyng the bowes to be ſhred of for the cariage, filled the holowes with the bare ſtockes. Alexander bare the fyrſt tree, and all the ſouldiers fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after with a couragious ſhowt, for there was no man that would refuce to do that they ſawe the kynge begynne: So that within .vii. dayes the dikes and hollowe places were fylled vp. Then the king apoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Agrians and the archers to go to the aſſaulte of the rocke, and did choſe .xxx. yonge men of ſuch as he iudged moſt apt for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe out of hys owne bande,<note place="margin">Charus and Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> to leading of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he apointed Charus and Alexander whom he put in remembraunce of his name that was in comen to them bothe.

not obſtaine, but making a ſigne to his guard that thei ſhoulde folowe him, was the fyrſte that ſet fote vpon the rock. Then there were fewe of the Macedons that would gladly haue taried behind, but many lefte their array where as they ſtode in ordre of battell, and folowed the king. The cauſe of many was miſerable whom the riuer that ran by ſwalowed in, when they fell downe from the rocke. Which ſight was ſorowfull to ſuch as were out of daungeir being admoniſhed by the perel of other, what they ought to feare them ſelfs So that their cumpaſſion being turned into feare, lamented aſwell them ſelues, as thoſe whome they ſawe ſlayne after that maner.

For there enemies rowled downe great ſtones vpon them wherwith they were eaſely beaten downe, the rocke hauing ſo ſlippar and vnſtable ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Yet for all that Charus and Alexander whiche were apointed the leading of the .xxx. choſen ſouldiers, had gotten to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> toppe, and beganne to fight hand to hand.

Wherefore Alexander bothe mynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his name, and of his promiſe, whiles he fought more egerly then warely, was encloſed aboute and ſlayne.

For both he cauſed the wayes to be cloſed vp. And made an approche with towers of woode, alwayes putting freſhe men in place of them that were weried. When the Indians parceiued Alexanders abſtinacy, two dayes and two night they banketed contiunially, and played vpon timbrels after there maner, to cauſe there enemies thinke that they had no doubte in the ſiege, but truſted ſuerly to preuaill.

For I neither dare affirme the thinges wherof I doubt, nor counceale ſuche thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as I haue receiued for truthe.

For he iudged, that ſince they habounded, &amp; were ſo laden with ſpoyle, they would rather ſeke to enioye ſuche thynges as they had gotten then to trauaill any further in getting of more.

Notwithſtanding all that he had ſayde, there was not one ſouldier that would open his mouth to ſpeake, but ſtode wayting that ſome of the princes, and great capitaynes, ſhoulde declare vnto the kynge their eſtates, and howe that there remayned not in them any obſtinat refuſall of the warres, but that they were ſo exhauſted with woundes, and weried with continuall trauaill that they were not able to endure any lenger.</q>

            <p> As they ſtode thus aſtonied and afrayed, keping ſilence and lookyng vpon the grounde, there beganne firſte a whiſperyng and a rumor, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes a lamentacion amonges them, and by lyttle and little thei beganne more manifeſtly to ſhewe their dolour, the teares fallyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their eyes.

Behold our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies deſtitute of bloud perced with ſo many woundes, and rotted with ſo many ſcarres.

When Cenus had made an ende of his tale, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> roſe a crie, and a lamentacion, whiche with confuſed voyces euery where called Alexandre their king, their father, and their lord. Then the other captaines &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thelders, whiche by reaſon of their age had the more honeſt excuſe, and greater aucthoritie, made the like requeſt. So that the king was not able to chaſtiſe them being in that obſtinacie, nor mitigate them being ſo moued. Therfore vncertayne what to do, he lept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudgement place, and commaunding his lodging to be ſhut in, admitted no man but ſuche as were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed about his perſone. Two dayes he conſumed in his anger, and the third he came furth amonges his men, cauſing .xii. aulters of ſquare ſtone there to be ſet vp as a monument of his expedicion, &amp; willed the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his campe to be made greater, and the places of mens lieng, to be enlarged bigger, then ſerued for their bodies. For he thought by the encreaſyng, of the fourme and ſhape of thynges to leaue a diſceitful wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Cenus chaunſed there to die, whoſe death the king lamented, but yet he ſaid: that for a few daies he had made a long oracion, as though he alone ſhuld haue returned into Macedon. By that time the nauy of ſhippes which he had apoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be made, ſtode in redines aflote. Memno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſeaſon brought him out of Thrace a ſupply of .vi.M. horſemen,<note place="margin">Wemnon.</note> &amp; beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from Harpalas .vii.M. fotemen, with .xxv.M. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that were wrought with ſiluer &amp; gold, which he diſtributed amonges his men, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the olde to be burned, purpoſing to paſſe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Occea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſea w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .M.

During the tyme he was about that buſines, he builded there two cyties wherof he called thone Nycea,<note place="margin">Nycea.

At length he came into a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey where as the ryuer of Hidaſpis and Aceſynes do ioyne togethers &amp; ronne from thence into the boundes of a nacion called Sobyons.<note place="margin">The Sobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> They declared that their predeceſſours came of Hercules army, whiche beyng left there ſicke, did inhabite the countrey. They were clothed in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſkinnes, vſyng clubbes for their weapons, and though they had left the cuſtomes of the Grekes, yet there appeared many thinges amonges them, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from whence they were deſcended. Here the kyng landed and merched .CCx. furlonges within the countrey, whiche he waſted, and toke the chiefeſt cytie in the ſame. There were .xl.M. men that ſtode in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt hym vpon a ryuer ſyde, but he paſſed the water, puttyng them to flyght, and after they fledde into the cytie, he wanne it by force. The chyldren were ſlayne, and the reſt ſolde as ſlaues. He aſſaulted an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cytie where he was repulced, with the great force of the defendauntes, and loſt many of his men. But when the inhabitauntes ſawe, that he continued ſtill the ſiege, diſpayring of their ſaulfeguarde, they ſet fire

on their houſes, &amp; burned them ſelues, their wifes and their children. Which fire when the Macedons quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, they kyndled agayne, it ſeamed a ſtraunge contencion. The Cyteſins deſtroyed their owne cytie, their enemies laboured to ſaue it: the warres ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariouſly chaunged the lawes wrought in man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The caſtle was ſaued, wherin a guarriſon was left. Alexander went about this caſtle by water which was inuironed with thre of the greateſt ryuers in all India, Ganges except.

But they were ſo troubled through feare, and the violent ſwiftnes of the ſtreame, that they could not ordre their tackling, ſo that two of their greateſt ſhyppes were drowned within ſyght. And the ſmaller veſſels which they were as vnable to gouerne, were driuen vpon the ſhore without any harme. The kyng chaunſed vpon the place where the waues went hygheſt, wherwith his ſhyppe was ſo toſſed and trauerſed, that the helme could not direct his courſe. Wherfore the kyng doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of drownyng, pulled of his garment redy to caſte hym ſelfe into the water, and his frendes dyd ſwymme nere there about redy to receyue hym.

But the Indians whether it were for feare, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome ſedition riſen amonges them, ſodainelye fledde into the deſerte mountaynes, whom Alexander folowed in vaine, and not able to ouertake them, toke their cariage. After this he came vnto a citye of the Oxidracans wherunto great numbre were fled,<note place="margin">The Oxidra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cans.</note> aſwell in truſt of the ſtrength of the place, as of their owne power. As Alexander was about to make the approch, Demophon his deuiner admoniſhed him,<note place="margin">Demophon.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould eiher deferre the matter, or els not meddle with it at all, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there appered ſignes that his life ſhould be in perill.

            <p>And as ſone as he hadde ſpoken the worde, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to rere, vp ladders, and whiles other menne ſticked and ſtayed at the matter, he mounted vp the walle. The ſame was verye narrowe in the toppe, not deuided wyth lopes (as is communely vſed,) but enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with one whole and continuall battilment rounde aboute, which cauſed it to be the more hard to ſcale.</p>
            <p>Alexander therfore hauyng no conuenient rowme to ſtande at his defence, ſtayed vpon the walle, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng vpon his target the dartes whyche were caſte at him from all partes. His ſouldiours could not get vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, they were ſo beaten from the walles by caſtyng of Dartes, and multitude of ſhotte that came from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue. Yet at length when by their ſtayinge thei ſawe their kyng geuen vp into their enemies hands, ſhame ouercame their immaculate daunger. But their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche haſte was ouer great a lette, and the cauſe why they coulde not come to the reſcue of their king. For whyles euery manne coueted vp the ladders, they were ſo ſore laden that they brake aſunder, and ſuche as were mounted vpon theim fell downe agayne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuynge Alexander of hys onelye hope.

For with a ful leape he did caſte him ſelfe into the citye that was full of his enemies, wheras he coulde ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For before he coulde recouer hys fete agayne, it was likelye either he ſhoulde haue bene ſlayne, or taken aliue. But he by chaunce ſo conueied his bodye, that he fell vpon his fete, and ſtandinge, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with ſuch as came againſte him, Fortune ſo prouidyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he coulde not be encloſed about by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an olde tree, which (as it had bene of purpoſe) ſtode neare vnto the wall, whoſe broade boughes full of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues couered him from aboue, and the greatnes of the ſtocke kept his enemies from comming on his backe, and vpon the fore front he receiued the dartes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were caſt againſt him with his target. For though there were neuer ſo many that contented with him a farre of, yet durſt there no man come neare vnto him, and the bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghes kept of the arrowes and the dartes ſo well as his target did. In this extremitie the greatnes of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fame chiefly fought for him, and next deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a great encouragement for a man to dye honeſtlye. At length through the multitude of his enemies that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually flocked about him, both his target was laden with ſhotte, his helmet was broken wyth ſtones, and his legges fainted and fayled vnder him, by reaſon of his continuall trauaile. Whiche thing when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies perceiued, they toke leſſe regarde to them ſelues, and drue more neare him, of whome he receiued two with his ſwerde in ſuch ſort, that thei fell downe dead at his fete. And from that time forwardes none was
<pb facs="tcp:29057:198"/>
ſo bolde to approche againe ſo neare him, but threwe dartes and ſhotte arowes at him a farre of. He laye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to euery mans blowe, and yet though it were with great payne defended him ſelfe vpon his knees, vntil ſuche time as an Indian ſhotte an arowe at hym that was two cubites long, whyche a little aboue his right thighe paſſed throughe his corſelet. By reaſon of that wounde he ſhedde ſo muche bloude, that he lette his ſwerde fall, as one at the pointe of death, and therwith ſo faynte, that he hadde not ſtrengthe to plucke oute the arrowe. Then the Indian whiche hadde hurte him, came with great ioye to ſpoyle hys bodye. But when Alexander felte his enemies hande vpon hym (moued as it is to be thought) with deſpite, to receyue an infamie to that extremitie, called againe his ſprites that were paſſynge awaye, and with his ſwerde thruſt his enemye (beynge vnarmed) throughe the bodye. When he had thus ſlayne two of his enemies whyche laye dead before him, all the reſte ſtode amaſed a farre of. Then Alexander deſieryng before his laſt breathe ſhoulde fayle hym, to be kylled fightyng, began to raiſe vp his bodye vpon his target, but his ſtrength woulde not ſerue him therunto, &amp; therfore reiched at a bough that honge ouer his heade, couetynge therby to haue rayſed vp hym ſelfe, but his ſtrength not ſuffiſynge therunto, he fell downe agayne vpon his knees, and by a ſigne made with his hande, chalenged his enemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if any of them durſte come and matche with him. At the laſt Penceſtes repulcinge his enemies vpon an other parte of the citye, gotte into the towne,<note place="margin">Penceſtes</note> and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng along the walles, came vnto the place where the kynge was.

Tymeus after that he hadde fought notablye, and receiued manye woundes, was there ſlayne. Penceſtes alſo notwithſtandynge that he was ſtricken and wounded wyth their Dartes, yet with his Target he defended the kynges perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie reguarde of him ſelfe. And Leonatus whiles he reſiſted the Indians, that egerlye preſſed vpon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, receyued ſo ſore a ſtripe vpon the necke, that he fell downe in a ſwowne at the kinges fete. By that time Penceſtes became ſo feable of his woundes, that he was not able to defende him anye more. The laſte hope and refuge remayned in Ariſtonus, who alſo was ſo greuouſlye wounded, that he coulde not endure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye lenger the force of the Indians.</p>

When Crito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus hearde his wordes, he either ceaſſed, or diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his feare, and exhorted Alexander that he woulde ſuffer him ſelfe to be holden whiles they pulled out the arrowes heade that was within his fleſhe, for the leaſt mocion (he ſaied) might be hurtefull vnto him. The kynge woulde not be holden, but helde his bodye at a ſtaye without mouyng in ſuch ſorte as they appoynted him.

Some when they ſawe them preſſe a ſhipbord in ſuch thronges, for feare of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng into many, woulde receyue none at all. So that both multitude and ſmal numbre, was a let vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haſt they made. The crye that ſome made in bidding men tary, and the noiſe that other made willing them to go forwardes, and there voyſes that differed, and agred not in one effect, toke away the vſe both of their ſight and hearing. The mariners could not help the matter, whoſe wordes in the tumult coulde not be harde, nor their commaundementes obſerued amonges men in feare and out of order. The ſhyppes therfore daſhed one agaynſt an other, the Ores craſſhed a ſonder, and euery ſhippe either thurſt forwards, or put backe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For when then the Sea began to ebbe, the water fell backe agayne into hys wonted courſe with ſo greate violence as it came forwardes, and reſtored and ſight of the lande, whiche before was drowned as in a depe Sea.</p>
            <p>The ſhippes then forſaken of the water fel vpon their ſides, and the feldes were ſtrowen with broken bordes and wyth peares of Ores. The ſouldiers durſt not go furth to land, and yet were in feare to tarye a ſhipbord lokynge euer for ſome greater miſchiefe to come, then that they ſawe preſent or paſte.</p>

And therefore they Imagyned to them ſelfes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne and all extremities.

            <p>The nyght approached, and deſpayre brought the kynge into a great agonye.</p>
            <p>Yet no care could ouercome his hart that was inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, but that he watched all night, and ſent horſemen to the mouth of the riuer, to bryng him word when the tyde came. He cauſed the ſhippes that were broken to

But that his liberalitie was occaſion of hys death. For when he had preſented al the kinges frendes with giftes aboue there deſire, he honoured not with anye giftes at all Bagoas the Enuke,<note place="margin">Bagone ther Enuke.</note> whom Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſpecially fauoured of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſage he had of him.

The king had not Orcynes yet in ſuſpect of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as afterwardes was laid againſt him, but began to growe wyth him out of eſtimacion. Hys accuſacion was euer ſo ſecret, that he could neuer get knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peril that was preuily wrought againſt him.

For my parte I neuer ſawe this tombe before, but I haue hard Darius reporte, that there were .iii.M. talentes buried with Eirus. (Therof (qd he) proceded Orcynes liberalitie, in wynning your fauour by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift of the thinges, which he knewe he could not keape. When he had thus ſturred vp Alexanders wrathe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Orcynes, he preſented them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to accuſe him. By whoſe reporte and by Bagoas ſurmiſed tales, Alexander was ſo encenſed againſte Orcynes, that he was put in pryſon, before he coulde ſuſpect that he was accuſed. The Enuke was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the deſtruccion of this Innocent man, but at his death, laied violent hands vpon him.

This was the ende of the moſte noble man amonges the Percians, who was not onely an innocent in the matter, but ſuch one as bare ſinguler affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Alexander, and had ſhewed great libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to him &amp; his. At the ſame time Phradrates whiche was ſuſpected to haue gone about to make hym ſelfe king,<note place="margin">Alexander began to be enclined to the ſhedyng of blood.</note> was put to death. Alexander beganne then to be much enclyned to the ſheding of bloode, and to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in hearing of euil report. Proſperitie is of ſuch a force to chaunge a mans nature. Wherein fewe men haue conſederacion of vertue. Thus he which a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before would not condempne Linceſtes Alexander when he was accuſed by two witneſſes, that ſuffred dyuers of more meane eſtate to be acquited, though it

You whiche vnder Philip went haulf naked, now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

You deſire againe your wodden diſſhes, your targettes made of wikers, &amp; your ſwordes couered with ruſt. I receiued you in this ſimple eſtate, with .v.C. talentes in debte, when all my furnyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes exceded not in valure .lx. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes.

Are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that haue robbed all Aſia, to beare the ſpoyles of ſo many nacions within your belies, and now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home to your wyfes &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto whom there be but few of you that are able to ſhewe any rewardes of your victory. For many of you ſhalbe compelled to gage your armour, if ye forſake this good hope, ye might receiue at my handes. Theſe be the good men of warre that I ſhall want, which of all their riches haue nothing left them but only their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines. The waye lieth open for your departure, get you hence quickly out of my ſyght. I with the Percians ſhall defende your backes when ye be gone.

Now you ſhall knowe of what force an army is, that lacketh a kyng, and what moment doth conſiſte in me alone. When he had ſpoken thoſe wordes he leped in a fury from the iudgement ſeate, and ranne into the throng of the armed men, whereas he toke with his owne handes ſuche as had mutined moſte againſt him. Of whome there were none that durſt make reſiſtaunce, deliuered xiii. to his guarde for to be ſaufly kept. Who woulde thinke that an aſſembly whiche a little before had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto their prince with ſuche fierſenes and rigour,
<pb facs="tcp:29057:219"/>
could haue bene ſo ſodenly appalled for feare? Which ſeing there companions ledde to execution, durſt not moue, nor make any attempt.</p>
            <p>But the inordinate libertie they vſed before, &amp; their ſedicious violence was then ſo ſtayed, that neuer one of them durſt reſiſte, the king ronning amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges them, but were al aſtonied for feare, and ſtode like men ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with doubtfull imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s loking what he would determine of the offenders.</p>
            <p>Whether it were the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they bare to his name, becauſe the nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that liue vnder kinges, are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to honour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as gods; or were it the maieſtie of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, or els his own aſſured co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy executing his auc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>toritie with ſuche violence, that put them in feare: thei ſhewed a notable enſample of pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not only without ſlurre or mocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the executing of their companions, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew to be put to death in the night time, but alſo were more diligent in doing their duties then euer they were before, pretermitting nothing pertaining to obedience, &amp; naturall affeccion towardes their prince. For the next day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei came to the courte, and were not ſuffred to entre, but all ſhotte out ſauing the ſouldiers of Aſia, they made a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull crye and lamentacion whiche ſpred ouer al the campe, proteſting that they would not liue, if the kyng continued ſtill in his wrath. But he that was obſtinat in all thinges that he had once conceiued in his head, commaunded all the Macedons to keape ſtill their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, and aſſembled the ſouldiers ſtraungers together, to whome by an Interpretour he made this Oracion.<note place="margin">Alexanders Oracion to the ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſouldiers.</note> At ſuche tyme as I came firſte out of Europe into Aſia, my truſte was to brynge vnder myne Empyre manye noble Nacions, and greate power of men,
<pb facs="tcp:29057:220"/>
wherin I was not deceaued. For beſides that the fame reported you to be men of value, I haue founde in you one thinge more, whiche is an incomperable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, fidelitie, and affection towardes your prince. I thought voluptuouſnes had ouerflowen all vertue amonges you, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through your great filicitie, ye had bene drowned in pleaſures. But I finde it otherwiſe, and perceyue that none obſerue the diſcipline and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the warres better then you do, nor execute the ſame with more actiuitie nor ſtoutenes. And beynge manfull and valeaunt menne, ye embrace fidelitie, no leſſe then you do the reſt. This thinge I do but nowe acknowledge, but I knewe it longe ago. Whiche was the cauſe that I choſe you out of the youth of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions to be my ſouldiours, and did incorporate you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges mine owne people, cauſinge you to vſe the ſame habite, and the ſame armoure. But your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and pacience towardes the aucthoritie, appeareth muche better in you then in them. Therfore I haue ioyned to my ſelfe in mariage the daughter of Oxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres that is a Percian, not diſdayninge to beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vpon a captiue. And afterwardes deſiringe more aboundauntlye to encreaſe the iſſue of my bodye, I toke to wife the daughter of Darius, and was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthour that my neare frendes, likewiſe ſhoulde beget children vpon captiues: mindynge by this holye coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te to exclude the difference betwene the victorers, and the vainquiſhed. Wherfore you muſt now thinke that you be not ſouldiours vnto me adopted but more naturall. And that Aſia and Europe is one kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without any difference. I haue geuen vnto you armoure after the maner of the Macedons. I haue brought all ſtraungnes and noueltie into a cuſtome,
<pb facs="tcp:29057:220"/>
and nowe ye be both my countreymen and my ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, all thinges take vpon them one fourme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. I haue not thought it vnſemely for the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſhadowe the cuſtomes of the Macedons, nor for the Macedons to counterfeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Percians, ſeynge thei ought to be vnder one lawe &amp; cuſtome that ſhould liue vnder one kynge.</p>
            <p>When he had made this oration, he committed the cuſtody of his perſon vnto the Perſians, he made them of his guarde and his officers of iuſtice, bi whom when the Macedons whiche had geuen occaſion of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion were ledde bound vnto execution, one of them that was more auncient and of greater eſtimacion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, ſpake after this maner.</p>
            <p>Howe longe will you thus geue place vnto your wil, in executynge vs after the ſtraungers maner? Your ſouldiours and countreymen be drawen to execuſion by their owne priſoners before their cauſe be hearde. If you haue iudged vs worthye of death, at leaſtwayes chaung the miniſters of your wrath. This was a good admoniſhmente, if he hadde bene pacient to heare the trueth. But his wrath was growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a woodnes, ſo that when he ſawe theim whiche hadde the charge of the priſoners ſtaye a little at the matter, he cauſed the priſoners to be tumbled into the riuer, and there drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29057:221"/>After it was knowen that Liuetenaunteſhips were geuen vnto the Percia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and that they were diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into diuers orders, and ſuche names geuen vnto them as were vnto the Macedons, and that they were reiected wyth reproche, they coulde not then any len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conteine theim ſelues, nor ſuffer the doloure they had conceyued in their hertes, but with a great throng preſſed to the courte, wearyng onely their nethermoſt garmentes, and leauynge their weapons without the gate in token of repentaunce. There wyth weapynge and all tokens of humilitie, they made requeſt to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the kynges preſence, &amp; that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to pardon their offence, pacifiynge his wrath with the deathe of ſo manye of theim as he ſhoulde thinke good, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuffer them to liue in ſuch reproch: whiche excepte he woulde releaſe,<note place="margin">Alexander was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiled to his ſouldiours.</note> they proteſted they woulde neuer departe out of the place. When thoſe thynges were declared vnto Alexander, he cauſed the courte gates to be opened, and came forthe amonges them. Wheras beholdynge their lamentation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, their miſerable behauour and affliction, he coulde not abſtayne to weape longe tyme wyth theim, and in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of their modeſtie, forgaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their former offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. And after he had temperately told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their faultes, and againe comforted them with gentle words, he diſcharged many fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice of the warres, &amp; ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home liberally rewarded: writing to Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his liuetenant in Macedon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould aſſigne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe places in the Threatres, at triumphes, and open playes, wheras they ſhoulde ſit with garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des on their heades, &amp; he willed that their children after their deathes ſhould enioye their fathers wages.</p>
            <p>He appointed Craterus to be their ruler, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the place of Antipater he had committed the gouernement
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29057:221"/>
of Macedon, Teſſalie, and Thrace, ſendynge for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater to repaire vnto him with a ſupplie of yong ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Alexander had receiued letters before both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, and Olympias his mother,<note place="margin">Olymyias Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders mother.</note> wherby diſſenſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be betwixt them. For his mother acuſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater that he wente aboute to make him ſelfe kyng. And Antipater did write howe Olympias did manye thinges otherwiſe then it did become her. Antipater did take his callynge awaye ſo greuouſlye in his hart, that he conſpired therupon to poyſon Alexander, who hauynge accompliſhed the matters that before be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned, went to Echatan that ſtandeth in Media, to ſet order in the neceſſarie affaires of his Empire, and there ordeyned ſolempne triumphes and feaſting. It chaunſed Epheſtion whom the kynge ſpecially loued,<note place="margin">The death of Epheſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> and vſed in place of a brother, about the ſame time to dye of a feuer. Whoſe death Alexander toke more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfullye then can well be credited, committynge in his doloure manie thinges that were vnſeaminge for the maieſtye of a Prince. He commaunded Epheſtions phiſition to be hanged, as though he had died through his negligence. He laye embracynge of the dead bodye and coulde hardlye be taken awaye by his frendes, but continued his ſorowe night and daye. There be many other thinges written in that behalfe, which be ſcarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credible. But it is certayne that he commaunded ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be made vnto him as vnto a God, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his buriall and making of his tombe aboue .xii.M. talentes. As he was returninge to Babilon, the Caldian Prophetes met him on the waye, exhortynge him that he ſhoulde not enter into the citye. For that it was ſignified, that if he wente thether at that time, he ſhould be in great peryll of his life. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:29057:222"/>
he regarded not their admoniſhmentes, but went forwardes in his iourney accordynge as he hadde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. For he vnderſtode that Embaſſadours were come thither from all Regions tariynge for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The terrour of his name was ſo ſpredde throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe the worlde, that all nacions ſhewed an obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes towardes him, as though he had bene appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be their kynge. That cauſed him to make haſte towardes Babylon, to kepe there as it were a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of the whole worlde. When he was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he receiued the Embaſſadours gentlye, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes diſpatched them home agayne. There was aboute the ſame tyme a banquet prepared at one Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalus Medius houſe.<note place="margin">Theſſalus Medius</note> wherunto the kynge beinge bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, came thither wyth ſuch as were appoynted to kepe him companye.

And beynge caried out of the feaſt halfe dead, was ſo tormented wyth payne that he required a ſwerde to haue killed him ſelfe. His frendes did publyſhe abroade dronkennes to be the cauſe of his diſeaſe, but in verye dede it was prepenſed treaſon the infamye wherof the power of his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours did oppreſſe. The poyſon prepared longe before was deliuered by Antipater vnto Caſſander his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, whiche wyth his brethren Phillippe, and Iolla, were wonte to ſerue the kynge at meate. He was warned that he ſhoulde not committe the ſame poyſon to anye perſon, except it were to Theſſalus or to his brethren. Philippe therfore and Iollas, whiche were wonte to take the ſaye of the kynge cuppes, hauyng the poyſon readye in colde water, mixed it with the wine, after they had taſted it. When the fourth daye was come
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29057:222"/>
the ſouldiours partly for that they ſuſpected he hadde bene dead, and partlye becauſe they coulde not endure to wante longe his ſyght, came ſorowfullye vnto the courte, deſirynge to ſee the kynge, whiche by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were admitted vnto his preſence, by ſuch as had the charge of his perſon.</p>
            <p>When they behelde him liynge in that caſe, they made great ſorowe and lamentacion, for he ſemed not to them to be the ſame their kynge, whom they were wont to ſee, but rather a deade corſe. If their griefe were great, the ſorowe of theim that ſtode nexte to the bedde appeared muche more, whom when Alexander behelde lamentyng after that ſorte, he ſaied vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When I ſhall departe, you ſhall finde a kynge wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye for ſuche men as you be. It is a thynge incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble howe that he durynge the tyme, the ſouldiours of his whole armye came to viſet hym, he neuer altered countenaunce nor geſture, but continued in that kind of preſence he gaue vnto the firſte, vnto the laſte man. When he hadde diſmiſſed the multitude, as though he had bene diſcharged of al the debt of life, he laye downe againe to reſt his weake body, &amp; his voyce beginnyng to fayle him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his frendes to come neare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute him, and then takinge his rynge from his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, deliuered it to Perdicas, and gaue therwith a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente that his bodye ſhoulde be conueyed to Hammon. They demaunded to whom he would leaue his kingdome. He ſaide: to the worthieſt. By whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wordes it appeared that he forſawe the contention that was like to enſue vpon his death. Perdicas more ouer demaunded of him when he woulde haue diuine honours done vnto him. At ſuch time (quod he) as you
<pb facs="tcp:29057:223"/>
ſhall finde your ſelfes in felicitie. Theſe were the laſte wordes Alexander ſpake, and ſhortelye after he died. Immediatlye after his death, the courte was full of howlynge,<note place="margin">The ſorow that was made vpon Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders death.</note> lamentynge, and ſorowe makynge, and by and by as it hadde bene in a deſerte, or a place ſolitary, all thynges were whiſte, and a ſorowfull ſilence was ſpredde ouer all, euerye man beynge conuerted into imagination, what ſhoulde become of the matter. The yonge menne of the nobilitye that were accuſtomed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute Alexanders perſon, coulde not beare the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their doloure, nor kepe them ſelfes within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the courte, but ranne aboute as menne out of their wyttes, wherby the citye was filled with heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and complainte, and no kinde of lamentation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted, that ſorow is wont to miniſter in ſuch a caſe Suche therfore as were without the courte, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge this matter, as well Macedones as other came runnynge thither, wheras the Conquerours from the conquered, nor the Victorers from the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed coulde not be diſcerned, the ſorowe was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al. The Percians called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their iuſt and mercifull Lorde, and the Macedons made inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him, that was ſo valeaunte and gracious a kynge, and thus there was a certaine contencion of ſorow amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Men did not vſe their only wordes of griefe and heauines, but alſo of grudge and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that ſo yonge a prince beynge in the flower of his age, and of his fortunate ſucceſſe, ſhoulde by the enuy of the Goddes, be ſo taken out of this worlde. They called to remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce what a cherefulnes they had alwaies ſene in his countenaunce, ether when he led them to the battel, when he beſieged, or aſſaulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny citie, or when he would geue any commendacion to

the worthye in anye aſſemble. Then the Macedons repented that euer they hadde denied him deuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, confeſſyng them ſelues bothe wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull for depriuynge him of anye name wherof he was worthye. And when they had continued long in the veneration and deſire of him that was dead, then they began to pitye their owne caſe, whiche commyng out of Macedon were paſſed the riuer of Euphrates, amonges the middes of their enemies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnwillinglye receiued their new gouernement. They ſaw them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues left deſtitute, &amp; the Empire without any certaine heyre, for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euery one wold go about to draw the power of the ſtate vnto his priuate behofe. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they began to conceiue and forſee in their mindes, the ciuill warres that did enſue, &amp; that they ſhoulde be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to ſhede their bloude againe, not for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt of Aſia, but for the title of ſome ſuch one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make him ſelfe king: wherby their old ſcarres ſhould breake out againe into new wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; that ſuch as by reaſon of their age had bene diſcharged from the warres by their noble &amp; righteous king, ſhould now be enforced to ſpend their liues in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarell of ſome ſuch one as was but his ſouldier. Whiles thei were in theſe imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the night came on, &amp; encreaſed their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure. The men of warre watched in harnayes &amp; the Babilonians loked ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles; pepyng out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the toppes of their houſes to ſpye ſome certaintye how the matter we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

And bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eie did fail, thei laied their eares to heare the rumours &amp; wordes that were ſpoken. And many times thei wer afraied whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no cauſe was, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei met together in the narow ſtretes or darke lanes, thei would be amaſed, &amp; ſuſpect eche other as enemies

The Percians after their accuſtumed maner clipped there heare and with ther wiues and children lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the death of Alexander in mourning garmentes, with vnfained affeccion, not as a conqueror and one that lately had bene there enemye; but as there right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and naturall kyng. For they being accuſtumed to liue vnder a king, could think no man more worthy then he, to rule ouer them. Thys ſorowe was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conteined within the walles of the citie, but ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſpred ouer all the countrey ther aboutes. And the fame of ſo great a miſchiefe flyenge through oute Aſia, brought ſome tydinges therof vnto Darius mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She at the fyrſte reporte tare a ſonder the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe ware and put on morning appareill, ſhe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her heare, and fel downe groueling vpon the earth One of her neces ſat by her morning the death of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſtion whom ſhe had maried, and in an vniuerſall heuines, bewayled the cauſe of hir owne ſorowe. But Syſigambis alone ſuſteyned all there miſeries,<note place="margin">The beha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uour of Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius mother vpon the death of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> and bewayled bothe hir owne caſe and her nefes, her freſhe ſorowe cauſing her to call to mynde thinges paſte. A man would haue iudged by her behauour that Darius had bene newly ſlayne, and that ſhe had cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the funeralles of bothe her ſonnes togither. She did not only lament the deade, but ſorowed alſo for the lyuing. Who ſhall nowe (qd ſhe) take care of this yong woman? or who can be like vnto Alexander nowe we be taken priſoners againe, nowe we be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen from our dignitie and eſtate.</p>
            <p>After Darius death we found one to defend vs. But nowe ſince Alexander is gone, who wyll haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of vs? Amongs ſhe called to mind, how Occhus the cruell kinge had ſlayne her father and foure ſcore
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29057:224"/>
of her brethren on one daye, and that of ſeuen children borne of hir bodye, there was but one of theim lefte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. She ſawe that fortune had aduaunced Darius and cauſed him to floryſhe for a tyme, to the entente he myght ende his life by greater crueltye. Finallye ſhe was ſo ouercome wyth ſorowe, that ſhe couered her head, turning her ſelfe from her neſe and nephew that ſate at her fete, and abſtayninge both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meate &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholdynge of the light, ended hir life the fift daye after ſhe was determined to dye. This hir death was a great argument of the clemencye Alexander hadde ſhewed towardes her, and of the iuſtice towardes all the captyues, ſeyng that after Darius death ſhe could abide to liue, but after Alexanders departure, ſhe was aſhamed to continue any lenger.</p>
            <p>Conſiderynge Alexander rightwiſelye,<note place="margin">A diſcourſe of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vices and his ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues.</note> we muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all his vertues to his owne nature, and his vices either to hys youth, or to the greatnes of his fortune. There was in him an incredible force of courage, and an exceadynge ſufferaunce of trauaile. He was endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with manhode excellinge, not onely amonges kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but alſo amonges ſuch as had neither vertue nor qualitye. He was of that liberalitye that oftentymes he gaue greater thinges then the reciuers could haue aſked of God. The multitude of kyngdomes that he gaue in gift, and reſtored to ſuch from whom he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theim by force, was a token of his clemencye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them that he ſubdued. He ſhewed a perpetuall contempte of deathe, the feare wherof doth amaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. And as there was in him a greater deſire of glorye and worldely prayſe then reaſon woulde beare: ſo was it intollerable in ſo yong a man enterpriſynge ſo great actes. The reuerence and affection he bare
<pb facs="tcp:29057:225"/>
towardes his parentes, appeared in that he purpoſed to conſecrate his mother Olimpias to immortalitie, and that he ſo ſore reuenged Philips death. How gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and familiar was he towardes his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and how beniuolence towarde his ſouldiours. He had a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome equall to the greatnes of his harte, and ſuche a policie and forecaſt, as ſo yong yeres were ſcarſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receiue. A meaſure in immoderate pleſures. And the vſe of his luſt leſſe then nature deſiered, vſing no pleaſure but that was lawefull: theſe were wonderfull greate giftes and vertues.</p>
            <p>But in that he compared him ſelfe to the Gods, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diuine honours, and beleued the Oracles that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſuch thinges, that he was offended w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that woulde not worſhip him, and geuen more vehementlye to wrath then was expedient.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge it muſte nedes be confeſſed, that though he preuailed muche by his vertue, yet ought he to impute more vnto his fortune, which only of al mortal men, he had in his owne power.

            <p>To this ſo greate a kynge and noble conqueroure,

a ſucceſſour was loked for: But the matter was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch importau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for any one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.

The thronge of the ſouldiours was ſuche, that manye of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes were excluded, and coulde not enter into the courte. A Proclamation therfore was made wherby all men were forbidden to enter, except ſuche as were called by name. But becauſe their commaundement ſemed to want aucthoritie, it was little regarded, &amp; the multitude at the firſt began to make a greuous ſorow &amp; lamentation. But ſtraightwaies the deſire they had to vnderſtande the ſucceſſe of the matter, ſtopped their lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; made ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

            <p>Then ſaied Perdicas:<note place="margin">Perdicas wordes.</note> Lo here is the rynge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſeale ſuch thinges as perteined to the force of his Empire, &amp; as he deliuered the ſame to me, I ſo do reſtore it agayne to you. And although no aduerſitye can be deuiſed by the Goddes (were they
<pb facs="tcp:29057:226"/>

Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of the actes whych he hath done, we muſte thinke that the Goddes ſent ſuche a man as he was to raigne in the worlde, whoſe tyme beyng ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired that was appointed, they haue called him againe to the place from whence he came. Forſomuche there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as none other thinge remaine of hym amonges vs, but onely that whiche is alwayes wont to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from immortalitie: let vs perfourme the due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayninge bothe to his bodye, and to his name, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bringe in what citye we be, amonges what kynde of people, and what a kynge, and what maner of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure we haue loſte. We muſt debate and deuiſe how to maintaine our conqueſt amonges theim of whom it is gotten. For the doynge wherof, it is nedefull for vs to haue an heade. But whether the ſame ſhall be one, or manye, that conſiſteth in you. You are not ignorant that a multitude of men of warre wythout an heade, is a body without any life. Sixe monethes be now paſſed ſence Roxane was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued wyth chylde, we deſire of God that ſhe maye bringe forthe a male, whiche maye enioye this kyngdome, when he cometh to age.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the bloude royall, but to loke for a kynge that is not yet borne &amp; to paſſe ouer one that is in his being already, is nether expedient for ſuch men as the Mace<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dons be, nor yet dothe ſerue the neceſſitie of the time.</p>

therfore the ſouldiers accordyng to their cuſtome claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the ſpeares againſt the targets, &amp; continued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of a noyſe. And when he woulde not forſake his opinion, but obſtinately maintened the ſame, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had almoſt bredde a ſedition, which thing perceiued by Ptolomeus, he ſpake after this maner.</p>
            <p>Neither the ſonne of Roxane nor Barſines,<note place="margin">Ptolomeus wordes</note> is an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue mete to raigne ouer the Macedons, whoſe names we ſhold be aſhamed to rehearſe within Europe, their mothers beinge captiue. Haue we ſubdued the Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to that ende to become ſubiect to ſuche as be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of them? That was the thinge which Darius and zerxes beynge Kynges of Perce wrought for in vain, with ſo mani mileons of men of warre, and with ſo many nauies. This therfore is my opinion, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders chaire of eſtate be ſet in the middes of the court, and that all ſuch as were wont to be of counſail with him, ſhal aſſemble together, ſo often as any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter require to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulted vpon. And that the captaines and rulers of the armye ſhalbe obedient to that order, wherunto the greater number do aſſent. There were ſome agreed wyth Ptolomeus, but fewe with Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas. Then Ariſtonus ſpake in this wiſe.<note place="margin">Ariſtonus wordes.</note> When Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander was conſulted withall, to whom he would leaue his kingdome, he willed the worthieſt to be choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudged he worthieſt but Perdicas, to whom he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his rynge?. This was not done at ſuch time as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander was alone, but when al his frendes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente, he did caſte his eyes amonges them, and at len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth choſe out one to whom he deliuered it. Wherfore I thinke it ryght that the kingdome be committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Perdicas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29057:227"/>There were many that agreed to his opinion, ſo that the aſſemble cried to Perdicas that he ſhoulde come forthe amonges them, and take vp the kynges ſignet. But he ſtayed betwene ambition and ſhamefaſtnes, thinkynge that the more modeſtye he vſed in gettynge the thinge whiche he coueted, they woulde be ſo muche the more earneſt to profer it hym. When he had ſtande a good while at a ſtaye, doubtyng what to do, at length he drewe backe, and ſtode behind them which ſate next vnto hym.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Weleagers wordes.</note>When Meleager that was one of the capitaynes, ſawe the ſtaye that Perdicas made, toke courage ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and ſaide: Neither the Goddes will permit, nor men wil ſuffer, that Alexanders eſtate, and the weight of ſo great an empire ſhould reſt vpon his ſhoulders. I will not rehearſe how there be many men more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is, and of greater worthines, againſt whoſe wyll no ſuche thinge may be ſuffred to be done. There is no difference whether ye make Perdicas kynge, or the ſonne of Roxane, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer he ſhalbe borne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge Pedicas goeth aboute to make him ſelfe Kynge, vnder pretence to be gouernoure to the other. That is the cauſe why no kinge can pleaſe him, but ſuch one as is not yet borne. And in ſuche an haſte as all we make to haue a kynge, whyche haſte is bothe mete and neceſſary for the preſeruation of our eſtate. He onelye doth waite for the expirynge of tymes, and monethes, imaginynge that ſhe ſhoulde brynge forthe a manne chylde, whiche I thinke ye doubte not but he is readye to counterfayte and exchaunge, if nede be. If it were ſo in very dede that Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der had appointed him to be our king, I am of opinion that the ſame thing onely of all the thinges he hath commaunded, oughte not to be

perfourmed and kepte. Why do not you runne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſpoyle the treaſure? ſeyng that this kynde of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the people ought to enherite. When he hadde ſpoken thoſe wordes, he brake through the preaſe of the armed men, and they whiche gaue him waye, folowed him to the ſpoyle, wherof he had made mencion. The gredines of the treaſure cauſed a greate bande of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men to flocke about Meleager, and the aſſemble began to fall to diſcorde and ſedicion, whiche had gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to greater inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience, if a meane ſouldier who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verye fewe did knowe, had not ſtepped forthe,<note place="margin">The words of a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the aſſemble.</note> and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the multitude. What nede we (quod he) to fall to force or ciuill warre ſeynge we haue a kynge alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye whiche you ſeke to finde. The ſame is Aridens Philips ſonne,<note place="margin">Aridens</note> brother to Alexander that latelye was our kynge, borne and brought vp in the ſame religion, and ceremonies that we do vſe, who beyng the onelye heyre, I maruayle by what deſeruynge of his he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſlipped or what he hath done, why he ſhoulde not enioye his ryght, deſcended vnto hym by the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall lawe of the worlde. If you ſeke one to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Alexander, you ſhall neuer fynde hym. If you will haue ſuche one as ſhall approche nexte vnto him, this is onelye he. When theſe wordes were hearde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the multitude, they kept ſilence at the firſte, as if they had bene commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſo to do, but afterwardes they cryed with one voyce, that Aridens ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that they were worthy deathe whiche made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſemble wythout him.<note place="margin">Pythons wordes.</note> Then Python all beſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keled wyth teares, began to ſpeake. Nowe I perceyue (quod he) Alexanders caſe to be moſte miſerable, ſeyng he is defrauded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frute wyth ſuch as wer his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; ſubiects ſhold bringforth at ſuch a time as this is
<pb facs="tcp:29057:228"/>
For you hauynge reſpect onelye to the name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of your kynge, ye be vtterly blinde in the reſt of thynges. His wordes tended directlye to the reprofe of Aridens that was elected kynge, but the tale procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more hatred to the ſpeaker, then contempte to hym againſt whom they were mente. For the compaſſion they had of Aridens, cauſed them the more to fauoure his cauſe, and therfore declarred by an obſtinate crye, that they woulde not ſuffer any to reigne ouer them, but him onely which was borne to that poſſibilitie, and ſtill called for Aridens to come forthe amonges them. Wherupon Meleager for the malice and enuy he bare vnto Perdicas, toke an occaſion boldlye to bring him into the aſſemble, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multitude ſaluted as kinge, and called him Philippe. This was the voyce of the people,<note place="margin">Aridens was choſen kyng.</note> but the nobilitie was of an other mind, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pithon toke vpon him to put Perdicas deuiſe in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and appoynted Perdicas and Leonatus (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were deſcended of the bloude royall) to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the ſonne whiche ſhoulde be borne of Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane: addinge moreouer that Craterus and Antipater ſhoulde haue the rule within Europe. And vpon this they ſware men to be obedient to Alexanders iſſue, Meleager then doubting notwithout cauſe, that ſome euill might come to him, departed with ſuche as were of his faction, but he returned immediatly againe, and brought Philip w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him into the court, criyng out to the multitude for the aſſiſtyng of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune welth, in ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of the newe Kynge, whiche a little before they had elected: and wylled them to make an experimente of his actiuitie, perſuadinge that he was the meteſt to rule ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iſſue of Philip, that had bothe a king to his father, and a king to his brother.</p>
            <p>

There wanted not ſome that gaue their conſent to Perdicas, but more agreed to make Philip king. They could neither agre nor diſagre, to any thyng long time together. One while repenting them of that they had determined, and ſtreightwaies forthought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that repentaunce. Yet finally they were enclyned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the kinges bloud. Aridens was put in ſuch feare with the aucthoritie of the nobilite, that he departed out of the aſſemble, after whoſe departure, the fauour of the ſouldiers was rather ſilent, then ceſſed towardes him. So that at length he was called agayne, and put vpon him his brothers veſture regal, whiche laye in the chayre. And Meleager put on his armour folowing as a guarde to the perſone of the newe king. The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Phalanx claſſhed their ſpeares to their tar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gettes, threatening to ſhed their bloud, whiche coueted the kingdome that pertained not to them. They reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the force of the Empire ſhould ſtill continue in the ſame familie, the right of whoſe enheritaunce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the bloud royall they ſhewed themſelues redy alwayes to defende. For by reaſon they were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to honour the name of their kyng, and to haue it in veneracion: they thought no man worthy for it, but ſuche one as came therunto by diſcent of bloud. Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas therfore was afraied, and with .vi. hundred men that were of an approued manhode, kept the lodging wheras the body of Alexander lay. Ptolomeus ioyned him ſelfe vnto hym, and the bande of the younge men that were about the kynges perſone. But ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:29057:229"/>
thouſand of armed men as were vpon the other ſide, did eaſely breake in vpon them. Amonges whome the king was preſent, with a great bande for the guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his perſone, wherof Meleager was chief. Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas therfore in a greate furye, called them to his parte which would defende Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders body, but they which brake in vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhrew dartes at him afarre of, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many were hurt. At the laſt the auncient men pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of their head peces the better to be knowen, &amp; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them whiche were with perdicas to abſtayne from ciuill warre, &amp; geue place to the kyng &amp; to the greater parte. Wherupon Perdicas was the firſte that layde downe his weapon, &amp; the reſt did in like maner. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager then perſuaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould not depart, but remayne ſtill about the dead corſe, but he iudging that to be a deceite and a meane to entrap hym, fled to the further ſide of Euphrates lieng ouer againſt the court. Then the horſemen whiche conſiſted chiefly of the nobilitie, flocked about Perdicas, and Leonatus, whiche thought good to departe out of the cytie, and take the fieldes, but becauſe Perdicas was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, that the footemen woulde haue taken his parte, remained ſtil within the cytie, leſt he myght ſeme to be the cauſe that the horſemen ſhould deuide them ſelues from the reſt of the armye. Meleager ceaſſed not to beate in the kynges head, that he could not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhe himſelfe ſurely in his eſtate, but by the death of Perdicas, whoſe ambicious mynde deſirous of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, was (he ſayde) to be preuented in time. Willyng the kyng to remembre what Perdicas had deſerued at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and that no man could be faithfull to him, whom he feared. The kyng ſuffring the thing, rather then geuing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the matter, Meleager toke
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29057:229"/>
his ſilence for a commaundement, and ſent for Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas in the kynges name, and they whiche were ſent had commiſſion to kyll hym, if he made any ſticking to come with them. Perdicas hearing of their comming, accompanied only with .xvi. yonge men that were of Alexanders guarde, mette them at the entrey of the houſe, and callyng them Meleagers ſlaues, rebuked them with ſuche a conſtancy both of mynde and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, that they returned back agayne as men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed.

For Perdicas was deſirous to remoue Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager from the kyng, and thought that he alone ſhold not be able to matche with Leonatus and hym.

He did ſubornate therfore priuely certain of the bandes that were vnder his rule, to complayne ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly (as though it were without his knowledge) that Meleager ſhuld be made equal with him, which wordes of the ſouldiers, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were reported vnto Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, be came in a great rage, &amp; declared their ſayenges to Perdicas.

Betwixt whiche ſpace the men of warre, accuſtomed to ſtande armed, the horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the mercenary ſouldiers and the phalanx euery one aparte. The ſame daye that this ceremony was put in execution, the kyng ſtoode with the horſemen &amp; the Elephantes againſt the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of whome Meleager had the rule.

But left without cauſe they myght condempne the fidelity of their companions, they ſtode ſtill with a determinate mynde to fight, if any would proffer them violence. When the battailles were almoſte mette together, and only a ſmalle diſtaunce left betwixt them, wherby the one parte was deuided from the other, the kyng by the prouocation of Perdicas with one bande of horſemen did ride along the footemen, requiring the deliuery of thoſe to be executed, which wer the aucthors of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde (whome in very dede he ought to haue defended) whiche if thei refuſed to deliuer, he threatened to bring againſt them, both the horſemen and the Elephantes.

The Empire being deuided into partes, euerye one might well haue defended his portion, if any boundes could conteine mens immoderate deſires.

For the firſt thynges alwayes appeare of no valure, when men be in hope of greater thynges to come. So that euery one of them thought it an eaſier matter to encreaſe his kyngdome, then it was to come by it at the firſte.
