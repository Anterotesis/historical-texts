         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THe preſerving the bleſſed memory of a
great and Pious Prelate to a publick
goood, hath occaſioned the publiſhing of
this thereunto introductory.</p>
            <p>In doing whereof, Opportunity is given for adding
and enlarging ſome things, which had bin omitted by
reaſon of the ſhortneſs of time, both for preparation and
delivery.</p>
            <p>The ſubject matter of the following diſcourſe, was
not (it is confeſt) for every auditory, but purpoſely
choſen for thoſe who then heard it; there being beſide
the Crowd, a confluence of learned and Judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of every condition, and from all quarters, which
might be well foreſeen on that occaſion.</p>
            <p>The deſign in this, was <hi>the vindicating the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and greatneſs of Chriſt</hi> our Lord from leſſening
<pb facs="tcp:95050:3"/>
Doctrines of <hi>Socinians,</hi> troubling the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
bleſſed be God, not ſo among us, as elſewhere.
This being here rather in way of <hi>Caveat</hi> and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which may not be unneceſſary, the fineſt Wits
being apt to be tickled with Subtilties, which is the
way with thoſe, whoſe plain and downright ſpeaking
might end in Blaſphemy; whereas by ſly and covert
Inſinuations, ſome deſirous of Novelties, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
inveigled and enticed by ſhew and ſweetneſs,
not conſidering it to be that of Poyſon.</p>
            <p>Hereunto is added (what was foregoing) an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant
Oration, in name of the Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
by one of the principal and learned Members of that
Society, at the Herſe of this great Prelate, lately their
Vicechancellor; whoſe Life and Death, and ſurviving
Vertues therein described, might have ſpared further
labours in that, did not a mixed Auditory after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it to be in ſome ſort declared in a Language, to
moſt there, more Intelligible.</p>
            <p>Of all which theſe ſhort Advertiſements being thus
premiſed, the reſt, Reader, is for thy further Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <p>The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death.</p>

<hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe the laſt only <hi>Death</hi> is here named, that anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </note> But death after all holds, and that until the

To the Church here <hi>on Earth militant,</hi> anſwers

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95050:6"/>
I. As to <hi>his Kingdom of Glory</hi> that ſhall never end, ſo ſhall
he reign for ever and ever: This is the voice from heaven,
<note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 11. 17.</note> and how can that Chriſts Kingdom end, when ours with

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>II. It remains then that this be conſidered, as to <hi>this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this is the ſtate of the Church here Militant, this
is only for this world, and with the world ſhall this end.</p>
            <p>Grace makes way for Glory and gives way to Glory, and
ſhall end in Glory, of this <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
this, <hi>his delivering up the Kingdom to the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how is that?</p>
            <p>1. This Chriſts delivering up the Kingdom to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is anſwerable to the end, for which that Kingdom
was by the Father to him his Son committed.</p>
            <p>That was <hi>to order it and to eſtabliſh it,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 9. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> to <hi>order it</hi> as to
his good Subjects, and to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> it as to his Enemies the
Rebellious.</p>
            <p>As if a King ſhould ſend his Son with power to reduce
Rebels riſen up againſt him: which being done, thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſubdued and all ordered and ſettled in peace, then he
returns and delivers up the Kingdom to his Father free from
all diſturbances, every thing being <hi>caſt out of his Kingdom
that did offend,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 30.</note> the Father then <hi>taking to himſelf his great
power and reigning.</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Rev. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And thus ſhall this Kingdom of Grace be then by Chriſt
delivered up to his Father in peace.</p>
            <p>2. This Chriſt delivering up this his Kingdom to his
Father, implies that <hi>happy ſtate to which the Church Militant
ſhall be tranſlated,</hi> being to that end by Chriſt delivered up,
and put into the Fathers hand, tranſlated from Grace to
glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Ark of the Teſtament</hi> was a Type of the <hi>Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,</hi>
that having had but a Tabernacle and a Tent habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
having no other foundation than what Pins and cords
could give it, and for movings and removings, which were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95050:7"/>
frequent: It had its <hi>Staves</hi> ever joyned for portage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
its being ſometimes even in the hands of Enemies;
whereas <hi>the Temple</hi> was a <hi>Type of the Church Triumphant,</hi>
having firm foundations:<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 11. 10.</note> And as the <hi>Ark</hi> after many
wandrings and long unſettlements, was at length <hi>placed in
the Temple in reſt,</hi> no more to be carried about or removed,
therefore the Staves taken out,<note n="l" place="margin">1 Kin. 4. 6, 7, 8.</note> ſo ſhall Chriſt deliver
up his Church Militant to his Father, to be ever with the
Father ſettled in his Temple in heaven. To which may
allude St. <hi>John</hi>'s ſeeing <hi>the Temple of God opened in heaven,
and that there was ſeen the Ark of his Teſtament,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Rev. 11. 19.</note> and to
that end ſhall the Kingdom of Grace, the Church Militant,
be by Chriſt delivered up to his Father, to be triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſettled in glory in the heavens for ever.</p>
            <p>3. But this is not all intended in this Chriſts delivering
up the Kingdom to the Father, this reaching even to very
Government alſo.</p>
            <p>For this way and manner of Chriſts Government of his
Kingdom of Grace, which is now in the world ſhall ceaſe
and determin, it not being conſistent after with Glory.</p>
            <p>This will appear if it be conſidered,</p>
            <p>That Chriſt the Mediator governs his Kingdom of Grace
here in this world, by his <hi>three great Offices of his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Prophetical, Prieſtly,</hi> and <hi>Kingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As <hi>our Prophet,</hi> Chriſt here rules his Church by his
<hi>Word</hi> the <hi>Scepter of his Kingdom,</hi> he alſo is in that deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with <hi>a ſharp two edged Sword out of his mouth,</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Rev. 1. 16. 2. 12.</note> his
<hi>word being ſharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to

<hi>riding on a white Horſe,</hi> and out of <hi>his mouth a ſharp

with that name <hi>the word of God.</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Rev. 19. 11. 13. 15.</note> By this his word
Chriſt our Prophet here rules and orders his Church, and
for that is the outward miniſtry of the word here neceſſary,
<hi>being profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, and

               <note n="q" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 26, 17.</note> which after in heaven ſhall

               <note n="r" place="margin">Is. 54.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Which being <hi>taught of God,</hi> may be underſtood <hi>of Chriſt

<hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>written in the Prophets, they ſhall be all taught

               </note> All teachings before under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

be underſtood of <hi>the manner of teaching,</hi> our being <hi>taught
by men,</hi> is by the outward miniſtry of the word, but <hi>God</hi>
teacheth inwardly, and effectually. Or thirdly, in that our
<hi>being taught of God,</hi> may be our differing way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now and hereafter, now by the word teaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and learning of others, and that but imperfectly,
which ſhall be in Heaven otherwiſe; our way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as needleſſ, being all <hi>then taught of God;</hi> ſo as to Chriſts
<hi>prophetical Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As to <hi>Chriſts prieſthood.</hi> Here he Expiates for Sin,
ſatiſfying Gods Juſtice in his Blood, making <hi>reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the ſins of his People,</hi> and <hi>having offered one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for ſins for ever, he is ſet down on the right hand of God,
from hence forth expecting till his Enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi>
               <note n="v" place="margin">Heb. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note> 
               <hi>Till then</hi> therefore is this work of Chriſts prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
neceſſary, but <hi>after,</hi> not ſo, all Sin being then done
away, and peace, and reconciliation with God by him made
perfectly, that work therefore of Chriſts prieſthood then
to ceaſe alſo.</p>
            <p>3. So alſo, as to <hi>Chriſt our King,</hi> he <hi>here Reigns in midſt
of Enemies</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> ſubduing them and defending his, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them alſo by Grace, and gathering them for Glory;
But then ſhall all this ceaſe as needleſſ, then ſhall no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95050:8"/>
remain, all being ſubdued, and then ſhall all Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be perfected, and gathered, and ſetled in Glory.
That therefore of Chriſts kingly Office, ſo far as it is only
conſistent with Grace, and inconſistent with Glory, ſhall
ceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo</hi> ſhall this kingdom of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, <hi>as</hi> to
the manner of its Government here, <hi>be</hi> delivered up to the
Father.</p>
            <p>But, what then? ſhall this conclude Chriſts Kingdom
and reign, then to ceaſe and end?</p>
            <p>No, in no wiſe, for ſo far ſhall it be from that, that in
compariſon of what is till then, his Kingdom ſhall be then
but as in a manner beginning, and he thenceforth to appear
unto all to reign more gloriouſly, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>This is ſet forth in that <hi>Parable</hi> of a <hi>certain Nobleman
going into a far Country to receive a Kingdom,</hi> againſt
whom, his <hi>Citizens roſe</hi> up rebelliouſly, ſaying; <hi>we will
not have this man to rule over us.</hi> But he after returns,
and <hi>then receiving the Kingdom,</hi> rewards his good ſervants,
and cauſeth his Enemies to be ſlain before his face.<note n="x" place="margin">Luke 19. 12. 14, 15, 16 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In that, is <hi>Chriſt's now abſence from the World,</hi> and <hi>his
return,</hi> and <hi>his then receiving his Kingdom,</hi> for the good
of his, and deſtruction of Enemies; <hi>Then when returning,</hi>
is the <hi>Kingdom ſaid to be received.</hi> So, in <hi>the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
in our petition, that <hi>his Kingdom may come,</hi> and <hi>his will be
done as in Heaven, ſo in Earth;</hi> In that <hi>appears his Kingdom
to be come, when his will is done in perfect obedience,</hi> and that
is <hi>done in Heaven,</hi> our Pattern for it. <hi>In Heaven</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is <hi>his Kingdom come,</hi> and there perfected. Nor doth
Chriſts <hi>delivering up the Kingdom to the Father</hi> exclude
his own then alſo reigning. For as the Father, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that Kingdom to his Son, to be here governed,
did not in that deveſt himſelf of the Government. For
even he himſelf, the Father, acts ſtill in that with his
Son. For ſetting Chriſt at his right Hand, I (saith the
Father) <hi>will make thine Enemies thy Footſtool.</hi> So, the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95050:8"/>
Sons after delivering up the Kingdom to his Father, he
doth not in that denude himſelf of the Government.
But as the Father by the Son now reigns, ſo ſhall the Son
after, with the Father reign alſo for ever. It is <hi>the
voice of Heaven. The Kingdoms of this World are become
the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign
for ever and ever.</hi>

            <p>Thus of <hi>Chriſts then delivering up the Kingdom to the
Father;</hi> with whom, yet, in that he reigns for ever.</p>
            <p>II. On that Chriſts delivering up the Kingdom to the
Father, follows that <hi>then ſhall the Son himſelf be ſubject to
him, that put all things under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This of the <hi>Sons being then ſubject,</hi> is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of him <hi>as God;</hi> for ſo is <hi>he moſt high.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 4. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25. 15.</note> And <hi>moſt
high</hi> is Gods proper Attribute, nor can he be God, who
is not <hi>moſt high,</hi> therefore, <hi>none higher,</hi> no, not among
the three ſacred Perſons in the bleſſed Trinity, <hi>none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there before or after another, none greater or leſs than
another, but the whole three Perſons Coeternal together, and
Coequal.</hi> (Athanas.) to make therefore the Son, as God,
leſſ, or under, or ſubject to any, were to deny him to be
God.</p>
            <p>So, as this, of the Sons being ſubject to the Father,
is to be underſtood of him only, as man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſo the Queſtion ſtill holds. For why ſhould it
be ſaid of Chriſt, as man, that he ſhould be <hi>then</hi> ſubject,
the Kingdom being delivered, as if not <hi>till then</hi> ſubject,

Kingdom being to him ſo delivered, is to be underſtood,
<hi>as to manifeſtation,</hi> and its then ſo appearing.</p>
            <p>As a Deputy or Lieutenant, ſupreme in Government,
of a Kingdom under the King, while he is veſted with the
Kings authority and power, and in his place and ſtead,
he commands in chief, and is as the King himſelf, who
is in him perſonated, and he, as the King honoured of
all, yet in all that with owned ſubordination and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which ſubjection then appears, when his work is
done, his Commiſſion determined, and the Government
delivered up.</p>
            <p>While Chriſt acts as ſupreme by that Power delegated
by the Father, and all things to that end put under him,
that his Subordination, though ſo as man, yet appears
not to all ſo clearly as after, <hi>when that Kingdom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſhall be by him to the Father delivered, then ſhall
the Son himſelf appear ſubject to him, who hath put all things
under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Chriſts being then ſo ſubject to the Father, is
not intended any leſſening or diminiſhing of his greatneſs.
This making much more to his Glory, and Majeſty which
is in that manifeſted.</p>
            <p>For, Obſerve, that <hi>God the Father</hi> having <hi>put all things
under his</hi> (Chriſt his Sons) <hi>Feet.</hi> It is on that inferred,
<hi>that in that, he hath put all things under him</hi> (the man
Chriſt) <hi>he left nothing, that is not put under him.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 2. 8.</note> But
here comes in the Text, an Exception to that, that <hi>when
he ſaith that he, the Father hath put all things under his
Feet, it is in that manifeſt, that he, the Father is excepted,
which did put all things under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it follows that <hi>the man Chriſt is next unto
God above all things;</hi> This ſhewing the high and exalted
Glory, and Honour of Chriſts humane Nature next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God himſelf, above all created beings and Glories what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
even <hi>above Angels</hi> who are <hi>commanded to worſhip
him</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 1. 6. 13.</note> And <hi>he having by himſelf purged our Sins, being

now ſet down on the right hand of the majeſty on high</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 1.</note>
So as this Chriſts being ſubject to the Father, is as if ſaid,
<hi>ſubject to him only, or alone,</hi> and his being in that next to
God himſelf, above all others whatſoever, which is not
a diminiſhing, but a magnifying of his greatneſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
above all.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>And</hi> then ſhall God be all in all, <hi>or</hi> that God may be
all in all.</p>
            <p>This is the laſt and higheſt conſideration of the ſtate of
all things, after the Reſurrection to Eternity, where <hi>God</hi>
is to be underſtood <hi>perſonally</hi> for the <hi>Father;</hi> this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by his relation to his Son here mentioned, he alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here expreſſely named and diſtinguished, <hi>God even the
Father v.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>Here alſo, is this God the Fathers being all in all made
a ſpecial work, and the great end of Chriſt ſo delivering
up the Kingdom to the Father, <hi>that he,</hi> the Father <hi>may
be all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This premiſed, ſee now <hi>how God is all in all,</hi> and what
is in that intended.</p>
            <p>This may be underſtood ſo.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As to acknowledgment. He</hi> ſeen and known <hi>and</hi>
owned ſo of all, that he is all in all.</p>
            <p>2. All in all alſo, <hi>in reſpect of</hi> dependence on him.</p>
            <p>3. And in <hi>reſpect of our happineſs alſo,</hi> in him and by him.</p>
            <p>I. This may be underſtood of Chriſt the Sons delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up the Kingdom to the Father in peace, God the
<hi>Father</hi> thereby, and thenceforth being <hi>acknowledged all
in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there are Enemies (as was ſaid) to be deſtroyed,
who riſe up againſt God to the diſturbance of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and obſcuring his ſoveraignty in the World.</p>
            <p>1. Such are <hi>Atheiſts</hi> denying God and his Governance
of all things in the World, and <hi>others</hi> leſſening what they
can, Chriſts Glory; and <hi>will not have that man to reign
over them.</hi>

Let ſuch conſider in what rank they ſtand, even as

I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name
he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my

things have I ſpoken unto you in Proverbs, the time cometh

ſhall ask in my name, and I ſay not to you that I will pray the
Father for you: For the Father himſelf loveth you.</p>
            <p>Where obſerve, 1. That here and before we find Chriſt
in this diſcourse with his Diſciples ſpeaking much <hi>of the

to deſire him to <hi>ſhew them the Father:</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Joh. 14. 8.</note> And here he
promiſeth that <hi>tbe time ſhall come when he ſhall ſhew them

minds them that there was a time, when even he himſelf
was not ſo expreſly known in the world, nor his name then
ſo much uſed in addreſſes to the Father. <hi>Hitherto</hi> (ſaith
he) that is under the Old Teſtament, <hi>ye asked nothing in my

               <note n="z" place="margin">Dan.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. But now under the Goſpel our Lord here ſhews, that
thenceforth all addreſſes ſhould be to the Father by him,
<hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my name he will give it you:
Ask and ye ſhall receive,</hi> which is now the concluding ſtyle
of all Chriſtian prayers, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But he tells them withal, that there ſhall come a day
when addreſſes ſhould be to the Father himſelf alſo, and
<hi>in that day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſhall ask me nothing,</hi> and though ye
ask in my name, <hi>I ſay not to you that I will pray the Father

how in that <hi>it was,</hi> and how <hi>it is,</hi> and how <hi>it ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet underſtand not this as any way abating our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

breaking out <hi>on the 23th. of October</hi> 1641, wherein

this charitable Perſon fed, clad, and relieved, that he
was himſelf thereby brought to ſtreights, the courſe of
his Revenues here being every way ſtopt. By which,
and by the Dangers daily drawing nearer even to the

<hi>England</hi> for ſecurity and ſubſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But there alſo not long after was he (as by ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality)
overtaken with Evils unexpected, as great and
general, by which Church and State were together o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned.
<hi>As if one fleeing from a Lion ſhould meet

This is here obſerved for obviating Malicious ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
detracting from that excellent Work, breathing Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Devotion, and vindicating the ſincerity of that great
Soul in all his actings and occurrences therein mentioned;
Malice ſuggeſting to the World <hi>that although that work carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King</hi>'s <hi>Name, yet was it not</hi> (said they) <hi>his own, but by
ſome of his Chaplains compoſed,</hi> intending thereby the leſſoning
his Majeſties great and excelling parts; and the rendring
that moſt excellent piece leſs regarded, that thereby their
own wickedneſs might be leſs obſerved.</p>
               <p>Whereas the contrary to that falſe aſſertion appears now
in this: and the Royal Author of the precious Work found to
be the King himſelf: that being declared <hi>by one dying,</hi> whoſe
advantages then by it could be then nothing any way,
and thoſe being his laſt words which may be concluded ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and ſacred; <hi>he averring thoſe very Papers to have

And <hi>that they were by the King himſelf delivered into his

               <p>And now to return to what concerns himſelf.</p>
               <p>His Sufferings were of long continuance, from 1641,
to 1660. but by the glorious Sunriſe of his ſacred Majeſty
<hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond in his happy return were all thoſe miſts

happy; then was the face of all things in Church and
State changed gloriouſly, his Majeſty returning to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and to the Throne of his Royal Anceſtors. <hi>Then were our
Judges reſtored as at firſt, and our Counſellors as at the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A deſcription of happy times<note n="a" place="margin">Iſ. 1. 2</note>: then was the <hi>Church</hi>

               <p>Among thoſe was this pious Perſon ſought, found, and

Chriſtianarum ſucceſſione &amp; ſtatu</hi> which was by him
publiſhed <hi>an.</hi> 1613. and was <hi>by Archbiſhop Abbot of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
preſented to <hi>King James</hi> with theſe words, <hi>ſee Sr.
the eminent firſt fruits of the Colledge of Dublin.</hi> That <hi>Houſe</hi>
was then of twenty years ſtanding, and that <hi>learned Work</hi>
the <hi>firſt</hi> that came from any there. And <hi>he himſelf,</hi> the
happy <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of that <hi>Univerſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which concerning this learned Perſon, I borrow
from and owe to that ſhort collection of his Life, given by
<hi>Doctor Bernard</hi> in his <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> Apr. 17, 1656, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the enlarging that, may hereafter be the work of ſome
happy pen: that <hi>nothing of thoſe precious Fragments</hi> be
loſt, ſome <hi>Baſkets</hi> yet remaining <hi>to be filled.</hi> If his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
be now by time almoſt worn out here among us, let
this ſerve in ſome ſort to refreſh it, or if envy in ſome
would have it loſt, and his eſteem leſſened here; let it be
remembred which was ſpoken by our Lord of himſelf, and
true of others, <hi>that a Prophet is not without Honour ſave in
his own Country and in his own Houſe</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 1 57.</note>; and let it ſuffice
that it be <hi>left to Strangers</hi> to value what is ours, which
we our ſelves do not. But know that therein you ſuffer
your ſelves to be robbed of an <hi>Honor</hi> to this <hi>Univerſity,</hi> to
this <hi>City,</hi> and to this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from ſuch beginnigs, what may we not after expect.</p>
               <p>To paſs times intervening, the preſent ſhews it hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>1. In <hi>our illuſtrious Chancellor James</hi> Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>

Univerſity of Oxford</hi> ambitiouſly ſought for, and now
of both together Chancellor.</p>
               <p>2. You have ſeen the <hi>late Vice Chancellor,</hi> the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Prelat; whoſe memory is at preſent before us prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally.</p>
               <p>3. You have a prudent, careful, and learned <hi>Preſident
and Governor</hi> ſecond to none, if equalled by any before,
for government and parts anſwerable.</p>
               <p>4. And as to the preſent ſtock of Fellows and other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates
and Schollars; theſe for Learning and Ingenuity, their
number and ſtanding conſidered, not needing to give place
to any; envied they may be, but not neglected.</p>
               <p>And wherefore all this? All ſaid in this is intended, as an
inducement to all well affected to Piety and Learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, to promote and encourage ſuch happy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may hear thoſe</hi> Sons of Prophets <hi>now ſay, as did

take every man a beam and let us make us a place where to

               <p>In order whereunto, let it be remembred. That <hi>the
Army</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>time an.</hi> 1601 after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the Enemy at <hi>Kniſale,</hi> that being the ſhutting
up of that War, contributed <hi>l.</hi> 1800 towards the beginning
of a Library, till then here wanting; for which end <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Chaloner</hi> (the induſtrious promoter of the building of
this Colledge, by exhorting others, and himſelf withal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
contributing) Alſo that <hi>learned Perſon after Primat
Uſher of</hi> whom ſo much hath been now ſpoken, were both
choſen; and ſent into <hi>England</hi> with that money given by
the Army for chooſing and buying books accordingly.
Theſe then met at <hi>London,</hi> Sr. <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi> on the like
work <hi>for his Library at Oxford;</hi> each helping the other in
what was in that to be done; ſo as <hi>Sr. Thomas Bodleys Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

Library in Oxford, and ours here began together. And
herein this our Library owes it ſelf to our ſoldiery, learning
by Arms promoted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſeconded <hi>an.</hi> 1656 by that Army in <hi>Ireland</hi>
commanded then by <hi>Henry Cromwel</hi> (let not what may be
good be forgotten; but the good <hi>be gathered into Veſſels, while
what is bad is caſt away</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 13. 48.</note>; then did <hi>that Army</hi> (on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
of their work in <hi>Ireland</hi> as to the Rebellion there)
<hi>contribute about. l 2200 for purchaſing learned Primat Uſhers
Library;</hi> which being then in <hi>England</hi> it was by that <hi>great
Cardinal of France</hi> eyed, and by the French Embaſſador
in <hi>England</hi> preſſed for earneſtly, for other ends, to be by
them purchaſed at a greater ſumm then was here given.
Hereby was that pretious Stock of Learning preſerved for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> whither it was after brought: And by his Grace
the <hi>Duke of Ormond then Lord Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Chancellor</hi>
of this <hi>Univerſity,</hi> was <hi>An.</hi> 1661 ordered to be laid up in
this Colledge, as an addition to the Library here where
now it is. And now purſuant to <hi>both</hi> thoſe, let there be a
place left for this preſent Army alſo, on this <hi>their great
and general ſettlement,</hi> they therein gathering the fruits of
their Labors, and that more abundantly than ever had been
in <hi>Ireland</hi> before this time.</p>
               <p>Let it not be ſaid, that thoſe other have done ſo much
and theſe nothing. This is what hath been of old accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
<hi>that out of ſpoils in War, ſome part ſhould be dedicated to
God as an acknowledgement of his hand in that work:</hi> ſo did
<hi>Samuel the ſeer; and Saul the Son of Kiſh; and Abner the Son
of Ner and Joab the Son of Zerviah; David alſo the King and

which beſides that of the <hi>ſpoils</hi> had been by them
<hi>of their own</hi> ſtore ſo offered<note n="w" place="margin">1. Chrs 2 3. 10. 9.</note> together with the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

the occaſion offered, <hi>the enlarging this place for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

ſelf a bleſſing to Church and State. Pardon this <hi>Digreſſion</hi>
which I deſire may be, to that end for which it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
prevailing.</p>
               <p>As to this <hi>great prelat,</hi> to whom I now again return:</p>
               <p>We have ſeen him at the <hi>higheſt</hi> that <hi>this Church of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
could raiſe him; ſee him now as to his <hi>Qualifications</hi>
thereunto.</p>
               <p>In him appears what the great Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> wiſhes
for and requires in a Biſhop<note n="y" place="margin">Tit. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>that he be blameleſs, hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable,
ſober, a lover of good Men, juſt, holy, holding faſt
the Faith</hi> (Orthodox) theſe I but name only without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
application as to him, who may rather ſeem to be in
that, named or pointed at, as by his juſt and owned Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;
Add his <hi>Learning</hi> a fit application for ſuch. His
parts were more in ſubſtance, then ſhew, ordinarily. His
value was much intrinſick, not overlaid and ſet forth for
oſtentation. He was a veſſel full of rich liquor, which
muſt be pierced if taſted, and then found Fragrant, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and refreſhing, I was at his Table with others, when
a point of Learning paſſing from hand to hand, he for a
time hearing and ſilent, at length the matter was by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
taken up with variety of learning and reading and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to admiration; ſo as a learned prelat preſent,
brake out into this expreſſion; <hi>my Lord I thank you I am
now here both Fed and taught,</hi> I know not but his papers
may afford ſomething <hi>poſthume</hi> worthy his parts, and the
worlds peruſal. This his being as to himſelf reſerved
ſeems to to be <hi>a natural diſpoſition</hi> in him, being of a <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Spirit</hi> like <hi>Iſaac</hi> among the Patriarks (<hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Jacob</hi>) of leſs noiſe in the World than they; and as the
patern to all,<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 12. 19.</note> our Lord Chriſt, <hi>not ſtriving nor his voice heard
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95050:20"/>
in the Streets</hi> ſeeming to be rather blamed by his friends
as was <hi>our Lord</hi> alſo by his,<note n="a" place="margin">John. 7. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>go</hi> (said they) <hi>over Jordan
that thy Diſciples may ſee the Works that thou doeſt, for there
is no man that doth any thing in ſecret and he himſelf ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be known openly: if thou do thoſe things ſhew thy ſelf
to the World;</hi> ſo was it with him generally, I <hi>except when
the Church came to be concerned.</hi> Then was he up and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the duty of a true Prelate, <hi>the Zeal of Gods Houſe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him up;</hi> he being thereupon ſometimes paſſionately
troubled, where any thing fell ſhort of his expectation
that way. <hi>Careful</hi> he was of his Epiſcopal <hi>Charge;</hi> as in
what was in his <hi>own Dioceſs of Armagh</hi> under his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
care, ſo throughout his <hi>Province;</hi> that others in like
place ſubordinately, ſhould ſee to their work alſo. He did
encourage well doing in all the Clergy, exhorting the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and reproving what was amiſs; and that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in mildneſs, but ſometimes where cauſe required,
ſharply, yet that oft with tears.</p>
               <p>Not long before his end being faſtned to his Bed, and a
viſitation then being held by his Surrogate, for his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Armagh,</hi> he deſired in the return, to underſtand the
ſtate of the Churches there; to which this accompt was
given him, That therewas no Church there, without an
able and learned Miniſter: and that the duty in every
Church was performed duly by a Refident Miniſter, or
an able Reſident Curate with competent allowance. This
I had from a learned Perſon, whoſe that work was under
him principally, which accompt was by him recived with
much ſatisfaction, as what was to be ſhortly after given
by him to the great Biſhop of Souls.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Charity; Piety,</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> this is a principal
<hi>Qualification,</hi> and becoming that ſacred Order above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
concerning which as to <hi>this pious Prelat,</hi> ſomething
hath been already ſpoken. His charitable <hi>relieving thoſe
poor ſtript Proteſtants in Ireland while</hi> he <hi>was there, An.</hi>
1641 <hi>feeding the Hungry, Clothing the Naked and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95050:21"/>
all neceſſaries for the Sick;</hi> and that ſo liberally, and ſo
long, as that he was himſelf at length brought neer to his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
and thereby enforced to ſeek elſewhere what to eat;
of which before Alſo <hi>in times of his retirements in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
his own Stock, and ſtore being ſhort for helping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as he deſired; <hi>He made it his work to ſtir up others to
that good Work,</hi> for relieving the neceſſities of poor Iriſh
Sufferers, flocking daily to <hi>London</hi> for help; eſpecially
for the diſtreſſed of the Clergy; and thoſe particularly
of <hi>England</hi> ſuffering for a good Conſcience. Hereunto
were charitable Perſons by his ſollicitations moved to large
Contributions: they chooſing him the firſt mover, to be
therein the Almoſner and Diſpenser of their bounty to
ſuch as he ſhould judge fitting: this he diſcharged with all
faithfulnes. And among others was thereby releived that
Worthy and Learned Prelat of <hi>Ireland Biſhop Chappel
that excellent Provoſt</hi> ſometimes of <hi>this Colledge of Dublin.</hi>
After his return into <hi>Ireland,</hi> God having bleſſed him
in his Subſtance conſiderably, he would not be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of that place in <hi>England</hi> where he was Born. And
at <hi>Drighlington</hi> in <hi>York</hi>-Shire, his Native place and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he erected and endowed <hi>a Free School,</hi> endowing
that with a large yearly Revenue for ever. And in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> Beſide what was by him piouſly contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the repairing and adorning the two <hi>Cathedrals</hi> in
<hi>Dublin Chriſts Church and St. Patricks,</hi> There was added
his Care and Bounty towards his Cathedral at <hi>Armagh.</hi>
As to <hi>Armagh,</hi> That had oft fatally ſuffered almoſt to
utter deſolation: that place Seated in the Province of <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
being in troubleſome times ſubject to frequent incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and attempts of Enemies. It had ſuffered by Fire
and Sword <hi>An</hi> 890. 893. and 919. 1166. and 1179.
and 1189. and laſtly 1642. when Sr. <hi>Phelim O Neile</hi> in
the head of an Army of about 7000 Rebels aſſaulting
<hi>Liſnegarvy</hi> (now <hi>Liſburn</hi>) and being ſhamefully repulſed
by a few not exceeding (if ſo many as) 200 Brittiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95050:21"/>
whom that Noble Perſon Sr. <hi>George Rawden</hi> was
Eminent above any: the enraged Rebels therefore in their
return revenged themſelves in the cruel murthering a
number of poor Proteſtants yet in their power. One alſo
of their chief Officers of the <hi>O Neiles, deſtroyed Armagh,</hi>
and conſumed <hi>that great Cathedral with Fire,</hi> which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
Act of that wicked perſon eſcaped not divine
Juſtice, <hi>he ſoon after falling diſtracted and dying miſerably.</hi>
The repairing that vaſt Pile and Cathedral of <hi>Armagh</hi>
was a chief care of this pious Prelate, its Arch-Biſhop;
towards which, that being the Metropolitical Church of
that Province of <hi>Armagh,</hi> contributions had been in all
former times on ſuch occaſions made for it in the ſeveral
Dioceſſes ſubject to that Metropolitan; the like therefore
was now alſo propoſed, which being done, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
made, it was found very ſhort of what was hoped
for, and not anſwering the ſixth part of the charge herein
neceſſary. Thereunto were alſo applyed other ſmall Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Church, which comings in, being limited to
certain days of payment as they became due; thoſe alſo
coming in ſlowly; and ſome failing; and all ſhort of
what that great Work further required: therefore for
preſent advance of Mony to anſwer the conſtant carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on that Work, and to ſupply what was every way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in all, it cannot be reaſonably judged but that
this great perſons Bounty was in that conſiderable; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for particular to accompts taken of the whole. But
now by his care is the whole Fabrick perfected and the
Service of God in its ſeveral Miniſtrations reſtored, and
that conſtantly attended to the juſt praiſe of his Piety,
Care, and Beneficence.</p>
               <p>As to his otherwiſe diſpensing charitably to the need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he
reſerved himſelf in that unto himſelf, (as in other his great
parts) which were not for common obſervation; charity
being in that properly ordered, ſo as that <hi>the left hand
ſhould not know what the right hand doth,</hi> yet by that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95050:22"/>
hand by him in ſuch occaſions ordinarily employed, I
have aſſurance that he was <hi>full of good Works</hi> and in that
way conſtant and forward, not expecting ſolicitations and
addreſſes toward it, but enquiring ſecretly for the Poor
and Needy, and ſending them oft help, they knew not
whence, and that as occaſion was for it, liberally. One
Perſon being inſtanced (but not named) to whom at one
time out of his own Purſe, he ſent one hundred Pound.</p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>out of his own Purſe;</hi> to difference what was ſo by
him done, from what, <hi>by his honourable place of his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Almoſner of Ireland,</hi> he faithfully diſpersed. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
he was in that his publique truſt, not ſuffering any
part of what came in that way to mix with his private.
But depoſiting this in that faithful hand that received it, to
be forthwith diſposed to its proper uſe, as the comings
in, which were Slow, would allow it. I have peruſed
thoſe accompts, and found the comings in to be ſometimes
by 20 Shillings, or ſuch ſmall Sums at a time, ſometimes
more, but never above 23 Pounds, and that but once,
thoſe comings in alſo being uncertain and but as occaſions
were for it, by its double Branches of <hi>Fines</hi> or <hi>Deodands,</hi>
the whole ſum of both put together making up but
169<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. 18<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and that in 15 Years from 1663 to 1678.
Yet was this, whatſoever it was in common eſteem ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to cloud his private Charity, all by him done, being
commonly interpreted only on the publique accompt,
which was no trouble to him, but well anſwering his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of being in that work as to himſelf private and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved.</p>
               <p>As to his private Eſtate and Fortunes, God bleſſed him
in that abundantly. A Bleſſing promiſed to the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
yet is not that allways ſo in this Life. God reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome retributions, and the greater, to another; here

               <p>But to the contrary it is well known that even <hi>in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he laid out for a ſettlement for one of his Children,
<hi>no leſs then 4 thouſand Pounds at once.</hi> And the like <hi>Sum
of 4 thouſand</hi> more towards the ſettlement there of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Children. He was alſo on purchaſeing not
far off, an Eſtate ſould after for 6 thouſand Pound, which he
might have had cheaper, but refuſed to deal in it, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
part of it to be Abbey Land. For in all his
layings out whereſoever, he was ever careful not to medle
with any concern of the Church, nor with Tithes, nor
with what did belong to Abbeys, having oft obſerved
the evil of that to their Poſſeſſors.</p>
               <p>That therefore of <hi>his not laying out of his Subſtance in
Ireland,</hi> is a cauſleſs detraction, the contrary appearing
conſiderably.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>wherein is the evil of his providing a ſettlement
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95050:23"/>
alſo in England, as in Ireland;</hi> and whether in that were
not his conſiderations prudent and provident.</p>
               <p>He had <hi>in Ireland ſeen and felt</hi> the prodigious evills of
that <hi>fatal Year</hi> 1641. How it was then with <hi>others,</hi>
and with <hi>himſelf</hi> alſo; and that holding 20 Years after.</p>
               <p>He might have remembred that Year 1641, <hi>was not
the firſt of that kind in this Kingdom;</hi> that being but a
repeating over and over again what was oft before;
although never in ſo high a degree of miſchief in any
age till then.</p>
               <p>He might have conſidered, <hi>that it might be ſo again,
as then and before;</hi> the ſame effects likely following where
the ſame cauſes are in being. <hi>Solomons</hi> obſervation of

bin, is what ſhall be, and that which is done, is that which
ſhall be done</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Eccl. 1. 9.</note>. May it not therefore be thought adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſhould be a laying up in ſtore, where is more ſecurity to
anſwer ſuch accidents; I wiſh there be not ſome here
this day alive, who reflecting on this, may not find cauſe

I wiſh I may be in this a falſe Prophet. And if there be

not withſtanding his Phiſitians deſires to the contrary,
not by his going abroad to expoſe himſelf to inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies;
his Diſtemper having already gotten ſome hold
of him. He was a ſtrict obſerver of his Phiſitians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
and councells at all times now only excepted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Gods ſervice to his private Condition. He was
always a conſtant frequenter above others, of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſervice of God, not omitting any occaſion for that,
where any competency of Health would permit. After
that, and from thenceforth <hi>he was confined to his Houſe</hi> by

for ſerving God. And when <hi>he ſeemed to be confined to his
Chamber:</hi> yet then (although not well able) would he ſtep
out to be in the company of thoſe worſhiping God in
the next room, parting from them with a bleſſing to that
meeting. After a while that liberty was denied him, not
to <hi>be reſtrained only to his Chamber, but to be alſo faſtned
to his Bed.</hi> Then notwithſtanding ſome hopes given by
his Phiſitians, he gave himſelf to prepare carefully for
that change which he did foreſee more then others, This
he did by Prayer, and for the Church was his Prayers
particularly; and deſired others Prayers alſo with him and
for him. Alſo by private Meditation in which he was
frequent, complaining ſometimes of being in that diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
