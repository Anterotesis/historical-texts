            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The rest in Annual Rites must be display'd;</l>
               <l>For when a Saint like ours to Heaven ascends,</l>
               <l>Grief stays below,â€”</l>
               <l>And only Joy the Seraphim attends.</l>
               <l>Our Tears on Earth to certain Measures are restrain'd;</l>
               <l>For should our long excessive Moans,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Niobe</hi> congeal us into Stones,</l>
               <l>No Mortal yet e'er saw restor'd</l>
               <l>What the relentless Grave has once devour'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50258:6"/>Thus Thirty Daysâ€”</l>
               <l>In <hi>Moab</hi>'s Plains by their loud Grief detain'd</l>
               <l>The Sacred Host of <hi>Israel</hi> wept</l>
               <l>When their Divine Commander slept,</l>
               <l>And <hi>God</hi> conceal'd Their Captain, and his Friend.</l>

               <l>â€”'Tis but Self Int'rest still</l>
               <l>With grudging Tears to wail Her endless <hi>Gain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>While only we deplore the Loss our Selves sustain.</l>
               <l>For now,â€”</l>
               <l>Our Saint e're this, in Bright Seraphick State,</l>
               <l>Has made her publick Entry through the <hi>Iaspar Gate,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where she through Walls of vast <hi>Transparent Gems,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And Starry Lustre into Tresses curl'd,</l>
               <l>Looks down with Pity on the Wicked World.</l>
               <l>Vouchsafe a Royal Saint an Apotheosis</l>
               <l>So just to be allow'd as this.</l>
               <l>For why should gaudy Superstition claim</l>
               <l>The Keys of Paradice,</l>
               <l>And real Sanctity not have the same,</l>
               <l>

               <l>She wore a Crown on Earth; Who can surmise</l>
               <l>That she should lose her Crown by going to Heav'n?</l>
               <l>Nor would the Question be too closely driv'n,</l>
               <l>Where the Effects of Prayer to Saints would fall,</l>
               <l>Should <hi>Rome</hi> on Hers, we on Our <hi>MARY</hi> call.</l>

               <l>And to the cheared World explain</l>
               <l>Th' Enigma of our Joy and Sorrow Subaltern,</l>
               <l>So blended, that at once we both Rejoice and Mourn.</l>
               <l>We thought th' Omnipotent at first provok'd,</l>
               <l>And our Disaster with Impatience brook'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Britannia</hi> languishing with Arms across</l>
               <l>To see her Welfare weltring in her Loss.</l>
               <l>But then, Fresh Joys Arriv'd,</l>
               <l>Finding Victorious <hi>WILLIAM</hi> still surviv'd,</l>
               <l>And to his Peoples Hearts more closely joyn'd,</l>
               <l>By New Espousals of Address'd Affection.</l>

                  <hi>Britannia</hi> then,â€”</l>
               <l>Acknowledg'd Heav'n less Angry and more Kind,</l>
               <l>The more she stood in need of Heav'ns Protection.</l>
               <l>Long may He be, still Arm'd in our Defence,</l>
               <l>The Care of wakefull Providence.</l>
               <l>And long may be his Martial Flame</l>
               <l>The Terrour of proud <hi>Bourbon</hi>'s Hated Name.</l>
               <l>For Mighty Works, and Wonderfull Events,</l>
               <l>Heav'n still prepares Heroic Instruments.</l>
               <l>Him all Men grant the Instrument prepar'd,</l>
               <l>And by the <hi>Gallick Titan</hi> only fear'd.</l>
               <l>Should His Support, by Prudence Fortunate,</l>
               <l>Once fail the Common Cause, I dread the Fate</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Europe</hi> all into Confusion hurl'd,</l>
               <l>Like the Unbolted Frame of the Dissolving World.</l>
