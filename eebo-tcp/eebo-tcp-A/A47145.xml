         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at <hi>Turners-Hall</hi> in <hi>Philpot-Lane</hi> by <hi>Fanchurch-Street</hi>
in <hi>London,</hi> being our ordinary Meeting-place,
Licenſed by Authority, on the Eleventh Day of the
Eleventh Month called <hi>January,</hi> in the Forenoon;
there to detect and diſcover Groſs Errors and Anti-chriſtian
Principles, plainly repugnant to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Chriſtianity, in the Books of the approved
Authors and Writers of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by
ocular Inſpection preſenting them, in fair and full
Quotations, to as many as are willing to be preſent
and make Inſpection into them. And alſo to lay open
the great Fallacy and Sophiſtry of <hi>George Whitehead</hi>
and <hi>Joſeph Wyeth,</hi> and ſome of their Brethren at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
which they have uſed in their late print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Defences of their Own, and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
moſt Erronious Paſſages contained in their
Books, in order to Cloak and Hide their Antichriſtian
Principles and vile Errors, not only to the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of all true Proteſtants in this Nation, of whom
they pretend to be the more refined Part, but of all
true Chriſtians any where.</p>
            <p>And I do hereby deſire, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
Wyeth,</hi> and their Brethren of the Second Days
Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> who have approved their late

            <head>A few Words of
PREFACE
TO THE
IMPARTIAL READERS.</head>
            <p>IMpartial Readers, I have theſe few things to acquaint
you with, and recommend to your Conſideration.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> that I found juſt and neceſſary Cauſe to recite
diverſe former Quotations given in my former Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and in other Books formerly publiſh'd against the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Errors, to detect the fallacious and ſophiſtical Defences
that they have made in their late Books, in Vindication of
thoſe Quotations, to cover their vile Errors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Beſide the former Quotations above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I have brought many new Quotations, which are neither
in my former Narratives, nor in any other Books that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
have been publiſhed against them, which obviates the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
of the Quakers, who would be ready to ſay, <hi>There is
nothing to be expected of new Matter, but what is
contained in other Books, and which hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
anſwered by them:</hi> The contrary whereof will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
appear to any that ſhall compare this fourth Narrative,
with any other Books, before this, publiſhed againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97123:5"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas the common Objection of the Quakers,
is, <hi>That their Books are neither fully nor fairly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi>
To remove the Ground of any ſuch Objection, I have
got the Atteſtation of Perſons of known Integrity and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Truth of them (as I got the like Atteſtation
from ſome, the former Year, to atteſt to my third Narrative.)
I have given the Quotations as fully and fairly as is requiſite
to ſatisfie any reaſonable Perſons. But the Men I have to
deal with, for all this, will (I expect) renew their unjuſt
Complaint, and will tell their Readers, <hi>This and the other
Paſſage, going before, or following, ſhould have been
inſerted in the Quotations;</hi> whereas the not inſerting of
them, makes not their Cauſe one whit the worſe, nor the inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, makes their Cauſe one whit the better, as could be
ſhewed in many Inſtances, and is ſhewed in their late Books, for
when ſo much is quoted out of any Book, that gives the full
Senſe of the Writer; whatever is more, is ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note, for a Proof on the laſt Head,</hi> That the Quakers
deny the Moral Law or Ten Commandments, to be a
Rule to the Chriſtian's Life, and thereupon do not
blame, but juſtifie doing ſervile Work on the firſt Day,
yea, and in the Face of a Congregation, while the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
was preaching. <hi>See p. 28. of this Narrative.</hi>

George Whitehead, <hi>Voice of Wiſdom, pag 33. his Opponent,</hi> Th. Danſon, <hi>having
ſaid,</hi> As for our Want of Infallibility, 'tis no valid Plea againſt our Miniſtry. G.W. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi>
His Falſhood here appears plainly, for they that want Infallibility, and have not
the Spirit of Chriſt, they are out of the Truth, and are fallible, and their miniſtry is not
of the Spirit, ſeeing they ſpeak not from the Spirit, but from their own Hearts, which are
deceitful, where they want Infallibility, ſo out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth
ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>Joſ. Wyeth,</hi> in his <hi>Switch for the Snake,</hi> p. 87. ſtates the Queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Infallibility, fallaciouſly in three ſeveral Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That the holy Spirit of God is infallible,</hi> &amp;c. This is no Part of the Controverſie.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That the holy Spirit leads all ſuch who obey him, infallibly into all Truth neceſſary to
Salvation:</hi> This is wrongly ſtated, the true State of the Queſtion being, Whether
the Holy Spirit leads us into all Truth neceſſary to Salvation, without the external
Doctrine, externally delivered in the holy Scriptures, by preaching and reading,
and without all external means? This they affirm, as ſhall hereafter be proved; but
this all ſound Chriſtians deny, who yet grant, that all the Faithful are infallibly led
into all Truth neceſſary to Salvation, by the infallible Spirit, in the Uſe of the holy
Scriptures, which contain the infallible Truths of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That the Miniſters who are ſent forth in the Work of the Miniſtry, have, or may
have (if they diligently attend to the Voice of the infallible Spirit ſpeaking in them) a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
infallible Knowledge and Aſſurance of the Truth of what they ſo deliver.</hi> This alſo
is wrongly ſtated, the true State is not what they have or may have, but what they
really have in all they preach and write, as is clear from the above given Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> their great Leaders. To ſay, they <hi>may</hi> have, implies that
they <hi>may</hi> not have, and in that caſe they are fallible, and ſo by their own Verdict,
are under the Curſe, Conjurers, Deceivers.</p>
               <p>Note, that their great Teachers and Leaders, <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> have taught, that
the infallible teaching of the Spirit, is not by the medium or external Means of
the Scriptures, and that Faith is not given by the external Word, doth appear from
their Books.</p>

               <p>Note, the Quakers that ſay, they are turned to the Light, yet are not led out

Words prove, that ſome of the Quakers at leaſt did underſtand (as they thought)
ALL Scripture. The Paſſage is this;</hi> But they cannot know all Scriptures, but as they
vttain to the full Meaſure of the Spirit of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and to the Meaſure

able to know all the Scriptures, and the Work of the Miniſters of God, was to bring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Note, that they thought their Miniſtry had brought ſome of the Quakers to this;
we ſhall ſee hereafter, and no doubt they judged they were come to it, <hi>viz. G. F.</hi>

come above any Degree, and that is beyond and above the Apoſtles themſelves,
who were but in the Degrees, but they were come to the Fulneſs it ſelf, that is, to

               <p>
                  <hi>But let us next hear</hi> G. Whitehead<hi>'s Excuſe of G, F's Saying,</hi> None can underſtand

the Scripture be received, that must be by a Degree of the ſame Spirit, as I ſuppoſe, the
Words before-cited ſhould be ſo tranſpoſed, and ſo intended.</p>
               <p>Note, If this Liberty be allowed, to tranſpoſe Words in a Sentence, the falſeſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions

<hi>James,</hi> by tranſpoſing <hi>James</hi> killed <hi>Herod.</hi> Is not this a rare Evidence of <hi>G. W</hi>'s
Truth and Innocency, or rather of his ſhameful Sophiſtry: But whereas he ſaith,

               <p>But it's no wonder <hi>G. F.</hi> thought he was come to ſuch Height of Perfection,
when he ſaid in his <hi>Battle-door, All Languages are to me no more than Dust, who

               </p>
               <p>But here again let us note, that the Author of the <hi>Switch</hi> acts the dull Sophiſter
very manifeſtly,<note place="margin">Switch. p. 453, 465.</note> when on the one hand he ſeems to be highly pleaſed with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Point of Inſpiration, and ſaith, <hi>He is glad that
ſo eſſential a Truth, as is the Inſpiration of the holy Spirit, is owned by her:</hi> And on the
other hand, for blaming the Author of the Snake, for his contradicting himſelf, by
his approving the Inſpirations owned by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and yet faulting the
Quakers Pretences to, Inſpirations. The Author of the <hi>Snake</hi> had ſufficiently cleared
this, in his Book called <hi>the Snake,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 322. what ſort of Inſpiration the
Church of <hi>England</hi> owned, <hi>which is that of ſanctifying and ſaving Graces;</hi> but for the
extraordinary and miraculous Inſpirations of Prophecy and Tongues, ſhe doth not
pretend to, nor teach, that they are commonly given, or that they are to be ſought,
there being no need of them.</p>
               <p>The manner of prophetical Inſpirations, which the Prophets and Apoſtles had,
was ſuch as they had given them by the Spirit, <hi>without all outward teaching of Men or
Books;</hi> and beſide this, they had the ordinary Inſpirations of the Spirit (given in the
uſe of the external means in God's ordinary way) to wit, the ſanctifying and ſaving
Graces of the Spirit inſpired into them. Here is a plain Difference betwixt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
which the Quakers pretend to, given them without the external means
of hearing, reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Inſpirations given in the uſe of the ordinary means
of the written Word, both preached and read, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> lays
claim unto, which makes the Sophiſtry of the Author of the <hi>Switch</hi> very manifeſt,
and alſo his great Injuſtice to the Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi> ſo to charge him without
ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us hear what great matters the Author of the</hi> Switch <hi>pretends, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
of the Light within,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Switch, pag. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>will teach them who attend upon it:</hi> It will (<hi>ſaith
he</hi>) fully teach them their Duty to God, and enable them to perform it: It will diſcover
to them a Syſtem of Principles truly Orthodox, with more Certainty than Counſel or Synod
can, not taught by it; for be is indeed a wonderful Counſeller. It will first, fully and
truly (beyond any Caſuiſt) ſhew unto Man what is his Sin, and if Man deſpile not this
Diſcovery, but cloſe with it, it will beget in him a Loathing of his Sin, and then proceed
to work in him a Repentance from dead Works, which if unfeigned, <hi>you ſee he is very
cautious [but why</hi> If unfeigned? <hi>Can the Light within work any other Repentance
but that which is unfeigned?]</hi> It will go on to ſanctifie him; and when Man, by this
Light, Spirit, or Grace, is ſanctified; it will then witneſs to his Spirit that he is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſo will Man come truly to be redeemed. This (<hi>he ſaith</hi>) in ſhort, is the <hi>Subſtance</hi>
of what hath been by us declared, concerning this Divine Light, Christ in Man, and
which is not more than is witneſſed of it in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97123:7"/>
Note, By this plain Confeſſion, we ſee what ſort of Syſtem of Divinity the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the Quakers plead for, doth, or will give them who attend upon it; to wit,
<hi>a-Scheme of Deism, or refined Paganiſm.</hi> In all this Subſtance of his whole Syſtem,
not one word of <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> as he outwardly dyed for our Sins; his being the
great Sacrifice for the Remiſſion of our Sins, <hi>by Faith in his Blood outwardly, ſhed.</hi>
But the Inſpirations of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles taught them this Faith, and
the neceſſity of it, as well as of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins: And ſeeing
the Quakers Inſpiration teacheth them nothing of ſuch a Faith, and the neceſſity of
it, it is a plain caſe tho the Quakers pretend to the ſame Inſpirations that the Prophets
and Apoſtles had; yet they have them not, nay, nor the ordinary Inſpirations that
common true Believers have, in and by the means of the external Doctrine contained
in the holy Scriptures, that lead them to regard Chriſt outwardly, as he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and raiſed again, and is at the Right Hand of God, <hi>in our Nature,</hi> as the great
Object of their Faith: But this the Inſpirations of the chief Teachers of the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
have led them not to regard.</p>
               <p>In the whole Syſtem of his Orthodox Principles, the Subſtance whereof he tells
us he has given; there is not one <hi>intire Article of the Creed,</hi> commonly called <hi>the
Apoſtles Creed,</hi> mentioned; nay, nor ſo much as implyed. And indeed, he cannot
(nor any of his Brethren) by any real Evidence, convince any Man. that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
have taught them ſo much as <hi>one intire Article of that Creed, in the true
Senſe,</hi> generally received <hi>by true Chriſtians;</hi> and according to their Principles, they
muſt not ſay, that the Spirit has given or wrought the Faith of the Articles of the
Creed in them, by the medium or means of the outward Word; for that is contrary
to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Doctrine above delivered, and as expreſly contrary to the Doctrine of
<hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Brief Diſcovery of the dangerous Principles of</hi> John Horne,<note place="margin">

who blames <hi>J. Horne</hi> and <hi>T. Moor for having affirmed, that the Scriptures are the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
of Faith, [i. e.</hi> the means by which Faith is wrought in Believers.] There is no
ſuch Scripture (ſaith <hi>G.W.</hi>) as ſaith, the Scriptures are the Medium of Faith.</p>
               <p>Note, ſeeing the Quakers have not the Faith of Chriſt, as he was outwardly
crucified, and died for our Sins, and roſe again; neither by the Light within them,
nor by the medium of the Scriptures, as the Inſtrument of the holy Spirit, as other
true Chriſtians have it; it is a plain caſe, they have no Faith of it at all, other
than a meer hiſtorical Faith, as they have of any common Hiſtory; and indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them have not that.</p>
               <p>G. Whitehead, <hi>in his</hi> Quakers Plainneſs, <hi>p. 70. brings a quibbling Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a means and the means, he grants,</hi> The Bible may be a means inſtrumentally, as
God beſtows a Bleſſing upon, or accompanies the ſerious reading thereof, as it directs to
Chriſt Jeſus, or to his Light and Spirit, which openeth the Vnderſtanding in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
<hi>And a little before he ſaith,</hi> Mark the Difference betwixt a means and the
means, as between the Bible and Chriſt; that may be a means which is not the means,
Chriſt being the abſolute way and means, by way of Eminency for Man to come to know
God.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew the Fallacy of this Quibble: By the means are generally underſtood
the inſtrumental and ſubordinate Cauſes, to the principal Agent and Efficient,
which ought not to be confounded. Chriſt is the Author, and principal Efficient of
our Knowledge of God; and the Bible, <hi>i.e.</hi> the divine Oracles and Teſtimonies
contained therein, are the means, and to ſay the means, or a means, is equivalent
among all that know true <hi>Engliſh;</hi> as when we ſay, Food and Raiment are <hi>the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97123:8"/>
means</hi> to preſerve our natural Life, or <hi>a means,</hi> the Senſe is the ſame.</p>
               <p>But it is proved already out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Gr. Myſt. p. 243. that <hi>G. F.</hi> denyed that
the things of the Goſpel, and of the Spirit, are attained by <hi>an external means;</hi> will
<hi>G. W</hi>'s Diſtinction here ſerve him? Will he again diſtinguiſh betwixt a means and
an external means?</p>
               <p>But let us apply this ſubtile Diſtinction of <hi>G.W.</hi> to the Words of <hi>G. F.</hi> in <hi>Saul's Errand,</hi>
p. 6. who being charged that he ſaid, <hi>He was the eternal Judge of the World,</hi> he confeſſeth
it, and brings ſeveral Proofs, as he thinks, to prove it, as that <hi>the ſpiritual Man judgeth all
things, and the Saints ſhall judge the World:</hi> Now, ſeeing <hi>G. W.</hi> will needs have a
Diſtinction betwixt <hi>a means</hi> and <hi>the means,</hi> why not alſo betwixt <hi>a Judge of the
World,</hi> and <hi>the Judge,</hi> yea, <hi>the eternal Judge of the World,</hi> as he profeſſeth himſelf to
be? It was not enough that <hi>G. F.</hi> ſhould be a Judge of the World, but <hi>the Judge,</hi>
yea, the <hi>eternal Judge</hi> of the World; and by <hi>G. W</hi>'s Logick, <hi>G. F.</hi> was not a Judge,
but <hi>the Judge,</hi> by way of Eminency; yea, <hi>the eternal Judge of the World,</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi>
after his manner of frequently corrupting the Words of Scripture, as well as his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
Words, doth corruptly and falſly argue from that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 2.
Do ye not know that the Saints ſhall judge the World:</hi> Note, the Words, <hi>ſhall judge,</hi> in
the future, which <hi>G. F.</hi> corruptly applyeth to himſelf, in the preſent, or preterit.
Tenſe, that he was or is <hi>the Judge,</hi> yea, <hi>the eternal Judge of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, To come yet more cloſely to</hi> G. W. <hi>himſelf, I will ſhew you how he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
the Scriptures to be a means for the Converſion of Jews and Heathens to the
true Faith; in</hi> Truth defending the Quakers, by <hi>G. W.</hi> qu. 35. pag. 51. And what is
that the Goſpel muſt be preached to, in the Heathens that will receive it? And whether
they that preach to Turks and Heathens, ought to preach out of a Text, and prove their
Doctrine by Scripture to them, as the Prieſts do in <hi>England,</hi> yea or nay?</p>
               <p>Note, By this Query, he not only excludes the Scripture from being the
means, but a means for converting Turks and Heathens; nor will his common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of ſaying it was but a Query, help him: This ſort of querying being the
ſtrongeſt way of denying or affirming, both in Scripture and all other Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next let us hear</hi> W. Penn<hi>'s Confeſſion concerning means, in his</hi> Key, <hi>printed,</hi>
1699. <hi>p. 12. perverſ.</hi> 8. The Quakers aſſert the Spirit of God to be the immediate
Teacher, and that there is no other means now to be uſed, as Miniſtry, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.
He anſwereth,</hi> They never ſpake ſuch Language...for they never denied the uſe of means,
but to this Day, from the Beginning, they have been in the uſe of them; but then they
are ſuch means as are uſed in the Life and Power of God.</p>
               <p>Note with what preſumptuous Confidence, <hi>W. P.</hi> dareth to ſay, <hi>they never ſpake
ſuch Language,</hi> when <hi>G. F.</hi> their great Apoſtle, had plainly ſaid, as above-quoted,
<hi>that the things of the Goſpel are not attained by AN external means:</hi> That they have
been all along in the uſe of ſome means, as preaching, writing, and reading, is but
to ſay, their Practice contradicts their Principles, which is very common to them:
But to cover their Error, their way is to miſtate the Queſtion, as <hi>W. P.</hi> doth here,
which is not whether outward means can truly profit, without the inward Aid and
Aſſiſtance of the Spirit; for this is generally granted that they cannot, which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to his Phraſe, that the means then only profit when uſed in the Life and Power
of God: And in very deed, their holding the Light within every Man ſufficient to
Salvation, without any thing elſe, as they do commonly teach, deſtroyeth all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
uſe of outward means; as who ſhould ſay, a Man has that within him, that is
ſufficient to carry him to <hi>America</hi> without any thing elſe, as Boat or Ship, ſhould be


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97123:8"/>
underſtood to ſay, he can walk on the Sea, or flie in the Air to that remote
Place.</p>
               <p>The next thing in reference to their Infallibility, is their Pretence to the infallible
diſcerning of Mens Hearts, without reſpect to their Works, good or bad. This is
differently ſtated by them, and wherein we ſhall find a real Contradiction among
them.</p>
               <p>G. F. <hi>in his Gr. Myſt, pag. 89. had ſaid,</hi> Here thou haſt ſhewed, that the Quakers
have a Spirit given to them, beyond all the Forefathers (which we do witneſs) ſince the
Days of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtacy; and they can diſcern who are Saints, who are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and who are Apoſtates, without ſpeaking ever a VVord, they that be in the Power
and the Life of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This diſcerning of Mens Hearts,</hi> G. VVhitehead <hi>had formerly placed upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Signs in the Countenances of wicked Men or Women, which he ſtill juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in his Antitode. pag.</hi> 69.—Proud and haughty Looks, wanton and ſcornful Eyes, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and fallen Countenances are rendred in Scripture, as outward Signs or Marks of ſuch
wicked Hearts, which alſo the Gift of diſcerning perceiveth, and gives to ſee many times
through ſuch outward mediums.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>G. VV.</hi> here layeth a great Streſs upon outward Signs in the Countenance,
which he owneth to be outward mediums, through which the Spirit of diſcerning
perceiveth, and giveth to ſee Mens Hearts, but yet he will not allow the Scriptures
to be the medium of Faith, ſo preferreth outward Signs in the Countenance to the
Scriptures, but then he much throweth down this ſort of diſcerning by Mens Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
by ſaying <hi>many times,</hi> for this leaveth their diſcerning to be many times
fallible; and though the Scripture, and common Experience proveth, that the
Countenances of ſome, openly vicious, and extreamly wicked, are Signs of their wicked
Hearts, yet the Scripture giveth no univerſal Rule in the Caſe, but giveth us the
Command of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 11. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>John 7. 24. Judge not according to Appearance, but judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judgment;</hi> and it was ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He ſhall not judge after the Sight of</hi> his <hi>Eyes,
nor reprove after the hearing of his Ears.</hi> But <hi>G. VV.</hi> will not take Chriſt in the caſe
for his Example; but he pleads further, <hi>That the Gift of diſcerning of Spirits is given
to ſome Members eſpecially</hi> (and ſtill is continued) <hi>in the true Church,</hi> and from
which diſcerning, Satan cannot be hid, however he transforms himſelf. Here
is another minching of their Infallibility of diſcerning, that <hi>it's given to ſome Members
eſpecially,</hi> but he doth not allow it to all Members; however he ſeems to plead for all
the Miniſters having it,<note place="margin">Truth and Inn. p. 12.</note> for he makes <hi>it an Evidence of great Darkneſs in his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
to hold, that a Miniſter that is fallible is in the Spirit, a Miniſter of Chriſt, and
yet cannot diſcern another Man's State or Condition, ſo as to give an infallible Character
of him:</hi> And he contends ſo earneſtly for this infallible diſcerning in the Church,
that he ſaith, <hi>If there muſt be no diſcerning of Spirits. no infallible or certain Character
to be given of other Men's States or Conditions, by an inward Senſe or diſcerning of Spirits;
then Chriſt's Sheep may follow Strangers, VVolves, Dogs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo be devoured, contrary
to his own Doctrine, and below the Senſe and Inſtinct of the very Sheep, which leads them
to ſhun Dogs and VVolves, when they make at them, whether they bark or howl, or be
mute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, By this manner of <hi>G.VV</hi>'s arguing, not only the Teachers, but all and
every one of the People, if they be Sheep, muſt have this infallible diſcerning,
whereas he pleads for the Miniſters having it, or ſome Members; ſo it ſeems the
People muſt rely on the Miniſters diſcerning <hi>by an implicit Faith,</hi> or if not, be in


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97123:9"/>
danger of periſhing: But in plain Contradiction to this Doctrine of <hi>G.VV.</hi> who
pleads for the infallible diſcerning of Men's Hearts, to every Miniſter; let us hear
<hi>Joſ. VVyeth,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Switch,</hi> p. 95. <hi>But though this holy Spirit can diſcover unto one,
the Heart and Thoughts of another, as of</hi> Ananias <hi>to</hi> Peter, Acts 5. <hi>yet as that is not
uſual, ſo neither is it neceſſary, nor is it that which we pretend to; nor hath</hi> G.F. <hi>in the
fore-quoted Places, pretended to it,</hi> referring to the above-quoted Paſſage, where he
makes this Obſervation, <hi>Switch,</hi> p. 90.—<hi>VVhich does very plainly ſhew, that</hi> G. F.
<hi>did not attribute this Knowledge or Diſcerning to the Quakers or any Man, but to the
Power and Life of Truth, where it is manifeſted.</hi> This Gloſs, as it is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Words, which ſay, <hi>They,</hi> i.e. <hi>the Quakers that be in the Power
and Life of Truth can diſcern;</hi> ſo to the Words of <hi>G. W.</hi> who doth affirm, That
<hi>ſome of the Members eſpecially have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But both <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. VV.</hi> hath carried this diſcerning farther than by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
medium of Men's Looks and Glances, ſo that they can know the inward States
of their Hearers, without looking to their Faces, <hi>yea, though their Backs be toward
them;</hi> and not only what they are at preſent, but what they have been, and ſhall
be from Eternity to Eternity. For Proof of this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. F.</hi> Gr. M. quotes his Opponents,<note place="margin">G. M. p. 229.</note> ſaying, <hi>VVill a diſcerning of the Goſpel Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
prove a Power to diſcern the State and Condition of Souls, what it ſhall be to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
And after ſome Words he anſwers; <hi>And ſo who are come into the Biſhop Christ,
they are one Soul, they know the Hand of God, which the Soul lives in, which is the Power,
and ſo knows it from Eternity to Eternity:</hi> And ſo ye Prieſts which do not diſcern the
Soul and its State, <hi>to Eternity and from Eternity; ye are not in the Myſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
which gives Liberty to it, neither have ye it—And you five Prieſts have ſhamed
your ſelves that do not know the Soul from Eternity to Eternity;</hi> and on this horrid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
that they knew the State of Men's Souls from Eternity to Eternity.
<hi>Rich. Hubberth</hi> paſſes this ſevere Sentence on his Opponent, <hi>Truth's def. pag. 92. Thou
art ordained of old for Condemnation, and for Perdition among the ungodly ones, and art
a Reprobate.</hi> And p. 93. <hi>So here thou art curſed, and caſt out eternally.</hi> Note, this
was only for his asking What is original Sin? And here he ſpeaks of the ſeveral
States of the Soul, as when the Soul is in Death, and when it liveth, and God hath
Pleaſure in it: By which Soul, he muſt needs underſtand the Soul of Man, for of
the Souls of Men his Opponents did ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Next <hi>G. VV.</hi> in his <hi>Truth defending the Quakers,</hi> hath gone as far as <hi>G. F.</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to his Infallibility in knowing Men's Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Queſtion being put to him in</hi> Truth def. <hi>p. 24. qu.</hi> 54. Do not you, <hi>G. W.</hi>
blaſphemouſly take to your ſelf an Attribute of God, while you pretend ordinarily to know
the Hearts of Men. And tell Mr. <hi>Townſend</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in the ſecond Page of your
<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> That the Light of God is departed from his Conſcience. <hi>He anſwers,</hi> I take no
Attribute of God to my ſelf, but what God hath given me, by whoſe Gift I witneſs that
Promiſe fulfilled in me: ye ſhall diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him
that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>This arrogant aſſuming of one of God's Attributes, of knowing Men's Hearts,
being objected againſt him lately, in a printed Sheet, called, <hi>An Account from</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In another late printed Paper, ſigned by ſeven Quakers at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi>
called, <hi>Some Account from</hi> Colcheſter, they expoſtulate the Caſe with them who
made the Objection: <hi>Is it ſuch an Error to believe or witneſs the fulfilling of this plain
Promiſe,</hi> Mal. 3. 18. <hi>How do you then believe in Chriſt, in whom all the Promiſes of


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97123:9"/>
God are yea and amen? Is the contrary good Doctrine for you</hi> (our Acculers) <hi>to hold,
that ye or Chriſtians ſhall not return, nor diſcern between the righteous and the wicked?</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Do you not thereby prove your ſelves blind, and in Vnbelief?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, This in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 18. or any other Place of Scripture proves not that any
Men ſhall <hi>have one of</hi> God<hi>'s Attributes given them to know Men's Hearts;</hi> which is no
where promiſed, but Chriſt hath taught us to know Men by their Works
and Fruits, and not by his giving them one of God's Attributes whereby to know
Men's Hearts; for if they had that, they ſhould be as God himſelf, to know without
regard to the Fruits: But that Place, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 18. ſeems to have a plain <hi>Reference to
the Day of Judgment,</hi> wherein the Works of all Men, however ſecret, ſhall be made
manifeſt, and yet not by Men's having one of God's Attributes given them even
then. And as to <hi>G.VV</hi>'s Argument for the neceſſity of this infallible diſcerning given
to Miniſters, otherwiſe Chriſt's Sheep may follow Strangers and be deſtroyed: This
Conſequence doth not follow; for while they follow the Voice of Chriſt, that is, <hi>his
Doctrine outwardly deLivered in the holy Scriptures, and inwardly ſet home and applied to
their Hearts by the holy Spirit, they are ſafe;</hi> and when they follow not that, but Men
of falſe Pretences, who bring a contrary Doctrine, and yet ſay, they have the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Spirit, as the Followers of <hi>G.VV.</hi> and his Brethren do; they are in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of periſhing, and though the true Sheep of Chriſt ſhall not finally be deceived,
nor finally periſh, yet they at times may be deceived, and have been deceived by
falſe Teachers, and by none more than ſuch falſe Teachers, who falſly pretend to
the Spirit of Chriſt, and yet preach contrary to his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>But that the Quakers did not only pretend to extraordinary Inſpirations of the
Spirit, but to miraculous Operations I ſhall ſhew you out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s G. M. p. 254.
Some of them having asked the Queſtion, <hi>VVhether your Baptizers cast out Devils,
and drink any deadly thing, and it not hurt you? And whether the Houſe where you meet
was ever ſhaken? And where he did give the Holy Ghost to you?</hi> The Opponent calls
this an unlearned Queſtion, to which <hi>G. F.</hi> replies, <hi>This is to ſhew that you are not
Believers, nor in the Power that the Apoſtles was in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, By this it appears they lay claim to the ſame Power of working Miracles
that the Apoſtles had, as to drink any deadly thing, and it not to hurt them, and
that the Houſe where they meet was ſhaken: I have both heard and ſeen, that ſome
of the Quakers Bodies were ſhaken in their Meetings, but I never heard nor ſaw
that the Houſe where they met was ſhaken.</p>
               <p>Note, while I was giving my Proofs out of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> their Books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their high Pretences to an infallible diſcerning Men's Hearts; a Quaker,
called <hi>Samuel Miller,</hi> as I am informed, a Bricklayer, ſtood upon a Bench, and for
a further Confirmation, ſaid with a loud Voice, <hi>George, I had a Viſion concerning thee
twenty Years ago, that though thou didſt preach the Goſpel to others, thou thy ſelf ſhould
be a Caſt-away.</hi> This he gave to corroborate <hi>G. F</hi>'s Pretenſe of his knowing the
State of Men's Souls from Eternity to Eternity: But if his and their bare Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt be received for Truth, without all external Evidence, that I am an
Apoſtate, a Caſt-away, what Man, howſoever innocent, can eſcape their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Cenſure? Another Quaker, called <hi>Thomas Kent,</hi> ſtood up, and would have
preached, telling the Auditory, <hi>He felt a Fire or Flame burn in his Breaſt, he had a
Conſciencious Concern upon him;</hi> but the People forbidding him to preach, he cried
out, <hi>The Quotations were falſe,</hi> but gave not the leaſt Proof: I told them he has

be perfect here or hereafter in Equality, but only in Quality. G. F. <hi>anſwers,</hi> Chriſt
makes no Diſtinction in his Words, but ſaith, Be ye perfect, even as your Heavenly Father
is, and be ye merciful as he is, and as he is ſo are we, and that which is perfect and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,

               <p>G. Whitehead, <hi>in Defence of this Paſſage,</hi> in Truth and In. <hi>p. 14. ſaith,</hi> Now where's
the Blaſphemy pray? Was it not Chriſt's own Doctrine? Be ye perfect even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Father is merciful. Now what Diſtinction doth Chriſt make in theſe Words and Precepts,
as in point of Purity, and where's the Perfection in Quality granted then, and wherein
muſt this Perfection conſiſt?</p>
               <p>Note, It was not Chriſt's Doctrine to be perfect in Equality with God's Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for that were to command them to be God himſelf, and though Chriſt expreſſeth
no Diſtinction, yet it is implied; and whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> pleads for the <hi>Saint's Equality

is not an eſſential Perfection, for what Holineſs and Purity they now have, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

ſometimes after one Man, and ſoon after another, and ſo hold one another in Affection,
and ſo draw out the Affection of one another; and after a while leave one another, and go
one from another, do the ſame thing; theſe doings make more like <hi>Sodom</hi> than Saints,
and is not of God's moving or joining. <hi>And in Number</hi> 10. And Notice be taken of all

whoſe VVork is to ſow Diſſention, are to be reproved and admoniſhed. <hi>And in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>

Friends in By-places, and have cheated ſeveral; all ſuch are to be ſtopped and judged; as
there is a VVoman, tall in her Perſon, freckled in her Face; and alſo one <hi>John Harding,</hi>
who are for Judgment and to be condemned. <hi>And in the Concluſion he ſharply reproves
them of the Quaker's Society,</hi> who ſit nodding in a Meeting, for their Sleeping, and
Sottiſhneſs, and Dullneſs; <hi>and he ſaith,</hi> Therefore be careful and watchful, and let it be

               <p>On this I noted, that theſe and other Faults he chargeth upon many of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
owned to be Quakers, evidently prove their viſible Church and Society are
not ſuch a Church of Chriſt, which he ſaith, is <hi>without Spot or VVrinkle,</hi> as above-quoted;

and that, as a People, they are far from that ſinleſs Perfection they commonly
boaſt of, on which account they are not known, as a People to pray in their publick
Meetings for Pardon of Sin; and yet, where ſuch Faults are, were they ſincere,
they would both confeſs and ask Pardon of God for their Sins. I noted alſo, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Injunction, theſe Orders on Canons of G. F. are duly read in their
quarterly Meetings, both here in <hi>Europe,</hi> and alſo in <hi>America,</hi> whereof I have been
an Eye and Ear Witneſs. But as he hath not in all his Canons enjoined the reading
the holy Scriptures, nor any Part of them in their Meetings; ſo I ſaid, I never
heard any Part of Scripture read in any of their publick Meetings, either for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or Diſcipline; and they caſt great Blame on me, for my reading ſome Texts of
Scripture in our Meetings at Turners-Hall. But let it be further noted, that ſeeing
G. F. and G. <hi>VV.</hi> have ſo ſtrongly affirmed, That the Quakers can give an infallible
Character of Men, to know who are Saints or Devils, without ever ſpeaking a
Word; what need had G. F. in his Canons, to give ſuch a Deſcription of ſome, by
Name and Face, whereby to know them to be Cheats? Surely if they had ſuch an
infallible diſcerning as they pretend, they need not to have ſuch outward Characters
of Deceivers.</p>

and of ſuffering in Temptations and Tryals.</hi> Note, do none of theſe belong to the
Church, who yet have not arrived to a ſinleſs Perfection, but are in that Time of
Travel? But what if they die in that Time of Travel, before a ſinleſs Perfection be
attained? G. <hi>VV.</hi> has paſſed a nibſt ſevere and uncharitable Cenſure on them. <hi>Voice
of VViſdom,</hi> p. 42, 43. <hi>This ſinleſs Perfection</hi> (for that's the true State of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>all muſt come to witneſs who ever come to be ſaved, for there is no unclean thing muſt
enter into Chriſt's Kingdom, therefore People muſt either expect Freedom from Sin in this
Life, or never.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, Thus he has paſſed a moſt uncharitable and cruel Sentence, nor only upon
many who were in a ſincere Travel towards Perfection, and yet have not attained
to a ſinleſs Perfection before their Deceaſe, but alſo upon his deceaſed Brethren, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of whom deceaſed (as I judge he muſt confeſs) while they were in the Travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, for Quakers commonly are not longer lived than other Men, they die at all
Ages, young as well as old, and many die that are but Novices in their Way: And
certainly <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and <hi>E. Burr. Fr. Hougel, Rich. Hubb.</hi> and ſome of their greateſt
Saints lived in great Ignorance, Error, and Unbelief, in divers great Fundamentals
of the Chriſtian Faith, and in great Uncharitableneſs towards ſuch as differed from
them, and remained in theſe Sins to their dying Day; ſhall we therefore be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
to them, as <hi>G. W</hi>s Doctrine is, to conclude <hi>they are all damned, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
eternally?</hi> God forbid, we will be more charitable to them than his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
alloweth.</p>
               <p>But then again, in Contradiction, not only to G. F. but, himſelf, he pleads in his
<hi>Voice of Wiſdom, That the Believers Works are perfect, and God hath wrought all their
VVorks in them,</hi> citing <hi>Iſa. 26. 12. So theſe VVorks of God, which true Believers witneſs,
are perfect, and the Believers have ceaſed from their own VVorks, which were imperfect,
and are come into God's VVorks which are perfect.</hi> But then what ſaith he concerning
them who are in the Travel towards Perfection? Are not they Believers; Have
they no Faith? Thus their Confuſion is evident.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97123:11"/>
They do not conſider, that though the Work of Faith, Labour of Love, and
Patience of Hope in Believers are the Works of God, yet they are alſo the Works of
thoſe Men, in whom they are wrought; it's they who believe, who love and hope
by God's Operation or working in them, and therefore they being imperfect, though
God is a perfect Being and Agent, their Faith, Love and Hope are imperfect, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Property of all Effects to be according to the weaker and more imperfect
Cauſes, according to that true Maxim, <hi>Bonum ex integra cauſa, malum ex quolibet
defectu,</hi> a perfect Effect muſt have all its Cauſes perfect.</p>
               <p>But whatever Charity we may ſuppoſe they may have for their deceaſed Brethren,
they have little or none for any ſuch who do not believe to the Hight of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of a ſinleſs Perfection before Death; their Doctrine obligeth them to judge,
that none of other Societies are ſaved, becauſe they do not believe the Quakers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Perfection before they die, the contrary of which, they call <hi>the Doctrine of
Devils,</hi> the which, if any die, and do not renounce before their Deceaſe, by the
Quakers Principle, they cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But ſome of them now begin to go into the ſame Road with others of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and after a large Circumference, wherein they have far departed from
them who ſay, <hi>That the Souls of Believers are at the inſtant of Death made perfect in
Holineſs;</hi> yet return and ſay the ſame thing concerning their imperfect Brethren who
are deceaſed, and yet before their Deceaſe, arrived not to a ſinleſs Perfection;
which, if it may be allowed to imperfect Quakers, may be as well allowed to
others, ſineere Travellers towards Perfection, many of whom, no doubt, have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to greater Perfection before their Deceaſe, than any among the Quakers Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
of whoſe Perfection they ſo much boaſt, who lived in great Error and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in the great Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and Uncharitableneſs towards
others, and of whoſe Repentance for the ſame we never heard any Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> G. F. <hi>in his G. M. p. 251. in Defence of his and his Brethrens ſinleſs Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thus anſwers to that in</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 20. There is not a juſt Man upon the Earth which
doth good and ſinneth not. This juſt, this wiſe Man upon the Earth, which doth good and
ſinneth not, that was the Eſtate of the Law, which Chriſt is the End of, who is a greater
than <hi>Solomon,</hi> who is the juſt, and Righteouſneſs it ſelf, and makes Men free from Sin.</p>
               <p>Note, that G. F. in Contradiction to his own Gloſs, in the ſame Page, to prove
a ſinleſs Perfection, brings the Examples of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> both which were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt came; and to prove <hi>David</hi>'s ſinleſs Perfection, he brings <hi>David</hi>'s Words;
and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had ſeen the End of all Perfection.</hi> Is not this a rare Proof for a
ſinleſs Perfection? But if G. F. did not mean Chriſt without, but Chriſt within, to
be the End of the Law: As this is a falſe Gloſs on <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, ſo that imports,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> was not come to the Light within him, which G. F. calls Chriſt within;
but how then could <hi>Solomon</hi> pen ſuch Books of the Scripture, which the Quakers
confeſs to have been writ by Divine Inſpiration, if <hi>Solomon</hi> had not come to the
Light within him?</p>
               <p>But let us hear another as nonſenſical Gloſs of G. <hi>VV.</hi> on the ſame Place, <hi>Voice of
VViſd.</hi> p. 18. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 20. Anſ. <hi>The Converſation of the Saints is in Heaven,</hi> Eph. 2. 6.
Philip. 3. 20. <hi>And they are redeemed from the Earth and from the Vanity, where</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>ſaw all things in the Days of his Vanity, in which all were Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, Is this any Proof, that the Saints, ſuch as <hi>Paul,</hi> who writ theſe Words,
were not real Men upon Earth? And is not G. W. a Man upon Earth ſo long as he
eats, drinks, ſleeps, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Thus we ſee how they pervert the Scriptures to prove


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97123:12"/>
their ſinleſs Perfection; for if G. W. will own he is one of theſe juſt Men on Earth,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> writes of, he muſt confeſs himſelf to be a Sinner, if he will not own
himſelf to be a juſt Man upon the Earth, yet he muſt allow his Body to be upon
Earth, unleſs he will ſay, our Sight deceives us when we ſee him in the Streets,
and then either his Body is no Part of him, or if it be, it hath Sin, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he alſo hath Sin, if he will own his Body to be a Part of him.</p>
               <p>But let us yet again hear another nonſenſical Gloſs of G. F. to maintain his and his
Brethrens ſinleſs Perfection on the Words of <hi>James, In many things we offend all,</hi>
G. M. p 309. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſaith G. F. <hi>In the many things we offend all, but we are come to the
one thing, Christ Jeſus, the End of the many things, and in him there is no Sin, and who
is in him ſins not, who put an End to the many things that must end and change.</hi> Thus
we ſee his and his Brethrens Preſumption, who plainly declare they were got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>James,</hi> and all the Faithful to whom he wrote thoſe Words; and he chargeth
both <hi>James</hi> and all the Faithful, to whom he wrote all theſe Words, with a horrid
Falſhood, that they were not come to the one thing, to wit, to Jeſus Chriſt: And if
none are come to Chriſt or in Chriſt, but who are perfect with a ſinleſs Perfection,
as G. W. doth here argue, then young Believers and Converts, who are travelling
towards Perfection, are not in Chriſt, nor come to Chriſt, becauſe they have not
that ſinleſs Perfection, which is both a moſt falſe and moſt comfortleſs Doctrine,
and injurious to all young Chriſtian Converts at leaſt, and may be thought, by
young Quaker Converts, injurious to them alſo.</p>
               <p>Note, while the Proofs were reading out of the Quakers Books for their ſinleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
a Quaker (ſuppoſed to be <hi>John Whiting</hi>) ſaid, George, <hi>if Men are not
perfect before Death, when are they made perfect? It must be either before Death or after
Death.</hi> I anſwered, In the inſtant of Death, and that is neither before Death nor
after Death; as if one ſhould ask, when did <hi>Peter</hi> and other deceaſed Saints put off the
earthly Tabernacle, whether before Death or after Death? The Anſwer is, neither
before nor after, but at the Inſtant of Death.</p>
               <p>But let us hear yet ſomewhat more of G. F's great Conceit of his and his Brethrens
Perfection, even in Equality with God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Abrief Diſcovery of the Threefold State of Antichriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>G. W</hi>'s. brief Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, p. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>printed 1653. he being charged
with ſaying,</hi> That he was as upright as Chriſt; <hi>he anſwers,</hi> theſe Words were not ſpoken
by me, but that, as he is, ſo are we in this World, that the Saints are made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God, that the Saints are one in the Father and the Son, that we ſhall be like him,
and that all teaching which is given forth by Jeſus Chriſt, is to bring up the Hearers to
Perfection, even to the Meaſure, Stature, and Fullneſs of Chriſt, this the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth,
and I witneſs fulfilled in me.</p>
               <p>Note, this is more than what is in <hi>Saul's Errand</hi> above-quoted, for there the
Words of Scripture are kept to, that mention the Meaſure of the Stature of the Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but here it's far beyond what is written in Scripture, that he was come, not
only to the Meaſure, but <hi>to the Stature and Fullneſs of Chriſt,</hi> and what is this but to
be equal with Chriſt and God? Saul's Errand, p. 13. G. F. <hi>He that is perfectly holy,
is perfectly juſt; where this is revealed, there needs no Addition, for the Man of God is
perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will yet more fully appear by the following Quotations.</p>

               <p>Again, in his G. <hi>Myſtery,</hi> p. 248. he quotes, (but very lamely and corruptly).
<hi>C. Wade,</hi> in his Book Quakery Slain, <hi>He denies the Son of God to be revealed in Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
only by Adoption, and cries againſt Equality with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here before I give you G. F's Anſwer, I ſhall give you <hi>C. Wade</hi>'s Words, as they
ſtand in his Book, to which he anſwers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C. Wade</hi>'s Words in his <hi>Quakery ſlain,</hi> are theſe, p. 23. <hi>G. Fox,</hi> in the 8. pag. of
<hi>Saul's Errand,</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That he that hath the ſame Spirit that raiſed up Jeſus Christ,
is equal with God, and the Saints have the ſame Spirit in Meaſure, for God's Spirit is but
one.</hi> And G. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, in pag. 11. <hi>That he is a Saint.</hi> 
                  <q>Thus he would again
prove, That he, a poor wicked Creature, is equal with God the Creator, and if
ſo, then G. <hi>Fox</hi> is the Creator of G. <hi>Fox,</hi> and the whole World; and he intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
claimeth Chriſt's Equality with God, by his perverted citing of <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</q>
Now in Oppoſition to <hi>G. F</hi>'s affirming, <hi>He was equal with God, C. Wade,</hi> in his
pag 24. ſaith. <q>The Scripture ſaith, that even the Saints themſelves are not God's
Sons otherwiſe but by Adoption only by Chriſt (note that you Quakers) not as
being Chriſt, as you fooliſhly fancy but by Chriſt, for it's written, <hi>Having predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1. 5. See this confirmed,
<hi>Gal. 4. 5. Rom.</hi> 8. 23. and Creature adopted Sons cannot be equal with their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
uncreated Father, who vouchſafeth by free Grace, by and in his Son Chriſt,
to adopt them to be his Sons in Acceptation only: Neither can any Creature adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sons, be equal with God's only begotten Son, the Creator of all adopted Sons,
and all other things, both in Heaven and in Earth alſo.</q> This is the true and full
Quotation out of <hi>C. Wade</hi> his <hi>Quakery ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Oppoſition to which ſound Doctrine of <hi>C. Wade, G. Fox</hi> thus anſwers.<note place="margin">G. M. p. 248.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And that is contrary to the Apoſtle, who had the Son of God revealed in him,
and the Aſſembly of Divines gave forth a Catechiſm, which, Children, old and young,
was to learn, and ſaid. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt and Son was equal in Subſtance and Power
and Glory with the Father:</hi> What? Then all that have the Son and the Holy Ghoſt,
hath that which is equal in Power and Glory with the Father. <hi>In this thou haſt not only
judged thy ſelf, but all the Aſſembly of Divines at</hi> Weſtminſter, 1649.</p>
               <p>Note, G. <hi>Fox</hi> here doth not quote the Page of <hi>C. Wade</hi>'s Book, as frequently he
doth not throughout his G. Myſt, give his Opponents Pages of their Books, which it
ſeems was in Deſign, that his unfair Quotations might not be ſo eaſily found out.
Now obſerve, whereas G. F. brings <hi>C. Wade, crying againſt Equality with the Father,</hi>
we ſee by the Quotation given, what Equality with the Father <hi>C. VVade</hi> cries
againſt, to wit, not the Equality of Chriſt, the only begotten of God, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that he expreſly affirms by ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt, God's only begotten Son, is
the Creator of all things;</hi> but the Equality that <hi>C. Wade</hi> cryed againſt, was the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of</hi> G. Fox, and <hi>Creature adopted Sons with the Father,</hi> and for his ſo ſaying,
G. Fox makes him to have contradicted the Apoſtle, and alſo the Aſſembly of Divines
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and judged both himſelf and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97123:13"/>
This I think ſo evident a Proof, that G. F. thought himſelf equal with the Father,
that neither G. W. nor <hi>Joſ. Wyeth,</hi> nor any of their Brethren, with all their little
Craft and Sophiſtry, can clear this Paſſage from that down-right Blaſphemy, That
G. F. was equal with God, for neither the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> nor
C. W. deny the Equality of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, for G. <hi>Fox</hi> grants they
owned it; but the Equality which C. <hi>Wade</hi> cryed againſt, was the Equality of
G. F. or any of the Saints with the Father. But here we find the Strength of
G. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Logick, The Son and Holy Ghoſt are equal with the Father, therefore
G. F. is equal with the Father, the Proof of which Conſequence muſt be one of
theſe two following Aſſertions; the one is, That G. <hi>Fox</hi> thought himſelf to be the
Son of God, or ſuch a Son as was equal with the Father; the other is, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Son of God was revealed in G. <hi>Fox</hi> (as he thought) that therefore G. <hi>Fox</hi>
was equal with the Father. As to the firſt of theſe Aſſertions, as it is utterly falſe,
that G. <hi>Fox</hi> was the Son of God, to wit, the only begotten Son of God, the Word
made Fleſh, ſo the other is utterly a falſe Conſequence, that becauſe the Son of God
was revealed in him, that therefore he was equal with the Father; but ſurely, if the
Son of God had been revealed in him, that Revelation would have taught him not
to utter ſuch horrid Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>But that C. <hi>Wade</hi> did not deny, but own as much as the Scripture warranteth,
That God the Father, as alſo Chriſt the Son, were manifeſted or revealed in the
Saints: I ſhall quote a Paſſage in his Book, being originally the Words of one
<hi>T. Moor,</hi> that wrote againſt the Quakers, whom <hi>J. Nailer</hi> had charged, <hi>That he
would exclude God and Chriſt out of the World, and that he ſhould no more dwell in his
People till Doomſday:</hi> In Oppoſition to which C. <hi>Wade</hi> quotes the following ſaying
of <hi>T. Moor,</hi> which he approves, pag. 23. of <hi>Quakery ſlain, That the Majeſty of God,
whoſe Throne is in Heaven, is in his Inſpections, Influences, and Operation every where;
and in his gracious and ſpiritual Preſence, and manifeſted Nighneſs in and through his
Son, dwelling in</hi> Sion, <hi>even in the Hearts and Societies of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us hear what <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi> and G. <hi>Whitehead</hi> ſay in Defence of that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Paſſage above-mentioned, quoted from <hi>Saul</hi>'s Errand to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> p. 8.
<hi>He that hath the ſame Spirit that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, is equal with God.
Joſ. Wyeth</hi> doth plainly juſtifie it by the like falſe Conſequence as G. <hi>Fox</hi> made;<note place="margin">Switch, pag. 59.</note> he
ſaith, <hi>For when Men are guided by the Holy Spirit, they are certainly guided by God, for
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are one God, and therefore equal, and that which is
equal, as</hi> G. Fox (he ſaith) <hi>often expreſſeth it.</hi> But doth it therefore follow, that
becauſe the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are equal, that therefore he that
hath either the Son or the Holy Ghoſt, is equal, either with the Son, or Holy Ghoſt,
or with the Father? yet this is <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi>'s blaſphemous Conſequence, to juſtifie
G. F's Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>But G. W. hath found two other Ways to defend the above-ſaid Blaſphemy of
G. F. in the <hi>Supplement to the Switch,</hi> he ſaith, p. 528. <hi>And if any among us have
writ of them who are perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, being led by his Spirrt, as in that Senſe equal.
I underſtand equal only as like unto God, or in Vnion with him, being united unto him
by his Spirit, as he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note firſt, The Word <hi>Equal,</hi> no where that I know, either in Scripture, or other
Books, or common Speech in any Language, ſignifieth only <hi>as like,</hi> therefore this is
a meer Force put upon the Word, and a ſtrained Senſe: But Secondly, That could
not be the Senſe intended by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> becauſe, as I have above ſhewed in a former


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97123:13"/>
Quotation, he proves that he is equal with God the Father, becauſe the Son and
Holy Ghoſt are equal with the Father. Now will G. W. ſay, That the Equality
betwixt the Son and the Holy Ghoſt and the Father, is only an Equality of Likeneſs,
as to ſay, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are only like the Father, but are not really
equal with the Father: This was the Arian Hereſie, that the Son was like the
Father, but not equal or of the ſame Subſtance with the Father; they ſaid he was
<hi>Homoiuſios,</hi> but not <hi>Homouiſios.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he hath yet another String to his Bow, in his Truth and Innocency, pag. 10.
<hi>Therefore the Words</hi> [He that hath] <hi>in the ſaid Inſtance, ſhould be left out, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to</hi> G. F<hi>'s and our Principle, and to his own very Words and Confeſſion a little before
in the ſame Book, quoting</hi> Saul's Errand, p. 5, 6. where G. F. ſaith, <hi>It was not ſo
ſpoken, as</hi> G. Fox <hi>was equal with God, but the Father and the Son is one.</hi> But the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
lyeth here, he did not ſay, <hi>George Fox,</hi> to wit, the Name <hi>George Fox,</hi> or the
outward viſible Body that bears that Carnal Name, as he ſomewhere calls it, but
the new Name that he hath, that is the <hi>He</hi> that is equal with God, becauſe that
<hi>He</hi> is the Son, and as to what <hi>G. W.</hi> ſaith of Union with God, that <hi>G. F.</hi> did not
mean Union by Faith and Love, but a perſonal Union, appears from G. M. p. 100.
He brings in his Opponent ſaying, <hi>God dwells not in the Saints as a</hi> Perſonal Union.
In Oppoſition to which he anſwers, <hi>How comes the Saints then to eat of his Fleſh, and
to be of his Fleſh and Bone:</hi> Note, it ſhould be by a perſonal Union? <hi>And God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in them, and have Vnity with the Son and the Father, and to be of his Body which
is the Church, and Christ the Head:</hi> Yea, he blames his Opponent, G. M. p. 258.
for ſaying, <hi>To ſay that God is ſubſtantially in Man, as eſſentially one with him, can be no
other but the Man of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that hath</hi> ſhould be left out; pray who put them in?
That they were <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Words, the Book called <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand,</hi> affirms, if this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
be allowed to tranſpoſe, leave out, and add Words in a Sentence, nothing ſo
vile and blaſphemous or atheiſtical, but may be juſtified by <hi>G. W.</hi> who hath uſed
all theſe three Methods to defend his and his Brethrens vile Errors.</p>
               <p>But let us hear one Paſſage more of G. F. out of G. Myſt. p. 299. to let us know
what Conceit he had of himſelf as being more than a Creature; he tells, <hi>That one

the End. This Man having ſo charged him, and having told him he had Witneſs to

himſelf, and Chriſt in the Male and in the Female, if he ſpeak he was Chriſt the Seed,
and the Seed was Chriſt, but he did not ſpeak it as a Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, he grants he ſpoke the Words, <hi>That he was Chriſt,</hi> but he did not ſpeak it
as a Creature, therefore he thought he was ſomething more than a Creature, the
Seed in him ſpoke it, which was Chriſt, and that was not a Creature, but what
Seed was in him, or in other Quakers, that was not a Creature; I cannot find out
any other in his Writings, but his Soul or inviſible Part that he makes to be Chriſt
and a Part of God, as will afterwards appear on a diſtinct Head.</p>
               <p>But he has yet another Defence to ſave the like blaſphemous Saying of F. <hi>Howgel,
They that have the Spirit of God are equal with God in Nature, but not in Stature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It having been objected againſt the Quakers, that ſome of them have ſaid, <hi>They
that have the Spirit of God are equal with God:</hi> To this F. <hi>Howgel</hi> anſwers, after
ſome foregoing Words,<note place="margin">F. Howgel's Col. p. 232.</note> 
                  <hi>He that is born from above is the Son of God, and he ſaid,</hi> I
and my Father are one; <hi>and where the Son is revealed and ſpeaks, the Father ſpeaks in


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97123:14"/>
him; and dwells in him, and he in thy Father; there is Equality in Nature though not in
Stature.</hi> Here it is a plain Caſe that F. <hi>H.</hi> places this Equality in Nature but not
in Stature, betwixt him that has the Spirit of God, who is born from above, and
God himſelf; for to place it betwixt Chriſt, as he was the Son of God before all
Ages, and God the Father, were to ſay, That the Son is equal with the Father in
Nature but not in Stature, which has a twofold Error in it; firſt, To make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
betwixt God's Nature and Stature. Secondly, Suppoſe that Diſtinction,
That the Son is equal to the Father in Nature but not in Stature, both which are
moſt groſs and blaſphemous, and no leſs groſs and blaſphemous it is to affirm, That
the Saints are equal with God in Nature but not in Stature.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi>'s Defence, Truth and Inn. p. 10. <hi>The Equality in
Nature</hi> (objected) relates to the Divine Nature which the Child of God partakes
of in Meaſure, <hi>though not in Stature,</hi> relates to the Child, that Divine Nature is one
and unchangeable, but our participating of it, and Growth in it is gradual, until
all (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt's whole Church and Body) come into the Meaſure of the Stature of
the Fullneſs of Chriſt. But doth all this Saying of G. <hi>VV.</hi> prove that the Children of
God are equal with God, either in Nature or Stature? The Saints are ſaid in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to be Partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, are they therefore equal to the Holy
Ghoſt? Which yet is the Way of G. <hi>VV</hi>'s reaſoning; the Equality in Nature he
ſays, relates to the Divine Nature, but who is it that is equal to God in the Divine
Nature, but not in Stature? was it the Son or Holy Choſt that is equal to God
in the Divine Nature but not in Stature? Nay, therefore it muſt be the Saints or
Believers; here a Propoſition is framed, <hi>They that have the Spirit of God are equal
with God;</hi> and then this Diſtinction is given; They are equal in <hi>Nature,</hi> but not in
<hi>Stature:</hi> This Propoſition hath for its Subject <hi>They,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Saints</hi> or <hi>Children of
God.</hi> In all Propoſitions, all the Parts of the Predicate belong to one and the ſame
Subject, the which Parts are equal in Nature but not in Stature: But it is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Liberty that G. <hi>VV.</hi> takes in his Way of defending theſe Blaſphemies, not
only to change the Signification of Words from all common Uſe, but the unalterable
Rules of right Reaſon, as in the preſent Caſe; like as if one ſhould ſay, G. <hi>VVhite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
is equal to A. B. in Nature but not in Stature; Nature relates to G. W. but
not in Stature relates to another; but who is this other who can tell? Or as if one
ſhould ſay G. W. is a Man, but not honeſt, <hi>Man</hi> relates to G. <hi>Whitehead,</hi> but <hi>not
honeſt</hi> relates to another. It is a real Shame that ſuch pittiful Sophiſtry ſhould be
uſed by G. W. to defend his and his Brethrens vile Errors and Blaſphemies, whereby
he makes himſelf guilty of them, and all to ſave his and their pretended Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
It were much more Manly, as well as Chriſtian, fairly to acknowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
thoſe moſt erronious Paſſages, and own their Fallibility and Error, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be lifted among fallible Men, for <hi>humanum est errare, labi, decipi;</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo, but to be greatly humbled for the Preſumption, that being Men, they ſhould
equal themſelves to God.</p>
               <p>But the general Conceit of their ſinleſs Perfection, as they are a Body of People,
is ſuch, that both <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi> doth juſtifie <hi>W. P</hi>'s objecting to the Church

Note, Is not this a plain Evidence of the great Pride that is among the Quakers
concerning their ſinleſs Perfection; As a Body of People, and their great Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs
towards, not only the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but all others called Chriſtians
throughout the whole World; yea, all Chriſtians in all Ages, and the univerſal
Church of God, both under the old and new Teſtament, who always uſed Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sin, and prayed for Forgiveneſs of Sin? find as Chriſt taught his Diſciples to
pray daily for their daily Bread; ſo to pray daily for Forgiveneſs of Sins: So under
the old Teſtament there were daily Offerings for Sin, and the High Prieſt, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo holy, yet offered both for his own Sins, and the Sins of the People: Doth it
therefore follow that their Confeſſions and Offerings were hypocritical?</p>
               <p>But doth not <hi>G. VV.</hi> know, that as there is a gradual going unto Perfection,
ſo there is a gradual forſaking of Sin, and a putting off the old Man with his Deeds?
Muſt not they who feel themſelves wounded with Sin, ſeek for a Cure? And ſhould
not the diſeaſed come daily to the Phiſician till they be cured? And as to the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Uncharitableneſs, and G. <hi>VV</hi>'s eſpecially, towards all in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
whom he chargeth without Exception, that they are ſtill confeſſing but not forſaking
their Sins. How can he more prove this Charge againſt them than his own Society
or himſelf? Many, both in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other Proteſtants, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with the beſt of the Quakers for Holineſs of Life, and exceed them in many
Virtues, eſpecially in Humility. But do no not they better who confeſs their Sins, and
yet through humane Frailty, find that they relapſe into ſome Sins, than ſuch proud
Phariſees among the Quakers, who neither confeſs nor forſake their Sins? ſuch as
their ſinful Ignorance and Errors in the great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith,
their too high Eſteem of themſelves, and Uncharitableneſs towards others, calling
all others but themſelves, The World and Idolaters, and their Worſhip Idolatry:
And if any, formerly among them, come to a more ſober Mind, and to a more
ſound Underſtanding and Faith in Chriſtian Doctrine, and are more charitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others: They call them Apoſtates, as they do call me and others, whom God
in his great Mercy has of late recovered from the Errors and Uncharitableneſs that
were and are among them; ſo that for owning the Proteſtant Churches, and that
we can join in the Worſhip of God with them, we are rendred Apoſtates by G. <hi>VV<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and his Brethren in their printed Pamphlets againſt us: But if we be Apoſtates for
this, then by G. <hi>VV</hi>'s and his Brethrens Sentence, all the Proteſtant Churches are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
and Idolaters.</p>
               <p>But if the Church of the Quakers be a ſinleſs Church, that need not to confeſs
their Sins, nor pray for Forgiveneſs of their Sins, how doth this agree with the large.
Acknowledgments that G. <hi>VV.</hi> has made in his <hi>Chriſtian Epiſtle to the People called
Quakers,</hi> of ſo many things amiſs among them, as above quoted? Either ſuch faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Perſons are owned Members of their Church, or they are not; if they are not,
why do not they diſown them, and excommunicate them, or declare them to be
none of them.</p>
               <p>If they own them to be of their Church, then their Church is not without Sp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>They, i. e.</hi> the Quakers, <hi>are the ten thouſand of his Saints in whom the Lord is
come to execute Judgment upon all.</hi> Why do they not begin at home, and firſt cleanſe
their own Houſe, and purge out the old Leaven from among them? How is it that
diverſe unclean Perſons, even of their Miniſtry, have been owned to preach among
them while living in ſecret Uncleanneſs, diverſe of whoſe Names they know I can
produce? Why did they not diſcern them, ſeeing they have (as they pretend) an
infallible diſcerning of Mens Hearts? Or if they did diſcern them, why did they not
diſcover them, and get them caſt out of the Camp?</p>
               <p>As to the Inſtance above given of the daily Sacrifices for Sin, which were offered
under the Law: If it be replyed, That they grant the Law made nothing perfect,
but now a ſinleſs Perfection is brought in by the Goſpel. I ask them what became
of them all of that ancient Church (who daily confeſſed their Sins, and prayed for
Forgiveneſs) when they died? Did they die in their Sins! Or where were they
cleanſed from their Sins after Death? Or did they all periſh, according to <hi>G. W</hi>'s
manner of reaſoning againſt his Opponents in his <hi>Voice of Wiſdom</hi> above quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>As to that Place in Scripture, <hi>The Law made nothing perfect;</hi> and other the like
Places; they are to be underſtood, firſt, Comparatively, the Goſpel State under
the New Teſtament, as to the general, is a State of more Purity and greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
than the State of the People under the Law. Secondly, The ceremonial
Part of the Law, as Circumciſion and the Sacrifices, did neither in whole, nor in
part, give them the Remiſſion of their Sins, but were Types of Chriſt, that alone
Sacrifice, by which Remiſſion of Sin and Sanctification both then was and now is
obtained.</p>
               <p>It is on the Conceit that the Quakers have of their ſinleſs Perfection, eſpecially
their Miniſters, that they are not known to pray for the Forgiveneſs of their Sins, in
their publick Meetings, which gave occaſion to that Queſtion in <hi>Truth defending the
Quak.</hi> by <hi>G. VV.</hi> p. 8. Q. 11. <hi>Do not you think it needleſs to pray for the Pardon of your Sins?</hi>
To this <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> replies, <hi>We have prayed for the Pardon of our Sins, and the Lord,
who heard our Prayers, hath pardoned and remitted our Sins, by the Power of the World to
come, which we have taſted, and do taſte of, as many witneſs.</hi> But of late ſome of
them have got a way to pray in the third Perſon plural in their Meetings, as I have
obſerved; as thus, <hi>If any here have ſinned againſt thee, give them Repentance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs:</hi>
Or thus, <hi>Pardon them that have ſinned againſt thee:</hi> Thus I have heard
<hi>John Field</hi> pray, but I never heard him, or any here in <hi>England,</hi> to the beſt of my.
Remembrance, pray in the firſt Perſon plural, <hi>Forgive us our Sins;</hi> though <hi>Daniel,</hi>
and the beſt of the holy Men recorded in Scripture, prayed, <hi>Forgive us our Sins.</hi> A
Quaker ſaid, <hi>George, dost not thou know, that it is the manner of Friends, if any have
done amiſs, to deal with them, and get them to confeſs and ask Forgiveneſs:</hi> I ſaid, that
was but as to particular Perſons, and private Offences; but that was no Proof as to
their general Confeſſion and praying for Pardon of Sin. Another Quaker ſtood on
a Bench, and began to read a Paſſage out of a Book of mine, called, <hi>The Way caſt
up,</hi> printed in the Year 1677, containing ſome Words of Prayer, which I ſaid I had
heard, or Words to that effect, uſed in our Meetings, both to God the Father, in
the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo to Jeſus Chriſt, naming him by the Name Son
of <hi>David.</hi> This Paſſage that Quaker brought (his Name, as I am informed, is
<hi>John Whiting</hi>) to prove, that the Quakers prayed for Forgiveneſs of Sin, for I was
then a Quaker, but what he read out of my Book not being well heard, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97123:15"/>
to hand the Book to the Miniſter that ſtood by me, and read the Quotations;
which was done, and the whole Paſſage, containing a Prayer, was read, which
is this; <hi>VVay caſt up,</hi> p, 121. <hi>Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy on us. O thou bleſſed Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
that wert crucified and died for our Sins, and ſhed thy precious Blood for us; be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unto us. Thou that in the Days of thy Fleſh, wert tempted of Satan, afflicted, bore our
Sins on the Croſs, felt our Infirmities, and wert touched with them. O thou our merciful
High Priest, whoſe tender Bowls of Compaſſion, are not more ſtraitned, ſince thy Aſcenſion,
but rather more enlarged, and whoſe Love and Kindneſs is the ſame towards thy Servants
in our Days, as it was of old, help us and ſtrengthen us, and by the Power of thy divine
Life and Spirit; raiſe us up over all Tentations, and indue us with a Meaſure of the ſame
Patience and Reſignation that dwelt ſo fully in thee, and which thou didst ſo abundantly
manifest in all thy Sufferings in the Days of thy Fleſh. Thou art the ſame that thou wert,
thy Heart is the ſame towards thy Servants, as when thou wert outwardly preſent with
them in the Fleſh. Thou art our Advocate and Mediator in Heaven with the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Our merciful High Priest, who is not untouched with the feeling of our Infirmities. Thou,
even thou, bleſſed Jeſus, thou knowest our moſt ſecret Deſires and Breathings, which we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up unto thee, in the Enablings of the bleſſed Life and Spirit, that thou mayeſt preſent
them unto thy Father and our Father, that in thee we may be accepted, and our Services
alſo; and for thy ſake our Defects and ſhort Comings, our Sins and Tranſgreſſions that we
have committed, may be forgiven us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prayer being read, divers Miniſters and others ſaid it was a good Prayer, but
they never heard that any ſuch Prayer was uſed in any of the Quakers Meetings:
A Quaker, called <hi>Daniel Philips,</hi> ſtanding by near where I ſtood, ſaid that Book
was approved by the ſecond Days Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> which was a great Untruth:
I told how I wrote that Book in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from <hi>Scotland</hi> ſent it to a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in <hi>Holland,</hi> who printed it there; and when it came over to <hi>London,</hi> in the
Year 1678. it met with great Oppoſition from divers of the Preachers of the Quakers
at <hi>London</hi> [as <hi>Stephen Criſp, William Shewen, William Mede,</hi> and, <hi>Samuel Newton</hi>]
and one of the chief things they blamed in my Book, was this very Prayer, and
eſpecially that Part of it, <hi>Jeſus Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy on us:</hi> Some of them ſaid it
was half Popery; for though <hi>G. K.</hi> would not pray to <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Jeſus, as
the Papiſts do, yet he was for praying to the Son of <hi>Mary:</hi> Others ſaid it was
Common Prayer: A larger Account of things relating to the Oppoſition I met with
from the Quakers for that Prayer, and ſome other things in that Book, ye will find
in the late Book called <hi>A Defence of the Snake,</hi> in that called <hi>A Collection,</hi> from p. 16.
to 38. I further ſhewed, that what I had delivered in that Book, and others of my
Books in former times when I was reckoned in Unity with the Quakers, did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evidence that I held the Faith of the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity with all true
Chriſtians, though in ſome leſſer Matters I was biaſſed and miſled by them into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Errors, particularly in rejecting the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Supper;
which I have ſince retracted; and for my holding the fundamental Doctrines of
the Chriſtian Faith, as appears by that Book, and other Books of mine. All the
Time of my Quakeriſm, a Quaker in <hi>Ponſylvania,</hi> who was a Juſtice of Peace [his
Name was <hi>Arthur Cook</hi>] ſaid unto me, <hi>George, thou never was a right Quaker all thy
Days? but an old rotten Presbyterian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reading of that Paſſage in my Book, containing the Prayer aforeſaid, which
the Quaker brought to make againſt me, had a far contrary Effect to what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
for many (ſome Miniſters; and others) preſent ſaid, <hi>This makes for</hi> G. K.

                  <hi>not againſt him; let the Quakers bring any ſuch Paſſage out of their Books, to prove they
were of that Faith with him.</hi> Some of the Quakers that objected againſt that Prayer
in my Book, asked me, in one of the Meetings that were appointed to hear the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt my Book, and my Anſwers, <hi>Where did I ever hear any</hi> Engliſh <hi>Friend
of the Miniſtry pray after that manner? Poſſibly,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>ſome</hi> Scots <hi>Friends, who
were thy Proſelytes, thou haſt heard to pray ſo:</hi> I confeſs they gueſſed right, they were
ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Friends whom I had heard to pray ſo, and ſo I had prayed; and being
at a ſtand to inſtance any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friend that I had heard ſo pray, <hi>W. Penn</hi> told
them, he had ſo prayed, and that not long ago, but he ſaid, <hi>It was in private:
G. W.</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let the Scripture decide it;</hi> whereupon he calls for the Bible, and reads
in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2. What ſay ye to this Friends,</hi> ſaid <hi>G. W?</hi> Ye ſee that <hi>Paul</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that called upon the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Their
Anſwer was, <hi>Paul was dark and ignorant in that thing, as</hi> G. K. <hi>is, for our Parts we
know better.</hi> Here note the Fallacy both of <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> who for all this ſeemingly
owning Faith in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, by confeſſing they were to pray to him, yet
in their printed Books have oppoſed that Faith without any Retractation.</p>

                  <p>Note, This Controverſie betwixt all true Proteſtants and the Quakers, whether the
Scriptures are the Word of God (which the Quakers have formerly moſt earneſtly
denyed, and fiercely diſputed againſt, though ſome now begin to acknowledge it,
and yet they are ſtill the ſame infallible Men) is not a meer Strife of Words, but a
moſt material and important Controverſie, for when many Places of Scripture are
brought to prove that God's Spirit doth inwardly teach us, by means of the Word, and
that Faith comes by the Word of God outwardly heard or read, that we are born of
the Word, and ſanctified by it, and all ſpiritual Effects that are attributed in Scripture
to God, Chriſt, and the Spirit, as the principal Agent, and to the Word as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
they will not allow of any inſtrumental external Word, but makes the
Word to be the Spirit, to be Chriſt and God, which is in effect to render them of no
uſe to us at all ſeeing by denying them to be the Word they deny them alſo to be the
external Means or Medium, whereby the Spirit teaceth us by his inward Operation
in our Hearts, and works any ſaving Knowledge and Faith in us, and this alſo
they have denyed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures are the Means or Medium.</p>
                  <p>But that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and the Word moſt frequently ſo
called in Scripture, is clear from abundant Places; to wit, the external Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97123:16"/>
in the Scriptures. <hi>Our Goſpel came unto you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
1 <hi>Theſſ. 1. 5. not in Word only;</hi> by <hi>Word</hi> here is meant Doctrine, <hi>Iſaiah 28. 13. The

                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Timothy</hi> preach the Word, it cannot be juſtly thought that he
would have him only preach the inward Word, or the eſſential Word or Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
but by the Word he meant the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel. The Quakers
but trifle when they argue the Scriptures are Words, and it is a Lye to call Words
the Word, which is not a Lye, but a common Speech uſed by themſelves, who call
an Epiſtle a Letter, that yet contains many Letters: And they do no leſs trifle when
they argue, to ſay the Scripture is the Word, is to ſay the Scripture is Chriſt, as if
the Name <hi>Word</hi> did only belong to Chriſt, whereas the Name <hi>Word,</hi> as well as the
Name <hi>Light,</hi> is given both to Chriſt and other things: Chriſt ſaid to the Diſciples,
<hi>Ye are the Light of the World;</hi> and ſo ſaid Chriſt of himſelf, doth it therefore follow
that they were Chriſt? They ſay they call the Scriptures what they call themſelves,

the Foundation of their Deiſm, and their overthrowing Chriſtiany, and yet this very
Year they have reprinted <hi>W. P</hi>'s Diſcourſe concerning the general Rule of Faith and
Practice, who brings fourteen Arguments to prove that the Scriptures are not the
general Rule of Faith and Practice, to which I have anſwered in my late Book in
Print, called <hi>The Deiſm of</hi> W. P. &amp;c. Three of which Arguments of his are, 1. From
their Imperfection.<note place="margin">Switch, pag. 46.</note> 2. Their Uncertainty. 3. Their Obſcurity, Yea, <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi> in
his <hi>Switch,</hi> chargeth <hi>the Scriptures with Vncertainty.</hi> This is a moſt dangerous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie;
for by this Principle they are not obliged to believe one intire Doctrine in the
Apoſtles Creed, as indeed I could eaſily prove; by their Principles they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

ſeeing by denying the Scriptures to be either the Medium or Rule of their Faith,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97123:17"/>
what account can they give for their Faith, to believe one peculiar Article of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</p>
                  <p>If they ſay they have a peculiar Inſpiration from the Light within, to believe
theſe peculiar Doctrines; this in the firſt place throws down the common Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from being the univerſal Rule, for common and peculiar are differing things.
But next, It is a meer Fiction, if they ſhould ſay they have ſuch a peculiar Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe that Chriſt was born of a Virgin, died for our
Sins, roſe again the third Day: <hi>W. P.</hi> grants the Light within doth not reveal theſe
things to them, nor is it needful; and he grants the Scriptures are an hiſtorical
Rule, but he will not allow that the Belief of the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Birth,
Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is neceſſary to our Salvation: <hi>It is none of the abſolute Neceſſaries</hi> he
ſaith.</p>
                  <p>But they have not only denied the Scriptures to be the Word, the Rule, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Medium of Faith, but have given them Names of Contempt, particularly <hi>G. F.</hi>
who has called them <hi>earthly and carnal, Death, Ink and Paper, Dust, and Serpents
Meat,</hi> G. F's Truth's Defence, p. 14, 102. See ſeveral Papers given forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p.
45, 46. <hi>So Dust is the Serpents Meat, their Original is but Duſt, which is but the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is Death; ſo theſe Serpents feed upon Duſt, which feed upon all theſe carnal
things, and their Goſpel is Duſt,</hi> Matthew, Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>which is the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
The curſed Serpent is in the Letter, R. Hub</hi>'s Words, <hi>Truth's Def.</hi> p. 102. Is not
this to fright People from reading the Letter, to tell them the curſed Serpent, <hi>i. e.</hi>
the Devil is in it? Their common Defence is, that G. F. meant all this of the Ink
and Paper, but none of all (whom he calls Serpents) that is the Proteſtant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
did ever ſay, that the Ink and Paper was the Goſpel, they meant the Doctrines
and Truths declared by what is writ or printed with Ink on Paper: As for the

Scripture is God, yea, the Letter of the Scripture is God, Switch,</hi> p. 15. and for Proof
of this he quotes <hi>G. Fox,</hi> G. M. p. 261. who affirmed that one <hi>Roger Atkinſon</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That the Scripture is God;</hi> but had this been ſo, will that juſtifie G. F. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

them ſuch opprobrious Names, if one or two Particulars did run into one Extream?
Will this juſtifie <hi>G. F.</hi> his running into the other Extream? The bending a crooked
Plant the contrary way will not ſerve his turn in this caſe: But that <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is not to be truſted, in his quoting his Opponents: I ſhall clearly prove, <hi>G. F.</hi>
in his Great Myſtery, p. 247. quotes <hi>C. Wade</hi> for the ſame Treſpaſs that he quotes
<hi>Roger Atkinſon</hi> for, namely, that <hi>Chriſtopher Wade</hi> ſhould affirm, <hi>That the Scripture
Letter was God and Chriſt;</hi> for this he quotes his Book called <hi>Quakery Slain,</hi> but no
ſuch Paſſage is to be found in all that Book; and <hi>C. Wade,</hi> in another Book of his,
entituled, <hi>To all thoſe called Quakers,</hi> he charges <hi>G. F.</hi> with a Helliſh Lye and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for affirming that he called the Letter God and Chriſt; ſee this laſt Book of
<hi>C. Wade,</hi> p. 7. and compare it with his <hi>Quakery ſlain,</hi> p. 16. and his Words in that
p. 16. being, <hi>That the Letter of the New Teſtament or Goſpel, containeth in it the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inſpired teaching written VVord of Chriſt, the VVord that was and is God, which,</hi>
ſaith <hi>C. VVade, is flat contrary to thy Lye.</hi> And in his laſt cited Book, the ſaid <hi>C.
VVade</hi> mentions no leſs than twelve particular Lyes wherewith <hi>G. F.</hi> had belyed him
in matter of fact as to his Quotations, all which I have conſidered, and ſo may others
if they have the Books, and will find them indeed to be abuſive Perverſions and Lies
of <hi>G. F.</hi> upon this <hi>C. VVade,</hi> but I ſhall give only two Inſtances more, that out of
the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes, that is plain matter of fact <hi>G. F.</hi> is guilty of


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97123:17"/>
falſe Quotations, and belying the Innocent (and yet theſe impudent Men will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Infallibility) one of them is, that G. F. in his G. M. p. 246. chargeth <hi>C.
VVade</hi> to ſay, <hi>O Luciferian Pride to ſave Souls;</hi> to this <hi>C. VVade</hi> fully and effectually
anſwereth, and plainly detects the Lie and Perverſion in his ſecond Book, where he
ſhews out of the ſeventh and eighth Page of his <hi>Quakery ſlain,</hi> that his Words were,
<hi>His crying out againſt</hi> James Milner'<hi>s Luciferian Pride to ſave Souls as Chriſt did,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>C. Wade's</hi> ſecond Book, p. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he pretended himſelf to be Chriſt, and audaciouſly took upon him to ſave Souls, as
Chriſt did by his ſuffering Death; and hereupon</hi> James Milner <hi>did in a juggling manner
die, and in a juggling inchanting manner, with a Knife and a Baſon, he pretended his
Blood was ſhed to ſave the Souls of two VVomen, this manner of ſaving Souls only, C. Wade
blames, which</hi> G. F. <hi>either juſtifies, or renders himſelf a Lyer by blaming</hi> C. Wade. See
the Places themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The other Lye and Slander which <hi>G. F.</hi> is guilty of againſt <hi>C. Wade,</hi> is that in his
G. M. p. 247. he makes <hi>C. Wade</hi> to ſay, <hi>God limits the Supreme Holy One, by the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Writings of the Apoſtles;</hi> but <hi>C.</hi> Wade's Words were, <hi>That the Devil limits the
Supreme Holy One;</hi> ſee <hi>C.</hi> Wade's ſecond Book, p. 5. compared with p. 13. of <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſlain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, If either the <hi>Switch,</hi> or G. <hi>Whitehead</hi> could prove the like Perverſions and Lies
againſt the Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi> as C. <hi>Wade</hi> hath here proved againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> how
would they have ſentenced him, as indeed they have, for things of ſmall moment, in
compariſon of what is here juſtly proved againſt their infallible Apoſtle (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he was) <hi>G. F?</hi> But I do not know one Quotation of the Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi>
out of their Books, wherein he hath in a ſubſtantial matter wronged him, as <hi>G. F.</hi>
here hath wronged <hi>C. Wade,</hi> not only in theſe three, but many more.</p>
                  <p>There yet remains two Quotations out of <hi>G. W</hi>'s own Book, called <hi>Truth defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Quakers,</hi> which he moſt fallaciouſly and ſophiſtically endeavours to juſtifie.
The Queſtion being put, Whether the Quakers did eſteem their Speakings to be of
as great Authority as any Chapter in the Bible?<note place="margin">Truth and Inn. p. 16.</note> 'Tis anſwered, <hi>That which is ſpoken
from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters
are, and greater.</hi> This ſame Quotation is objected in a late printed Sheet, called <hi>An
Account from Colcheſter,</hi> where the following Words are ſet down, that <hi>G. W.</hi>
blames the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Prieſts for leaving out, which he calls <hi>the annexed explanatory
Words,</hi> and they are theſe; <hi>As Chriſt's VVords were of greater Authority when he ſpoke,
than the Phariſes reading the Letter, and they in whom that Spirit ſpeaks not, are out of
the Authority of the Scriptures, and their ſpeaking we deny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But firſt, Theſe Words are not explanatory, but a ſophiſtical Argument to prove
the former Aſſertion; for <hi>G. VV.</hi> argues, That becauſe Chriſt's preaching was of
greater Authority than the Phariſees reading the Scriptures, that therefore
what the Spirit ſpeaks in the Quakers, and by them, is of greater Authority than the
Scriptures, which is both a falſe and fooliſh Conſequence, for it ſuppoſes that the
Spirit of God ſpeaks in the Quakers when they preach or ſpeak in Meetings, as it
did in Chriſt and in the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ſame divine Inſpiration in kind and
manner, immediately and infallibly, which cannot be granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of it appears by the many falſe things that they ſpeak and write contrary to the
Scriptures: And though he mentions not Quakers, yet that he does underſtand
them, and none elſe, is clear from his own Words: He ſaith, <hi>They in whom that
Spirit ſpeaks not, their ſpeaking we deny:</hi> This ſuppoſeth he grants that the Spirit ſpoke
in ſome, which they did not deny, and who were theſe, but the Miniſters


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97123:18"/>
among the Quakers, ſeeing they deny the Miniſtry of all others in our Days.</p>
                  <p>Next he has an impertinent Queſtion, as to the Diviſion of Chapters and Verſes,
<hi>Can theſe Men ſay that was done by Divine Authority?</hi> But this is wholly from the
purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Another Evaſion is, <hi>That the Spirit of Truth immediately miniſtring in Man, or by
any ſpiritual Miniſter, is of greater Authority, Power, or Efficacy, than the Chapters are,
ſimply conſidered as without the Spirit.</hi> But, <hi>ſimply conſidered as without the Spirit,</hi> is
wholly remote from the Queſtion, and is no ways to be allowed for any true Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
becauſe the Spirit doth as truly and frequently accompany the Scriptures
when read as when preached; or whatever is preached by the Spirit's Aſſiſtance, if
the Hearers in reading be as ſincere as the Hearers in preaching: But if the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be careleſs, ſuppoſe Men preach by the Spirit, it doth not follow that carnal and
careleſs Hearers hear by the Spirit, more than that they read or hear what is read by
the Spirit: But if he will needs have the Words <hi>ſimply and abſtractly conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit</hi> be added to reading, let them, by the like reaſon, be added to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
what he adds of Chriſt and the Apoſtles living and powerful preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of greater Efficacy, Power, and Authority, than the outward Writing or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it ſelf, <hi>ſimply or abſtractly conſidered as diſtinct from the Spirit:</hi> As it was no Part
of the Queſtion, nor Anſwer given by him in <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> ſo it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.
But he equivocates upon the Word <hi>Authority,</hi> taking it for the effect it
hath on the Hearers; but that was not the Senſe of the Word <hi>Authority</hi> in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
asked; but its Senſe (as it's generally among all that treat of Scripture Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
above other Writings, ſo taken) the Obligation or Right that doth oblige or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to believe the Truth of them, and that they are of divine Inſpiration: This
is quite another thing than the Effect or Impreſſion that Men feel in reading or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them read, as well as when preached upon by way of expounding; for whether
the Effect or Influence and Impreſſion be great or little, as it is ſometimes great, and
ſometimes little, and ſometimes perhaps none, upon hardned Hearts, yet their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is ſtill the ſame, neither greater nor leſs at one time than another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other Quotation is taken out of his</hi> Truth defending, <hi>and is objected againſt in
that called</hi> An Account from Colcheſter, <hi>to which a pretended Anſwer is given in that
called</hi> Some Account from Colcheſter, <hi>ſigned by ſeven Quakers; the Paſſage is this,</hi> Is
the Moral Law or ten Commandments a Rule to the Chriſtian's Life,<note place="margin">Some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> p. 9. to the End.</note> or is it not? <hi>Anſ.</hi>
Thou might as well ask if the moral Law, as thou calleſt it, be a Rule to Chriſt? For the
Chriſtian's Life and Rule is Chriſt, who is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs, who came
not to deſtroy but to fulfil it.</p>
                  <p>Note, In their Anſwer they groſlly equivocate, in taking the Word <hi>Chriſtian's
Life</hi> in another Senſe than was meant in the Query, and is meant in common Speech:
By a Chriſtian's Life, is meant in the Query and common Speech, a Chriſtian's Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and manner of Life, with reſpect to his Thoughts, Words, and Actions.
Now, though Chriſt is called in Scripture the Chriſtian's Life by the Figure of a
Metonimy, being the Author of their Life, yet he is not their Practice or Manner of
Life, their thinking, ſpeaking, and acting; and whereas they make it abſurd to
ſuppoſe that the moral Law was a Rule to Chriſt: Here they ſhew their Ignorance
and Error, for the Man Chriſt had the moral Law for his Law and Rule, and it
did oblige him to Obedience, and he fulfilled it in his own Perſon, for he was made
under the Law, and though the Law is not a Rule to the Spirit of Chriſt in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
yet it is a Rule of the Spirit, whereby he rules them. Next they ſay, The


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97123:18"/>
                     <hi>ſaid Anſwer appears not to be intended to make void the moral Law or ten Commandments,
but the contrary, in aſſerting Christ to be the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs, and that
he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it, therefore the Righteouſneſs thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
and is binding by the holy Spirit in every true Believer, though not under the Law,
but under Grace, which effectually teaches, both to deny Vngodlineſs and worldly Luſts,
and to live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this preſent VVorld,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. which
anſwers the Subſtance and End of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Note, whereas they ſay, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of it remains, and is binding by the holy
Spirit in every true Believer, how is it binding by the Spirit, if it be not a Rule to every
true Believer? Doth the Spirit bind Believers to that which is no Rule or Law?</hi> Again,
By their Limitation and Reſtriction of binding by the Spirit, they make the moral
Law, as it is outwardly delivered in the holy Scriptures, to have no Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Believers at all, but only as it is inwardly revealed and given by the Spirit; and
thus Chriſt's Prophetical and Kingly Office, as he outwardly delivered that Law to
us, is of no Force by their Anſwer; whereas that Law, and all the other Laws of
Chriſt, have their binding Authority over Believers from Chriſt the great Prophet,
and King, and Head of his Church, as without them delivered by him to them, and
ſealed by his Spirit in their Hearts; and though the Spirit of Chriſt in Chriſt himſelf,
and in the Prophets and Apoſtles, was a Lawgiver to Men, yet the Spirit is not a
Lawgiver as in us, becauſe his Law is ſufficiently given already by Chriſt, and by
his Spirit in Chriſt, and in his Prophets and Apoſtles: But the Work and Office of
the Spirit in us, and all Believers, is to perſwade us of the Truth and Authority of
the Laws of Chriſt already given, to enlighten our Minds to underſtand them, and
inwardly to ſtrengthen us by his Grace, and gracious Influences and Operations to
obey them. But to hold that the holy Spirit is any Lawgiver to Believers ſince the
Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, is of no leſs dangerous Conſequence, than to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
Chriſtianity, and introduce Deiſm and Mahumetiſm: For indeed, upon that
Pretence, the Laws of the Turks Alcoran are ſet up and by the ſame Pretence <hi>G. F.</hi>
did throw down Chriſt's Inſtitutions of Baptiſm and the Supper, and Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by Paſtors and Elders, and ſet up Laws and Rules that he pretended to have
given him by the Spirit; and this was the Pretence of the ancient Montaniſts: Yea,
<hi>W. Penn,</hi> on this very Pretence, rejects Baptiſm and the Supper, affirming, <hi>That
the ſame Spirit that led the Apoſtles to reject Circumciſion, hath led the Quakers to reject
the outward Baptiſm and Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, whereas they ſay, <hi>A Believer is not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> this
doth not juſtifie their vile Hereſie, <hi>That the moral Law is not a Rule of Life to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
for though they are not under the Curſe and Condemnation of it, nor as it is a
Law of Works, ſo as thereby to be juſtified, yet they are under it, even as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
given by Chriſt and his Prophets and Apoſtles, as a Rule of Life: And thus,
as they diſannul and make void the moral Law of the Ten Commandments, ſo all
the other poſitive Laws and Commands of the Goſpel, making the Goſpel nothing
but the Light within all Mankind, and Goſpel Commands nothing but what that
dictates, though they are not agreed about the Commands of the Light within, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Number or Duration, or whether there are any new Commands given in
this Age, as <hi>G. F.</hi> pretends was given to him, and by him to the Quakers.</p>
                  <p>But again, How doth it appear, that their Anſwer doth not make void the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law or Ten Commandments, when they reject the Morality of the fourth
Commandment, and do not allow, that one Day of ſeven is to be obſerved, and


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97123:19"/>
to be ſanctified, by abſtaining from ſervile Labour, and giving that Day to religious
Exerciſe, as appears from another Quotation in that called <hi>An Account from Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
taken out of <hi>G. W</hi>'s <hi>Truth defending?</hi> To which they pretend to give anſwer, in
that called <hi>Some Account from Colcheſter,</hi> p. 11. <hi>Did that Quaker ſin therein or not,
who brought lately, on the Lord's Day, an old Doublet into Dr.</hi> Gell'<hi>s Church in</hi> London,
<hi>and ſate upon the Communion Table mending it, while the Dr. was preaching; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhoners

<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it a Crime Sin to work upon the Communion Table, as if it were a more holy
Place than another.</hi> But though it have no inherent Holineſs, yet it being dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to that Uſe, every ſober Chriſtian will ſay, it was a great Sin by diverſe
aggravating Circumſtances, as done in Contempt of the Inſtitution of our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who appointed the Practice of breaking of Bread; and that there ſhould be a
Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is evident from Scripture, that mentions the Table of the Lord. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The doing of it while the Dr. was preaching. Thirdly, The wilful Offence deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
given to the People preſent, upon Pretence of bearing witneſs againſt their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and idolatrous Practice, as the Quakers were wont to cenſure it. Fourthly,
The doing of it on the firſt Day of the Week, ſet apart from ſervile Labour, to the
Worſhip of God. Fifthly, The Breach of that golden Law of Equity, <hi>Not doing as
they would be done by;</hi> for would not the Quakers account it a great Sin and Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
if any of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or Diſſenter, ſhould ſit in one of their Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
where they ſtand to preach, and kneel at Prayer, and mend an old Doublet,
while they are preaching in their Meeting Places? Surely they would greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
it, and call it rude and unmannerly and profane. Again, whereas they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Where dost thou read in the Scripture, that Men must do no Work on the first Day
of the Week?</hi> And this Query is made to juſtifie the Quaker's ſitting on the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Table to mend an old Doublet on the firſt Day, in time of Divine Service. Is
not this a great Shame, to print and reprint ſuch avowed Profanation of the Lord's
Day, and Worſhip alſo, in the Face of a Proteſtant Nation, that zealouſly profeſs to
be againſt the Profanation of it, and where are ſtanding Laws againſt the Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note here, that whereas the Quakers affirm that what they ſpeak and write, is
immediately and infallibly from God; their profeſſed Principle obligeth them to
hold,</hi> that what they ſpeak and write, is of greater Certainty, and conſequently of greater
Authority than the Scriptures, becauſe they are certain of what they ſpeak and write from
the Spirit in themſelves, but they are not certain of the Writings of the Scriptures, <hi>as</hi>
W. P. <hi>argues in his Diſcourſe concerning the</hi> General Rule: They have not the <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapha,</hi>
the Copies differ, and ſo do the Tranſlations, but they have their own <hi>Autogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi>

Where do they find in Scripture, the Term <hi>immediate Revelation, immediate teaching

find in Scripture, <hi>That,</hi> ſee G. M. p. 324. <hi>the Seed, to which the Promiſe of Salvation is,

otherwiſe than in Manifeſtation; ſee <hi>G. W</hi>'s <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> p. 94. he ſaith, <hi>The
Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit (or the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost) are one and inſeparable, no where in Scripture called three ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Perſons, nor finite in Perſonalities, though Three [in Manifeſtation] and ſo teſtified
of (as Three Witneſſes) for the Confirmation of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, Seeing <hi>G. W.</hi> doth not own them to be Three, otherwiſe but in Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this is not only to deny the Names or Words, <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> but to deny that
they were Three from all Eternity, or before all Ages, for there was no Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either of One, or Two, or Three from Eternity: His calling them <hi>Three in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,</hi>
is to call them <hi>three Manifeſtations;</hi> and ſeeing all Manifeſtation has a
Beginning with Time, by his Doctrine there were not Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,
three any wiſe diſtinct from Eternity: There was no God the Father from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that did beger, nor no Son from Eternity that was begotten, nor Holy Ghoſt that
from Eternity did proceed from the Father and the Son, by <hi>G. VVhitehead</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> F. Hougil, <hi>in his</hi> Collection, <hi>p. 308. delivers the ſame erronious Doctrine: He
ſaith,</hi> That the Holy Ghost is called another (than Chriſt:) Another is not underſtood of
another Life, of another Subſtance; but is underſtood of another Manifeſtation, or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſame God, who ſubſiſts in the ſame Power in which the Father, the Son, and
the Spirit ſubſiſt, as I ſaid unto thee before: Another, as to diſtinguiſh of the Operation
and VVork of the Spirit and of the Son, we do not refuſe. <hi>By this Doctrine of</hi> F. Hougil,
<hi>they are but diſtinct Manifeſtations, Operations, and Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if <hi>G. VV.</hi> or the Author of the <hi>Switch</hi> will ſay, that there were three Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations,
Operations, or Works in the Godhead from all Eternity: It is abſurd to
ſuppoſe ſuch Manifeſtations, beſide that they are unſcripture Terms, the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that they uſe againſt, three Perſons, will as much, and indeed much more,
be of Force againſt three Manifeſtations; for if the Father be a Manifeſtation from
Eternity, of what is he a Manifeſtation? Can he be a Manifeſtation of himſelf?
Or is he a Manifeſtation of the Son, who (as they ſay) is a Manifeſtation? Thus


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97123:20"/>
one Manifeſtation would be the Manifeſtation of another Manifeſtation; but then
what would the Holy Spirit be a Manifeſtation of?</p>
               <p>And ſeeing in God there are no Accidents, theſe three Manifeſtations are not
three Accidents, nor three Subſiſtences, nor three Subſtances, nor three Perſons;
and conſequently (according to theſe Men) they are nothing at all but their own
Inventions.</p>
               <p>But <hi>VV. Penn,</hi> in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> has not only argued againſt three Perſons,
but againſt the Holy Three, for he bringeth five Arguments againſt their being a
Holy Three, Page 12, 13, 14. one of which is this in expreſs Words: <hi>Since the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is God, the Son is God, and the Spirit is God</hi> (which their Opinion neceſſitates
them to confeſs) <hi>then unleſs the Father, Son, and Spirit are three diſtinct nothings, they
must be three diſtinct Subſtances, and conſequently, three diſtinct Gods.</hi> Now let his
Argument be applied to the unſcripture Terms, three Manifeſtations, and it will
have the ſame Force, or rather greater; but indeed it hath none at all againſt three
diſtinct Perſons, for there is a plain Diſtinction of a Medium in created Beings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Subſtance and Nothing, the three Dimenſions of a Body, <hi>Length, Breadth,</hi>
and <hi>Depth,</hi> are neither three Nothings, nor three Subſtances; the Underſtanding,
Will, and Locomotive Power of Man's Soul, are neither three Nothings, nor three
Subſtances, and yet they are but one Soul, though all Creaturely Similitudes are
improper to expreſs this Myſtery.</p>
               <p>Beſide, how could a Manifeſtation become Fleſh, or take Man's Nature, as the
Son did? And how could one Manifeſtation ſend another, or beget another, or a
third Manifeſtation proceed from two other Manifeſtations?</p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>Joſ. VVyeth</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Switch,</hi> p. 184. <hi>VVe own their Diſtinction in
all the Inſtances of it recorded in Holy VVrit:</hi> In contradiction to this, hear <hi>F. Hougil,</hi>
in his <hi>Collection,</hi> p. 251. he calls it damnable Doctrine to ſay, <hi>That Chriſt muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the Father and the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Before in God, and now from God; their
Quibble about ſeparate doth not help them, for ſome that have ſo called them, have
declared they meant nothing by ſeparate but diſtinct; and now if <hi>Joſ. VVyeth</hi> and
<hi>G. VV.</hi> will have diſtinct to ſignifie ſeparate, ſeeing they pretend to own the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Father and the Son, they muſt own the Separation.</p>
               <p>And whereas, the Teachers among the Quakers profeſs they are not changed in any
thing of Doctrine or Practice, from what they were from the Beginning, <hi>for Truth
is one</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and changes not, and as God is one, and Truth is one and changeth not,
ſo his People are one:</hi> Now let us compare the Doctrine of <hi>G. VVhitehead,</hi> what it
was in the Year 1659. when he writ his <hi>Truth defending the Quakers</hi> (which he ſaid
was written from the Spirit of Truth) concerning the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity,
and what it was in the Year 1697, when he wrote his <hi>Antidote againſt the Venome
of the Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his <hi>Truth defending,</hi> &amp;c. printed 1659. in p. 2. he ſaith, <hi>VVhat the Scripture ſaith
of the Godhead, the Father, the VVord, and the Spirit, which are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7. <hi>we
own, but deny the Popiſh Term of three diſtinct Perſons, which you call God the Father, God
the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, which tends to the dividing God, and to the making three
Gods:</hi> [Note, here he not only denies the three Perſons, but the Orthodox and
Scriptural Explanation of them, of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt.] <hi>And thou who haſt vindicated ſuch a</hi> Dream; <hi>could never prove it by the
Scripture, when thou waſt put upon it: And do not you Prieſts, in your Divinity, as you call
it, affirm, that a Perſon is a ſingle rational compleat Subſtance, and differing from another


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97123:20"/>
by an incommunicable Property? And art thou ſo blind, as to think that there is ſuch a
Difference in the Godhead? Seeing Chriſt is equal with his Father who is a Spirit, then
what incommunicable Property can he differ in from the Father, that is not communicable
to the one as well as the other?</hi> Here we ſee, he not only oppoſes the Terms, <hi>Three
Perſons,</hi> but the Diſtinction of the Three their <hi>incommunicable Properties,</hi> which are
theſe, That the Father begot the Son from everlaſting, the Son was begot of the
Father from everlaſting, and the Holy Ghoſt did proceed, both from the Father and
the Son from everlaſting; and ſurely the Father's Property is incommunicable to the
Son, and ſo is the Son's to the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt's Property to both, for it
cannot be ſaid, that the Son begot the Father, or that the Son is the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or that the Holy Ghoſt is either the Father or the Son.</p>
               <p>But now let us hear his late Doctrine in his printed <hi>Antidote,</hi> 1697. p. 139.
<hi>Though 'tis true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in one Senſe, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
diſtinct, as to their divine Being, which is but one, they are but one God; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to their Properties of Relation, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as ſuch they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
but not divided nor ſeparate, either in themſelves, or VVork of the old or new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Firſt, <hi>G. VV.</hi> ſhould tell us, where doth he find in Scripture, in expreſs
Terms, that they are diſtinct in reſpect to their Properties of Relation. Secondly,
Whether theſe Properties of Relation are communicable or incommunicable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties:
Surely he muſt ſay, incommunicable, and that he did in his Book, <hi>Truth
defending,</hi> expreſly deny: For if he ſhould ſay, theſe Properties are communicable,
ſuch as God's abſolute Properties are, as holy, wiſe, good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the Son might
beget, and the Father might be begotten. And laſtly, Seeing he now owns a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Properties of Relation, though in unſcripture Terms, he muſt, by good
conſequence, own three Perſons to be the Subjects of thoſe Properties, for no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
or Predicates, or Attributes, can be without their proper Subjects; for
though it is the Father's Property to have begot the Son from everlaſting, yet the
Father is not a Property, but the Perſon or Subject that has that Property. Thus
we ſee, how <hi>Proteus</hi>-like <hi>G. VV.</hi> has changed his Shapes in the Years 1659. and 1697.
and yet there is no Shadow of Change in him for all this, if we will believe him.
But further, by ſome of his late Books, we ſhall find him, not only owning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of the three, in reſpect to their Properties of Relation, but advanced much
nearer, ſo far as to diſown his former Oppoſition to the Terms <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> which
in his Book called <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> that was his jointly with others, he had charged his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
to have conjured out of one, and told him, <hi>that both they and he are ſhut up in
perpetual Darkneſs for the Lake;</hi> and this he doth in two ſeveral Books, one printed in
the Year 1690. called <hi>The Chriſtianity of the People commonly called Quakers,</hi> where
he ſets down the Words quoted out of his <hi>Iſhmael</hi> more largely; the other called
<hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> printed this very Year, 1699. where he leaves out the moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Words, and puts an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their room, as being (I ſupoſe) aſhamed of
them, and well he might; but he is not aſhamed to affirm, he is not changed in his
Faith. But let us hear how he excuſeth what he writ in his <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> that was
printed in the Year 1655.<note place="margin">Truth and Inn. p. 51.</note> Though his Name is at the Book, yet he poſitively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns
the Words, and affirms, <hi>They are none of his, and that he writ not that Part of
the Anſwer to</hi> Townſend: And in his Book, called <hi>The Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp;c. above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
he ſaith <hi>He looks on the Words as wrong writ, or wrong printed, and that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them out, or corrected them long ſince, where he has met with that Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97123:21"/>
But is not this a Piece of dull Sophiſtry to ſave the Credit of his Infallibility?
Had he not better, more like a Man and a Chriſtian, acknowledged his Error,
than to lay the Fault upon [as wrong writ, or wrong printed?] And if he correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them long ſince, how comes it that he never publiſhed his Correction in any of
the Books he has publiſhed ſince, betwixt the Year 1655. and 1690. containing the
ſpace of 36. Years?</p>
               <p>But for evidence againſt him, that he hath not ſincerely ſaid, <hi>That he writ not
that Part of the Book,</hi> it is enough that he owned it, and this I can prove, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exception, he owned it to be his jointly with theſe others who ſigned it with him,
as appears from his <hi>Truth defending the Quakers,</hi> p. 1. printed four Years after the
<hi>Iſhmael:</hi> And he belches out the like antichriſtian and profane Expreſſions againſt
the three Perſons in the Godhead, in Terms equivalent to thoſe in the <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> He
ſaith, in his firſt Page, in Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, <hi>Do not you repent for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
vainly to defend,</hi> Auguſt 29. 1659. <hi>in ſo great a Congregation, theſe Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
printed in a Book writ by</hi> George Whitehead? He anſwers for himſelf and his
Brethren thus: <hi>The Poſitions we defended, are according to the Scriptures of Truth, and
them we need not repent of.</hi> Theſe were they contained in that very Book called
<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as doth appear out of the Book <hi>Iſhmael</hi> it ſelf; [here the Book was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced]
one of which Poſitions were, in aſſerting the <hi>Scriptures or Writing not to be the
Word:</hi> Another was, <hi>That there is no ſuch Word in the Scriptures, as Three Perſons in
the Trinity, but it is a Popiſh Doctrine, as the Maſs or Common-Prayer-Book mentions it.
Fourthly, And thou that affirms three diſtinct Perſons in the Godhead, art a Dreamer,
and he that dreams, and tells Lies, contrary to the Scriptures of Truth which we own,
he with his Imaginations and Dreams, is for the Lake.</hi> Here it is plain, that by his
Imaginations and Dreams, <hi>G.W.</hi> meant the Miniſters Doctrines of calling the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>the Word,</hi> and affirming that there are three Perſons in the Godhead; ſo
whereas he ſaid in his <hi>Iſhmael, Townſend and the three Perſons are ſhut up in perpetual
Doctrines:</hi> Here in <hi>Truth defending,</hi> &amp;c. he ſaith, <hi>He with his Imaginations and
Dreams</hi> [that is the three Perſons] <hi>is for the Lake:</hi> Now this is not one whit more
ſober than his Words in the <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> how then is it that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> has not found
ſome ſhift to put this part of his <hi>Truth defending</hi> upon another? Again, in his <hi>Truth
defending,</hi> &amp;c. p. 25. he plainly owns that Book called <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to be his, four Years
after it was printed; and now, though in his <hi>Truth defending,</hi> &amp;c. he ſaith, <hi>That he
and his Brethren need not repent of the Poſitions laid down in that called</hi> Iſhmael; yet
now in the Year 1690. in his <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>He was ſorry his Name was to that
Paper;</hi> and yet, as before is mentioned, in <hi>Truth defending,</hi> p. 1. he ſaith, <hi>They need
not repent of it.</hi> Is not this a plain Change in <hi>G. W. He need not repent of what was
writ,</hi> and yet <hi>was ſorry that it was writ:</hi> Formerly he owned that Book in the Year
1659, and in the Year 1690, <hi>He writ not that Part, and was ſorry it was writ;</hi> and
all this without any Change in his Mind: But when People are ſorry for what they
do, we commonly reckon they repent of it.</p>
               <p>This offenſive Paſſage, objected againſt <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> out of his <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt him by <hi>Chriſtopher Wade,</hi> in his <hi>Quakery ſlain,</hi> p. 9. printed in 1657.
And though <hi>G. W.</hi> printed againſt <hi>C. Wade,</hi> in his <hi>Truth defending,</hi> 1659. yet he
then took no notice of that Paſſage, to diſown it to be his.</p>
               <p>But how is it that <hi>G. W.</hi> diſowns what was written in the Book called <hi>Iſhmael,</hi>
againſt the three Perſons? Doth he now own the three Perſons not to be Popiſh, as
he formerly charged them, <hi>Truth def.</hi> p. 2? Though he has not in the leaſt retracted


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97123:21"/>
his abuſive and reviling Speeches againſt this glorious Truth, both in the <hi>Iſhmael,</hi>
and in his <hi>Truth defending,</hi> &amp;c. [for that would reflect upon his Infallibility) yet he
would ſeem now to own the Doctrine of the three Perſons, ſince the Act for Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
came forth, for that Act of Toleration does except thoſe who deny, in their
preaching or writing, the Doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity, as it is declared in the
Articles of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the 39 Articles. But that <hi>G. W.</hi> may have the Benefit of
the Act (which at preſent he has not by Law, whatever he has by Indulgence) he
ought alſo to diſown ſome other abuſive Expreſſions of his, and ſophiſtical Arguings
he has uſed in his other Books, as particularly, not only in his <hi>Truth defending,</hi> &amp;c.
above mentioned; but in his <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> ſigned by the two Letters, <hi>G. W.</hi>
ſee p. 18. he hath theſe Words, <hi>As to</hi> T.D'<hi>s telling of the Son of God's Incarnation, the
Creation of his Body and Soul, the Parts of that Nature be ſubſiſted in,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To this I
ſay</hi> (ſaith <hi>G. W.) if the Body and Soul of the Son of God were both created, doth not this
render him a fourth Perſon?</hi> And as nonſenſical and abuſive is the reaſoning of <hi>G. Fox</hi>
their great Apoſtle, in the Epiſtle prefixed to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſigned by him and <hi>John
Stubbs,</hi> where, in the 9th Page of that Epiſtle, they thus argue;—<hi>And he ſpeaks
again, in his 14th Page, of three diſtinct Perſons are one with the Godhead: Now Reader,
is not here four, to wit, three Perſons and the Godhead?</hi> And thus <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi>
make no leſs, by their wild and nonſenſical Reaſonings, than five Perſons in the
Godhead, an Abſurdity they would fix on the Doctrine of three Perſons; for by
their Arguments, the Godhead is the fourth Perſon, and Chriſt's created Soul and
Body is the fifth: Do not theſe Paſſages require a Retractation, and will they ſay
they are Proteſtants, and one with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Matter of Doctrine,
and in the common Principles of Chriſtianity, and yet boldly ſtand in the Defence of
thoſe abuſive Paſſages?</p>
               <p>But whereas they argue (<hi>ad hominem</hi>) that there muſt be five Perſons, if Father,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt be ſaid to be three Perſons, ſeeing <hi>G. W.</hi> calls them <hi>three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi>
by their nonſenſical Argument, there muſt be five Witneſſes that bear Record
in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and the Godhead;
theſe are four, and the created Soul and Body of Chriſt, that is the fifth: But <hi>G.W.</hi>
has a way to evade this laſt, by denying that Chriſt has any created Soul or Body,
as in the Words in p. 18. above mentioned doth appear, for which I ſhall have ſome
uſe hereafter.</p>
               <p>Joſ. Wyeth, <hi>in his</hi> Switch, <hi>p. 184. would make his Readers believe,</hi> It's only the
Word Perſon they object against, as too groſs: We cannot (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) but think the VVord
Perſon too groſs to expreſs them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to detect this Fallacy, pray let us take notice,</hi> that G. F. <hi>whom he calls an
Apoſtle, has expreſly owned</hi> the Perſon of the Father, <hi>G. M. p.</hi> 247. But thou ſaith,
Chriſt doth not dwell in them perſonally, doth not Chriſt dwell in his Saints, as he is in the
Perſon of the Father, the Subſtance? And are not they of his Fleſh, and of his Bone?</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>G. Fox,</hi> G.M. p. 248. owns expreſly Chriſt's Perſon; for firſt, having cited
his Opponent's Words; <hi>It is a falſe thing to ſay Chriſt's Perſon is in Man;</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
(without finding the leaſt fault with the Term Perſon) he makes Oppoſition
thus, <hi>VVhich is as much as to ſay, none are of his Fleſh, or of his Bone, nor eat it, nor had
not his Subſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it appears, that <hi>G. F.</hi> did not find fault, either with the Word <hi>Perſon,</hi> as
belonging to the Father, or with Chriſt's Perſon, but he will not allow them to be
two Perſons, but one Perſon. But if any will ſay, he allowed them to be two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97123:22"/>
then by the Arguments, both of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. VV.</hi> they muſt be two Gods; for
if three Perſons infer by Argument, three Gods, by the ſame Argument, two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
will infer two Gods.</p>
               <p>The above mentioned Words of <hi>G. F.</hi> in G. M. <hi>Doth not Chriſt dwell in his Saints,
as he is in the Perſon of the Father, the Subſtance? Joſ. VVyeth,</hi> in his <hi>Switch,</hi> recites as

of the Father, which were <hi>G. F</hi>'s own Words, but labors to prove, that by that

the Soul of the ſame Perſon and Subſtance with God, which how ineffectual his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor

               <p>
                  <hi>Note, that the</hi> Switch <hi>doth juſtifie G. F. his Saying,</hi> That God the Father did take
upon him Humane Nature, <hi>p. 190. and in</hi> Truth's defence, <hi>by G. F. p.</hi> 85. The Son's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <p>
                  <hi>But here, once more on this Head, let us take notice of</hi> G. VV<hi>'s Fallibility and
ſelf Contradiction in moſt evident manner. In his</hi> Light and Life, <hi>p. 47. he blames
his Opponent,</hi> VV. B. <hi>for theſe Words following, concerning Chriſt;</hi> Now, as he was
God, he was Co-creator with the Father, and ſo was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and had Glory with
God before the VVorld was, and in this Senſe came down from Heaven. <hi>To this</hi> G.VV.
<hi>replies,</hi> VVhat Nonſence and unſcripture Language is this, to tell of God being Co-creator
with the Father, or that God had Glory with God? Doth not this imply two Gods, and
that God had a Father, let the Reader judge? <hi>Note how he calleth it Nonſence and
unſcripture Language, to ſay,</hi> That Chriſt, as God, had Glory with God, and that he
had a Father; <hi>which is a plain Evidence that</hi> G. VV. <hi>denied the eternal divine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of the Son, contrary both to the</hi> Nicene <hi>and</hi> Athanaſian <hi>Creed, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alſo. But let us ſee how he excuſes himſelf in his</hi> Antidote, <hi>p.</hi> 188. But the
Phraſe, God Co-creator with God, I think ſtill implies two Creators, and conſequently two
Gods. 'Tis not the Particle <hi>Co,</hi> with, in this caſe, will excuſe the matter, for <hi>Co</hi> or <hi>Con</hi>
is <hi>ſimul,</hi> together, as Co-workers, Co-partners, which are more diſtinct Agents than one,
but the Creator is but one God, one VVord, one Spirit, and ſo one Creator.</p>
               <p>Note, Here we ſee the Force of <hi>G. VV</hi>'s Argument againſt Chriſt the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, Co-creator with the Father, is, that it would infer the Father and the Son
to be <hi>Co-workers, and conſequently two Gods.</hi> This <hi>Antidote</hi> he writ in the Year 1697.
but in the Year 1674. wherein he publiſhed his <hi>Quakers Plainneſs,</hi> in p. 24. he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Father and the Son to be <hi>Co-workers</hi> in the following Words; <hi>That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of the Father and the Son, is not only nominal (as this Oppoſer implies against us)
but real, in the divine Relation of Father and Son; the Son as being the only begotten of
the Father, and alſo known as Co-workers; in the Order and Degrees of Manifeſtation
and Diſcovery,</hi> where it is plain, by his late manner of arguing, in his <hi>Antidote,</hi>
againſt the Father and the Son being <hi>Co-workers,</hi> that it doth infer two Gods; that
in his Saying, in his <hi>Quakers Plainneſs,</hi> as above quoted, <hi>That the Father and the Son
are known as Co-workers;</hi> he has rendred himſelf guilty, by his own Argument, of
holding the Father and the Son to be two Gods: This is not only a Contradiction
to himſelf, but a ſevere Cenſure on himſelf, that in the Year 1674. he was guilty of
Idolatry, in holding, <hi>That the Father and the Son are two Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note Reader, that the Quakers uſe to object two things againſt my charging
Contradictions upon <hi>G. W.</hi> and other their principal Authors: Firſt, <hi>That I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
my ſelf in my former and later Writings:</hi> To this I have anſwered, What in
my later Writings I have retracted of my former Errors, is no Contradiction; for


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97123:22"/>
that's a Contradiction, when a Man holds contradictory Propoſitions to be both
true [<hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel</hi>] without retracting his Errors. But what a Man retracts, he
is no more chargeable with; let <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Brethren retract their Errors, and I
ſhall ceaſe to charge them with them, or with Contradictions. Secondly, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>That I may find as many Contradictions in the Scriptures, as in their Books:</hi> Thus
we ſee how they undervalue the Scriptures, to be as contradictory as their Authors;
but I deny there are any real Contradictions in the Scriptures, but there are many in
the Quakers Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again further, hear a Quotation out of the</hi> Primmer <hi>of</hi> G. F. junior, <hi>and</hi> S. Criſp,
<hi>p.</hi> 24. And they that come to ſee and know the Son, they come to ſee and know the Father
alſo, for the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, as ſaith the Scriptures,
and they are called by one Name, which is, <hi>The Word,</hi> or <hi>The Light,</hi> For the Word is
God, and Christ is the Word, and God is Light, and Christ is the Light of the World, and
the Spirit of Life proceeds from God and Christ, who are Light.</p>
               <p>Note, Seeing they hold that the Father and the Son are called by one Name,
which is, <hi>The Word,</hi> and that the Father is the Word, and the Son is the Word, it is
evident they make no Diſtinction betwixt the Father and Son? and therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their falſe Doctrine, ſeeing the Word was made Fleſh, and the Father is the
Word, the Father was made Fleſh, the Father was born of a Virgin, the Father ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Death on the Croſs, yea, the Father is the Son, and the Son is the Father,
which is a plain overturning the great Fundamentals of Chriſtianity; yet this <hi>Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
is ſo highly magnified among the Quakers, that almoſt every Family of them
have it to teach it their Children, and they call it in the Preface, <hi>A Fruit of the Plant
of Righteouſneſs, given forth for the removing the Vſe of ſuch Books and Catechiſins, as are
ſprung forth of the corrupt Tree, which now is to be burned, and its Fruit rejected:</hi> Now
theſe are all the Books and Catechiſms publiſhed by any others but themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, in p. 23. they ſay,</hi> And though ſome have known him (<hi>viz.</hi> Christ after the
Fleſh) yet henceforth know they him ſo no more, as ſay the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
               <p>Note, Here they pervert the true Sence of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, as they commonly do in
their Books and Preachings, giving <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words for a Reaſon why they do not
preach Faith in Chriſt, as he came in the Fleſh, died, and roſe again, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Salvation, becauſe, ſay they, <hi>VVe are no more to know Christ after the Fleſh;</hi>
whereas it was the great Subject, both of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, and of all the Apoſtles,
to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, as he came in the Fleſh, died for our Sins, and roſe again, and
aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſomuch, that they did, with one Accord, declare, <hi>That the Gift of
the Holy Ghoſt, with all the ſaving and ſanctifying Graces of the Spirit, do come to Men,
by Chriſt, through Faith in him, as he came in the Fleſh, died, roſe, and aſcended; and
that this Faith was wrought in Men by hearing the VVord outwardly preached.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in p. 23. they ſay, <hi>Now Children, the Scriptures of Truth do declare of God
and Christ, and the Spirit of Truth, which are one; but the Scriptures cannot bring you
to know God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit of Truth:</hi> And yet they ſay, concerning this
<hi>Primmer,</hi> and the Contents of it, p. 2. <hi>That they are very uſeful for Children and others
to</hi> Learn, <hi>that they may be turned unto the Light, which is the Gift of God:</hi> Here
they ſeem to prefer their <hi>Primmer</hi> to the Scriptures; for they ſay, of the Contents
of their <hi>Primmer, That they are very uſeful for Children and others to Learn:</hi> To learn
what? Surely ſome Knowledge of God and Chriſt they will ſay, and yet they will
not allow ſo much to the Scripture; and on a diligent Search, I find not, in all this
<hi>Primmer,</hi> one ſimple Direction, to Children and others, to read the Scriptures, and


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97123:23"/>
what they have quoted of Scripture in it, is but little, and much, even of that,
groſly perverted and miſapplied, as in p. 44, 45. they ſay, <hi>They that hear the Light
[that is in all Men, and common to all Men] they hear God, for God is Light, and they
that hear God, they hear Chriſt alſo, for God and Chriſt are one (as ſaith the Scripture)
and they that hear Chriſt, hear the Author of the true Faith, and ſo hear the Saviour of
their Souls, and the Light is that Prophet, which all that hear not him, are to be cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee how groſly they pervert that Place of Scripture, <hi>Deut. 18. 15. Acts</hi> 3.
22. 7. 37. which is not to be underſtood of the common Illumination given to all
Mankind, but of the Man Chriſt, as he outwardly came in the Fleſh, and did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his prophetical Office on Earth, by preaching and teaching; and as he doth now
ſtill execute his prophetical Office in his Church, by his Word outwardly preached,
and his Spirit inwardly accompanying it to make it effectual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, p. 82. they run into the ſame wild Notion, that others, Familiſts and mad
Enthuſiaſts run into, of the Blood of Chriſt within them:</hi> For, <hi>ſay they,</hi> and all wait
together in the Light [<hi>viz.</hi> as it is common to all Mankind, Infidels, Jews, Mahumetans,
Heathens; <hi>for ſo they underſtand it</hi>] and believe in it, that ye may be the Children of
the Light, and therein watch unto Prayer, and one over another, and this will beget ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
unfeigned Love, and walk in the Light, ye will have true Vnity and Fellowſhip one
with another, and the Blood, which is the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, ye will feel cleanſing you
from all Sin, and ſo ye will come into Vnity with God.</p>
               <p>Note, By this it is evident, as will more fully appear on a particular Head follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that by the Blood, which they call the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, they meant not his
Blood outwardly ſhed, or his Life that he outwardly laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> the Life of his
Manhood without us, for the Remiſſion of our Sins, and cleanſing therefrom: But
according to their uſual Cant and Phraſe, <hi>The Blood, that is the Life, and the Life is the
Light within:</hi> So that they make the Blood, the Life, and the Light within them,
to be one and the ſame thing; but neither in this <hi>Primmer,</hi> nor in any other of their
Books, do I find the leaſt Direction to Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, as it was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſhed on the Croſs, therefore in this <hi>Primmer,</hi> and in their other Books, <hi>they
give Poiſon to poor Children, to ſuck or receive, inſtead of wholeſome Food.</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>W. P. <hi>in</hi> Serious Apology, <hi>p. 146. ſaith,</hi> That the outward Perſon which ſuffered,
was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny.</p>
            <p>This is expreſly contrary to many Texts of Scripture, and to a great Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Article of our Chriſtian Creed; yea, in a manner, it overthrows the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Creed: See the following Scriptures, <hi>Mat. 16. 13, 16. Luke 1. 32. Mat. 14.
33. Mark 1. 1. John 1. 14, 34. John 9. 35. 10. 36. Acts 8. 37. Rom. 1. 4. Mat.</hi> 27.
54.</p>
            <p>G.W. <hi>in his</hi> Truth and Inn. <hi>p. 52. excuſeth</hi> W.P'<hi>s Words thus,</hi> Here I take him to mean
the Son of God, in reſpect to his Divine Being, as he is of one Subſtance with the Father,
which his Body that ſuffered Death was not, though he was truly the Son of God, as he took
upon him that Body, and as made of a Woman: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. Being conceived by the Holy
Ghost, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fallacy of this is eaſily detected, the Queſtion in Debate betwixt <hi>W. P.</hi> and
his Opponents, who were Presbyterian Miniſters in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was not whether the
Body was the Son of God, abſtractly conſidered from the Soul of Chriſt and his
Godhead, for no Presbyterian ever held that, neither will any Socinian that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97123:24"/>
the Godhead of Chriſt ſay, that that meer Body, without his created Soul, was
the Chriſt or Son of God. But the true State of the Queſtion was and is, whether
he that outwardly ſuffered Death without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (whom <hi>W. P.</hi>
calls <hi>that outward Perſon.</hi> in Diſtinction from the Light within, which the Quakers
will have to be the whole Chriſt, according to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Doctrine) was and is not
properly the Son of God, which all ſound Chriſtians ſay, according to Scripture, he
was and is, being both God and Man, and yet one Perſon, one Chriſt, one Son of
God, having his Godhead-Nature, and his Manhood-Nature, ſo united as to
conſtitute one Chriſt, which is by a miraculous and extraordinary Union, that no
other Creatures, neither Angels or Men, are dignified with? and though Chriſt, as
Man, was the Son of God, miraculouſly conceived and born in Time, and alſo, as
God, was, by a Generation from Eternity, before all Worlds and Times, yet he
is but one Son of God, and becauſe of the perſonal Union of the Word with his
Manhood, both as God and Man he is properly the Son of God.</p>
            <p>But there is yet another Fallacy in <hi>G. W</hi>'s Words, which is, that neither the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Body, nor Manhood, that was born of the Virgin, was any Part of the true
Chriſt, or Son of God; and firſt, As to that viſible Body of Fleſh and Bones, he
denies that Chriſt conſiſted of it. <hi>I diſtinguiſh</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>between conſiſting and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
Christ had [viſible] Fleſh and Bones, but he did not conſiſt of them,</hi> Chriſtian
Quaker, p. 139, 140. This ſhews us the very Heart of their Hereſie. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">W.P's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinder, p. 299, to 307.</note>
               <hi>W. P.</hi> argues, for 16. Pages in his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> againſt <hi>Faldo, That Chriſt never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for they will not have any thing properly to be the Christ, but his Godhead,</hi> which
they make to be all one, identically and eſſentially with his Heavenly Mandhood,
conſiſting of Heavenly Fleſh and Blood, that he had from all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Here a Quaker, called <hi>John Whiting,</hi> oppoſed, in Defence of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and ſaid,
<hi>W. Penn did not deny, that that outward Perſon was the Son of God:</hi> I askt him, whoſe
Son was he properly? He ſaid, <hi>The Son of</hi> Mary: I replied; <hi>Mary</hi> was his Mother,
but who was his Father properly? He ſaid, <hi>He was conceived by the Holy Ghost:</hi> I
again replied, But that's no Anſwer to my Queſtion, who was his Father? Every
Son muſt have a Father, and ſeeing Chriſt had no immediate Father but God, then
ſurely he was properly the Son of God, as the Scripture plainly teſtifieth.</p>
            <p>To this he made no Reply, but oppoſed in Defence of <hi>G. W.</hi> I having ſaid, that
<hi>G. W.</hi> denied that viſible Body, that hung on the Croſs, to be any Part of the true
Chriſt; I replied, I have proved it already, by the late Quotation here read, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſays, <hi>He denies that Chriſt conſiſted of Fleſh and Bones; I diſtinguiſh,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
conſiſting and having, Chriſt had Fleſh and Bones, but did not conſiſt of them, as a
Man has a Coat or Garment, but doth not conſiſt of it, and that outward Perſon that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>was Chriſt by a Metonimy</hi> (ſaith <hi>VV. P.) of the thing containing,
having the Name of the thing contained:</hi> And at this rate, <hi>VV. P.</hi> himſelf may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Chriſt, becauſe he hath Chriſt in him. The Excuſe, <hi>That Chriſt did not</hi> Meerly
<hi>conſiſt of Fleſh and Bones,</hi> ſignifies nothing, for that was no Part of the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>G.VV.</hi> and his Opponent: None ever ſaid, That Chriſt did meerly conſiſt of
Fleſh, Blood, and Bones; no Socinian will ſo affirm, for that were to ſay, Chriſt
was meerly a Body of Fleſh and Bones, without a rational Soul; whatever hath
Parts, doth conſiſt of thoſe Parts, incompleatly of one or more Parts, compleatly of
them all: The Foundation of the Quakers great Error on this Head, lieth here,
That becauſe Chriſt was before the Body was; therefore that Body is no Part of
him, which is eaſily anſwered thus, Chriſt was before that Body was, but he was not


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97123:24"/>
compleatly, and in all Reſpects, fitted to be the anointed Saviour of the World, until
the Word was made Fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> until the Word did take our Fleſh and whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into a perſonal Union with himſelf, the which was neceſſary to the compleat
Performance of his Mediatory Offices, of King, Prieſt, and Prophet, and eſpecially
of his Prieſtly Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And not only</hi> G. VV. <hi>hath denyed Chriſt to have any created Body, whereof he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
but he hath denyed that he hath any created Soul, in his Anſwer to</hi> T. Danſon'<hi>s</hi>
Synopſis, <hi>p.</hi> 18. As to <hi>T. Danſon</hi>'s telling of the Son of God's Incarnation, the Creation
of his Body and Soul, the Parts of that Nature he ſubſiſted in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this I ſay, if the
Body and Soul of the Son of God were both created, doth not this render him a fourth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
For Creation was in Time, which contradicts their Doctrine of three diſtinct, incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
coeternal, coeſſential Perſons in the Deity, ſeeing that which was created, was not
ſo: But herein, whether doth not his, and their Ignorance of the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and their Denial of Chriſt's Divinity, plainly appear, yea or nay? VVhere doth the
Scripture ſay, that his Soul was created? For was not he the Brightneſs of his Father's
Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Divine Subſtance? But ſuppoſing the Soul of Christ,
was, with the Body, created in time; I ask, if from Eternity he was a Perſon diſtinct
from God and his holy Spirit, without either Soul or Body, and where doth the Scripture
ſpeak of any Perſon without either Soul or Body? T. Elwood, <hi>to cover this groſs Error of
G.VV. in his pretended Anſwer to my firſt Narrative, ſaith,</hi> That <hi>G. W.</hi> only denyed
that Chriſt had a created Soul, as God: <hi>But this was not the State of the Queſtion,
for neither</hi> T. D. <hi>nor any other Man, were ever ſo groſs as to affirm, that Chriſt as
God, had a created Soul: And the like Evaſion doth</hi> G. VV. <hi>uſe himſelf, in his</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,
<hi>p.</hi> 191. This Queſtion (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) is no Determination, that it was, or was not
Chriſt; as God, his Soul was increated; as Man, his Soul or Spirit was not the Deity,
but formed and aſſumed by the VVord: <hi>But it's Evident, that his accuſing</hi> T. D. <hi>and
others of Ignorance, for ſaying, it was created, determines it ſufficiently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as is above ſaid, G. W. and his Brethren will have only the Godhead to be
the Chriſt, which they call, <hi>The Heavenly Man,</hi> having Soul and Body, Fleſh,
Blood, and Bones, uncreated, and exiſting from all Eternity, which they call, <hi>The
Seed within them, the Seed of the Woman that bruiſeth the Serpent's Head,</hi> which G. F.
(as is above quoted) denyeth to be a Creature: <hi>What the Seed ſpoke in him,</hi> he ſaid,
<hi>he ſpoke it not as a Creature;</hi> therefore, that Heavenly Man, or Seed, conſiſting of
Heavenly Fleſh and Blood, which they ſay is in them, not being a Creature, muſt
needs, in their Senſe, be from all Eternity, and not from the Beginning of the
World only. This appears yet more fully from <hi>R. Hubberthorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When was that Christ created,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>R. Hub.</hi> Coll. p. 49, 50.</note> which you ſay, muſt, as a Creature, judge the World? And
if in <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time, who was Judge of the World till then? Was not the Perſon of Chriſt
Jeſus before the World was? [<hi>Note, here he owns Chriſt to be a Perſon; and by
G. W's Argument above mentioned, he muſt, being a Perſon, have both Soul and
Body before the World was.</hi>] And when had the Man, Chriſt Jeſus, his Beginning?
If you can declare it, how is Chriſt the only begoten Son of God, if he be a Creature? Or
how can God beget a Creature? And if the whole Perſon of Chriſt was not before the
Barthly <hi>Adam,</hi> how was the Creation made by him, or how can he be of the Nature of
fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and not Earthly and defiled, and is the Fleſh of Chriſt Heavenly or Earthly,

And though they did well diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>our Nature, as in us it is corrupt by
Sin [ſince the Fall] and as in Chriſt not corrupt and filthy;</hi> yet by no means will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this Diſtinction, nor will he allow, <hi>That it's one and the ſame Nature in the Gentiles,
by which they did the things contained in the Law, and by which they broke the Law;</hi> and
he makes the ſinful Nature and the pure Nature, to be two Natures; this agrees with
G. F's Doctrine afterwards quoted, <hi>That the Nature in us that doth the Will of God, is
Chriſt the Seed, but the Nature in us that ſinneth, is the Devil, the Serpent, the Luſt;</hi> ſo that
there is nothing in Mens Bodies, but Chriſt, or God, and the Devil, the Serpent, Sin, and

               <hi>Next let us hear</hi> E. Bur. <hi>in his</hi> Collection, <hi>p.</hi> 301. Thou ſayeſt, in that Anſwer, that
Christ aſcended to the Right Hand of the Father in your Nature. Mark now thy Nature
and your Nature, who are one with thee, is ſinful and wicked, and of the Devil, for ſo are
all Liers, and it is Blaſphemy to ſay, ſinful, wicked, devilliſh Nature, ſuch as <hi>John Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>'s
is, and his Fellows, is at the Right Hand of God in Heaven. Oh Horrible!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, he ſaith, p.</hi> 306. That Chriſt aſcended into Heaven in our Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in his
Nature, and they that are one with him, and he and they are proved to be in corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as they will confeſs it: O what Wickedneſs is it to hold forth, That Chriſt is at the
Right Hand of God in ſinful Nature, as his Words hold forth from his own Mouth.</p>
            <p>Note, His Opponent did not ſay, <hi>ſinful Nature,</hi> but <hi>our Nature:</hi> But ſeeing E. B.
makes them both one, that it cannot be our Nature that Chriſt hath in Heaven, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be ſinful Nature: This is to make Sin to be eſſential to our Nature, which is
a moſt vile and groſs Hereſie, and agrees with that above mentioned, of G.F. and
G. W. <hi>That there are but two Natures in Man's Body, the one that is divine, and of
God's Eſſence, that neither doth nor can ſin; the other of the Devil, that ſinneth and can
do no good:</hi> So there is no Soul left in Man, that is neither God nor the Devil, nor
any Part of either by theſe Mens Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what doth G. W. and his Brethren then ſay to W.</hi> Penn, <hi>in his</hi> Primitive
Chriſtianity, <hi>where he ſaith, p.</hi> 85. That we do, we bleſs God, religiouſly believe and
confeſs, to the Glory of God the Father, and the Honour of his dear and beloved Son, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ took our Nature upon him, and was like unto us in all things, Sin excepted? <hi>And
p. 87. We</hi> ſay, that he then overcame our common Enemy, foiled him in the open Field
[<hi>viz.</hi> at his Death] and in our Nature triumphed over him that had overcome and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over it, in our Forefather <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Poſterity; and that as truly as Chriſt
overcame him in our Nature in his own Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But poſſibly, ſome will ſay, W. P. by our Nature, did mean the Quakers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is not ſinful; but not the Prieſts Nature, which is ſinful. But firſt,
was not the Quakers Nature once ſinful, as really as the Nature of other Men?
And doth no Sin cleave to the Nature of any Quaker at this Day? But ſecondly,
W. P. tells us, <hi>Our Nature, which Chriſt took, was that, over which our common Enemy
had triumphed in our Forefather</hi> Adam, <hi>and his Poſterity.</hi> Now, except the Quakers
will ſay, <hi>They are none of</hi> Adam'<hi>s Poſterity,</hi> they muſt grant, that, according to
W. P. Chriſt did take, not only the Nature of the Quakers, but the Nature of
other Men, which hath been defiled by Sin, both in them and us. What ſhall we
now ſay of the great Unity that the Teachers of the Quakers boaſt of, in Doctrine
as well as in Spirit? Whereas we ſee, that what W. P. owns, as a Part of his and
his Brethrens Faith, and for which, he ſaith, <hi>They bleſs God: E. Burrough,</hi> who was


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97123:25"/>
owned as a Prophet among them and was in greater Repute and more deſerving then,
than ever W. P. was, or now is: <hi>E. B.</hi> hath paſt Sentence on it, <hi>That it is horrible
Blaſphemy:</hi> For if Chriſt took our Nature, and triumphed over the common Enemy
in our Nature, ſurely he roſe from the dead in our Nature, and aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in our Nature, which <hi>E. B.</hi> hath judged to be Blaſphemy and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Here I asked <hi>John Whiting,</hi> of which of theſe two Faiths he was, whether that
of G. W. and <hi>E. B.</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Chriſt was not in Heaven in our Nature;</hi> or that of
W. P. who ſaid, <hi>Chriſt took our Nature, and triumphed in our Nature?</hi> He replied,
<hi>He was of the Faith of both:</hi> By which Anſwer he made himſelf very ridiculous, and
obnoxious to the general Cenſure of the Auditory, who cried out againſt him, as at
ſeveral other times, many cried out at his and his Brethrens Impertinencies and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
Anſwers.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner doth W. <hi>Penn</hi> labour to excuſe and cloak his and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
vile Hereſie, <hi>That he who died at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>was not properly the Son of God,</hi> as
is ſet down at the End of <hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> recommended by G. W. And W. P.
thinks he has fairly defended himſelf,<note place="margin">Truth and Ion. p. 72.</note> by what he formerly ſaid, <hi>viz. That he that
laid down his Life, and ſuffered his Body to be crucified by the Jews, without the Gates of</hi>
Jeruſalem, <hi>is Chriſt, the only Son of the moſt High God. But to aſſert, the Body which
ſuffered and died, was properly the entire Son of God; this brings him more under the
Charge of making him but a meer Man, than us, who acknowledge him to be one with the
Father, and of a Nature eternal and immortal.</hi> But here are two Fallacies; one is,
<hi>He that laid down his Life, and ſuffered his Body to be crucified, is Chriſt, the only Son
of the moſt High God:</hi> But, by this <hi>HE,</hi> he means only the Godhead, or the Word:
This is the entire Chriſt by his Doctrine, and this <hi>HE</hi> ſuffered his Body to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified;
but how was it his Body? Not as any Part of the intire Chriſt, but only as
a Vail or Garment; that is a Man's Garment, but is no Part of him. The other
Fallacy is, that he would caſt it upon his Opponents, that they held, <hi>The Body that
ſuffered, was properly the entire Son of God, which were to make him but a meer Man.</hi> But
none of his Opponents ſaid, That that Body, without the Soul of the Manhood,
and without the Godhead of the Word, was the entire Chriſt; nor could it be ſo
much as meer Man, <hi>without a Soul, even a created Soul belonging to it.</hi>

in his People, is the Subſtance of all Figures, Types and Shadows, fulfilling them in them,
and ſetting them free from them; but as he is held forth in the Scripture Letter without
them, and in the Fleſh without them, he is their Example or Figure, which is both one,
that the ſame things must be fulfilled in them, that was in Christ Jeſus, <hi>for which he
quotes</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 21. 1 Pet. 4. 1. 1 Pet. 1. 15. Joh. 13. 15. <hi>Again, in</hi> Saul's Err.

                     <hi>p. 14. Q.</hi> Whether Chriſt in the Fleſh be a Figure or not, and if a Figure, how, and in what?
<hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt is the Subſtance of all Figures, and his Fleſh is a Figure, for every one paſſeth
through the ſame way as he did, who comes to know Chriſt in the Fleſh; there muſt be a
ſuffering with him, before there be a rejoycing with him: Chriſt is an Example for all to
walk after, and if thou kneweſt what an Example is, thou wouldſt know what a Figure is,
To come up to the ſame Fulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Note, Had <hi>R. Hubb.</hi> and <hi>G.F.</hi> taught, That Chriſt is our Example, and if by
Example, they only meant to be our Example, to follow him in the Virtues of
Love, Humility, Self-denial, Patience, Reſignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none would have blamed
them, but what they talk of his being ſuch an Example, is but mainly to hide their
vile Hereſie: <hi>For firſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>G.F. Chriſt is an Example for all to walk after,</hi> to come
up to the ſame Fulneſs: No ſound Chriſtian ever taught ſo, for the Apoſtles never
taught, That they, or any other were, by following Chriſt's Example, <hi>to come up to
the ſame Fulneſs;</hi> but ſtill ſpoke of the Meaſure, as with reſpect to all others. To
come up to the ſame Fulneſs, is to come to be as much Chriſt as he was; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>VV. Penn,</hi> ſee his Preface to <hi>R.B's Collection,</hi> the Paſſage quoted in my
third Narrative, p. 10. atteſted, <hi>&amp;c. The VVork of Regeneration is a greater Myſtery,
than God manifeſt in the Fleſh without us:</hi> And ſaith <hi>G.F. Chriſt, in his People, is the
Subſtance of all Figures, Types, and Shadows, fulfilling them in them; and his Fleſh is a
Figure.</hi> Now, that by <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> they meant, not only or indeed ſo much,
that he is our Example in holy living and walking, which none ever found fault
with, of any called Chriſtians; but that, as he was outwardly born, was crucified,
had his Blood ſhed, was buried, roſe and aſcended; ſo he is inwardly born, and
has been crucified in the Quakers, and all other Saints, buried, riſen, and aſcended,
and is King, Prieſt, and Prophet in them; and <hi>G.VV's Light and Life,</hi> p. 44.
<hi>Chriſt in them offers up himſelf in the Nature of a mediating Sacrifice, to appeaſe the
VVrath of God; That not the outward Blood, that was outwardly ſhed, is the Blood of God,
by which he purchaſed his Church, but God being a Spirit, his Blood, his inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi>
as <hi>G.VV.</hi> hath expreſly affirmed in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 44. And <hi>VV. P.</hi> in
his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> to <hi>I. Faldo,</hi> p. 336, 337. comparing Chriſt his dying as a Malefactor,
by his Death to reconcile us to God, to what was to be accompliſhed in Man, ſaith,
<hi>'Tis ſtrange that ſhould be reputed moſt miſterious, which was the Introduction to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
and thoſe Tranſactions counted moſt difficult, that were, by the divine VViſdom of
God, ordained, as ſo many facile Repreſentations of what was to be accompliſhed in
Man,</hi> &amp;c. And a little before, comparing the outward with the inward, in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>The Hiſtory is made the greateſt Miſtery,</hi> which he blames in <hi>I.
Faldo,</hi> for making Chriſt without us, a greater Miſtery than Chriſt within us; ſo
that whether by Figure or Example, the Quakers mean the ſame thing, it is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offenſive, that Chriſt without us, and what he did and ſuffered without us,
is ſuch an Example, as is to be wrought and accompliſhed in us by a greater Miſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſo that the Work, or the thing wrought and effected, is greater and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
t;han the Example according to which it is wrought; as the building ſome great
Fabrick, the Example, Type, or Figure, according to which it is built, is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of Wood or Paſt-board, in a ſmall Model; whereas the Fabrick is great, and
conſiſting of rich and very precious Materials: Thus they magnifie the Fleſh and
Blood of Chriſt within them, above his Death and Sacrifice without them, and well
they may, if Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood with in them be unerected and from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that Chriſt's material Blood on the Croſs, was the Type of Chriſt's inward


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97123:26"/>
ward and ſpiritual Blood he had from all Eternity; for the Word, <hi>Example,</hi> in this
caſe, is fully as offenſive as Figure, and can ſignifie no other than Figure; for if
there be any ſuch inward and ſpiritual Blood of Chriſt, and Fleſh that he had from
all Eternity, and if the material Blood be the Example of it, and Chriſt's material
Fleſh the Example of that Heavenly increated Fleſh: It muſt needs be granted, that
the thing exemplified, is greater than the Example of it, in the caſe, and the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that Heavenly Blood which Chriſt had from all Eternity, and which was
ſhed in <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinned, is more excellent than the ſhedding of that material
Blood which is but its Figure, according to them.</p>
                  <p>But now let us hear how <hi>G.VV.</hi> firſt defends himſelf, and next <hi>VV. P.</hi> in his <hi>Truth
and Inn.</hi> p. 53. He gives a lame Quotation, objected againſt him, out of his <hi>Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Quakers: Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh was but a Figure,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Figure or
Type of the inward Chriſt, or Light within:</hi> Here is a lame Quotation, which at full is
thus, <hi>Truth defend.</hi> p. 21.</p>
                  <p>Did <hi>R. Hubberth.</hi> well in writing, That Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh was but a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Could Chriſt have been ſaid to have been transfigured, if his coming in the Fleſh
had not been a Figure or Example, <hi>till his Glory was revealed?</hi> And haſt thou not read,
That he was the expreſs Figure of his Father's Subſtance, inſtead of which, it is tranſlated,
he is the expreſs Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, This Quotation was objected in a late printed Sheer, called <hi>An Account
from</hi> Colcheſter: And a pretended Anſwer was given to it in another printed Paper,
ſigned by ſeven Quakers of <hi>Colcheſter:</hi> And the like Anſwer is given by <hi>G.VV.</hi> in
his <hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> p. 53. <hi>They abuſe me ſtill in this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was none of my
Aſſertion,</hi> That Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, was but a Figure: <hi>I poſitively diſown
theſe Words, as a downright Forgery put upon me. Anſ.</hi> How can he in Conſcience
diſown theſe Words, and charge them to be a downright Forgery put upon him,
when in his Anſwer to that Charge againſt <hi>R. Hubb.</hi> he finds no Fault with the
Phraſe, <hi>But a Figure,</hi> but brings two Places of Scripture to juſtifie it, which are
moſt ignorantly and impertinently brought to prove it? Why did he not then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
againſt the Word, <hi>But a Figure?</hi> But inſtead of excepting againſt it, he brings
two Scriptures to prove the Aſſertion alledged againſt <hi>R. Hubb.</hi> the one is, That
Chriſt was ſaid to have been <hi>transfigured;</hi> which, becauſe it ſounded in Engliſh like
his being made a <hi>Figure,</hi> therefore, in his great Ignorance of the Word <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
as well as of the Senſe intended, he thought it was a good Proof, that Chriſt,
as he came in the Fleſh, was <hi>but a Figure;</hi> but <hi>transfigured</hi> there ſignifies nothing
other but transformed; the Greek Word has no Relation, either to Figure or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> Metamorphoſed, a Word ſome uſe in Engliſh;
and what that Transfiguration was, <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 2. that <hi>His Face did
ſhine as the Sun, and his Raiment was white as the Light:</hi> Now what Relation has
this, either to <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> in that Senſe for which G.W. brought it to prove
<hi>R. Hubb's</hi> Saying, Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, was <hi>but a Figure?</hi> Of what was
Chriſt's Transfiguration a Figure? Or how was it our Example to follow? But
that G.W. meant not an Example of Imitation, but a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> that was to <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
or be laid aſide, is evident from his own Words; <q>Could Chriſt have been ſaid
to have been transfigured, if his coming in the Fleſh had not been a Figure or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>till his Glory was revealed?</hi>
                     </q> Thus we ſee how long G.W. thought that
Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh was to continue a Figure, viz. <hi>until his Glory ſhould be


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97123:27"/>
revealed;</hi> to wir, by his inward coming into the Hearts of the Diſciples, which was
the Subſtance of that Figure; for thus G.W. and his Brethren argue for the Diſuſe
of outward Baptiſm and the Supper; they were but Figures of the inward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and were to continue but until that was revealed; ſo here Chriſt's coming
in the Fleſh, was but a Figure till his Glory was revealed: So whether G.W. makes
it Figure or Example, he tells us how long it was to be our Figure or Example, <hi>till
his Glory was revealed.</hi> But taking Example, for an Example that we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
in all holy living and walking, we ſhall find the Scriptures ſet him forth for
our Example after his Glory was revealed, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 21. Becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered
for us, leaving us an Example, that ye ſhould follow his Steps:</hi> this was after his Glory
was revealed in and among the Believers.</p>
                  <p>And as the Quakers Reaſon why they caſt off outward Baptiſm and the Supper is,
becauſe the Subſtance is revealed in them, whereof they were Figures; ſo for the
ſame reaſon, they think Chriſt's Death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not to be minded nor preached,
becauſe it was a Figure, <hi>Chriſt in his People is the Subſtance of all Figures: And his
Fleſh is a Figure:</hi> Here Figure in both Places hath the ſame Signification: He doth
not ſay, Chriſt <hi>without</hi> his People, but Chriſt <hi>in</hi> his People is the <hi>Subſtance of all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</hi>
And as a Proof of this, a Quotation was brought againſt the Quakers out of
one of their ancient Books, called, <hi>The Doctrine of Perfection vindicated; So when you
come to know this</hi> [to wit, the Operation of Chriſt, or the Light within] <hi>you will
ceaſe remembring his Death at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and will come to ſee how he hath been crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in you, and what it is that hath crucified him.</hi> Thus we ſee, how, according to
him, Chriſt's Death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being but a Figure of Chriſt crucified within the
Subſtance; the Uſe and Remembrance of it ceaſeth. Is not this horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?
Why have they not all this time retracted this?</p>

                  <p>But let us ſee, how that other Place of Scripture, brought by G.W. to prove
<hi>R.H.</hi> his Aſſertion, That <hi>Christs coming in the Fleſh is but a Figure,</hi> will clear him,
or rather indeed render him guilty of the ſame Error with <hi>R.H.</hi> the Place is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
quoted by G.W. to prove, That Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Figure or Example for us to follow, as he would have us to underſtand him;
That by Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, his being a Figure, that is, an Example of our
lmitation, <hi>Truth and Inn.</hi> p. 24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Chriſt is there called, <hi>The Brigthneſs

that he is the <hi>expreſs Figure;</hi> inſtead of which, he ſaith, it is tranſlated, <hi>expreſs

thing to come, ſometimes it denotes a preſent Example, and that either of Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or of Warning and Caution: But how can he make it appear, That by the
Deſcription given of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. his being the expreſs Image of his (<hi>viz.</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's)
Perſon, that Chriſt is there ſet forth to be our Example, either for Imitation

and <hi>C.VV.</hi> was but idle, to render it Figure, to quadrate with <hi>R. H</hi>'s Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to make the ignorant think he could mend the Tranſlation, but his
now turning it to Example, makes it Blaſphemy, as to ſay, The Son is an Example
of Imitation or Caution for the Father to follow; it had been more agreeable to
have ſaid, The Father is an Example of the Son, for the Son to follow, than to ſay,
The Son is an Example for the Father to follow, ſeeing Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I can do nothing
of my ſelf, for what I ſee the Father do, that do I.</hi> But to give an Inſtance what an
Ambidexter G.W. is, in twiſting and twining and bending the Scripture. In his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi>
p. 191. he ſaith, That <hi>He ſpoke for Chriſt's Divinity,</hi> as he was the Brightneſs
of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his divine Subſtance, <hi>in Anſwer to</hi>
T. Danſon. Here he forſaketh his former Tranſlation, which was <hi>Figure,</hi> and
taketh the Tranſlation in our Engliſh Bible, which is <hi>Image.</hi> But how will this
prove the Divinity of Chriſt, ſo as to be one Subſtance with the Father, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Image ſignifie our <hi>Example of Imitation,</hi> as G.W. doth argue in his <hi>Truth and
Innocency?</hi> His being an Example of our Imitation, is no ſufficient Argument to
prove his being one Subſtance with the Father; for the Socinians will grant him to
be a very excellent Example of our Imitation, yet this is no ſufficient Argument to
convince them, That he is one Subſtance with the Father, from his being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Imitation. Is it not plain, from all this ſhuffling and ſhifting, that G.W.
rather than he will confeſs his former Errors, will wrong his own Conſcience, and
bring the moſt nonſenſical Excuſes that ever were heard of, to defend his Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than give Glory to God by a plain and free Confeſſion of his Errors?</p>
                  <p>Next let us hear G.W's Defence of that Saying of W.P's; <hi>One outward thing
cannot be the proper Figure or Repreſentation of another; the outward Lamb ſhews forth
the inward Lamb.</hi> He labours to vindicate W.P's Saying, by thus arguing, <hi>How
will theſe Men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>prove that the outward Paſchal Lamb was the proper Figure or
Repreſentation of Chriſt's outward Perſon? Pray what proper Reſemblance had they?
Was not rather the Lamb, in reſpect of its Innocency, a proper Figure of Chriſt's Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as the Lamb of God once offered for Sin?</hi> I anſwer, And was not the Lamb's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
an outward thing, <hi>i.e.</hi> without Men, and alſo Chriſt's Innocency, as he lived
and walked among Men, and was not his outward Perſon innocent? But had not
G.W. been extreamly blind and ignorant, he had never argued nor asked ſo fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what proper Reſemblance had they, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſchal Lamb, and Chriſt's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Perſon; for the Generality of Chriſtians know, that as by God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Paſchal Lamb and Sacrifices, were proper Types and Figures of Chriſt's
outward Perſon, as he was to be ſlain for the Sins of the World; ſo the Reſemblance
was not only in Innocency, but in many other Reſpects; the Lamb was to be killed,
ſo was Chriſt; the Lamb was to be without Blemiſh, ſo was Chriſt; the Lamb was
to be of the Flock, ſo was Chriſt to be of his Brethren; the Blood of the Lamb,
ſprinkled on the Door-poſts and Lintels of the Iſraelites, ſaved them from the Wrath
of the deſtroying Angel, ſo the Blood of Chriſt, that was outwardly ſhed, applyed
by Faith, ſaveth true Believers from Wrath; the Lamb was to be eaten wholly, ſo
we are to receive Chriſt wholly, in all his Offices: Theſe and many other Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
there are betwixt the Paſchal Lamb and Chriſt, known in general to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
yea, to many Children, which yet G.W. here declares himſelf to ſeem whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of. <hi>Godwin,</hi> in his Book called <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> numbers at leaſt
twelve Particulars of Reſemblance, betwixt the Paſchal Lamb and Chriſt without


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97123:28"/>
us, and yet this G.W. more like a Heathen than a Chriſtian, queries, <hi>Pray what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Reſemblance had they?</hi> But to return his Queſtion, <hi>Pray what proper Reſemblance
had the Paſchal Lamb to the inward Blood Chriſt, which,</hi> G.W. ſaith, <hi>is the Life and
Light and Spirit of God within, and the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Was ever the Holy Ghoſt, or the
Godhead ſlain in Men? Or is there an inward ſpiritual Blood of Chriſt ſlain in Men,
that is not the Godhead? But we ſhall come anon to treat more fully of this: And
how is that fulfilled in Chriſt within, A Bone of him ſhall not be broken?</p>

would be ſo far from directing Men to go to the material Temple, that they make it but
a vain thing to look to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to the Antitype of that Temple,</hi> viz. <hi>to Jeſus, as he was
there crucified, or to that</hi> Blood <hi>that was there ſhed for Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Anſwer is,</hi> The Quakers ſee no need of directing Men to the Type for the Antitype;
<hi>viz.</hi> neither to the outward Temple, nor yet to <hi>Jeruſalem, either to Jeſus Chriſt or his
Blood,</hi> knowing that neither the Righteouſneſs of Faith, nor the Word of it, does ſo direct,
<hi>Rom</hi> 10. And is it the Baptists Doctrine to direct Men to the material Temple and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
the Type for the Antitype? What Nonſenſe and Darkneſs is this? And where
do the Scriptures ſay, That the <hi>Blood</hi> was there ſhed for Juſtification, and that Men must
be directed to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereas that Blood ſhed, is not in being? <hi>p.</hi> 40. But the true
Apoſtles directed them to the Light, which was ſo much oppoſed by the Baptists, to walk in
the Light, for the Blood of Christ to cleanſe them from all Sin.</p>
                  <p>Now let us hear his Defence, <hi>Truth and Inn.</hi> p. 54. <hi>I ask theſe Men</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>where the Scripture doth ſo direct Men to go to the outward Temple at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for Jeſus
Christ? Nay, doth it not contrarywiſe direct them? See plain Scripture,</hi> Deut. 30. 12,
13, 14. Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. The ſame Anſwer in effect, but in more Words, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at full length, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 12, 13, 14. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. we find in that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Some Account from</hi> Colcheſter, ſigned by ſeven Quakers there (but likely
enough to have been drawn up by <hi>G.W.</hi> himſelf, though whether it was or not, is
not material to the caſe) and on the Margin they ſay, <hi>Must they then go on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, This is a moſt ſhameful Evaſion to cloak their vile Hereſie, of which, yet
to this very Day, G. W. hath not plainly cleared himſelf, nor ever can, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
this and his many other Errors. Can it be ſuppoſed, that W. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who
was the Baptiſt that thus objected againſt the Quakers, was for having the Quakers
or any others, go on Pilgrimage, or on Feet to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt or his
Blood? G.W. knoweth, in his Conſcience, the contrary; yea, in the Lines imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
going before the Quotation, W. <hi>Burnet</hi> clears the matter, That he was not
for having People go on Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> either for Chriſt or to Chriſt.
W. <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his <hi>Capital Principles,</hi> p. 24. Iſrael <hi>of old</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>were commanded
to go up to the literal Temple at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to worſhip, but now God's Worſhippers may
worſhip him, each one in his Reſpective Place.</hi> Yea, G.W. in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi>


                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:97123:28"/>
takes that to be W. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Senſe, That Chriſt was to be ſought and found at ſuch a
Diſtance by Faith, and yet he ſtill objects againſt Chriſt ſought at a Diſtance
without us, even by Faith, as in Heaven above the Clouds, or as he ſuffered at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:
I ask</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the</hi> Object <hi>or Foundation of the Faith he divided from the</hi>
Faith? From which reaſoning, it is evident he is againſt Chriſt, as without us, as at
a diſtance, either as he ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or as he is now in Heaven, to be the
Object of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>And whereas, in that called <hi>Some Account from</hi> Colcheſter, they quote <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
6, 7, 8. and ſet down the Words at full Length, why do they not quote and ſet down
the Words in p. 9, 10. <hi>That if thou ſhall confeſs with thy Mouth, the Lord Jeſus, and
believe in thine Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
By all the things that have been objected againſt G.W. to move him to give ſome
confeſſion of his Faith in the Man Chriſt, as he ſuffered and roſe again without us,
and is now in Heaven without us, in that very created Nature of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Man he had on Earth, as in Union with the eternal Word, and that as ſuch,
he is the great Object of our Faith, for Remiſſion of Sin, yet he cannot be drawn
to it, which ſtill ſhews he remains in his vile Antichriſtian Doctrine. As to his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Confeſſion to Chriſt without, in his Supplement to the Switch, we ſhall ſee ere
long in its Place.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>Truth and Inn.</hi> p. 54. he ſeeks to excuſe <hi>W.P</hi>'s Saying, in his <hi>Quakeriſm a
new Nick-name,</hi> p. 6. <hi>Faith in Christ's outward Manifeſtation, has been a deadly Poiſon
theſe later Ages has been infected with. G.W</hi>'s Defence is, <hi>'Tis making Faith in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
thereof, that is in Oppoſition to his Power and Work in the Soul, and to Godly living,</hi>
as is evident in the Place quoted. But did <hi>I. Faldo, W.P</hi>'s Opponent, make Faith
in Chriſt's outward Manifeſtation, in Oppoſition to his Power and Work in the Soul?
Nay ſurely; nor did any other of their Opponents teach ſuch Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But this is the common way of G.W. and his Brethren, to cloak their own vile Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
they will miſrepreſent their Opponents Principles: It's ſufficiently evident,
from G.W's Doctrine, that he has all along oppoſed Faith in Chriſt's outward Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,
as neceſſary to Salvation, and it will yet further appear.</p>
                  <p>Again, he excuſes <hi>W.P</hi>'s Saying, <hi>Truth and Inn.</hi> p. 55. <hi>And ſince they believe that
outward Appearance</hi> [i.e. <hi>of Jeſus at</hi> Jeruſalem] <hi>they need not preach what is to be
main;</hi> by telling us, he means, <hi>They need not always preach it where it is believed;</hi>
and comeſſeth all true Quakers own that viſible Appearance of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Note, this is an evidenly apparent Strain, W.P's Reaſon why the Quakers
need not preach Chriſt's outward Appearance, as he ſuffered Death was, that it was
not to be again, which makes it unneceſſary to be preached. But this Liberty of
G.W. and <hi>I. Weyeth,</hi> and others, of adding and taking away material Words, is ſo
intolerable, where the plain Senſe will bear no ſuch Addition, nor taking away,
that at this rate nothing ſo falſe, but ſhall be made to ſeem true.</p>
                  <p>But why need they not always to preach it? Suppoſe the Quakers believe it, do
not they preach always the Light within, and do not the Quakers generally believe
it, and divers other Principles they proſeſs? How ſhall their Children have the
Faith of it without preaching? Doth the Light within ſo reach it, that they have it
without preaching? But how do they believe it? Only hiſtoſtically: It is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Article of their Faith to be preached or believed to Salvation, the Light within
is ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97123:29"/>
The like Fallacy and Sophiſtry he uſeth to excuſe <hi>W. Shewen</hi>'s Saying, <hi>Not to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
the Son of</hi> Abraham, David, <hi>and</hi> Mary, <hi>but to God the Father, all Worſhip, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory is to be given.</hi> But to hide his Fallacy, he gives a lame Quotation.
The Words being, <hi>Not to Jeſus, the Son of</hi> Abraham, David, <hi>and</hi> Mary, <hi>nor to Saint
nor Angel, but to God the Father.</hi> he ſaith, he knows his Intent was, <hi>Not to Jeſus</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>as the Son of</hi> Abraham: But then if the Word <hi>Only</hi> muſt be added, as explanatory
to one Part of the Sentence, it muſt be added to the other Part of the ſame Sentence
and ſo it will run thus, Not to Jeſus the Son of <hi>Abraham, David, Mary,</hi> nor to Saint
and Angel <hi>only,</hi> but to God the Father all Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not this a fair Excuſe,
by which, to cover their vile Hereſie, they will run into Popiſh Idolatry, they are
not to give Worſhip to Saints and Angels only, but to God.</p>
                  <p>Note, G.W. writes this contrary to what he knoweth in his Conſcience to be
true, for he was preſent at that Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> 1678. where <hi>W.S.</hi> and others
blamed me for praying to Jeſus Chriſt, in the Paſſage above quoted in my Book,
called <hi>The Way cast up,</hi> &amp;c. Beſide, it was no Part of the Controverſie betwixt the
Quakers and the Church of <hi>England</hi> or Diſſenters, That Chriſt was to be prayed to
only as the Son of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is <hi>G.W.</hi> now in good earneſt, in thus excuſing <hi>W.S.?</hi> Is he for giving divine
Worſhip to Jeſus the Son of <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> in any reſpect, ſeeing he
hath denied that the true Jeſus did conſiſt of a Body of Fleſh and Bone, or that he
hath a created Soul and Body, as above quoted.</p>
                  <p>But let us once more hear how he excuſeth that Paſſage of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> his <hi>Addreſs to
Proteſtants,</hi> p. 119. <q>Let us but ſoberly conſider what Chriſt is, and we ſhall the
better know whether moral Men are to be reckoned Chriſtians; what is Chriſt
but Meekneſs, Juſtice, Mercy, Patience, Charity, and Virtue in Perfection?</q>
                     <hi>G.W.</hi> ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>W.P.</hi> did not deſign thereby to leſſen the Power or Dignity of Chriſt,
who is the Author of theſe Virtues, no more than the Apoſtles did in ſaying, He
(Chriſt) is made of God unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
(ſpoken in the Abſtract) and the Prophet ſaying, God is my Light and
my Salvation, though God and Chriſt alſo be the Author of Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is alſo a ſophiſtical Evaſion; when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Christ was made of God unto us,

                     </gap> but <hi>Paul</hi> did really
mean Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who is both God and Man, the Word made Fleſh, as is
clear from the foregoing Words, even Chriſt crucified, as being the Author of thoſe
Graces, Bleſſings, and Virtues, unto all ſincere Believers in him, by beſtowing on
them his holy Spirit, to indue them with Wiſdom and Sanctification, and freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
his Righteouſneſs that he wrought in his own Perſon without them, for their
Juſtification and Redemption: Alſo <hi>David,</hi> in calling the Lord his Light and Salvation,
had a Reſpect to God in Chriſt, even the Man Chriſt, who was to come out of his
Loins, as the Object of his Faith for Redemption and Salvation. But the whole
Tendency of <hi>W.P</hi>'s Diſcourſe in that Paſſage, and in other Paſſages, going before
and following, is to perſwade that Men are Chriſtians, if they have theſe moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
without Faith in Chriſt, as he was outwardly crucified; for, in the Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe Virtues, he has not the leaſt Word of Faith in Chriſt crucified, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Chriſtianity, but pleads for a falſe Notion of the Chriſtian Faith, p. 118.

                  <p>But now let us ſee how the following ſcandalous Paſſages, quoted out of <hi>G.VV</hi>'s
own Books, are defended by the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Quakers, in that they call <hi>Some Account
from</hi> Colcheſter.</p>
                  <p>Some Account from <hi>Colcheſter, p. 11. When you tell us you have Faith in Chriſt,
do you mean Chriſt, whoſe Perſon is now aſcended into Heaven above the Clouds,
or do you mean only a Chriſt within you? Anſ. (ſaith G.VV.</hi>) Here thou would make
two Chriſts, a Chriſt whoſe Perſon is above the Clouds, and a Chriſt within; but how
proveſt thou two ſuch Chriſts? VVe have Faith in that Chriſt that deſcended from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who is the ſame that aſcended far above all Heavens; and this Chriſt we witneſs in
us, who is not divided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note, in their Vindication of this Paſſage they ſay,</hi> This Anſwer appears pertinent
to detect and reprehend an impertinent and fooliſh Queſtion, which, whether it does not
imply two Chriſts, let the ſerious judge, from the natural Import and Senſe of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the disjunctive Part of it; or do you only mean a Chriſt within you? <hi>Here their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Grammatical Skill of the Term</hi> disjunctive, <hi>fails them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ask the Queſtion disjunctively, implies no more two Chriſts, than it implies
two <hi>George VVhiteheads,</hi> to ask, Is <hi>George VVhitehead</hi> a Londoner born, or a North
Country Man, born in the North of <hi>England;</hi> this doth not imply two <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads:</hi>
But if one ſhould ſay, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> was born, in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſome 64 Years ago, and ſince that, was born in <hi>London;</hi> this would import
two G. <hi>Whiteheads</hi> very plainly: And no leſs indeed do the Quakers wild Notions
that many of them have printed, even the Men of great Note among them, import
not only two Chriſts, but many Chriſts, even thouſands; and they have no way to
extricate themſelves of this Difficulty, but ſophiſtical Evaſions; for if ye ask them,
Was that the true Chriſt who was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of a Virgin called <hi>Mary,</hi>
above 1600 Years ago, and do they believe in that Chriſt? They will tell you yea;
but they have this ſophiſtical Senſe, that he was the Light within, that Perſon that
was outwardly born, who is by a Metonimy called Chriſt, the thing containing,
for the thing contained: See W. <hi>Penn's Rejoinder,</hi> p. 304, 305. <hi>But that that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Perſon was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny,</hi> ſaid W.P. as above quoted:
But the moſt true and proper Chriſt, is the Chriſt born in them, and growing up in
them from a holy thing or Seed, to a Child born, and then to the Mighty God;

a metaphorical Expreſſion, and allegory, even as the Image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> on Gold or
Silver, is called <hi>Caeſar;</hi> ſo the true lively Image of Chriſt, is called Chriſt, in true
Believers, and that is the meaning of Chriſt formed in Believers, ſo that if they

contrary they do, ſo as to make the Chriſt thus born within, the greater Reality

<hi>Reply,</hi> Here you are ſeen to be ignorant of the Seed of God, and Enemies to it in his
People, which Seed is Chriſt, and where-ever he is known in ſuch a low Meaſure as a Seed
that ſuffers, and is burdened in Man by Corruption, there he deſires to be free from the
Burden of Sin, and always to do his Father's Will; and <hi>this Seed</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> reaches to
<hi>where it is begotten,</hi> and in the Power it ariſes in them that believe in the Light for their

in them, who firſt is known as one without Form or Comelineſs, and ſo the Seed of God
ſuffers in ſome, and in others it reigns, and is known to be Prince of Peace: And this is no
Miſtery of Deceit (as you ſay) but a Miſtery that hath diſcovered your Deceit, who know
not the Seed of the Kingdom, nor the Power wherein it riſes: And have you never known
what Chriſt is without the Camp? But before you, who are Neglecters of Chriſt, and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of his Truth, can know the Seed of God, and what it is in you, you must come to the
Light which condemns you for your Deceits and Lies, with which you have abuſed the Truth,
and then learn to know what and where the Grave is which Chriſt hath made with the
wicked. <hi>Comformable to this</hi> R. Hub. <hi>ſaid in</hi> He-goats Horn broken, <hi>p.</hi> 62. Christ the
Seed made his Grave in the wicked, and in the rich in his Death, and out of that Grave,

                  <p>Note, Thus by <hi>G.W.</hi> and <hi>R.H.</hi> we have an Account of Chriſt a Seed, buried
in the wicked, ſuffering without the Camp, deſiring to be freed from Sin, and to do
the Will of the Father, ſuffering in ſome, but reigning in others, begotten and born
in them, raiſed in them, the which Seed is reached to by the Power which taketh
hold of it, even the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and thus the chief Prophecies in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
concerning Chriſt's Birth of the Virgin, his Death, Burial, Reſurrection;
<hi>G.W.</hi> hath applied to the Birth of the Seed within, and which he ſaith, ſuffers in
ſome, and reigns in others, and ſo is neither begotten nor born in ſome, but is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                     <hi>In E. B's Works, p. 29. a Queſtion being propoſed to the Quakers by</hi> Philip Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<hi>Whether was the Word made Fleſh, or the Son of God made of a Woman,
more or oftner than once? After ſome Railing going before, he thus anſwers;</hi> Thou
doſt not know, nor canſt not witneſs the Word to be made Fleſh once, but art one of the
Antichriſts and Deceivers which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, that are entred into the World, which
cannot confeſs Jeſus Chriſt come in the Fleſh, and therefore thou querieſt whether the Word
was made Fleſh any more or oftner than once? Which Query comes from thy dark polluted
Mind, who is out of the Light. <hi>And p.</hi> 30. And when thou canſt witneſs the Word to be
made Fleſh once, then thou wilt know whether the Son of God was made of a Woman, any
more or oftner than once: But thou art the Dragon that would devour the Man-child
which the Woman has brought forth, who ſhall rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron.</p>
                  <p>Note, ſome Expoſitors on the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> have, by the Woman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Church, and by the Man-child, the Life of Chriſt, or Chriſt formed in
true Belidvers, by way of Allegory and Metaphor only, as is above noted; but
they never underſtood, that Chriſt, ſtrictly ſpeaking, without-all Allegory or Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
was ever begotten or born in time but once, or was ever made of a Woman
but once, <hi>viz.</hi> when he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt in the Womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and born of her: But the chief Teachers among the Quakers, ſuch as <hi>G. F.
G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi> hath made Chriſt's Birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and his
Death, and Sufferings, and Blood ſhed without them, the Type, and Allegory, and
Chriſt born within, crucified within them, riſen and aſcended within them, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity

Chriſt, though for a Time and Times, the Enmity of the wicked one was ſtrong againſt me
within and without, ſeeking to devour that Seed, which, thro' the Word of the Lord, was
begotten in me. And the Miſteries of God and his Kingdom was revealed in me, who
brought me out of Darkneſs through the Wilderneſs where the Man-child was preſerved,
<hi>for a Time and Times, and half a Time,</hi> from the Wrath of the Dragon who would have
ſlain the Man-child: But now is he ariſen in his Power and Zeal, and the Prince of the

Note, This I find was generally their manner of preaching and writing, both at
their firſt Appearance and long after, to tell People that Chriſt was begotten in them,
born in them, crucified, dead and buried, riſen and aſcended into Heaven within
them; and that every one, in order to eternal Salvation, muſt know Chriſt thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
and born in them, crucified, dead, buried, riſen and aſcended; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Conception and Birth of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they made the greateſt Miſtery and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity,
whereof Chriſt, as born without in the Fleſh, was the Figure, <hi>and a facile Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation</hi>
(to uſe <hi>W. P</hi>'s Phraſe in the caſe) <hi>of what is to be tranſacted in us,</hi> thus
they did repreſent the <hi>inward Work of Regeneration to be a greater Miſtery than God
manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> viz. <hi>in that Body of Fleſh that was born at</hi> Bethlehem, as <hi>W. P.</hi>
hath expreſly affirmed, as is above quoted: And by this high ſublime Doctrine,
which they gave forth to be given them by immediate Revelation from Heaven
(though it was no other but what <hi>G. F.</hi> had from ſome old Ranters and Familiſts;
who had it long before him.) They did mightily magnifie themſelves above all
others, and cried out againſt all others, as dark ignorant Sots, Deceivers and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts,
who denied Chriſt come in the Fleſh, becauſe they did not receive this wild
Notion they had got from Ranters and Familiſts, That Chriſt was born, crucified,
dead, buried, riſen and aſcended in them; and though while I was with them, I
was not altogether ignorant that they had ſuch Phraſes and Methods of Speech as I
had read in ſome of their Books, yet I thought they underſtood it only by way of
Allegory and Metaphor, as <hi>Origen, Auguſtine,</hi> &amp;c. Some others of the Fathers, both
Greek and Latine, uſed the like allegorical Phraſes, and which I my ſelf have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed in ſome of my former Books, only by way of Allegory and Metaphor: But I
appeal to all, who ſhall but impartially conſider what I have above quoted out of
their Books, whether they will not judge and ſay, that theſe Teachers of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
whoſe Words I have quoted, plainly import quite another thing than an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical
Birth, Crucifixion and Reſurrection of Chriſt in them, even that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
without an Allegory, Metaphor, or Figure; for as <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid, in <hi>Saul's Errand,
Chriſt's Fleſh is a Figure, and Chriſt in his People is the Subſtance of all Figures;</hi> and
conſequently of that Figure alſo. Beſides, if they meant it only by way of Allegory
and Metaphor, why did they cry out againſt all others as Antichriſts, Deceivers,
blind and dark Sots, who did not receive this their Notion, but oppoſed it as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian?
But if they had plainly told, that they meant it not otherwiſe but by
way of Allegory and Metaphor, I know none that would have oppoſed them in that
caſe. But as in ſome other things, after the Quakers have made a great Compaſs,
and yet return to ſay the ſame with others, from whom they differed ſo in this very
thing, after all that <hi>G.W.</hi> as much as any, had formerly contended for Chriſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and both within, ſuffering within, his Blood ſhed within, being a Sacrifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Men, to appeaſe the Wrath of God, and giving much more to Chriſt thus born
within, ſuffering within, his Blood ſhed within, than to Chriſt born without, this
Blood ſhed without, being a Type of his Blood ſhed within: Yet in his <hi>Judgment
fixed,</hi> printed 1682. which was 26. Years after his <hi>Jacob found in a deſert Land,</hi>
printed 1656. above quoted, he turns all that he had formerly writ and contended
for, (Chriſt born within, ſuffering within, deſiring to be freed from Sin) into an
Elegancy of Speech, the Property and Effect being put for the Cauſe [which is no
more, nor other than what all Chriſtian Teachers and Expoſitors affirm:] For this
hear what he ſaith in anſwer to his Opponent, <hi>Jeffery Bullock,</hi> who charged the
Quakers with falſe Doctrine, in ſaying, That God's Appearance is to his Son Jeſus Christs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which Doctrine,</hi> ſaid <hi>J. B. I do deny.</hi> To this, <hi>G.W.</hi> after ſome foregoing Words,
anſwereth, in his <hi>Judgment fixed,</hi> p. 330. <hi>This innocent Birth, which God by his Spirit
brings forth in the Sons and Daughters of Men, who truly believe, relate to them and their
Souls, as begotten and born of the immortal Seed by the living Word, ſo that, this Birth is
not Christ Jeſus</hi> [What ſay the Quaker Zealots to this flat Denial of his own and
his Brethrens former Doctrine, and yet this without any Change in him, he is the
ſame infallible <hi>G. W.</hi> ſtill] <hi>for he is that incorruptible Seed and Word of Life, which
begets Forms, and brings forth the Soul of Man into his own Nature and Image, and ſo he
renews his own Image in Man that believes in his Power, and ſo Christ may be ſaid to be
formed in us,</hi> as in a miſterious and elegant way of ſpeaking, <hi>the Property and Effect
being put for the Cauſe; for Christ, in himſelf, hath all Power in Heaven an Earth given
to him, and it hath pleaſed the Father, that all Fullneſs ſhould dwell in him.</hi>

in Men, according to his Explication, in <hi>Judgment fixed,</hi> juſt now given, he meaneth
only the created Souls of Men, as begotten and born of the immortal Seed; then

<hi>That Chriſt, as God, did not ſuffer, but only as Man.] VVhereas</hi> (ſaith he) T. V.
<hi>had affirmed, That Chriſt, as God, could not ſuffer: As to his ſaying, That God cannot
ſuffer, is in one Senſe, not true, though he intended as to Death, yet the Spirit of God

That the Seed, Spirit, Word, or God, is both in Priſon, Bondage, and Captivity,
and to be quickned, raiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> withal adding, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> J. B. <hi>hath not produced
any Book of ours or our Friends, wherein this Doctrine is printed:</hi> Surely <hi>G. VV.</hi> had a
very treacherous Memory, or writ this againſt his own Conſcience, ſeeing he had
writ ſo expreſly himſelf in his former Books, as is above quoted out of his <hi>He-goats
Horn,</hi> his <hi>Brief Diſcovery,</hi> and his <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> all which were in print before
<hi>J. B.</hi> gave this Charge againſt them. And as to his Diſtinction betwixt God or
Chriſt, and a Seed of God or Chriſt that is oppreſſed, and ſuffers in Men by their
Sins, as if it were not either God or Chriſt that thus ſuffers in Men by their Sins;
this is contradictory to <hi>G. W</hi>'s own former Doctrine, who brought <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. to
prove that God ſuffers in Men by their Sins (<hi>viz.</hi> not metaphorically, by that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
commonly called <hi>Anthropopathia,</hi> but really, which was the only State of the
Controverſie.) <hi>Behold, I am preſſed under you, as a Cart that is full of Sheaves.</hi>
Now, ſeeing this muſt be underſtood literally and ſtrictly, according to <hi>G. W.</hi> it
muſt be a very great Suffering, that he thinks God ſuffers in Men by their Sins, that
may be ſaid to amount to an Oppreſſion, which yet he denies is applicable to God,
in his <hi>Judgment fixed.</hi> And ſeeing the Seed within, that is ſlain, he would have it,
in his <hi>He-goats Horn,</hi> to be the Lamb that was ſlain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12. to whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
gave divine Worſhip; he muſt needs own that Seed to be Chriſt, and that
Chriſt to be God; and conſequently, not only that God ſuffers in Men by their Sins,
but is ſlain in them, or elſe confeſs Idolatry to be lawful. But that the Seed that is

(viz. <hi>that was outwardly born of the Virgin) is Christ, as teſtifie the Scriptures, the

Services; which, if I may ſo ſpeak. God held them in Hand with, condeſcending to their
Weakneſs, that he might both keep them from gadding after the pompous Invention,
and idolatrous Worſhip of other Nations, and point out unto them, under their great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,
that more hidden Glory and ſpiritual Diſpenſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhould afterwards be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
to wit, the compleat Redemption of the Soul, and Reign of the Holy Seed, from the
Child born, and the Son given, to the wonderful Counſeller, the mighty God, the everlaſting
Father, and Prince of Peace; of the Increaſe of whoſe Government there ſhould be no
End.</p>
                  <p>Note, Thus we ſee, he wholly applies that moſt excellent Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
9. 6. concerning the holy Seed and Child Jeſus born of the Virgin, whoſe Name is,
The Wonderful Counſeller, The Mighty God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a Seed or Principle within,
which groweth up from a Seed to a Child, and from a Child, to become the Only
Son, and ſo to become the Mighty God; which exactly agreeth with that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Notion of <hi>W. Baily,</hi> in the Collection of his Works, p. 292, 293. <hi>Be thou but
the Virgin, the Power of the moſt High ſhall overſhadow thee, and that holy thing, which
ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God, this was Chriſt's Name in the VVomb</hi>
(read, <hi>within) and then had other Names, as</hi> Jeſus <hi>and</hi> Emanuel. <hi>But the Virgin is
ſubject to the Power of the Moſt High, where Chriſt is known to be firſt a Holy Thing,
then a Child given, and a Son born, which is</hi> Emanuel, <hi>God with us, a Saviour, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Counſeller, the mighty God, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Thus we ſee, according to
theſe Men's Doctrine, God ſows a Seed in Men, the which Seed, as Men attend to,
and obey it, they are the Virgin in whom this Seed comes to be a Child born, and
that Child becomes the only Son, the wonderful Counſeller, the mighty God: And
a Preacher in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> of the Quakers, did illuſtrate this great Quaker Miſtery,
to another Quaker in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> who told it me after this manner, by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Similitude; <hi>A Hen lays an Egg, ſits, and hatches, and brings forth a Chick, and that
Chick becomes a Hen, equal to the Mother Hen;</hi> which I confeſs is a very plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
Explication of the blaſphemous Notion of <hi>G. VV. VV. P.</hi> and <hi>VV. B.</hi> above
mentioned: Thus God, in every regenerate Man, begers God, and the God begotten
is equal, in Power and Might, to the God that did beget. The Quakers Name
that gave this Similitude, is <hi>Jacob Talner,</hi> a Dutch-man, who began to ſpeak at the
Beginning of the firſt Meeting at Turners-Hall, but ſaying nothing pertinent to the
purpoſe, and confeſſing he had no Deputation from any of the Perſons properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
was deſired by the Auditory, as well as by me, to be ſilent, that the Service
of that Meeting might not be hindred. I proffered to give him a Meeting at that
Place any other Day, if he had a mind to diſpute, but he did not agree to my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
This very Perſon is a frequent Preacher in the Quakers Meetings here in
<hi>London.</hi>

                     <hi>Note, I find in</hi> VV P<hi>'s</hi> Chriſtian Quaker, <hi>p. 100. that he acknowledgeth that</hi>
Chriſt is called Light, by a Metaphor; And whereas, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> the Light in Men has
been reſiſted, grieved, and as it were, ſlain: The VVord, <hi>Slain,</hi> is alſo metaphorical, yet
be contends, it ſuffers in Men, and hath been deeply wounded in wicked Men; yea, he

Manhood inſenſible of it, <hi>he ſaith; and a little after he ſaith,</hi> As outwardly he gave
his outward Life for the World, ſo he might inwardly ſhed abroad in their Souls, the
Blood of God, that is, the holy purifying Life and Virtue, which is in him, as the VVord,
God, and as which, he is the Life of the VVorld. <hi>Thus we ſee the miſtick Notion of
the Blood of God.</hi>

ſecond Meeting.</p>
                  <p>Is not this a great Perverſion, as well as nonſenſical Expoſition of <hi>G. F.</hi> on this
Place of <hi>Peter,</hi> to prove that wicked Men impriſon Chriſt in them? <hi>The Spirits in
Priſon</hi> (whereof <hi>Peter</hi> writes in that Place) <hi>were ſometimes diſobedient in the Days of</hi>
Noah, as the following Words expreſly declare. But how could Chriſt in them be
diſobedient; not only Spirits, but diſobedient Spirits? This is that Apoſtle of the
Quakers, of whom <hi>VV. P.</hi> ſaith, in his Preface to <hi>G. F</hi>'s Journal, <hi>He had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Gift in opening the Scripture, he would go to the Marrow of things,</hi> ſaith <hi>VV. P.</hi>
Is not this a rare Inſtance of it?</p>
                  <p>Upon the reading theſe Places, <hi>Samuel Jobſon,</hi> one of the Quakers Elders ſaid,
<hi>George, doth not the Scriptures ſay, that ſome crucifie Chriſt a-freſh?</hi> I anſwered, It is
ſaid in Scripture, they crucifie him to themſelves, but it is not ſaid; they crucifie him
to himſelf, or in himſelf; by crucifying him there, is underſtood their rendring
themſelves guilty of his Death, and depriving themſelves, by their unworthy Life and
Practiſes, of the Salvation purchaſed by him. I asked him, did he believe, that
wicked Men, by their Sins, do really wound Chriſt in them, and kill him, and let
out his Blood in them, and that that Blood is the Blood of Atonement. He ſaid,
The Scripture ſaith, <hi>If we walk in the Light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us
from all Sin.</hi> I asked him, Whether that Blood was the Blood of Chriſt without us,
that was ſhed on the Croſs? He ſaid, <hi>The Blood was the Life:</hi> But I asked again,
Was it the Blood without us, or the Blood within us? He ſaid, <hi>It was ſpiritual
Blood:</hi> But being much preſſed, not only by me, but ſome Miniſters preſent, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
whether it was Blood without him, or Blood within him? He waved any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Anſwer; and I ſhewing the Auditory, that the Notion of <hi>G. F.</hi> and other
Teachers of the Quakers who had learned it of him was, <hi>That the Blood, by which
we are cleanſed from Sin, is the Blood within,</hi> which he calls, <hi>The Blood of the Seed;</hi> as
is more fully afterwards to be proved; and this Seed is Christ, and is not a Creature.


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97123:34"/>
Another Quaker ſaid, <hi>Is not the Seed Chriſt, and is not Chriſt within, the Seed of the
Woman that bruiſeth the Head of the Serpent?</hi> [At this, ſome of the Hearers ſaid,
Here is Proof enough of their Error, <hi>The Seed of the Woman, it the Seed within them.</hi>]
I anſwered, Chriſt is called the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as
he came in the Fleſh without us, and was made of a Woman, and was the Son of
<hi>Abraham:</hi> And though I own Chriſt within, by his Godhead Preſence, and by his
common Illumination in all Men, and by his ſpecial Preſence, and ſpecial Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the faithful; yet I deny, that the Seed of God in Men, is either Chriſt or
God; I own that there is a Seed of God in the faithful, but I deny <hi>G. F.</hi> his Notion
of it, <hi>That it is not a Creature.</hi> I asked <hi>Daniel Philips,</hi> what he ſaid to my former
Queſtion; Did Men, by their Sins, really wound God in them, as ſome of their
Teachers have affirmed? After ſome Demur, he ſaid he would not give a poſitive
Anſwer, but take it into further Conſideration, whereupon ſome of the Auditory did
commend him: I ſaid, it was better ſo to do, than to aſſert ſuch a vile Error; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
by this it appeared how uncertain they were, and how little agreed about
ſome of their chief Principles.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given an Account of G. W's wild Notions, concerning Chriſt the
Seed within, that the Power takes hold of and raiſes up: I will proceed to ſhew the
like by ſome new Quotations out of <hi>G. F.</hi> referring to other Quotations given in my
third Narrative, eſpecially on the ſame Subject. See my third Narrative, p. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>G. F.</hi> in his G. M. p. 324. <hi>quotes his Opponent ſaying,</hi> That the Seed to whom the
Promiſe of Salvation is made, is or hath been Sinners. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Promiſe of God is to the
Seed which hath been laden, as a Cart with Shaves by the Sinner, which Seed is the Hope
Christ that purifies, even as God is pure; and here is the Creature come to know its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
among the Sons of God, and the Seed Christ never ſinned, in the Male nor in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
in the Jew nor in the Gentiles: And of this Myſtery was the great High Profeſſors
ignorant of, that ſtood at a Diſtance from the Gentiles, that Christ had no room among
them, though they talked of him, but in the Stable, in the Manger, and in their Mouths
to talk of him with their Lips, and ſuch Christ calls Graves and Sepulchres, and whited
Walls, and the Wall is not the Seed, but the Seed is Christ, and not the Sepulchre nor
the Grave; ſo this Promiſe is not unto Seeds as many, but to one, the Seed which is
Christ. <hi>Note theſe groſs Perverſions of Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, p. 171. G. M.</hi> Now they feel not the Comfort, nor the Benefit, but by the
Faith of Chriſt Jeſus, the one Offering in which God is pleaſed with all, which is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which is Chriſt's Offering, his Sacrifice, his Fleſh, his Blood, his Life, his Word
must be manifeſt and received within, before they come to Juſtification, Sanctification,
and Redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 173. And where Jeſus Chriſt is within, the Word is there, and God is there, and
this is the great Miſtery of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, G. M. p.</hi> 158. Of this Body (which is that by which Chriſt reconciles unto
God) are all the Profeſſors, Proteſtants and Papiſts, ignorant of this Seed that breaks the
Enmity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 159. And by Faith is every one juſtified in the Blood of the Seed, the Fleſh of Chriſt,
the Lord from Heaven ſhed for the Sins of the whole World. The Blood of the Seed which is
the Life that cleanſeth; and <hi>this Blood is felt within,</hi> for it purgeth the Conſcience
from dead VVorks, to ſerve the living God; and here is the great Miſtery of God, and
the VViſdom of God.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:97123:34"/>
Note, This Fleſh and Blood that he ſaith is the great Miſtery, which neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
nor Proteſtants know, is that Fleſh which was crucified in <hi>Adam,</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi>
ſinned, and the Blood that was then ſhed, in which is the Belief that takes away the
Sin, as I have ſhewed in a large Quotation out of another Book of his in my third
Narrative, p. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For a Cloſe upon this Head, I ſhall quote a Paſſage of</hi> G. F. <hi>in that called</hi> Several
Papers given forth, <hi>&amp;c. by G. F. who is there called</hi> Miniſter of the eternal VVord of
God. <hi>p.</hi> 47. Now to all dear ones and dear Hearts, I ſpeak, the ſame Seed which it
Chriſt, the ſame Spirit takes upon it now as ever; yea, the ſame Temptations, the ſame
Devil, and the ſame VVorſhip of the VVorld is winding into another Form and Colour;
but Jeſus Chriſt is the Way, the Truth, and the Life: And the ſame Seed paſſing into the
Wilderneſs, and there is tempted to luſt after the Creature; you that are in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
witneſs this with me, and the ſame Tentations even to Deſpair, and make themſelves
away.</p>
                  <p>Note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here all along, from the Paſſages above quoted out of G. F. and G. W.
and many more which might be quoted out of them and others, it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the greateſt things that are written of Chriſt, either by Prophecy in the
Old Teſtament, or fulfilled in the New Teſtament; his outward Birth, his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
his taking hold, not of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Sacrifice
and Offering, his Blood, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion; yea, his being
tempted by Satan in the World; is all applied to the Seed Chriſt within, as the
great Miſtery of Godlineſs; yea, as greater than God manifeſt in Fleſh without, as
is quoted out of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and as concerning Chriſt's Fleſh without, that's a Figure,
but Chriſt within is the Subſtance. Now to apply all this in way of Allegory to
Chriſt incarnate within, the Seed that the Spirit takes hold of, to uſe G. F's Words,
that looks like an Incarnation of the Holy Ghoſt in G. F. and his Brethren, is too raſh,
and goeth beyond the Bounds of Sobriety: But to turn it all to the greateſt Reallity,
and all that's ſaid of Chriſt without, to be the Allegory and Figure of the Subſtance
within, as is effectually proved, is a plain overthrowing the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>But it's very hard to conceive how this Seed Chriſt within, as G. F. holds it forth,
was or could be tempted of the Devil, to luſt after the Creature; ſeeing, as he will
have it, it is no Creature it ſelf, can it be ſuppoſed that the Devil would or could
tempt the Godhead to luſt after the Creature; and what this Seed can be, which
G. F. calls Chriſt that's buried in the wicked; and elſewhere, the Spirit and Spirits
in Priſon, yea, the Priſoners in Hell, that the Quakers have preached to, that's no
Creature, nor God, nor any Part of the divine Eſſence, for that cannot be divided
into Parts, is unaccountable?</p>
                  <p>There yet remains three or four Paſſages which were objected in a printed
Sheet, called <hi>An Account from</hi> Colcheſter, againſt G. W. and <hi>E. B.</hi> to which theſe
ſeven Quakers in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> have given their Reply by way of Vindication, but all
groſly fallacious, in that they call, <hi>Some Account from</hi> Calcheſter, as we ſhall ſee in
what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was objected againſt G. W. out of his</hi> Truth defending the Quakers, <hi>page 65.
Chriſtopher Wade</hi> affirmeth, That our bleſſed Saviour doth inſtruct Men to lay faſt hold
of, and to abide in ſuch a Faith which confideth in himſelf, being without Men. <hi>To this
G. W. anſwereth,</hi> That's contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine, who preached the Word of
Faith that was in their Hearts, and the Saints Faith ſtood in the Power of God, which was
in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:97123:35"/>
                     <hi>Their Defence is,</hi> That <hi>George White head's</hi> Intent in this Anſwer, was not against
<hi>C. Wade</hi>'s excluding Chriſt's ſpiritual Appearance and Work of Righteouſneſs out of his
Saints, by affirming, That our bleſſed Saviour doth totally condomn all ſuch Faith which
doth truſt, that Men are righteous in their own Bodies by what Spirit ſoever, either from
Heaven or elſewhere, that Righteouſneſs is wrought in Mens Bodies; <hi>p. ibid.</hi> Whereby <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
oppoſed Chriſt's Work of Regeneration in true Believers, as alſo his affirming that the true
Chriſt doth prove himſelf not to be a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſay, ſuppoſe C. <hi>Wade</hi> had erred on the one hand, this doth not juſtifie
this moſt ſcandalous Aſſertion of <hi>George Whitehead.</hi> That it is contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
to confide in Chriſt without Men, whereas <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10. teacheth us, That to
to believe in Chriſt without us, and ſo to confeſs him, is neceſſary to our Salvation.
It's obſervable how both they and G. W. himſelf waves giving a plain and poſitive
Anſwer to this great Objection. They ſay indeed, in page 21. <q>As there is one
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and one true Faith in him, this Faith reſpects Chriſt, both as
without us in the Heavens, and as he is in the Hearts of his Saints.</q> But they do
not tell what they mean by Chriſt as without us in the Heavens; not one Word of
their Faith in Chriſt, as he is both God and Man, and who as Man, conſiſting of a
created Soul and Body, the ſame in Nature with the Nature of other Men (but
without Sin) is in the Heavens in our glorified Nature: This being the thing that is
mainly objected on this Head, and which they will not, nor dare not give a plain
Anſwer unto, nor G. W. either, for it will detect his and their groſs Error; or if
they or he give a ſound Anſwer, it will prove they are changed, and that will reflect
on G. W's Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>But they groſly abuſe C. <hi>Wade</hi> for his ſound Doctrine, which G. W. has not fairly
nor duely repreſented; for C. <hi>Wade,</hi> in that very Page, doth clear himſelf, both
againſt a lying Charge, firſt, in G. F. who charged him, That he did totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Works without any Diſtinction, G. M. p. 298. And the like falſe Charge
doth G. W. load him with, That he oppoſed Chriſt's Work of Regeneration in true
Believers, which is an extremely falſe Charge againſt him, as he ſheweth at length;
but he did only exclude them from being the meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification,
and the Foundation of our Faith; ſo that though Sanctification and good Works are
neceſſary, and none can be either juſtified or ſaved without them, yet we muſt not
truſt in them, nor make a Saviour of them. But it's no Wonder that G. W. blames
this Doctrine, who in his <hi>Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> pleads for the Meritoriouſneſs of good
Works in Men, as groſly as the groſſeſt Papiſts, yea, and much more groſly, as we
may ſee in its proper Place. But this is <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Brethrens common Work, to
miſrepreſent their Opponents, to hide their own vile Hereſies. And as for C.
<hi>Wade</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Chriſt proved himſelf not to be a Spirit,</hi> to wit, a meer <hi>Spirit,</hi> as he
explains himſelf; he quoted for it, Chriſt's own Words, <hi>Handle me and feel me, for a
Spirit has not Fleſh and Bones as ye ſee me have;</hi> and was not that a ſufficient Proof that
the Man Chriſt was not a meer Spirit.</p>

was not a Part of God: For, according to him, the Soul being a Part of God, this
part rejoyceth in God the Fulneſs; and God or Chriſt conſidered as the Fulneſs, is
the Biſhop of the Soul that is a Part of him, the Soul being like a Drop of Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning

not this that cometh out from God, which is in God's Hand, part of God, of God and from
God, and to God again, which Soul Chriſt is the Biſhop of?</p>
               <p>It is to be noted and well obſerved, that this Oppoſition that <hi>George Fox</hi> made to
thoſe Men and his other Opponents, as <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> and the five Miniſters of
<hi>New Caſtle,</hi> about the Soul which they denied to be a Part of God, or without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and he affirmed it was. [By Oppoſition to them] was not about any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97123:36"/>
Soul in the Soul that was the Life or Soul of it, as <hi>George VVhitehead</hi> would
have it; by which he means, God or the Holy Ghoſt, for in all Diſputes, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Diſpute is one betwixt the Opponent and the Reſpondent; and though
ſometimes, where the Matter is intricate and nice, the Subject is hard to find out,
and the Opponent may mean one thing, and the Reſpondent another; yet in a Caſe
that is clear, and eaſie to be underſtood, as this Caſe is, there can be no Difficulty
about the Subject of the Diſpute, as indeed here there is none; which Subject of
Diſpute betwixt <hi>George Fox</hi> and his Opponents above mentioned, was purely and
ſimply the Soul of Man, and not any divine Principle in the Soul. As to inſtance
from <hi>Magnus Byne,</hi> the Beginning of this Controverſie betwixt <hi>Magnus Byne</hi> and
<hi>George Fox,</hi> about the Soul, was by a Queſtion that <hi>Magnus Byne</hi> put to <hi>Thomas
Lawſon</hi> a Quaker, which was this [ſee in <hi>Magnus Byne,</hi> The ſcornful Quaker an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
page 103.] <hi>VVhat is the Soul of Man, and the Preciouſneſs of it, ſeeing Chriſt
ſays, It is more worth than all the VVorld?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Thomas Lawſon</hi> the Quaker anſwers, <q>The Miniſters of Jeſus, who come
by the Will of God, ſuch know the Soul, and watch for the Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.
But thy watching is for the Fliece, and art querying what the Soul is which lies in
Death, and State, and Condemnation ſo long as it lives, and the falſe Accuſer
lives, and it the Firſt-born knows not, nor the Preciouſneſs of it, who prefers the
World, and obeys it before the Light of Chriſt, and ſo ſells the Soul for the World,
as thou doſt who profeſſeſt him in thy Lip-talk, but denies him in Practice, Ways,
and Converſation, though Chriſt ſaith, The Soul is more worth than all the
World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which, <hi>Magnus Byne,</hi> his Opponent thus replieth; <q>In all this Anſwer, there
is not a Tittle unto-the Queſtion; here it appears thy perfect knowledge fails thee.
Here thou gueſſeſt, that the Soul is Chriſt, for he is the Firſt-born the Scripture
mentions; and ſo according to thy Blaſphemy, Chriſt it ſeems may be damned and
caſt into Hell, for ſo it is ſaid of the Soul, Fear him who is able to caſt Body and
Soul into Hell. See how dark thou art in making no Difference between the Soul
and Chriſt; the Soul is indeed a precious thing, there is a kind of Infiniteneſs in it,
which all the World cannot ſatisfie; and therefore the Man was a Fool that ſaid,
Soul, take thine Eaſe becauſe thy Barns are full; and yet notwithſtanding this kind
of Infiniteneſs in the Soul as being reſtleſs, till it return to God; yet it cannot be
Infiniteneſs it ſelf, it cannot be the Firſt-born, for of whole Man it is ſaid, whereof
the Soul is the more noble Part, <hi>VVhat is Man that thou art mindful of him?</hi> Heb.
2. 6, 7. Man you ſee is inferior unto the Angels, much more inferior to the Son of
God. And farther (ſaith he) though the Soul be the Seat of Chriſt, and Chriſt be
hid there as a Treaſure in a Field, even in the innermoſt Room of the Soul, yet
the Soul cannot comprehend the infinite Majeſty; ſo Chriſt in his diviner Eſſence or
Being, much leſs, can it be Chriſt who is God over all bleſſed for evermore? And
though there be indeed a bleſſed Union and Fellowſhip between Chriſt and an holy
Soul, yet ſtill there is a vaſt Difference between the Eſſence or being of the Soul
and Chriſt, the one being ſtill a Creature, and the other the Creator of
it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next he comes to give his own Definition of it; <q>The Soul (ſaith <hi>Magnus Byne</hi>)
is a moſt noble Power, a living Being, an Eſſence that quickens the Body, and
yet dies not, ſleeps not when the Body dies and ſleeps, but returns unto God who
gave it: This Soul is a little Map of the great World, and makes Man a little


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97123:36"/>
World; for in his Soul is comprehended the Life of Plants, the Senſe
of Beaſts, the Reaſon of Men and Angels: This Soul quickens and
makes Man a living Creature, a ſenſitive Creature, a rational Creature. After
he has deſcribed the Soul of Man (which he expreſly calls a Creature, as above
quoted) in its ſeveral Powers and Faculties of the Mind, Reaſon, Judgment,
Will, Memory, Fancy, Appetite and Affections; to wit, the created Soul of
Man: He ſaith, God is the Life of our Life, and Soul of our Soul; he proceeds
very regularly to tell, That in this Soul of Man, or in the Spirit or Mind of it, as
the higheſt Power, when it is regenerated and reſigned, lives the great King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted;
here he dwells as in <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> here he delights to be as in his Temple.
And in this Soul of Man, unenlightened and unrenewed, Chriſt lies hid and is as
one dead [note, he doth not ſay dead, as the Quakers ſay, but is as one dead]
and unſavory unto the Soul, and ſo the Soul is in Darkneſs, Weakneſs, Sinfulneſs,
Sorrow, Fear, Bondage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee <hi>Magnus Byne</hi> doth ſo clearly ſtate the <hi>Subject</hi> of the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the Quakers his Opponents, which was the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
reaſonable Soul,</hi> that is neither God nor Chriſt, though he owneth that
God and Chriſt are in the Souls of Men, both regenerate and unregenerate,
but after different Manners, that he leaves no room for any of the leaſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of Underſtanding to miſtake the true Subject of the Controverſie; and
therefore <hi>George Fox,</hi> whom <hi>Joſeph Wyeth</hi> magnifieth as the APOSTLE in
this Age, could not be ſuch a Sot as not to underſtand the true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Diſpute, which was the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> the <hi>reaſonable</hi> Soul, that
which <hi>thinks, wills, loves, which dieth not when the Body dieth,</hi> and which
again and again he calleth a Creature, and the created Soul, diſtinguiſheth it
from Chriſt in the Soul, which he ſaith, is the Life of our Life, and Soul
of our Soul. [The ſame Expreſſion uſed by <hi>George VVhitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Truth
and Innocency.</hi>] Yet notwithſtanding all this clear ſtating the Subject of the
Diſpute, which was the Soul of Man [and not that divine Principle in the
Soul.] <hi>George Fox</hi> doth make a great Difference with him, and ſets himſelf
in great Oppoſition to him, and will needs have it, That the Soul [to wit,
the Soul of Man, which was the only Subject of the Diſpute] is without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
coming from God, returning to God again. Alſo he oppoſeth <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Byne</hi>'s Saying, There is a kind of Infiniteneſs in the Soul [<hi>viz.</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Largeneſs of its Deſires, which the whole World cannot ſatisfie,
as he explained himſelf;] but it is not Infiniteneſs it ſelf, which <hi>George Fox</hi>
wrongly quotes by adding the Word IN, making him ſay, It is not Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs
IN it ſelf, which mars the Senſe: But <hi>George Fox,</hi> in Oppoſition to M. B.
will have the Soul of Man [which was the Subject of the Diſpute] to be Infiniteneſs
it ſelf without Beginning.</p>
               <p>Note, Here a Quaker, <hi>Daniel Philips</hi> objected, That Diſputants might differ
about the Subject of the Diſpute, ſo as the Opponent might mean one thing, and
the Reſpondent another: But I anſwered, They might ſo, when the Matter is intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and obſcure by Ambiguities of Words; but it could not be ſo here, the Subject
of the Diſpute being ſo clearly propoſed, that none but a Sot or Cheat could or
would miſtake the Subject, which the Quakers will not allow <hi>G. F.</hi> to be, having ſo
great an Eſteem of his Wiſdom, as the Apoſtle in this Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:97123:37"/>
And the like is to be ſaid of all the Diſputes betwixt <hi>George Fox</hi> and his other
Opponents about the Soul, which were only about the Soul of Man, and not
at all about God or Chriſt in the Soul, for they all did contend there was
a real Diſtinction betwixt the Soul and God or Chriſt who was in it: But
<hi>George Fox</hi> would allow none, but ſtill contended, That the Soul, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which they and he diſputed, was a Part of God without Beginning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And in his Great Miſtery, page 91. he blames <hi>Magnus Byne</hi> for calling the Soul
a Creature, and ſaith, he is in <hi>Babylon</hi> and Confuſion. And in his Diſpute with
the five Miniſters of <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> Great Miſtery, pag. 227, 228. he ſaith, <hi>The
Soul, whereof Christ is the Biſhop, is divine and immortal;</hi> alſo he moſt groſly
wrongs the five Miniſters of <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> and charges them with holding it to
be their own Principle; Great Miſtery, page 227. <hi>That the Soul is a Part of the divine
Eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his Great Miſtery, page 29. he ſaith to them, <hi>And ſo you five have
judged your ſelves to be Blaſphemers, who ſaid, The Soul was Part of the divine
Eſſence, and yet it is Blaſphemy to ſay ſo.</hi> This he moſt unjuſtly chargeth in
them, quoting their Book, called, <hi>A Diſcovery of that Generation of Men
called Quakers;</hi> but in that very Book, which was produced and the Words
quoted, as they are in that Book, page 5. the five Miniſters deliver it, not
as any Poſition of theirs, but as one of the Quakers Poſitions [having this
Title on the Top, <hi>Quakers Poſitions</hi>] being the third in Number, and in all
being ſeventeen] <hi>That the Soul is a Part of the divine Eſſence.</hi> What Excuſe
can <hi>George VVhitehead,</hi> or any of his Brethren find for this palpable Injuſtice
in <hi>George Fox?</hi> Could he be ſo ſottiſh as not to diſtinguiſh betwixt the five Miniſters
Poſitions, and what they call the <hi>Quakers Poſitions,</hi> and which they expreſly blame
and diſown, and give their Arguments againſt? And if he was not ſo ignoratly ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
in the Caſe, what can it be conſtrued but a wilful Lie thus for him to charge
them?</p>
               <p>And for a further Confirmation that <hi>George Fox</hi> did hold, That that very
Soul of Man [which <hi>George VVhitehead</hi> calls the reaſonable and rational Soul,
<hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> pag. 7, 8, 9. and which <hi>George VVhitehead</hi> confeſſeth hath
ſinned] doth not ſin, and is not at any time a ſinful Soul; conſequently is,
according to him, a Part of God; I bring a Quotation out of his Great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
page 337. <hi>George Fox</hi> quotes his Opponent ſaying, <hi>The Soul of Man
is a reaſonable ſinful Subſtance:</hi> To this <hi>George Fox</hi> anſwers, <hi>How can that which
is ſinful be reaſonable? And if that which is unſinful be reaſonable, and ſinful be
reaſonable both, then they are one in Vnity.</hi> The Lord will take the Soul for
an Offering for Sin, <hi>Iſa. 5. 3. See how thou and the Prophet agrees here. But
what is that Soul that the wicked is not able to kill? Is it not that which God
hath in his Hand? And this is a Lye to ſay, That which is reaſonable is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note how groſly he perverts that Place in <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. When thou ſhall make
his Soul an Offering for Sin:</hi> This is underſtood of the Soul of the Man Chriſt
who ſuffered without us, and not of any Soul within us, which yet is <hi>George
Fox</hi>'s Notion; and this very Soul in Men, this reaſonable Soul, <hi>George Fox</hi>
will have it to be the Odering for Sin: And becauſe it is ſo, therefore he
concludes it is not ſinful, not capable of ſinning; yet <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The reaſonable Soul is capable of ſinning, and hath ſinned in Men (though it never


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97123:37"/>
ſinned in Chriſt.</hi>) See how theſe two Apoſtles do now contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and yet none of them fallible! Note, again, how <hi>George Fox</hi> thought
he put a very puzzling Query to his Opponent to convince him, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Soul in Men did not ſin; <hi>What is that Soul that the wicked cannot kill?</hi>
Surely by this Query <hi>George Fox</hi> meant the Soul that the wicked cannot kill,
was not the Soul that could ſin, wherein he ſheweth his great Ignorance;
for though the wicked cannot kill the ſinful Souls of Men, yet as Chriſt ſaid
in the following Words, <hi>He is to be feared,</hi> to wit, God, <hi>that can cast both
Soul and Body into Hell Fire:</hi> Now what Soul can be caſt into Hell Fire, but
the Soul that ſinneth? But laſtly, By <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Argument, That <hi>if the
ſinful Soul be reaſonable, and the unſinful Soul be reaſonable alſo,</hi> then they are
one in Unity, which he would have to be a great Abſurdity; thus he hath
plainly diſcloſed the Miſtery of his profound Doctrine, that is a Branch of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſm,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there are but two Principles, one good in Man, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſinneth or doth evil, the other bad, that ſinneth, and never doeth good;
the one is God, or a Part of God, the other the Devil, or a Part of the
Devil: And his denying that one and the ſame Soul doth ſin at one Time, and
doth well at another Time, clearly proveth, that according to him, there
is not any Soul of Man, but what is either a Part of God, or of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
And he diſcovereth his great Ignorance, in denying that the reaſonable Soul
is ſinful, the contrary whereof is true, that no Soul but a reaſonable Soul, is or can
be ſinful: for what is it that makes the Beaſts uncapable of ſinning, but that they are
not reaſonable?</p>
               <p>And whereas his Opponent had very well argued, that <hi>the evil Spirits are both
ſinful and reaſonable; George Fox</hi> anſwereth, <hi>This is a Lie, for reaſonable is not ſinful,
unreaſonable is ſinful;</hi> quoting 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 2. And that we may be delivered from unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and wicked Men,</hi> for all Men have not Faith. But this doth nothing
favour his Manichean Notion; he was ſo ignorant as not to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Faculty of Reaſon, and the Act of Reaſon, when Men that are
reaſonable, and have reaſonable Souls, act contrary to Reaſon; they are ſaid
to be unreaſonable, to wit, in Act; but ſtill, the Soul that ſinneth is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
with reſpect to the rational Faculty, nor could evil Spirits ſin, if they
were not reaſonable, <hi>i. e.</hi> indued with rational Faculties? Beſides, the Greek
Word, in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and is not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſlated Unreaſonable, but (as it is on the Margin) Abſurd, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch, who,
though they have Reaſon, yet will not give place to Reaſon, but act contrary to it;
and <hi>George Fox,</hi> had he had the right Uſe of his Reaſon, might have ſeen, that
it is no more an Argument againſt the Soul of Man being reaſonable, that
it acts unreaſonably, than it is an Argument that the Soul is not enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Light within, becauſe it often acts contrary to the Dictates of
it.</p>
               <p>Again, for a further Confirmation of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Doctrine, That the Soul
that ſinneth, is not the Soul that is to be ſaved; and that therefore, the Soul
that is ſaved, or is to be ſaved, is only Chriſt, the Seed within Men: Hear
what <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaith, Great Miſtery, page 324. he quotes his Opponent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That the Seed, to whom the Promiſe of Salvation is made, is or hath been Sinners.</hi>
This he oppoſeth ſaying, <hi>The Promiſe of God is to the Seed, which hath been laden
as a Cart with Shaves by the Sinner, which Seed is the Hope Christ, that purifies even as


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97123:38"/>
God is pure:</hi> So this Promiſe is not to Seeds, as many, but to one, the Seed which is
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note In the ſame Paragraph he ſaith,</hi> So here is the Creature come to know its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
amongst the Sons of God, and the Seed Christ, never ſinned in the Male nor in the
Female.</p>
               <p>Note what he means by the Creature that comes to know its Liberty, which
hath not ſinned, and hath the Promiſe of Salvation, ſeems not intelligible, for
he denieth that the Seed is a Creature, and yet it is that to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Salvation is, to wit, the Seed Chriſt in the Male and in the Female
that never ſinned; but he groſly perverts that Place in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. for by
the Seed Christ, is there meant Chriſt as he came outwardly according to the
Fleſh out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins, to whom the Promiſe was, that in him all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, but this was not to a Seed within that needed
Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like to this is what he ſaith in Great Miſtery, p. 15. having quoted his Opponent
ſaying,</hi> There is nothing in Man to be ſpoken to but Man: <hi>To this he thus oppoſeth,</hi>
How then Miniſtred the Apoſtle to the Spirit, and Christ ſpake to the Spirits in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and <hi>Timothy</hi> was to ſtir up the Gift that was in him, and the Spirit of the Father
ſpeaks within them, and the Light it ſhines in the Heart? Here the Scriptures are for
Correction of thee, and Reproof of thee, who ſaid, there is nothing to ſpeak to in Man but
Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, In Great Myſtery, p. 187, he quotes his Opponent ſaying,</hi> It would
be good News, if the Quakers ſhould go and preach to the Spirits in Hell. <hi>To
this he anſwers,</hi> The Quakers have been among the Priſoners that be in Hell, and
miniſtred to that, and the <hi>CORRUPTIONS</hi> ſhall go into the Fire that hath
no End, and they that do wickedly and forget God, ſhall go into Hell, and Death
and Hell ſhall go into the Lake of Fire; and there is more in theſe Words yet than
thou canst receive, for God is the Salvation of all Men, but ſpecially them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>Note, thus we ſee he is very charitable, and the Quakers Miniſters are very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
that they have been among the Priſoners in Hell, and preached to that.
But how is this great Charity conſiſtent with his ſaying, That that which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
is not ſaved, unleſs he mean that Sin is not ſaved, though the Creature
is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The very ſame Doctrine, concerning the Soul, I find aſſerted by</hi> Edward
Burrough <hi>in his Works, Coll. page</hi> 27. Thou ſayest, one of us told thee, <hi>That
that which ſinned could not be ſaved. I anſwer (ſaith</hi> Edward Burrough)
It is out of the Reach of the Wiſdom, and thy vulturous Eye ſhall never ſee it,
I ſay, as the Scripture ſaith, The Soul that ſinneth must die, and every Man
muſt die for his own Iniquity: If thou haſt an Ear, thou mayſt hear.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the Agreement of theſe two great Teachers of the Quakers,
about the Souls that ſin, that they ſhall not be ſaved, nor can be ſaved.
But how groſly doth <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> pervert thoſe Scriptures to prove his
moſt corrupt Doctrine, that is plain Ranteriſm? Becauſe the Scripture ſaith,
<hi>The Soul that ſinneth muſt die;</hi> doth it therefore follow, That it cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be ſaved, both from Death, and Sin, that is the Cauſe of it? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Sin hath brought a Spiritual Death upon the Souls of Men: But what
then? Muſt they therefore none of them that have ſinned be ſaved? Had


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97123:38"/>
not the Epheſians been great Sinners, yea, and they were dead in their Sins
and Treſpaſſes, yet theſe very ſame Men having the ſame Souls, were quickened
and made alive by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 3. And you hath he quickened who were dead in
Treſpaſſes and Sins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>George Whitehead</hi> himſelf is guilty of the ſame abſurd Doctrine with G.
F. and <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> who in his <hi>He-goats Horn,</hi> pag. 11, 12. denieth that
Chriſt hath our Nature in Heaven, and that it is one and the ſame Nature
in Men, by which the Gentiles ſinned, aud by which they did the things
contained in the Law: And in his <hi>Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> page 20. he holdeth, That
<hi>Chriſt is both the Efficient and Subject of the good Works that are wrought in Men,</hi>
which is in effect to ſay, it is not Men, or the Souls of Men that repent,
believe, obey God, but Chriſt in them, or elſe he muſt ſay, The Soul that
believes, repents, obeys, is Chriſt; and though in his later Books he ſeems
to deny this, yet will retract nothing, for that would reflect on his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
But his common Salve for this Sore is, That he may ſee cauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to word the Matter, and yet mean the ſame thing, as he has of late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in ſome of his Books.</p>
               <p>Note, Whereas in the Cloſe of the third Meeting, a Letter of <hi>John Audland</hi> (a
Preacher among the Quakers) to <hi>George Fox,</hi> was read, wherein is contained groſs
Idolatry, which confirms, in matter of Fact, what <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>That

               <p>The Letter being read, the Auditory was ſtruck with Admiration, and generally
ſignified their great Abhorrency of the Blaſphemy and Idolatry contained in it to <hi>G.
Fox:</hi> I told them, the Quakers had two Excuſes as to this Letter, one was, that it
was feigned; becauſe, as it was once printed, it had a wrong Date, <hi>viz.</hi> 1665.
which was ſome Years after <hi>John Audland</hi> was dead. But that was the Fault or
Miſtake of the Publiſher of that Letter; that proves not the Letter to be feigned, for
the original Manuſcript was read in the Meeting, that had no date, and was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about to ſeveral Miniſters and others, together with another Letter of the ſame
<hi>John Audland,</hi> in Manuſcript, to another Perſon, who did unanimouſly judge it was
the ſame hand that writ both the Letters. Their next Excuſe is, That theſe Words
in <hi>John Audland</hi>'s Letter, were not intended to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> but to Chriſt, or the Life in
<hi>G. Fox:</hi> And the like Excuſe <hi>G. F.</hi> made in a Letter writ with his own Hand
[which was produced and read in the Meeting, and is ready to be produced before
any that ſhall call for it] for a Woman Quaker, that in a Quakers Meeting, ſaid to
<hi>George Fox, Thou art the King of</hi> Iſrael: That ſhe ſpoke her Words to Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in
<hi>G. Fox:</hi> But I told, This did not hinder it to be Idolatry, nor was any juſt Excuſe
in the Caſe, for it was the ſame Excuſe that the Heathens gave for their worſhiping
Idols, becauſe it was not the Idol, but the divine Power that was in it, which they
worſhiped. The like Excuſe gave thoſe Quakers that ſung <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to <hi>James Nailer,</hi>

            <p>I Produced a Printed Paper in the Meeting, call'd, <hi>A few Poſitions of
the ſincere Belief and Chriſtian Doctrine of the People call'd Quakers,</hi> Sign'd
by <hi>G. Whitehead;</hi> to which is adjoined another printed Paper, Sign'd
by Thirty two Quakers, which, they ſay, was given to the Members of
Parliament in the Year 1693: In which Paper, I noted divers groſs Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and groſs Equivocations; ſuch as follow.</p>
            <p>In the 4th Article of that Paper ſign'd by <hi>G. W.</hi> I quoted theſe words.
<hi>The Divinity and Humanity,</hi> i. e. <hi>Manhood, of Christ Jeſus, that as he is true
God, and he is most glorious Man, our Mediator and Advocate, we livingly
believe, and have often ſincerely confeſſed in our Publick Teſtimonies and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi>
On this I noted, That whatever ſeeming Confeſſions they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in their publick Teſtimonies to this and other Doctrines, yet ſeeing
they have contradicted them moſt evidently in their printed Books, and
will not allow that they are chang'd in any one of their Principles,
they do Fallaciouſly, and put a Cheat upon the Members of Parliament,
and the whole Nation. A Quaker reply'd, Doſt thou think that the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament</hi> are not more Wiſe than to ſuffer themſelves to be
cheated by the Quakers? I anſwer'd, It is one thing for the Quakers to
put a Cheat upon them; it is another thing for them to be cheated by them;
a Cheat may be put on Men, and yet they not receive it. I hope they
are ſo wiſe, as not to be deceived by them. Some of the Quakers object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That this tended to <hi>Perſecution,</hi> ſo to repreſent them; I anſwered, it
tended to no Perſecution, being to reſcue ſuch from thoſe Errors, who
were corrupted by them, and prevent their further ſpreading, and would
they take my advice, I would ſhew them a way to ſecure the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto them; and that is, by a free and plain Retractation of their
groſs Errors. And for an evidence of their fallacious way of Speaking and
Writing, beſides what was quoted and proved at the former Meeting,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97123:40"/>
to prove them groſly Erroneous, concerning Chriſt, his Humanity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
his Soul, Body, Fleſh and Blood; I brought a Quotation out of that,
call'd, <hi>A Teſtimony for the true Christ,</hi> printed 1668, and given forth (as in
the Title-Page) from ſome of them call'd Quakers. In page 4. <q>As he
ſpeaks of Humane, with relation to Nature and Body, it hath relation
to the Earth, or <hi>Humus,</hi> the Ground, of which Man was made, which
the firſt Man is of, not the ſecond (tho' he was really Man too,) but
Humane or Humanity in the other ſence, with relation to Gentleneſs,
Mercifulneſs, and the like, this we know, was, and is, in the Image
of God, in which Man was made; and his Gentleneſs, Kindneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is manifeſted in Chriſt, who is the Image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
God, and Firſt-Born of every Creature; which Image is not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that muſt be put off, but heavenly, and ſo to be put on by
all that come to know the Glory of the terreſtrial in its place, and
the true and real <hi>Humanity,</hi> as oppos'd to that Cruelty, Envy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity,
which is got up in Man ſince the Fall; ſo that Humanity
and the Unreaſonableneſs of Beaſts are two things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Thus we ſee how they own <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Humanity,</hi> not in the ſence of
Scripture, and of all ſound Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Word</hi> did take the
real Nature of Man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, into a <hi>Perſonal Union
with himſelf,</hi> his <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> being two Natures diſtinguiſhed
in him, but not divided; and that he took a Body of Fleſh and Blood,
the ſame in Nature with ours, even our earthly Nature, like to us in all
things, but without Sin; but this they plainly deny, That Chriſt had <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi>
as it ſignifies Earthly; but they tell in what ſence they mean
his <hi>Humanity, viz.</hi> as it ſignifies <hi>Gentleneſs, Mercifulneſs,</hi> as oppos'd to
<hi>Cruelty, Envy, and the unreaſonableneſs of Beasts;</hi> in which ſence they may
affirm all this of Chriſt's Divinity and Godhead, That his Godhead is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
<hi>i. e.</hi> Gentle, Merciful, Kind, and yet believe not one tittle of
Chriſt's Humanity as the Scripture holds it forth; that is, that he was
really made of a Woman, and had his Fleſh of her <hi>Subſtance;</hi> but this
they not only here deny, but <hi>G. F.</hi> expreſly denyeth, <hi>That Christ's Body
was Earthly or of the Earth,</hi> G. M. p. 322.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He quotes his Opponent ſaying, That</hi> Christ had and hath a Carnal Body,
—A Carnal and Humane Body united to his Divinity. <hi>In oppoſition
to which he ſaith,</hi> And Carnal Humane is from the Ground, Humane Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the first <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body, and Christ was not from the Ground, let all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
read what thou ſay'st; but he was from Heaven, his Fleſh came down
from above, his Fleſh which was the Meat, his Fleſh came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, He quotes his Opponent ſaying,</hi> That the Fleſh of Christ is not in
them; <hi>he anſwers,</hi> The Saints eat his Fleſh, and they that eat his Fleſh, hath
it within them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, He quotes his Opponent,</hi> That there is as much difference between
a Body and a Spirit, as there is between Light and Darkneſs; <hi>he Anſwers,</hi>
Christ's Body is Spiritual, and that which is Spiritual does not differ from the


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97123:40"/>
Spirit; and ſo there is a ſpiritual Body, and there is a natural Body; and there
is a ſpiritual Man, and there is a natural Man, and each hath their Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> He plainly here denies a difference or diſtinction <hi>between Christ's
Body of Fleſh and his Spirit,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>The Saints eat his Fleſh, and they
that eat his Fleſh, hath it in them.</hi> Now what Fleſh can they have of Chriſt
in them, but what is merely Spirit? whereas his Opponent (and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
when they ſpeak of Chriſts Fleſh, they) meant a real Body, as
real as the Body of any other Man. And whereas <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith Chriſt's
Fleſh was not from the Ground or Earth, the Scripture ſaith no ſuch
thing, but the contrary, that he did partake of the ſame Fleſh and Blood
with the Children, wherefore he is not aſham'd to call them Brethren<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. 11, 14.</note>
               <hi>G. F.</hi> doth both Ignorantly and Fallaciouſly play and quible about the
Word <hi>Carnal,</hi> againſt his Opponent, who ſaid Chriſt had a <hi>Carnal Body;</hi>
he Anſwers, <hi>Carnal, indeed, is Death, ſaith the Scripture;</hi> but here he belyes
the Scripture; it ſaith not, the Carnal Body is Death, but to be Carnally-minded
is Death. Could <hi>G. F.</hi> be ſo ſottiſh, as not to diſtinguiſh between
a Carnal Body, and a Carnal Mind? His Opponents who ſaid, Chriſt
had a Carnal Body united to the Divinity, they meant not Carnal, as it
ſignifies Vicious or Corrupted, but as it ſignifies Material, <hi>i. e.</hi> a real Body,
as real a Bodily Subſtance, as any other Man hath; and tho' Chriſt's
Body now in Heaven is a Spiritual Body, yet it is a Body ſtill, and the ſame
Body in Subſtance it was on Earth. And when it was on Earth, it was
both a Material Body, and yet, in a ſenſe, a Spiritual, <hi>i. e.</hi> a pure, imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
Body, without all ſtain of Sin, a moſt holy Body; and, in the like
ſenſe, it might be ſaid, even when on Earth, it was a heavenly Body, to
wit, as oppoſed to ſinful, corrupt, and tainted with Sin; and not only ſo,
but in reſpect of its miraculous Conception, by the Holy Ghoſt, and the
holy and heavenly Virtues it was endued with above the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi>
in Innocency: And thus the compariſon is made betwixt the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
and the Second; the firſt Man, even as he was in Innocency, is of the
Earth, Earthly; his Body was Created or Made by God Almighty, but
was neither ſo wonderfully framed, nor endued with ſuch excellent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
as our Lord's Body was: Tho' the Subſtance of both was the ſame
in <hi>Specie</hi> or <hi>Kind,</hi> yet the difference was great, both in the manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and the Virtues and Properties wherewith Chriſt's Body was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
above <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body, and chiefly in reſpect of the Hypoſtatical and
Perſonal Union, betwixt Chriſt's Body or Fleſh, and the Eternal Word,
Eternally Begotten of the Father. It was an old Hereſie of the <hi>Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
That Chriſt's Body that was Born of the Virgin, had no part of her
Body, but did penetrate her Body, as the Beams of the Sun penetrate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal,
and did entirely come from Heaven; which Hereſie was reviv'd
by <hi>Meno,</hi> a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> but is effectually and ſolidly refuted by <hi>Calvin,</hi>
in his <hi>Inſtitutions, lib. 2. c.</hi> 13. And as to the Quakers arguing from 1 <hi>Cor.
15, 47. The first man of the earth, earthly, the ſecond Man, the Lord, from
heaven,</hi> that therefore his Body had not an earthly Subſtance, which is
the ſame Argument <hi>Manicheus</hi> uſed of old; <hi>Calvin</hi> anſwereth ſolidly thus,

                  <hi>Manicheus</hi> maketh

<hi>Adam,</hi> from heaven, heavenly: But neither doth the Apoſtle there
infer, that the Eſſence of his Body is heavenly, but that there is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Virtue, which, being diffuſed from Chriſt, doth quicken us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Art.</hi> 7. of that Paper, <q>Our really Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and Confeſſing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his Paſſion, Sufferings,
Death, Atonement, and Reconciliation made for us, and his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Aſcention, and Glorification (as without us) according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
cannot be to allegorize theſe away, as if only tranſacted within us, as
we have been unduly accuſed, for they were really done, and tranſacted
without us, by our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, tho' our true knowledge of the
Power and Effect of his Reſurrection, and Fellowſhip of his Sufferings,
and our being conformable to his Death, muſt be experienc'd within us,
if ever we live and reign with him. And in their Paper annexed, <hi>Art.</hi> 2.
they ſay, we ſincerely Believe and Confeſs, that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who
was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the true Meſſiah, the very Chriſt, the
Son of the Living God, to whom all his Prophets gave Witneſs. And
we do highly value his Death, Sufferings, Works, Offices, and Merits,
for the Redemption and Salvation of Mankind, together with his Laws,
Doctrine and Miniſtry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That all this ſeemingly fair Confeſſion, cannot but be judged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
Fallacious, ſeeing they will not Retract any of their former aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
expreſly contradictory to the ſame, as is in great part already proved,
out of the above-given Quotations. How do they ſincerely Confeſs, that
Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was the very Chriſt,
the Son of the Living God, ſeeing they profeſs to be of one Faith with <hi>W. P.</hi>
who ſaith, <hi>That that Outward Perſon that Suffered [at</hi> Jeruſalem] <hi>was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the Son of God, we utterly deny,</hi> as above-quoted? And to be of <hi>E. B.</hi>'s
Faith, who denyeth that Chriſt is in Heaven in our Nature? And of
<hi>G. F.</hi>'s Faith, who denyeth, That Chriſt's Body was from the Earth? But
yet more fully to detect their Fallacies.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Their really Believing and Confeſſing Christ's Paſſion,
Sufferings, Death, Atonement, and Reconciliation, made for us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cannot be
to allegorize theſe away, as if only tranfacted within us, as we have been unduly
accuſed.</hi> To detect his Fallacy here, <hi>Note,</hi> I know none that accuſe them, for
holding that Chriſt's Birth and Death was only tranſacted within them; they
grant that a Man call'd Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> was outwardly Born and Suffered
Death; but ſome of the chief of them have ſaid, That that Man was not
properly the Chriſt, nor Son of God, but was by the metonymy of the thing
Containing for the thing Contained ſo called; ſo <hi>W. P.</hi> as above-quoted.
Next they make his being outwardly Slain, and his Blood outwardly
Shed, and what was outwardly tranſacted by him, both Actively and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,
a Figure of what he was to do and ſuffer in Men, of his inward
Crucifying, his Blood inwardly Shed, his Burial, Reſurrection, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
within them. Theſe outward tranſactions, ſaith <hi>W. P.</hi> are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97123:41"/>
facile repreſentations of what was to be accompliſhed in Men, as above-quoted,
and <hi>G. W.</hi> beſide the Proofs already given out of his Books to that
Effect, he hath lately affirmed in his<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Antidote</hi> p. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Antidote against the Venom of
the Snake,</hi> Printed in the Year 1697, That <hi>that Blood of his [viz.</hi> Chriſt's
outward Blood] <hi>as well as the Water that came out of his Side with it, had
an ALLEGORICAL and MYSTERIOUS SIGNIFICATION, as well as an
Outward and Literal, even of the Spiritual Blood and Water of Life, which Chriſt,
our High Priest, Sprinkleth, and really Waſheth our Hearts and Conſciences withal,
which, we hope, no ſenſible Soul will ſay, is an Outward or Literal Sprinkling or
Waſhing, but an Inward and Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> When we charge <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Brethren with Allegorizing away
Chriſt's Birth, Paſſion, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Blood, Atonement,
and Reconciliation made for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſenſe is obvious, which is this,
That tho' they grant, that a Man called Chriſt was outwardly Born, Dyed,
had his Blood ſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all this was an Allegory, and had an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical
Signification of Chriſt truly and really (without an Allegory) Born
within them, Crucified and Dead within them, his Blood ſhed within them,
Buried, Riſen, Aſcended within them; Atonement, Reconciliation made
within them. Now, that this is ſo, we have <hi>G. W.</hi>'s plain Confeſſion, in
the Words juſt now quoted. So that, according to him, Chriſt's Sufferings
without, his Blood ſhed without, is the Allegory, or Allegorical Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt's Sufferings within, of his Blood ſhed within, the Atonement
made within, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> who were real Women, yet as <hi>Paul</hi>
hath declar'd, they are an <hi>Allegory</hi> of the Two Covenants, and Types or
Figures of them, and as far ſhort of the things ſignified by them, as the
Type is ſhort of the Subſtance, or thing ſignified; for that is the true defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of an <hi>Allegory, Where one thing is expreſſed, and another thing is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</hi>
Now if Chriſt's Birth, Sufferings, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without Men, be an
<hi>Allegory,</hi> or Allegorical Signification of Chriſt's Birth, Sufferings, Blood
ſhed and ſprinkled within Men; that Within muſt be the Reality, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing ſignified, or typified by the outward; but both cannot be
the Allegory, as to ſay, that as Chriſt's Blood without us is the <hi>Allegory</hi>
of his Blood within, ſo his Blood within is the <hi>Allegory</hi> of Chriſt's Blood
without; this is as great Nonſenſe, as who would ſay, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi>
were an <hi>Allegory</hi> of the Two Covenants, ſo the Two Covenants are an
<hi>Allegory</hi> of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> And thus <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Brethren ſtand
juſtly charged with Allegorizing away Chriſt's outward Birth, Sufferings,
Blood, Atonement, by making them the Allegory of his Birth, Sufferings,
Blood, Atonement, made within Men, tho' they deny not Chriſt's Birth,
Death, Blood without, ſimply as Hiſtorically related; yet ſeeing they deny
the Merit and Efficacy of his Death and Blood without, and of what he
did and ſuffered without us, they are juſtly charg'd to <hi>Allegorize it away,</hi>
that is, to make no other account of it, than of the Hiſtory of <hi>Hagar</hi>
and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and other Types, Symbols and Allegories of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Beſides, If Men will be wilful denyers of the Hiſtorical Truth of Chriſt's
outward Birth, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, according to <hi>G. W.</hi>'s


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97123:42"/>
and his Brethren's way and method of expounding Scripture, we have no
way to convince them of their Error.</p>
            <p>If we bring <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6. to prove that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Propheſied of Chriſt's Birth,
and that the Child that ſhould be Born, ſhould be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and
his Mother ſhould be a <hi>Virgin,</hi> according to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 7. 14. And if we bring
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. to prove that <hi>Christ ſhould be wounded for our Sins, be killed, be
buried, and make his grave with the wicked;</hi> or, <hi>That Christ ſhould ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Camp;</hi> they may Anſwer, All theſe, and the like places, are to
be meant not of any Birth, Death or Burial of a Chriſt without us, but
of Chriſt Born, Slain, and Buried in Men; and, for their Proof, vouch
<hi>G. W.</hi>'s Authority and his Brethren's to confirm it, who, as above-quoted,
have expounded theſe places of Chriſt Born, Slain, Buried, within Men.
But if <hi>G. W.</hi> will ſay, theſe and other the like places have two meanings,
one Outward and Literal, and the other Inward and Spiritual; to this I
ſay, Firſt, <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> pag 21. hath ſeverely blamed his
Opponent <hi>T. D.</hi> for giving two meanings to one place. I agree to the moſt
Judicious and Orthodox Expoſitors of Scripture, that the Scriptures have
but one ſenſe or meaning, properly and ſtrictly ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
thing principally and properly intended, is but one, and what other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
or meanings may be put upon ſome places of Scripture, beſides that,
is rather an Alluſion or Allegory, than the real meaning, which, ſo far
as we have Scripture warrant, is allowed, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s calling <hi>Hagar</hi> and
<hi>Sarah</hi> an Allegory, but otherwiſe is dangerous, and in the preſent caſe is
moſt Heretical, as in <hi>G. W.</hi>'s and his Brethrens making <hi>Chriſt's Birth, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
Death, Burial without Men the Allegory,</hi> and his Birth, Sufferings,
Death, Burial, within, the Reality and Subſtance, or thing principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in theſe places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>That the Spirit of God, with his ſanctifying Gifts and Graces, is called
Water of Life, and Living Waters, whereby God doth really Purify and
Cleanſe the Hearts and Conſciences of the Faithful; and that this Work
of Sanctification is Inward and Spiritual in them, is no part of the Diſpute
or Controverſie; for this is not only granted, but earneſtly taught and
pleaded for againſt <hi>Pelagians</hi> and others who deny it, or at leaſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſuch an inward and ſpiritual Operation. Therefore <hi>G. W.</hi> in this,
as in moſt of his late Defences, doth purpoſely miſtake the true Caſe, to
hide his vile Hereſie, as if the debate betwixt him and his Opponents, were
only about the inward Operations of the Spirit of God, for the cleanſing
and ſanctifying the Hearts of the Faithful; but this is his ordinary Fallacy.
The true ſtate of the Queſtion then is this, Whether there is any <hi>Inward
Blood</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> that Chriſt Crucified in Men lets out, or is preſſed out of
him, crucified within them, that is the <hi>Blood of Atonement,</hi> is the <hi>Price</hi>
and <hi>Ranſom,</hi> and Meritorious Cauſe of the Remiſſion of our Sins; is the
<hi>ſatisfactory and propitiatory Offering for Sin,</hi> either in whole or in part?
Alſo, whether any ſuch <hi>ſuppoſed Blood or Water or Spirit,</hi> thus flowing from
Chriſt, as Crucified and Wounded within Men, is the meritorious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Cauſe either of Men's Juſtification before God, or of the ſaving
and ſanctifying Graces of the Holy Spirit; and whether the Gift of the


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97123:42"/>
Holy Spirit, given to Believers, with the ſanctifying Graces thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from Chriſt Crucified within, having made the <hi>Atonement and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
by his Blood</hi> ſhed within, Riſen and Aſcended within, Sitting at
the Right Hand of God within Men, making Interceſſion for them; or from
Chriſt, as he was crucified without us, having made the Atonement and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
without us, by his Blood ſhed without us, Riſen and Aſcended
and ſat down at the Right Hand of God without us, and there Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
for us. This is the true ſtate of the Controverſie; all true Chriſtians
ſay, that all this is from Chriſt without us; as outwardly Born, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
Riſen, Aſcended, from him thus only conſidered as without us; all
Believers have the free gift of the Remiſſion of Sins, free Juſtification free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by God's Grace [being the real effect of Chriſt's Purchaſe, and of the
Merit of his Precious Blood] and alſo the Holy Spirit, with the ſanctifying
Gifts and Graces thereof, inwardly to renew and ſanctifie them. So
that the Work of Chriſt or of the Spirit in Believers, is not at all, either
in whole or in part, to ſuffer for our Sins, or to procure by <hi>way of Merit,</hi>
the pardon of our Sins, and our Peace and Reconcliation with God, for
that's wholly and only done by Chriſt without us; but to work the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Faith of all that he hath done and ſuffer'd for us without us, and give
us the Spiritual Knowledge and Comfort of it, in our Hearts and
Souls.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Plaiſter</hi> and <hi>healing Medicine</hi> of Chriſt's Body and Blood was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for us, when he gave his Precious Body to be broken for us, and his
Blood to be ſhed for us; this was once done, and is no more to be doue
again; <hi>Christ having once dyed, dyeth no more;</hi> by the one Offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
once only offered without us [his Soul, Body, and Blood] he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and completely prepared the <hi>wholſom Medicine and Food of Life for
us:</hi> But now the work of Chriſt, and his Spirit in us, is to apply it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
to us [that is] to enable us effectually to apply it to our ſelves
for our Eternal Health and Salvation; to give us a Spiritual diſcovery and
ſight of that living Food, a Hunger and Appetite after it, and to teach us
ſpiritually by Faith to receive it, and feed upon it, to eat his Fleſh, and
drink his Blood, not by the bodily Mouth, but by the Mouth of the Soul,
which is Faith, a true and living Faith wrought in us by the powerful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of Chriſt in us, or his Spirit. And tho' the Blood of Chriſt that
both juſtifieth and ſanctifieth is without us, yet the application by Faith
is within, both for our Juſtification and Sanctification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> again, That as <hi>G. W.</hi> doth fallaciouſly ſtate the Queſtion, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men's being Cleanſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> Juſtified and Sanctified <hi>by the Blood of
Christ,</hi> as is above-ſhewed, ſo he argueth moſt fallaciouſly for his falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>of a Blood of Christ within Men,</hi> to be the Atonement, by the merit
whereof they are Cleanſed from Sin; as becauſe the Operation of the
Spirit of God is within Men, whereby he applieth to them the <hi>Merit, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of Chriſt's Blood, (which application, by a <hi>Metaphorical
Speech</hi> is call'd in Scripture, <hi>A ſprinkling the Conſcience,</hi>) that therefore the
Blood of Chriſt is Inward; which is the like Sophiſtical and Nonſenſical
Argument with that of <hi>G. F. The Saints eat the Fleſh of Christ, therefore


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97123:43"/>
they have it in them.</hi> Thus they both argue from a Metaphorical Eating and
Sprinkling or Cleanſing to a <hi>Literal</hi> or <hi>Material;</hi> as becauſe what Men
eat of <hi>Material Food,</hi> they receive it into them; ſo becauſe they eat <hi>Chriſts
Fleſh,</hi> they have it in them; and becauſe the <hi>Blood of Christ Sprinkles</hi> the
Hearts and Conſciences of the Faithful, therefore that <hi>Blood</hi> is in them,
not conſidering the application here, both with reſpect to Eating and Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
is not Material but Spiritual, by Faith, as Chriſt hath plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
it, that <hi>to eat Christ is to believe in him;</hi> to eat his Fleſh and drink
his Blood, is ſincerely <hi>to believe</hi> with the Heart, that Chriſt gave his <hi>Body
of Fleſh</hi> to be broken for us, <hi>and his Blood</hi> to be ſhed for us, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of our Sins, and both for our Juſtification and Sanctification, and
eternal Salvation. Joh. 6. 35. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, he
that believeth in me ſhall never thirſt;</hi> and verſe 40. <hi>This is the will of him
that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have
everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Whereas they ſay in that Printed Paper above-quoted, ſigned
by <hi>G. W.</hi> and Thirty more, <q>We do highly value his Death, Sufferings,
Works, Offices and Merits for the Redemption and Salvation of Mankind.</q>
That all this is extremely Fallacious doth largely appear from what is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted:
Do they highly value his Death and Sufferings, when ſome among
them have Printed, as above-quoted, That when they come to the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit or Light Within them, they will ceaſe remembring Chriſts
Death at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Do they value Chriſt's Sufferings and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
who deny it to be the Goſpel that Chriſt impowered the Apoſtles to Preach;
for which hear what they ſay in their Book above-quoted, call'd, <hi>A Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
for the true Christ,</hi> &amp;c. p. 16. Their Opponent they quote ſaying,
[p. 16.] <hi>Christ impowered the Apoſtles to go forth to Preach the Goſpel to the
ends of the Earth; which Goſpel was his Sufferings, Death and Reſurrection, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. To this they
Anſwer, <q>The Goſpel which they Preached was Everlaſting, it was the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God to Salvation, to as many as Believed both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
But were his Sufferings, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Everlaſting?</q> Is this good Doctrine,
ſay they. So that according to them, it is not good Doctrine, but bad, to
Preach Chriſt's Sufferings, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be the Goſpel either in whole or
in part; for their reaſon is of equal force againſt that Doctrine either in
whole or in part, The Goſpel is <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> but Chriſt's Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<hi>&amp;c. [Note</hi> the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which both the Opponent and they add] is
not Everlaſting, for that they ſay was Temporal, therefore Chriſt's Death
and Sufferings is not the Goſpel; and by this their profound Logick,
or rather beggarly Sophiſtry, nothing is the Goſpel, but that which is Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
<hi>i. e.</hi> was from Eternity to Eternity; and thus, according to them,
nothing is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but the <hi>Light Within,</hi> becauſe that is <hi>Everlaſting;</hi> the
Power, the Spirit, the Light is <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> and therefore that only is the
Goſpel. But tho' the Spirit, and Power, and Light, was and is Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet it was not within them from Everlaſting, becauſe they were not
from Everlaſting; and therefore by their Logick, as the Light or Spirit is in
them, and as t<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Gift of God to them, it is no more the Goſpel, than


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97123:43"/>
Chriſt's Death and Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they had it not within them from
Everlaſting, if they will acknowledge themſelves to be <hi>Creatures,</hi> Created
and Made by the Great <hi>Creator</hi> in Time. But they quibble Sophiſtically
upon the word Everlaſting; for tho' Chriſt's Suffering and Death were not
Everlaſting, yet both the Merit, Virtue and Efficacy of them, both for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Remiſſion of Sin, and the Holy Spirit with the ſanctifying Gifts and
Graces thereof, was from the beginning of the World, and will continue
to the end of the World; yea, and to all Eternity; and the Doctrine of
it in ſome meaſure was Preached from the beginning, as God revealed it
firſt to our firſt Parents, and then ſucceſſively to others of his Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and was held forth, both by Prophecy, Promiſe and Sacrifices to the
Faithful.</p>
            <p>Again, They are groſly Fallacious, when they ſay in that Printed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>We do highly value and eſteem his Sufferings, Death, Precious Blood, and
whole Sacrifice for Sinners—Works, Offices, and Merits for the Redemption
and Salvation of Mankind.</hi> But, what do they mean by Chriſt's Merits?
Do they mean the Merits of what Chriſt hath done for them, without
them, ſuffered without them, his Righteonſneſs without them, his Blood
ſhed without them, ſo as thereby to be juſtified? Nay, The following Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
will ſufficiently evidence the contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> That not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
or <hi>Merits,</hi> or Blood of Chriſt ſhed without us, but the <hi>Merits</hi> of
Chriſt within them, his Righteouſneſs wrought in them, his Blood ſhed
within them, the Blood of his Divinity or Godhead, but not of his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or Humane Blood, by which they are juſtified; for further proof of
which hear what <hi>G. W.</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> p. 48. where he blames
<hi>T. Danſon,</hi> and chargeth it on him to be falſe Doctrine held by him, <hi>That
there were two Righteouſneſſes of Chriſt, the one without the Saints to juſtifie
them, and the other within the Saints that did ſanctifie them.</hi> And in p. 26.
he chargeth <hi>T. Danſon</hi> with Ignorance, <hi>for his aſſerting two Righteouſneſſes of
Chriſt, [the one without us for Juſtification, the other within us for Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>]
And in p. 35. <hi>He argueth againſt Juſtification by a Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt without us, thus, If it be the ſame Chriſt that juſtifies and Janctifies, then
it's but one and the ſame Righteouſneſs, which effecteth both theſe in and for the
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in p. 19. he expreſly defends that <hi>Popiſh Argument</hi> uſed by <hi>S. Fiſher,</hi>
[the very ſame Argument is uſed by <hi>Bellarmin, De Juſtif.] That becauſe
evil Works are meritorious of Condemnation, therefore good Works [wrought by us
in the Spirit] are a meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification:</hi> But <hi>T. Danſon</hi> doth
effectually Anſwer the Argument, by denying the Conſequence; and that
it can have no force unleſs the good Works we work, even by the help
of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Voice of Wiſdom, <hi>p.</hi> 36.</note> were, in all reſpects, <hi>Perfect and Sinleſs,</hi> and that we had
always <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled the Law from firſt to laſt, which no Man ever did
but Chriſt. And he gives another good reaſon, why he denyeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
<hi>Becauſe the Righteouſneſs which God works in us is but</hi> Finite, <hi>as
well as other effects;</hi> his ſenſe is obvious, No Righteouſneſs can <hi>Merit</hi> our
Juſtification before God, but that which is of an <hi>Infinite value;</hi> and therefore
the Righteouſneſs of a meer Man, had it been Perfect and Sinleſs from the


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97123:44"/>
firſt moment of his Life to his Death, could not be of Merit for the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of others; and, indeed, ſtrictly ſpeaking, not of <hi>Merit</hi> for his own
Juſtification; he could only have been juſtified by his own good Works
(aſſiſted to do them by the Spirit) by fulfilling the terms of the Law or
Covenant of Works; but becauſe Chriſt was not meer Man, but both
God and Man, therefore his Righteouſneſs and Obedience is of that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Value and Merit, that is ſufficient for all that lay hold on it for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
by a true and lively Faith. Now to both theſe good and ſolid
Reaſons <hi>G. W.</hi> Anſwers moſt Ignorantly; Firſt in aſſerting, That the good
Works which we work by the Spirit, or which the Spirit works in us are
Perfect, and are the fulfilling of the Law, and therefore deſerving Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
but to this I have anſwered above, and diſcovered his Ignorance,
[ſee the Firſt Part, <hi>p.</hi> 13.] To his 2d Reaſon <hi>G. W.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
which God effects in us is not Finite, but Infinite,</hi> [Voice of Wiſdom,
p. 36.] <hi>for Christ is God's Righteouſneſs, and Christ is formed in us,</hi> Gal. 4.
19. <hi>and ſo that Righteouſneſs which God works in us by his Spirit, is of the
ſame Kind and Nature with that which worketh it, for the Saints are made
partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, how he magnifies the Righteouſneſs wrought by the Spirit
in Men; not only to be Perfect with a Sinleſs Perfection, but <hi>DEIPIES</hi>
it, ſo as to make it equal to God himſelf, arguing that the Righteouſneſs
which God works in us, is of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with that which worketh it;
ſurely whatever is of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with God, is equal to God, yea, is
God; for, becauſe Chriſt, <hi>as he is the Eternal Word,</hi> is of the <hi>ſame Nature</hi>
with God, therefore he is equal with God, and is God.</p>
            <p>But, obſerve a prodigious Fallacy in <hi>G. W.</hi> to defend his Blaſphemy. In
his <hi>Truth and Innoc.</hi> p. 60. in defence of that paſſage above-quoted out of
his <hi>Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>My meaning ſimply of the word [Infinite] was
that God's Righteouſneſs, which he effects in us, is Everlaſting, and without end,</hi>
Pſal. 119. 142. <hi>And Christ is ſaid to be of God made unto us Wiſdom and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>I hope</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>none will deny him to be Infinite, or his work of Righteouſneſs, and the effect
thereof to be quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> And thus he would heal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by giving us his ſenſe of the word Infinite, that he meant ſimply,
that it was Everlaſting and without end. But to detect this prodigiouſly
dull Sophiſtry, [I call it not prodigious for the Wit of it, but the Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it,] the nature of <hi>G. W.</hi>'s Argument did not only carry the ſenſe
of the word <hi>Infinite</hi> to be endleſs, but to be every way Infinite, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being grounded on this, That that Righteouſneſs which God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us <hi>is of the ſame Kind and Nature</hi> with that which worketh it: Now
the Nature of God is not only endleſs, but Infinite every way; his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and Holineſs not only extendeth beyond all Times and Ages, but
beyond all <hi>Degrees and Meaſures of Created Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever ſenſe the word <hi>Infinite</hi> may be allowed in other caſes to
have; as to ſay a Nation is Infinitely Rich, as <hi>Nahum</hi> 3. 9. yet in this
caſe of the Controverſie betwixt <hi>T. Danſon</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> the word <hi>Infinite</hi> can
have no ſuch limited or ſtrained ſenſe; neither did <hi>T. Danſon</hi> underſtand


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97123:44"/>
it in that ſenſe, as only to ſignifie <hi>Endleſs.</hi> And <hi>G. W.</hi> did he know the
true Law of Diſputants, ſhould know, That when he anſwereth to his
Opponent's Argument, he ſhould take the word of his Opponent in the
ſenſe of his Opponent, becauſe the force of the Argument lies upon that
ſenſe. For <hi>T. Danſon</hi>'s Argument had not this ſenſe, That becauſe the
Righteouſneſs that God works in Men, is not Endleſs, therefore it is not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
of Juſtification; for granting it to be Endleſs [that is, Infinite in
<hi>G. W.</hi>'s ſenſe] as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Charity, it never faileth, every
degree of it is Endleſs; but it will not therefore follow, that it is merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of Juſtification, becauſe it hath no end of duration, for ſo the Soul
it ſelf ſhould be meritorious of Juſtification, becauſe it is Endleſs; yea,
the Souls of bad Men and Devils are Endleſs and Infinite in <hi>G. W.</hi>'s ſenſe;
do they therefore merit Juſtification? But the force of <hi>T. Danſon</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lyeth in this, <hi>That Righteouſneſs alone can be meritorious of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
before God, that is Infinite in Value and Worth</hi> (that is) <hi>equivalent, and
infinitely more than equivalent, to the Righteouſneſs, not only of all the moſt holy
Angels that never ſinned, but of all the Men, that ever lived or ſhall live,
had they</hi> (by Suppoſition) <hi>lived as holily and righteouſly as the holy Law of
God required them to live from firſt to laſt; yet ſuch a Righteouſneſs as this, of
all ſuch holy Angels and Men, being but a Finite Righteouſneſs with reſpect
to its intrinſick worth and value, could not be ſufficiently meritorious for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
of one Man that has ſinned, tho' ſuppoſe but once all his Life
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Christ,</hi> to wit, his moſt holy and perfect
Obedience, which he performed without us, was not the Righteouſneſs of a
<hi>meer Man,</hi> but of him, who was both <hi>God and Man,</hi> therefore it is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Righteouſneſs, i. e.</hi> of Infinite value before God, by way of merit to
obtain the Juſtification of true Penitents and Believers; and when ſound
Chriſtian-Teachers ſay, The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which he performed
without us, for our Juſtification, is an Infinite Righteouſneſs, they mean
not that it was <hi>Phyſically Infinite,</hi> but Morally, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Infinite value be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, by reaſon of the <hi>Hypoſtatical Union</hi> of the Humane Nature of Chriſt
with the <hi>Eſſential and Eternal Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>G. W.</hi> thought to excuſe <hi>S. F.</hi> and himſelf from the imputation of
<hi>Popery,</hi> on the Point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and that very handſomly, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Quakers ſay, It's only the works that they work by the Spirit's
help, that are <hi>meritorious</hi> of Juſtification. But this will not excuſe them
from <hi>Popery;</hi> for even <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a great Popiſh Author, and the other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Authors, plead only for the merit of ſuch good Works, (which merit
by Condignity,) as wrought by the help of the Holy Spirit aſſiſting
them.</p>
            <p>And his Sophiſtry is as dull, in his drawing an Argument from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30.
<q>That Chriſt is made unto us of God, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and
Sanctification and Redemption, therefore that Believers are juſtified by an
Infinite Righteouſneſs wrought in them, and that Chriſt is formed in them,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:97123:45"/>
And thus he will have Chriſt, as held forth in that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.
not to be Chriſt God-Man without us, from and by whom we receive
Juſtification and Redemption, and alſo divine Wiſdom and Sanctification,
by his holy Spirit that he ſendeth into our Hearts, and by his holy Doctrine
outwardly taught us, but Chriſt formed in us; he will have to be all this
unto us,<note place="margin">Judgment Fixed, <hi>p.</hi> 330.</note> and Chriſt formed in us is the Seed, and the Seed is God over all
bleſſed for ever, as above-quoted, both out of <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> But what
then is become of his <hi>Expoſition</hi> that he gave in his <hi>Judgment Fixed</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted,
That this Birth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Chriſt formed in true Believers, <hi>is not Christ
Jeſus;</hi> for he is that incorruptible Seed and Word of Life, which begets,
forms and brings forth the Soul of Man into his own Nature and Image;
and ſo Chriſt may be ſaid to be formed in us <hi>in a Myſterious and Elegant
way of ſpeaking, the Property</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> being put for the <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how he wavers to and fro, betwixt <hi>So</hi> and <hi>No,</hi> and <hi>No</hi> and
<hi>So, ſometimes This, and ſometimes That: and ſometimes neither This nor That;</hi>
a Phraſe that <hi>S. F.</hi> uſed to ſome of his Opponents, but very juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to <hi>G. W.</hi> But differing ſenſes and meanings are more tolerable for a
Man to put on his Words, than plain contradictions, and eſpecially in
Matters Fundamental, as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Next, let us hear what <hi>W. P.</hi> hath ſaid on the Doctrine of Juſtification,
and how <hi>J. Wyeth</hi> in his <hi>Switch</hi> defends him.</p>
            <p>W. Penn <hi>in his</hi> Serious Apology <hi>p. 148, gives the charge of his Opponent
thus,</hi> That we deny Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs which Christ hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his own Perſon for us (<hi>wholly without us</hi>) and therefore deny the
Lord that bought us; <hi>W. P. Anſwers;</hi> And indeed this we deny and boldly
affirm it in the Name of the Lord, to be the Doctrine of Devils, and an Arm of
the Sea of Corruption, which does now deluge the whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſaith</hi> Joſ. Wyeth, <hi>that hardy Champion, to this,</hi> Switch <hi>p.</hi> 238. Yes
it is ſtill true, and that we do deny, and boldly affirm to be the Doctrine of
Devils; and for our ſo denying and affirming, we have the warrant of Holy
Writ, wherein is abundantly teſtifyed of the Spirit of Christ in Man, to which
he must be obedient in order to his Juſtification; <hi>for which he quotes</hi> Rom. 3.

               <hi>Note,</hi> Here <hi>J. Wyeth</hi> acts the dull Sophiſter as much as his Elder Brother
<hi>G. W.</hi> by perverting the true ſtate of the Queſtion, as is their frequent
manner. The Queſtion is not, What is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> by way of <hi>Inſtrument</hi> or
<hi>Inſtrumental Application,</hi> or <hi>Preparatory Condition,</hi> in order to Juſtification;
ſuch as Faith and Repentance; for ſuch are granted to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as the ſtretching out the Hand is neceſſary to receive
an Alms, or free Gift, and the opening the <hi>Mouth</hi> is neceſſary to receive
<hi>Food;</hi> but the true ſtate of the Queſtion is, What is the <hi>procuring</hi> and <hi>purchaſing</hi>
Cauſe of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God, <hi>by way of Merit,</hi> or the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe
of our Juſtification;</hi> whether the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt that he wrought <hi>without
us,</hi> by his <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> above Sixteen Hundred Years ago,
Yea, or Nay; If Yea, ſurely that is <hi>wholly without us;</hi> but this ſays <hi>W. P.</hi>
and <hi>J. W.</hi> is a Doctrine of Devils; and <hi>G. W.</hi> chargeth <hi>T. D.</hi> with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97123:45"/>
and falſe Doctrine for affirming it, as above-quoted; and yet it is
the very plain Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Iſa. 53. 4, 5, 11, 12. Rom.
3. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28. Rom. 4. 4, 11. Rom. 5. 18. Gal. 3. 22. 2 Cor.</hi>
5. 21.</p>
            <p>There are other Arguments which <hi>W. P.</hi> uſeth in his <hi>Serious Apology,</hi>
ſome of which I ſhall mention, not to refute them, for the leaſt Child in
Chriſtianity may do that, but to ſhow his Error; one of which is, <hi>Death
came by actual Sin, not imputative, therefore Juſtification unto Life comes by actual
Righteouſneſs, and not imputative.</hi> Another is, <hi>This ſpeaks Peace to the Wicked.</hi>
Another is, <hi>Men are Dead and Alive at the ſame time by this Doctrine. Note,</hi> He
perverts the ſtate of the Queſtion; his Opponents do not ſay, That Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and Unſanctified Perſons are juſtified; but if none be juſtified, but
who are Perfect vvith a Sinleſs Perfection, and have not the leaſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
then neither <hi>W. P.</hi> nor any Quaker, ever vvas, or is juſtified; for
vvhatever they boaſt of their Sinleſs Perfection, their vile Errors, Pride
and Uncharitableneſs, as vvell as other their Imperfections, demonſtrate
the contrary. Another of his Arguments is againſt our Juſtification by
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs without us, <hi>Our rejoycing must be in our ſelves and
not in another;</hi> thus perverting <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, <hi>Gal. 6. 4. But let every Man
prove his own work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf, and not in
another.</hi> But doth this exclude our rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus our Head.
who to be ſure is another? O ſad! How contrary to this is <hi>Philip 3. 3.
For we are the Circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in
Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the Fleſh;</hi> by this Argument of <hi>W. P.</hi>
he for himſelf and his Brethren (whoſe Faith he pretends to deliver) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
all Rejoycing, as well as Faith and Righteouſneſs, in Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us; yea, and in Christ within them alſo;</hi> for Chriſt within them, if he
be within them, is <hi>Another.</hi> Dare <hi>W. P.</hi> or <hi>G. W.</hi> ſay, Chriſt in <hi>W. P.</hi> or
<hi>G. W.</hi> is <hi>W. P.</hi> or <hi>G. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> in his Printed Paper above-quoted, call'd, <hi>A Few
Poſitions,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith, <hi>We highly do value and eſteem his</hi> (Chriſt's) <hi>Sufferings,
Death, Precious Blood, and whole Sacrifice for Sinners:</hi> For a Proof of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity
and Sophiſtry in this, I ſhall produce ſome following Quotations,
what <hi>G. W.</hi> means by his <hi>Precious Blood,</hi> and whether he put the due va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon Chriſt's Blood that was outwardly ſhed, or upon another ſort
of inward Blood, I cannot ſay of his and his Brethrens inventing, but what
they received from <hi>Familiſts</hi> and <hi>Ranters,</hi> tho' they pretend to have it by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Inſpiration, to wit, an inward Blood, that is the Atonement and
Sacrifice for Sin, which Blood <hi>G. W.</hi> will not allow to be the Blood of Chriſt's
Humanity, but of his Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> p. 66. quotes <hi>C. Wade</hi> ſaying, <q>The Lord
hath Bought us and Redeemed us, with the Precious Blood of his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and ſaith your imagined Chriſt [<hi>viz.</hi> their Notion of a Chriſt, whoſe
Blood is ſhed within them] never had any Humane Blood to Redeem
you with; and to prove it, he brings 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 19. G. W.</hi> Anſwers, That
Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. haſt thou perverted, as thou haſt done other Scriptures, to
thy own Deſtruction; for there he witneſſes to the Blood of the Lamb, which


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97123:46"/>
Redeemed them from their vain Converſation, but doth not tell them of
Humane Blood to Redeem them with; for that which is Humane is
Earthly, but Chriſt whoſe Blood is Spiritual is Lord from Heaven, and
he is not an imagined Spirit, but a true Spirit. And what ſay'ſt thou
to this? Was that Humane Blood, which Chriſt ſaith, Except a Man
drink he hath no Life in him, and which cleanſed the Saints from all
Sin, who were Fleſh of Chriſt's Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Thus we ſee what Blood <hi>G. W.</hi> eſteems the <hi>Precious Blood</hi> of Chriſt,
not his <hi>Humane Blood,</hi> or <hi>Blood of his Humanity,</hi> and that not only he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that we are Redeemed or Cleanſed by any <hi>Blood</hi> of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> but
denyeth that Chriſt had any <hi>Humane Blood,</hi> or <hi>Blood of Humanity,</hi> and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Reaſon againſt it, That Humane is Earthly, but Chriſt, whoſe Blood
is Spiritual, is Lord from Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But again, For a further evidence of his undervaluing the outward Blood
of Chriſt, and denying it to be that Blood by which Chriſt purchaſed his
Church, in his</hi> Light and Life, <hi>p.</hi> 56. It is confeſſed (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) that God by
his own Blood purchaſed to himſelf a Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Now the Blood of
God, or that Blood that relates to God, muſt needs be Spiritual, he being a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Covenant of God is Inward and Spiritual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This Quotation was lately publiſhed in the Printed Sheet, call'd,
<hi>An Account from</hi> Colcheſter, above-mention'd; to which Seven Quakers at
<hi>Colcheſter</hi> have given a pretended Anſwer, call'd, <hi>Some Account from</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In their Anſwer to this Quotation, they quibble Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
upon the Word Spiritual. We would ask theſe Men (ſay they) if
God's own Blood be not Spiritual, whether it be Carnal, and the Blood of
his Covenant ſuch alſo? But was not the Blood that was outwardly ſhed
on the Croſs, which <hi>John</hi> ſaid he ſaw, and bare Record, real material
Blood, as really as that of other Men: And granting it to be Spiritual, as
Spiritual ſignifies Holy, as a Holy Man is a Spiritual Man, and yet is a
Carnal Man with reſpect to his Body of Fleſh, yet it was Material and
Corporal. But <hi>G. W.</hi> by Spiritual meant inward Blood, in Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and ſo expreſſed it; The Covenant (ſaith he) is Inward and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and ſo is the Blood of it; ſo that <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Inward</hi> are with him
<hi>Synonymous.</hi> But, for a further Anſwer, they quote a paſſage in <hi>G. W.</hi>'s
<hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 233, 234. where he grants, contrary to his former Doctrine,
That God purchaſed his Church, by Chriſt's <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Outward</hi> Blood,
but not only by that, but <hi>principally by the Spiritual Blood</hi> or Life of Chriſt
Jeſus; and this <hi>Spiritual Blood</hi> he holds to be <hi>Inward</hi> in Men, <hi>The Blood
is the Life, and the Life is the Light of Men,</hi> as <hi>W. Bailie</hi> phraſed it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
and confounding two ſundry Texts of Scripture. But the tenor and
tendency of <hi>G. W.</hi>'s former Arguments were altogether againſt Redemption
or Juſtification, <hi>by any natural or outward Blood whatſoever;</hi> for Humane is
Natural; but <hi>Humane Blood G. W.</hi> would by no means admit to be <hi>the
Blood of Christ,</hi> by which Men are Redeemed: So now he will have God's
own Blood to be no leſs than his own dear Son, and the Blood to be <hi>both
Natural and Outward, and Spiritual and Inward,</hi> by which we are Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
meaning by Inward Blood, his Life, Power and Spirit, in Men and


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97123:46"/>
Women; and yet, in contradiction to himſelf, he ſaith, <hi>God's ſparing not
his own Son, but delivering him up for us all, includes the whole Sacrifice of
Chriſt in Soul and Body, which were offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> If Chriſt's Soul and Body without us, were the whole Sacrifice,
the outward Blood being a part of his Body, then his Spirit, Life and
Light in us, is no part of the Sacrifice; and yet in contradiction to this
in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 44. He brings ſeveral Arguments and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but all groſly perverted to prove <hi>That Chriſt in us, offers up himſelf
a living Sacrifice,</hi> refering to <hi>W. Burnets</hi> Book, <hi>cap. prim.</hi> p. 31. Where
the words are more largely quoted thus, out of <hi>W. Smiths Primmer. We
believe that Chriſt in us, doth offer up himſelf a living Sacrifice unto God
for us, by which the Wrath and Juſtice of God is appeaſed towards us.</hi> This
layeth the whole ſtreſs upon Chriſt within Men, being the offering; but
now <hi>G. W.</hi> would ſeem to give one part to Chriſt without, and another
part to Chriſt within Men to be the offering, and to the Blood ſhed
without, that was Natural and Outward, and to the Blood ſhed within
Men, that is Spiritual and Inward. But then ſurely he gives very little to
the Blood ſhed without, that was but once, and was Natural Blood,
the Blood of the Humanity; but he gives very much to the Inward Blood
ſhed within Men, which is a more excellent Blood; it is the <hi>Blood</hi> not of
the <hi>Humanity,</hi> but of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> and is ſhed many Thouſands, yea,
Millions of times, for it is ſhed in all Men, who have lived in ſeveral
Ages of the World: And thus Chriſt hath offered up himſelf <hi>Inwardly Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of times,</hi> and had his Blood inwardly ſhed to appeaſe the Wrath and
Juſtice of God; but this is directly contrary to the Scripture, that ſaith,
That Chriſt <hi>by one Offering</hi> hath for ever <hi>perfected</hi> them that are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
and <hi>by one Offering,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28. 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>once offered,</hi> not <hi>often</hi> offered, <hi>he hath appeared to
put away ſin;</hi> and, as was Propheſied of him, a Body thou haſt prepared
me, not <hi>two Bodies,</hi> or <hi>many Bodies:</hi> And as Chriſt had not <hi>two Bodies</hi> to
be offered for our Sins,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note> ſo nor had he <hi>two Bloods,</hi> the Scripture never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
any <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt but <hi>one;</hi> we no where read in Scripture of the
<hi>Bloods</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>plural,</hi> but of <hi>Blood, ſingular.</hi> And according to <hi>G. W.</hi> the
Blood of Chriſt, in his former Books, is but one, and that is the Inward
Blood, the Blood of his Divinity, but not of his Humanity; yea, he hath
denyed the Body of Chriſt to be any part of him, whereof he conſiſteth,
as above-quoted, and conſequently, nor was the outward Blood, ſhed on
the Croſs, any part of him.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it were allowed to call the Spirit of Chriſt in Believers, or
the ſanctifying and refreſhing Influences thereof, his <hi>Blood,</hi> by way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
as Wine is call'd in Scripture, the Blood of the Grape, and Chriſt
calleth himſelf the Vine, and Believers in him the Branches, yet by no means
can the Spirit, or influence thereof in Men, be call'd the Blood ſhed for
remiſſion of Sin, the Blood of Atonement, that by way of Merit and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to Divine Juſtice, removes the guilt of Sin, and makes Peace
betwixt God and Men; for whatever <hi>Sacrifice</hi> makes <hi>Atonement</hi> for Sin,
muſt be <hi>Slain,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſhed or poured forth, as the
Beaſts that were offered for Sin under the Law, behoved to be Slain, and


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97123:47"/>
their Blood to be ſhed, which were Types of Chriſt, who was outwardly
to be ſlain, and his Blood outwardly ſhed, for without ſhedding of Blood
there is no remiſſion, as the Scripture teſtifieth; the which ſheding of Blood
muſt be by the Death of that, whoſe Body was to be Slain: Now the
pouring and ſhedding of the Spirit of Chriſt, and his Graces and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
influences into the Hearts of the Faithful, is the effect of Chriſt's
Death without us, as he was outwardly Slain and offered up for us, by
way of Merit and Purchaſe as it is alſo the effect of his Mediation and
Interceſſion for us now in Heaven by way of impetration and actual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
having received power to give thoſe gifts to Men, as he is now
at Gods Right Hand in Heaven, in his glorified Humanity, which he
procured and purchaſed for them, when he was upon Earth, in his ſtate
of Humiliation, by the proper Merit of his Obedience, both Active and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
who humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the
Death of the Croſs; wherefore God hath exalted him, to be a Prince and
a Saviour.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1. 20.</note> that the Blood of Chriſt by which he made peace
for us, is called <hi>the Blood of the Croſs,</hi> becauſe it was ſhed, and poured
forth on the Croſs, and he is ſaid to have reconciled us in his Body of
Fleſh, through Death; all which beſpeaks that our Redemption, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
by way of Purchaſe and Merit, was wholly done and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by Chriſt without us, and could not be done within us, by way
of Sacrifice and Atonement, for that required the Sacrifice to be Slain,
and the Blood thereof to be ſhed and poured forth. But the Authors of
this abominable Hereſie, which teacheth that Chriſt in Man by his Blood
ſhed in them, is the <hi>offering</hi> for Sin, and the Blood thus ſhed in them, is the
Blood of Atonement, yea, <hi>the Blood of the Croſs</hi> within them, to make things
ſeemingly conſiſt and hang together, they have invented an Inward Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion
and Killing of Chriſt in Men, as well as an inward ſhedding of
his Blood in them, to anſwer, by way of Analogy, to the outward Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Sacrifices under the old Teſtament. But when this Crucifying
or Killing of Chriſt in Men, was, beſide many other queſtions about the
manner of it, they are put hard to it to reſolve, and indeed the reſolution
of it is impoſſible, for it implys not only manifeſt contradictions to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but to all true and right Reaſon, as much as the <hi>Popiſh Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
doth. For as nothing can be properly ſaid, to have been Killed,
but what was formerly alive; If Chriſt has been Killed, ſuppoſe in every
Quaker, he behoved to be firſt alive in them; and as Chriſt in the Figure
or Type, (as ſome of them call him) was Born long before he was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
crucified; for though when he was a Child, <hi>Herod</hi> ſought his Life,
yet by his being taken by his Mother into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he was preſerved; and this
very paſſage, of Chriſt's being perſecuted by <hi>Herod,</hi> ſoon after he was Born,
the Quakers have made an Allegory, not that the inward is the Allegory
of the outward [which were ſomewhat tolerable, as ſome of the Ancients
have ſo Allegorized, though ſome went too far even ſo] but the outward
is the Allegory of the inward, and as then there paſſed ſome conſiderable
ſpace of time betwixt Chriſt's typical Birth in the outward, and his typical


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97123:47"/>
Crucifixion; ſo that being about Twelve Years of Age, he diſputed with the
Doctors, and about Thirty he began his Miniſtry, wherein he continued for
about three Years and a half, and then was Crucified; after he was Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Judas,</hi> denyed by <hi>Peter,</hi> and Sentenced to Death by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>
falſly Accuſed, and cruelly Mocked by the <hi>Jews;</hi> all which, according to
<hi>W. P.</hi> are ſo many <hi>Facile repreſentations of what is to be accompliſhed in Men.</hi>
And I have heard, ſince the difference betwixt the Quakers and me began,
<hi>about Preaching Christ without,</hi> ſome of their Preachers in their Publick Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
Preach a great deal of the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Birth, Perſecution by
<hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> Betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> denyed by <hi>Peter,</hi> Sentenced to
Death by <hi>Pilate,</hi> and made it all an Allegory of what was to be witneſſed
within, with an <hi>Exhortation to Friends to wait to have it all fulfilled and
witneſſed within them:</hi> And particularly I heard <hi>Jacob Talner,</hi> the <hi>Dutch-man</hi>
above-mention'd, Preach at a Publick Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> [about the
time our differences began there about Chriſt] <hi>That Christ must be first
Born in us, and after that must be Crucified in us,</hi> &amp;c. On which I asked
ſome of their Preachers, <hi>Were it not better, after Christ is Born in Men</hi> (uſing
their Phraſe) <hi>that Men would not Crucifie him in them, but rather that he might
live in them? For who can Crucifie Christ in Men, but they themſelves</hi> (on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that he can be Crucified?) For the Devil cannot do it by himſelf
without Men's conſent and concurrence, and being the main Actors: But
<hi>G. F.</hi> whom <hi>J. Wyeth</hi> calls the Apoſtle in this Age, hath reſolved this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
but whether effectually ſo as either conſiſtent with Scripture or true
and right Reaſon, to which no true Revelation can contradict, I leave
to the intelligent Chriſtian to judge, in a Treatiſe of his, call'd, <hi>Several
Papers given forth for the ſpreading of Truth,</hi> one of them bearing this Title,
<hi>Concerning Christ's Fleſh which was Offered,</hi> p. 54. <q>Chriſt the Lamb ſlain
from the Foundation of the World, when it began its Foundation, then
the Lamb was ſlain, then the World was ſet up in Man's Heart, that
he did not ſee the beginning nor the ending of the Works of God;
—Then came their Underſtandings to be darken'd, and Chriſt AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDING
TO THE FLESH CRUCIFIED, the Lamb Slain, that
FLESH of his, which is a Myſtery; and when the <hi>Jews</hi> did tranſgreſs
the Law of God, the Prophets told them, they OPPRESSED the Seed,
as a Cart with Sheaves. [<hi>Note,</hi> the word Oppreſſed, tho' <hi>G. W.</hi> is ſo
impudent in his <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> p. 322. as to deny that the Seed is
Chriſt and God that is Oppreſſed]—That they may come to a <hi>thing</hi>
that's <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>under,</hi> and <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>over all,</hi> and before all that is the

doth reconcile, and by the offering up his Body, his Fleſh, that which
hath been Slain from the Foundation of the World, and yet never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:—
And this Fleſh is a Myſtery; and in this Fleſh is the
Belief that takes away the Sin, that never corrupted, that is the Offering
for Sin, and the Blood of this Fleſh clear ſeth from Sin; ſo through this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

<hi>G. W.</hi> hath determined it, as above-quoted, <hi>That Christ as God doth ſuffer in

               <hi>Note,</hi> Whereas many of the Quakers, particularly <hi>G. W.</hi> doth argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

of Faith he divided from the Faith?</hi> Which Argument has no more force,

of his Sight, becauſe it is without him, and at a great diſtance from him,
but his Sight is within him. And he hath of late been heard, ſeveral times
to preach in the Quakers Meetings, that <hi>Christ without us</hi> cannot be the <hi>object</hi>
of our Faith; doth not <hi>G. F.</hi> here propoſe an object of our Faith without
us? and ſuch an object, as is very difficult, if not impoſſible, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
to wit, the Fleſh of Chriſt, which was Crucified when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned,
and that Blood of his that was then ſhed or offered together with the Fleſh,—And
<hi>in this Fleſh is the Belief</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that takes away the Sin.</hi> But
poſſibly <hi>G. W.</hi> or ſome other will ſay, the Fleſh of Chriſt that was Crucified
in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he ſinned, is conveyed or tranſmitted from him into us.
If any of them will adventure to ſay ſo, it will occaſion ſuch Intricacies and
Niceties, that the Quakers pretended plainneſs doth not ſuit with; for
<hi>G. W.</hi> in his Book, call'd, <hi>The Divine Light of Christ in Man,</hi> p. 13. giveth
this deſcription of the People call'd Quakers, <hi>That they are not only eſteemed
an illiterate People, but are a plain, ſimple, innocent People, who moſt affect
plain Scripture-Language, without any School-gloſſes or nice diſtinctions, to deck,
adorn, or illuſtrate their Chriſtian Profeſſion of Chriſt, or his Divine Light in
Men. And many thouſands may not underſtand the terms,</hi> Vehiculum Dei,
Intermediate Being, nor is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, preached among us under thoſe terms,
but in Scripture terms.</hi> [The terms <hi>Vehiculum Dei</hi> had been uſed by <hi>R. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi>
in his <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 83. and <hi>Intermediate Being</hi> by me, in ſome of my
former Writings <hi>concerning the Seed of God,</hi> or principle of God's Grace in
Men; but which we carried not to that height, nor had that ſenſe of it,
to be the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt <hi>that is the Offering for Sin,</hi> and makes
the Atonement by way of Expiation to take away the guilt of Sin.]
But is not <hi>G. W.</hi>'s Fallacy very plain in this Caſe? Did not <hi>G. F.</hi> Preach
Chriſt as he Writ and Printed concerning him; and what though <hi>G. F.</hi>
and none of the Quakers ever uſed the word VEHICULUM DEI, or IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERMEDIATE
BEING before <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>G. K.</hi> uſed them, which they
chiefly uſed to help the Quakers out of the Mire, and render (if poſſible)
the Quakers Notions about the Seed within, intelligible, but they carrying
it far beyond, whatever <hi>R. B.</hi> or I ever thought of, particularly <hi>G. F.</hi> and
<hi>G. W.</hi> as I have found by my late more exact ſearch into their Books, than
ever formerly I made; I find it not only difficult but impoſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them, either with Scripture or right and true Reaſon, and therefore I
diſown them, and whatever I have formerly Writ, that ſeemed in the leaſt
to juſtifie ſuch Notions as I have found in the Quakers Writings, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97123:48"/>
in the Writings of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> let them be as void and null, as
if they had never been Writ. [See my late Book of Retractations.] Altho',
as I have already ſaid, I carried them not ſo far, ſo much as in my thoughts,
and I think no more did <hi>R. B.</hi> as they have done.</p>
            <p>Now ſince <hi>G. W.</hi> profeſſeth that the Quakers are ſuch a plain ſimple Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who moſt affect plain Scripture Language, how is it that both <hi>G. W.</hi>
himſelf, and G. F. the chief Leaders and Teachers among them have gone ſo
far from Scripture Language about <hi>Christ within,</hi> that they have run into
moſt wild and extravagant Notions, that they ſucked in from Familiſts
and Ranters about Chriſt within? Where do they find ſuch Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
That <hi>Chriſt, according to the Fleſh, was crucified when</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned,
and his Blood then ſhed,</hi> and that that <hi>Fleſh,</hi> then crucified, was the <hi>Offering</hi>
for <hi>Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> of that Fleſh cleanſeth away Sin, and that <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
or Faith is in that Offering, the Fleſh that was then Crucified:</hi> And where
doth G. W. find his wild Notion of a <hi>Blood of Christ within Men,</hi> that
cleanſeth from Sin, by way of Sacrifice and Atonement; or of any other
<hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, than the <hi>Blood</hi> of his <hi>Humanity;</hi> for tho' that place of
Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. calls the Blood of Chriſt, wherewith he purchaſed
his Church, <hi>the Blood of God,</hi> yet it doth not ſay, it was a <hi>Blood within Men,</hi>
or the Blood of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and not of <hi>Christ's Humanity;</hi> it is call'd the
<hi>Blood</hi> of God, becauſe Chriſt, whoſe Blood it was, was not a meer Man,
but both God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus was God, tho' his <hi>Godhead</hi>
was not his <hi>Manhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to this <hi>Conveyance</hi> of Chriſt's Fleſh, conveyed or tranſmitted from
<hi>Adam</hi> into his Poſterity, ſince his Fall, what Scripture Language is this?
If any of them will dare ſo to affirm, give us Chapter and Verſe for any
ſuch Doctrine or Terms? But yet further to diſcover the groſsneſs of this
wild Notion: Is this Fleſh of Chriſt conveyed or tranſmitted into his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
<hi>Crucified</hi> or <hi>Alive?</hi> If they ſay <hi>Crucified,</hi> it is ſcarcely intelligible,
how <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>crucified</hi> Fleſh, however ſo Spiritual, can be <hi>conveyed</hi> or <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>
from <hi>Adam</hi> into us; or how any <hi>crucified Seed</hi> or <hi>Principle</hi> can be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed;
and ſeeing that as we are all deſcended of <hi>Noah,</hi> and he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
of <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> was deſcended of <hi>Adam,</hi> by humane Generation,
long after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, <hi>and the Seed of the Woman</hi> was promiſed to him, it is
moſt probable, That if there was any <hi>crucified</hi> Fleſh, or <hi>Body of Christ</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
when he Fell, that <hi>crucified Body, Seed or Principle, was quickened and
raiſed in him, ſome time before he begot</hi> Seth, <hi>and it will-therefore follow rather,
that ſuch a Body, Seed or Principle, if conveyed or tranſmitted from</hi> Adam <hi>into
his Poſterity, is conveyed alive and not dead.</hi> Beſide, how can it be conveyed
by natural Generation? Indeed, many of the Quakers deny any convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> by natural Generation, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> denyed of old,
becauſe they cannot comprehend with their Reaſon, how ſuch a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
can be; to be ſure it is altogether remote from all rational Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
as well as from Scripture, that ſuch a <hi>Noble Principle,</hi> as <hi>the Seed
of God,</hi> ſhould come by natural Generation, and ſo come to all Men, even
the Children of Heathens, as well as the Children of Believers, as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
commonly Teach; yea, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>G. M.</hi> p. 209. <hi>Every Man AT


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97123:49"/>
HIS COMING INTO THE WORLD hath a Light from Christ, him by whom
the World was made, which is more than Conſcience.</hi> But if every Man has
that Light at his coming into the World, then Heathen Infants have it;
and ſeeing they have it from Chriſt, whether they have it Immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed,
or Mediately, by natural Generation, through their Parents, as they
have their natural Fleſh? If Immediately from Chriſt, it is more rational
to ſuppoſe it is not crucified nor killed at its firſt reception: Beſide, how
can it be a ſlain or dead Thing in them, when it <hi>convinceth them of the
ſins of Lying, Thieft, and the like, and ſpeaketh to them in their Hearts and
Conſciences, and teacheth them their whole duty to God and Man, if they will
obey it; yea, an entire Syſteme of Orthodox Divinity;</hi> If <hi>J. Wyeth</hi> can be
believed, how can it do all this, and be a dead or crucified thing in
them?</p>
            <p>Theſe are but ſome of the inexplicable and unintelligible Difficulties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
many more that might be mentioned, which the <hi>wild Notions</hi> and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> eſpecially, as far from Scripture Language, as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is from Light, have led them into, and many others whom they have
bewildred with them, notwithſtanding G. W.'s fallacious pretences of his
Brethren and Himſelf, <hi>being an innocent, plain, ſimple People, that moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Scripture Language,</hi> when, indeed, no Society call'd Chriſtians (nay not
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) have ſo much deviated from Scripture Language, as
well as Scripture Doctrine and Senſe, as they have done.</p>
            <p>But let none from this infer, that I do not own the Doctrine and Faith of
<hi>Christ within,</hi> and of his Divine Teachings, Inſpirations and Illuminations,
for that I do withal my Heart, as truly as ever I did, and, I hope, rather
better; only I deny the Quakers wild, extravagant and blaſphemous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Chriſt within, and particularly of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> above-mention'd,
who affirm that Chriſt is Crucified in all unregenerate Perſons, and that
the Fleſh of this crucified Chriſt in them is the Offering for Sin, and the
Belief is to be in this Fleſh, and the Blood of this Fleſh cleanſeth from all
Sin: Which Fleſh was crucified in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he Fell; but how from
<hi>Adam</hi> it came into them, either crucified or alive, is not intelligible, and
therefore no proper object of Faith; but if they ſay it is alive in all Men,
at its firſt reception, or at their firſt coming into the World, then all Men
are Born Sanctified and ſpiritually Regenerated, Heathens as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
for the great difference that the Quakers give betwixt Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and Unregenerated Perſons, lies in this, That the Seed Chriſt is alive
in the Regenerated, but crucified and dead in the Unregenerated.</p>
            <p>But yet again, to ſhew how much <hi>G. W.</hi> acts the Sophiſter in his late
pretences to own, the Merit of the Blood of Chriſt that was outwardly ſhed,
which yet he hath ſo plainly denied in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> and mightily,
oppoſed it, <hi>That the ſhedding of that Blood upon the Croſs was the meritorious cauſe
of Man's Juſtification,</hi> in p. 8. Of <hi>Light and Life</hi> he blames <hi>W. B. For laying
a twofold ſtreſs upon that Blood, 1. Merit to Salvation, 2. Work to Sanctification,
and</hi> infers againſt <hi>W. B</hi>'s twofold aſſertion, <hi>That in his ſo doing, he hath ſet it</hi>
(viz that Blood) <hi>up above God, for God could not ſave he ſaith,</hi> and <hi>yet is not
in being, groſs abſurdity ſaith</hi> G. W. Here the force of <hi>G. W.</hi>'s Sophiſtical


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97123:49"/>
Argument againſt the Merit of Chriſt's Blood, is very apparent, To ſay
that Blood is the Meritorious cauſe of our Salvation is to ſet it up above
God, which is a moſt abſurd conſequence, and his proof of his conſequence
he grounds upon an abſolute forgery whereby he manifeſtly wrongs his
Opponent <hi>W. B.</hi> in his alledging on him, that he ſaid, <hi>God could not ſave,</hi>
whereas, <hi>W. B.</hi> did not ſay, God could not ſave, <hi>But that Chriſt as he
was God, without being Man, he could not ſave Man.</hi> See <hi>W. B.</hi>'s <hi>Capital
Principles,</hi> p. 35, 36. which is almoſt Orthodox Doctrine, rightly underſtood,
<hi>viz.</hi> Seeing God hath appointed to ſave Man after that manner. <hi>G. VV.</hi>'s
further oppoſition to the Blood of Chriſt as outwardly ſhed, being the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
cauſe of Man's Juſtification, is evident from his words <hi>Light and
Life,</hi> p. 61. <hi>But mark how one while</hi> W. B. <hi>makes that Blood, and the ſhedding of
it, his Juſtifier and Redeemer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVhich he has confeſſed is not in being.
Another while People muſt ſeek their Saviour above the Clouds and Firmament
contrary to the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 6. <hi>Another while they muſt look
to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for Juſtification, and to the Blood that was there ſhed, contrary to</hi>
Deut. 30. 13, 14. And Rom. 10. <hi>And if Men ſhould look to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for
that Blood, it is not there to be found, for it is not in being, ſays</hi> W. B.</p>
            <p>The Seven <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Quakers, in their Printed Paper, called, <hi>Some Account,
above mentioned,</hi> p. 16. pretended to anſwer this paſſage, by producing
ſome words of <hi>G. VV.</hi> in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> which they think will juſtifie
him, but all in vain, unleſs to detect his and their dull Sophiſtry. <hi>VV. B.</hi>
having ſaid, <hi>The ſhedding of the Blood upon the Croſs, that was let out by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Spear, being thruſt into his ſide, to be Meritorious, or the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cauſe of Man's Juſtification.</hi> To this <hi>G. W.</hi> Anſwereth, <hi>The ſhedding of
that Blood, let out by the Spear, was an act of a wicked Man; and the Spear,
an Inſtrument of cruelty, which to lay the Meritorious cauſe or ſtreſs of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
upon, is falſe Doctrine, for there is a great difference between Chriſt's offering
up himſelf by the eternal Spirit, a Lamb without Spot to God, and the acts of
wicked Men inflicted upon him, as it is ſaid, by wicked Hands they put him to
Death.</hi> And they conclude ſaying, <hi>But the making the very act of ſhedding his
Blood by the Spear, to be the Meritorious cauſe of Man's Juſtification, we therefore
ask them, if they really believe the ſame.</hi> Here, <hi>Note,</hi> Both <hi>G. W.</hi>'s and the Seven
<hi>Colcheſter</hi> Quakers fallacy, thereby to cover <hi>G. W.</hi>'s vile Hereſie. He moſt
unjuſtly chargeth it upon <hi>W. B.</hi> his Opponent, that he laid the <hi>Meritorious cauſe
or ſtreſs</hi> of Juſtification, upon the <hi>Act of</hi> the wicked Man, that thruſt
the Spear into our Saviour's Side, but this is a piece of groſs forgery
in <hi>G. W.</hi> ſo to charge <hi>W. B.</hi> and miſtate the Controverſie, between <hi>W. B.</hi>
and him; nothing but deceit it ſelf could invent ſuch a forgery in <hi>G. W.</hi>
as this, to charge it on <hi>W. B.</hi> as if he had either ſaid or thought that the
<hi>Meritorious cauſe</hi> of Man's Juſtification, was laid by him, upon the <hi>Act of</hi>
the Soldier, that thruſt the Spear into our Saviour's Side; for neither did
he ſay it, nor can it be gathered from his Words, by the leaſt ſhadow
of any juſt Conſequence, his Words being thus, as <hi>G. W.</hi> cites them, <hi>The ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Blood upon the Croſs that was let out, by the Virtue of the Spear
being thruſt into his Side, was the Meritorious cauſe of Man's Juſtification.</hi> See
<hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 64. The ſhedding of the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the true Engliſh


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97123:50"/>
of the Latin Words <hi>Effaſio Sanguinis,</hi> which being <hi>A Noun Verbal,</hi> hath a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
as well as Active ſignification, and that <hi>W. B.</hi> meant it, in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſignification [and not in the Active as with reſpect to the Soldiers
Act] is evident, from the Words both of <hi>Jer. Ives,</hi> and alſo of <hi>W. B.</hi>
quoted by <hi>G. W. Light and Life,</hi> p. 64. he quotes <hi>Jer. Ives,</hi> ſaying, My
Brother <hi>Burnet</hi> meant <hi>Chriſt's Paſſion,</hi> and not <hi>the Act of wicked Men.</hi> And
again, <hi>G. W.</hi> quotes <hi>W. B.</hi> ſaying, Yes Brother, it is proper to ſay, It
was Chriſt's Act to ſhed his Blood. His meaning is obvious, to any
impartial Reader, that it was Chriſt's Act, freely to give his Blood to be
ſhed for the remiſſion of our Sins, as he ſaid himſelf, no Man taketh my
Life from me, I lay down my Life, and I take it up again. Without
all doubt, though Chriſt was not Active to Kill himſelf, by any Bodily
Act of violence, that he did to himſelf, yet his giving up his Blood to
be ſhed, and his Life to be taken away, was a moſt noble act of his Soul
and Will; who by a moſt noble act of Obedience and Reſignation to
the Will of God, for the Salvation of Men, gave up his Blood to be ſhed;
for that the ſhedding of Chriſt's Blood was neceſſary for remiſſion of Men's
Sins, and their Juſtification before God, is clear from his own words, <hi>This
Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood ſhed for the remiſſion of the Sins of many;</hi>
and as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Without ſhedding of Blood is no remiſſion;</hi> ſo that,
had not Chriſt's Blood been ſhed, Men's Sins could not be forgiven; and yet
what but deceit it ſelf can infer from this, That the merit or ſtreſs of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sin or Juſtification, is laid upon the act of the wicked Soldier, that
thruſt his Spear into our Saviour's Side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> again, Seeing <hi>G. W.</hi> hath impoſed ſuch a Forgery upon <hi>W. B.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any juſt ground, as if he had placed, the Merit of Men's Juſtification,
upon the act of the wicked Man that thruſt the Spear into our Saviour's
Side: By the like forgery, he may charge <hi>the Church of England,</hi> with the
ſame abſurdity, (though moſt unjuſtly) for in the <hi>Prayer</hi> immediately before
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> [in the Office of Baptiſm for thoſe of Riper Years] ſhe thus
Prays, <hi>Almighty everliving God, whoſe moſt dearly beloved Son, Jeſus Chriſt
for the forgiveneſs of our Sins, DID SHED OUT of his most precious Side,
both Water and Blood, and gave Commandment,</hi> &amp;c. Here we ſee it's ſaid,
that Chriſt <hi>SHED OUT</hi> of his moſt precious Side, both Water and Blood.
Can therefore <hi>G. W.</hi> from thence infer, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> believeth,
that ſhe layeth the Merit of remiſſion of Sin, and Juſtification upon the
act of the Soldier, or that Chriſt by any act of Violence killed himſelf,
or commanded others to do it; and if no juſt conſequence, as this, can be
gathered out of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s Words, nor can they from the
Words of <hi>W. B.</hi> that are of the ſame importance.</p>
            <p>But it's no wonder that <hi>G. W.</hi> will have the ſhedding of that Blood which
came out of Chriſt's Side, when it was pierced, to be only the Soldiers act,
when <hi>T. Elwood</hi> in his <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> p. 99. denyeth the Blood that came
out of Chriſt's Side, and its ſhedding after he was Dead, to have been to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Offering, for this he ſaith, and again repeats the ſame Words
and juſtifies them in his pretended Anſwer to my firſt Narrative, p, 220,
221. <hi>This offering up himſelf, (and giving himſelf a ranſom for all) included all


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97123:50"/>
his ſufferings both inward and outward, and made it a compleat and perfect Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
in which his Blood was comprehended and concerned as well as his Fleſh, before
his Side was pierced by the Spear, for he had pronounced that great Word, Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum
eſt, it is finiſhed, had bowed his Head, and given up the Ghoſt before his
Side was pierced with the Spear.</hi> This is not only contrary to the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as above quoted in the Office of Baptiſm, but
of all Orthodox Chriſtians throughout the World, who teach according to
Scripture, That the <hi>Water and Blood</hi> that came out of our Lord's Side, after
his Death, was a <hi>ſpecial part</hi> of the Offering as well as his Death; and the
wounds in his Hands and Feet and the Blood that came out of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Death; which groſs Error of <hi>T. Elwood,</hi> is the Error of the Second
Days meeting at <hi>London,</hi> who approved his Book, and of <hi>G. W.</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
the ſame Faith with them, is deſervedly cenſured and refuted, in
<hi>Satan diſrob'd,</hi> p. 47. <hi>His Body pierced and his Blood ſhed after his Death, were
truly and properly a part of the Sacrifice, as much as what he ſuffered before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
As the legal Sacrifice was not compleated by the Death of the Beaſt, but by
the Burning of it, and offering the Blood afterwards, that was ſhed; and thoſe who
reject that Blood do mutilate his Sacrifice, and render it ineffectual to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> again, How neither <hi>G. W.</hi> nor the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Quakers, in their <hi>Some
Account, &amp;c.</hi> give any anſwer, to what was objected againſt him, out of
his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 61. Though quoted by them, p. 15. Where he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
aſſerts, That <hi>to ſeek our Saviour above the Clouds and Firmanent</hi> [i. e.
to pray to him as he is in Heaven, without us, above the Clouds and Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament]
<hi>is contrary to the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 6. <hi>And to look to the
Blood that was ſhed at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for Juſtification, is contrary to</hi> Deut. 30. 13, 14.
and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. which ſeeking or looking to Chriſt, and his Blood, as is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted
and proved, was not by any outward or bodily act, but by Faith,
and yet even ſuch ſeeking or looking is denyed, and oppoſed by <hi>G. W.</hi> and
his <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Quaker Brethren.</p>
            <p>But whereas <hi>G. W.</hi> doth argue ſo much and ſo frequently againſt that
Blood that was outwardly ſhed by the Spear, its being the meritorious
Cauſe of Juſtification, becauſe that Blood is not to be found at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
for it's not in being ſays <hi>W. B.</hi> as <hi>G. W.</hi> quotes him. Suppoſe <hi>W. B.</hi> had
poſitively ſaid [as if they had been his words originally] <hi>That Blood is not
in being;</hi> yet he was far from inferring thence, that we are not juſtified by
that Blood; this was <hi>G. W.</hi>'s conſequence, and not <hi>W. B.</hi>'s for <hi>W. B.</hi> did
ſtrongly aſſert, that Men are juſtified by the Blood that was then ſhed, tho'
it was not now in being, but (ſaid he) the Efficacy of it is ſtill in being;
but <hi>G. W.</hi> did draw a quite contradictory Concluſion, to that of <hi>W. B.</hi>
as thus, That Blood that was ſhed by the Spear, is not in being, ſaith
<hi>W. B.</hi> therefore <hi>G. W.</hi> concludes, Men are not juſtified by it; which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>G. W.</hi>'s has equal force againſt Chriſt's Death, and Bodily pains, as
well as his Souls Dolours and Griefs, they are not now in being, therefore Men
are not juſtified by them. And his Argument has the like force againſt
Men's being juſtified, or having their Sins pardoned, by the Merit of Chriſt's
Blood, before Chriſt came in the Fleſh; for example, <hi>David</hi> had not the


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97123:51"/>
remiſſion of his Sins by the Merit of Chriſt's Blood, becauſe <hi>G. W.</hi>'s Logick,
in <hi>David</hi>'s time, the Blood was not in being: But as I ſhewed in the Meeting
the Words [that Blood is not in being] were not originally W <hi>B</hi>'s, but ſome
Quakers Words, or ſome other that held the like falſe notions with them,
which W. <hi>B.</hi> calls a Cavillation. <hi>Capital Principles</hi> p. 40. <hi>Of late, ſaith he, I
have frequently met with a Query by way of Cavillation, Which is, whether that
Blood ſpilt upon the Croſs run not on the ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If ſo, how then can Man
be juſtified by that which is not in being?</hi> Thus we ſee, W. B. cenſures the
conſequence of that Argument to be invalid, but <hi>G. W.</hi> again, and again,
I know not how frequently, makes uſe of it, and thinks the Concluſion to
be good; and I ſaid, in the Meeting, had <hi>G. W.</hi> been preſent, I would
have asked him, what was his Anſwer to that Queſtion, Is the Blood that
was ſhed on the Croſs now in being? [If he happen to reply to this 4th
Narative, I deſire him to give a poſitive anſwer to it, ſeeing he makes it the
Foundation of his Concluſion, that Men are not juſtified by the Merit of that
Blood, becauſe that Blood is not in being] but ſeeing I had not <hi>G. W.</hi> there,
I asked <hi>Dan. Philip</hi> [who was preſent, and ſat near where I ſtood, and is
one of the Quakers in the Unity] whither that Blood was in being, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
he knew not whither I meant the Blood, that was without Chriſt's
Body, or within it; I told him, the Blood that went out of his Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Blood was in being? but he gave no reply. I asked him again,
whether he believed that the Blood that was outwardly ſhed, was Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to Juſtification, and that true Believers were juſtified by it, he ſaid,
he knew not what I meant by the Word <hi>Merit, or Meritorious;</hi> I told him,
it was a ſhame for him, to pretend to be ſo Ignorant of the ſignification of
the Word, that an ordinary School Boy did know, ſeeing he was a Scholar,
and did not long ago, commence Dr. of Phyſick at <hi>Leiden,</hi> and had
there a Latin Oration. However, I gave him the ſignification of it,
that <hi>Merit</hi> ſignified that it was of that Worth and Value by way of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Expiation to make ſatisfaction to God, for the guilt of our Sins.
He alſo pretended he knew not what I meant by the Word <hi>Atonement,</hi> I
told him, it ſignified reconciling and bringing Men into ſavour with God.
I asked, again, were Believers juſtified by the Merit of the Blood, that
was outwardly ſhed, he anſwered it was a part of the Offering, but I
asked were Believers juſtified by it, He ſaid, that Blood will juſtifie none,
that are not Sanctified; I replied, that was not the queſtion, nor is it any
part of the Controverſie; I further asked him, what did he mean by the
Offering whether Chriſt only as without us, or as within us, or
both without and within, and both by Chriſt's Blood without us, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſhed, and by the Blood of his God-Head as inwardly ſhed in Men,
as <hi>G. W.</hi> will have it now at laſt; but to this he gave no poſitive anſwer;
and though in all his anſwers he gave, on this or other heads, he greatly
foiled himſelf: He is (as I am informed) ſo confident, that he tells in private,
how he foiled me. But ſeeing neither he, nor any of the Quakers there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
offered any anſwer to that queſtion; Is that Blood of Chriſt that was
outwardly ſhed in being? I told them, I believed the ſubſtance of it was
ſtill in being, for not the leaſt atome of any Bodily ſubſtance was ever


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97123:51"/>
annihilated; but to enquire, where that Blood now was, or whether Chriſt
did take it back again into his Body, [which no doubt he was able to do,
having all power, was a curious and unneceſſary queſtion, to be reſolved,]
And here I brought a ſaying of <hi>B. Burnet</hi> (whoſe Name I mentioned with due
reſpect) to the ſame effect in his Expoſition on the xxxix Articles of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo, ſometime afterwards at the ſame Meeting, I quoted
him, in the ſame Book, to ſhow my Agreement with him [as I do with all
ſound Chriſtian Teachers] that our Lord has the ſame Body, in ſubſtance,
he had on Earth, and that his Body is not changed in ſubſtance, but in the
different <hi>Contexture</hi> of parts.</p>
            <p>And on this Head alſo I queried <hi>Dan. Philips,</hi> Whither Chriſt's Body
was the ſame in Subſtance, now in Heaven, that it was on Earth; and
whether it was, when on Earth, a terreſtrial Body; he ſaid, He did not
know what I meant by Subſtance. I told him, the ſame that others
meant, who had any true skill in Natural Philoſophy, and it was a ſhame
to a Dr. of Phyſick, to profeſs his being ignorant to define a Subſtance;
however I told him, that a Subſtance (underſtanding a created Subſtance)
was a Being or Thing that did only depend on God Almighty, the firſt
Cauſe, and was the ſubject of certain Accidents that did depend on it,
and could not be without it. He asked whether a Subſtance could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Accidents? I anſwer'd him, it could be without Accidents of this
or that kind, and could be wonderfully changed in Accidents, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the ſame Subſtance. I asked him again, Was our Lord's Body
earthly, when it was on earth? He anſwered, it was like ours in all things,
Sin excepted. I again asked, but was it earthly, when on earth? Here he
demurred, and would not give a poſitive Anſwer; a Miniſter that ſtood
by, ſaid, by his confeſſing it was like ours, he has confeſſed it was an
earthly Body; I ſaid, to them that are ſound in the Faith it is ſo, but not
to the Quakers; for they will not allow, that an earthly Body, and an
heavenly Body, can be the ſame Body in Subſtance, or that a natural Body,
and a ſpiritual Body, are the ſame in Subſtance; for which I quoted <hi>G. W.'s
Light and Life,</hi> p. 69. <hi>Who calls him a very blind and ignorant Man that
will affirm, That Bodies Celeſtial and Terreſtrial, differ not in Subſtance;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he has proved himſelf to be both blind and ignorant, by his ignorant
Aſſertion. And I told the Auditory, how the Quakers ignorance and falſe
Notions of Philoſophy, deſtroy'd their Faith, and hindred them to believe
that neceſſary and fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Faith, That Chriſt's
Body that he had on Earth, is the ſame in Subſtance it was in Heaven;
and tho' when on Earth, it was earthly, and is heavenly now, yet the
change was not in Subſtance but in Accidents; for if it be not the ſame in
Subſtance, it is in no reſpect the ſame; for, take away the Subſtance and
no Accidents can remain of any thing. And by the like falſe Philoſophy,
both <hi>G. W.</hi> and W. P. have argued againſt the Reſurrection-Bodies
of the Saints, that they ſhall not be the ſame in Subſtance with the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Bodies they had on Earth. And I further ſhewed, that <hi>Muggleton</hi>
ſaid, Chriſt's Body was like ours, and yet would not own it was the ſame
Subſtance with ours; for, he held that Chriſt's Body that hung on the Croſs,


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97123:52"/>
and was laid in the Sepulcher, was the Godhead; yea, was God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>G. W.</hi> and his ſeven <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Brethren, leſs fallacious, in his and
their Defence of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>'s Blaſphemous ſaying, <q>That the Blood
of Chriſt that was forced out of him, by the Soldier after he was dead,
was no more than the Blood of another Saint.</q> In their <hi>Some Account,</hi>
they quote <hi>G. W.</hi>'s <hi>Antidote,</hi> for his defence, p. 223, 224, 225. 1. He ſaith,
he ſhewed a diſlike of <hi>S. E.</hi>'s Expreſſions before-cited, but how? in that he
did not allow them as an Article of their Faith. But nor did he cenſure
them as contrary to their Faith, which he ought to have done, and would
have done, had he been in the true Faith. And that his diſlike did not
proceed from any deteſtation of the Error, is very apparent, that he ſaid
in his defence of <hi>S. E. That S. E. did highly ſpeak in eſteem of the Blood of
Chriſt, and New Covenant, as more excellent and living, and holy and precious,
than is able to be utter'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which (G. W.</hi> faith) <hi>might have ſatisfied any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
or unbyaſs'd Mind;</hi> therefore it ſeems it ſatisfy'd <hi>G. W.</hi> But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of <hi>G. W.</hi> lyeth in this, That the Blood which <hi>S. E.</hi> did ſo highly eſteem,
was not that Blood, that was let out of his Side, after Chriſt was dead, as
<hi>S. E.</hi> plainly confeſſed in his Letter to <hi>R. Porter,</hi> but another kind of Blood,
that is, the Blood not of the Humanity, but of the Godhead; the Blood
of the New Covenant, which is Inward and Spiritual, ſaith <hi>G. W.</hi> 2. He
ſaith, he ſhewed in part his eſtimation of the Blood and whole Sacrifice or
Offering of Chriſt, both in reſpect to the bleſſed Teſtimony, Value and
Efficacy thereof, more than that of any other Saint or Saints. But I find
no ſuch Teſtimony in all that Book, to any Value or Efficacy of it, by
way of Merit, as it was ſhed for the remiſſion of Sins: For it is a great part
of his work throughout his whole Book, <hi>Light and Life,</hi> to contend againſt
the Merit and Value or Efficacy of it, for Men's Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as is largely above-proved out of many Quotations in that very Book,
and can be further proved. Yea, he would not ſo much as allow it to be
concerned in any part or reſpect, as the meritorious Cauſe of Men's Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 56. For <q>We are not (ſaith he) to ſuppoſe two
kinds of Saviours and Sanctifiers, that is both a Natural which is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as is ſaid of the Blood that was ſhed) and the Spirit which ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</q>
Thus he wholly excludes the outward Blood, which he calls Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and placeth all upon the Spirit, arguing moſt weakly and impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That to ſay, <hi>we are ſaved by the Blood of Chriſt that was outwardly ſhed</hi>
[as the meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, and Sanctification, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation]
<hi>and by the Spirit of Christ,</hi> [as the internal Agent and Efficient,
that applyeth to us the Merit and Efficacy of that Blood that was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſhed] <hi>is to inſer two kinds of Saviours and Sanctifiers;</hi> he might by
as good an Argument infer, That a Medicine, and he that applyeth the
Medicine to the Patient, are two Doctors of Phyſick, as to argue that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
or Sanctification by the Blood of Chriſt, and by the Spirit of
Chriſt, <hi>is to ſuppoſe two Saviours.</hi> But how will <hi>G. W.</hi> anſwer his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who of late, but without any Retractation of his former Error, doth own,
Redemption, both by the natural Blood outwardly, and by the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97123:52"/>
               <hi>Antidote</hi> p. 232, 233, 234. And it ſtill remains as a vile Error juſtly
charged on <hi>G. W.</hi> which he hath never to this day fairly anſwer'd, nor any for
him, that in <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 59. he blames <hi>W. B.</hi> for ſaying, <hi>That Blood
that Chriſt ſhed in order to the effecting the Salvation of Man, muſt needs he
viſible and material Blood;</hi> in oppoſition to which, he plainly denies, <hi>That the
material Blood of the Sacrifices was a Type of the material Blood of Christ; for
that were to ſay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that material Blood was a Type of that which was
material, this to give the Subſtance no Pre-eminence above the Type;</hi> which
clearly proveth, that <hi>G. W.</hi> held that the material Blood of Chriſt was not
the Subſtance ſignified by the Blood of the Sacrifices that were offer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, but a Type or Figure of ſome inward thing, to wit, their
ſpiritual Blood within, which they call the Life and the Light. 3. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, tho' <hi>G. W.</hi> would ſeem, at laſt, to be full and plain, in his paſſing
cenſure on <hi>S. E.</hi>'s words, he remains ſtill Fallacious and Sophiſtical, as
much as formerly; <hi>I diſown</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his ſaid Compariſon, of the Blood of
Chriſt with that of another Saint, and believe he was not in the Counſel or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he nothing blames the matter of his Words, but ſaith, <hi>he was not
in the Counſel or Wiſdom of God therein;</hi> that is to ſay, He was not wiſe nor
well adviſed, to diſcloſe that great Secret or Myſtery among the Quakers, ſo
as to let the World know it, that the Quakers held as a Principle among them,
That that Blood was no more [by way of Merit] than that of an ordinary
Saint; for in effect <hi>G. W.</hi> himſelf, as to all the real worth of it, above that of
other Saints, by way of real Merit for Men's Juſtification, or real neceſſity to
Salvation, hath plainly excluded it, not only by his many impertinent and
nonſenſical Arguings and Quibblings againſt it, as above-quoted, but by
his plainly aſſerting in his <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 28. <hi>That the Quakers are offended
with</hi> G. K. for ſaying, the <hi>Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation, or not
ſufficient without ſomething elſe;</hi> the which Propoſition, ſeeing he blames as
falſe, he muſt hold the contradictory to be true, <hi>That the Light within is
ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe;</hi> yea, <hi>G. W.</hi> hath granted in his
<hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 28. That Chriſt, as outwardly conſidered, is that ſomething
elſe, which <hi>G. K.</hi> meant. This is an evident proof, beſide many others
above-given, That it is <hi>G. W.</hi>'s and his Brethren's Principle, That the Blood
of Chriſt that was outwardly ſhed on the Croſs, is not a meritorious Cauſe
of our Salvation; nay, not ſo much as in part; and that Faith in that
Blood is not neceſſary for our Juſtification, expreſly contrary to Scripture,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that neither in their Books, nor Preachings, is any thing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
of this Doctrine Preached, That Chriſt, <hi>God-Man,</hi> as without us,
as he Died for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the object and foundation of our Faith, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Sin, and for our Juſtification, and eternal Salvation; but there
is much to be both read in their Books, and heard in their daily Preachings,
againſt the neceſſity of any ſuch Faith. The fartheſt that they go at this
day, is to Preach a little of him Hiſtorically, and as an Example, but to
Preach him as without us, in the true nature of Man, to be the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Faith, Love and Adoration, they think <hi>is hurtful,</hi> as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;

yea, W. <hi>Smith</hi> in his <hi>Primmer</hi> gives it as a mark of diſtinction,
whereby to know, true Miniſters from falſe, <hi>They that are falſe, Preach
Chriſt without, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven above,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi>'s excuſe of this, in his <hi>Switch,</hi> p. 220. is extreamly fallacious;
he thinks he may ſupply the defect in <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Words by an <hi>Ellipſis,</hi>
telling us, <hi>The Church hath given abundant encouragement to ſupply Elliptick defects
by her example and practiſe in the holy Scriptures, and what is ſo familiarly
done with holy Writ, ſurely me may do with our Friends Books.</hi> But to detect
this fallacy, what Elliptical defects the Church has ſupplied in ſome
places of the holy Scripture, ſhe had ground ſo to do from other places
of Scripture more full, that taught her to make that ſupply; but the caſe
is far otherwiſe here, it being ſo far from being the Quakers way gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to preach Faith in Chriſt without Men, for Salvation that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it, and call them Reprobates, who profeſs any ſuch Faith; and this
their great Apoſtle <hi>G. F.</hi> has taught them by his Example ſo to do, in his
<hi>G. M. p.</hi> 248. he ſaith to <hi>C. Wade, The Devil was in thee, and thou ſaith
thou art ſaved by Chriſt without thee, and ſo hath recorded thy ſelf to be a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and ignorant of the Myſtery of Chriſt within thee, for without that, thou
doſt not know Salvation.</hi> And yet this ſame <hi>C. Wade,</hi> hath fully owned the
<hi>Mystery of Chriſt within,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Switch, <hi>p.</hi> 205.</note> as above-quoted. <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi>'s excuſe for <hi>G. F.</hi>'s
ſaying to <hi>C. VVade, The Devil was in him.</hi> He ſaith, Was for his ſtuffing his
Book with Lyes, but of this he gives not one Proof, though I have given
ſeveral evident Proofs, That <hi>G. F.</hi> did groſly bely him: To the other part
of <hi>G. F.</hi>'s charge, <hi>Thou art ſaved by Chriſt without thee. Joſ. VVyeth</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth,
<hi>It doth plainly contradict the Doctrine of the Apoſtle.</hi> Thus we
ſee, what value he and all his Brethren have, (in whoſe Name he writes)
for <hi>Chriſt without us,</hi> that he ſaith; it plainly contradicts the Doctrine of
the Apoſtle, but by his ſo ſaying, he palpably bewrays his and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
<hi>Infidelity and Heatheniſm,</hi> and hath prepared <hi>a Rod</hi> for his <hi>own Back</hi>
inſtead of a Switch for the Author of the <hi>Snake.</hi> To ſuppoſe that <hi>C. VVade</hi>
meant that he was ſaved by Chriſt without him, without the inward
Operation of Chriſt, by the holy Spirit, to Sanctifie him, is great injuſtice
done to him, for he hath ſufficiently cleared himſelf of that charge, as
I have above-quoted him. But that Faith in Chriſt without us, as he
Died for our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no part of the Quakers Faith, or Syſteme of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

of Chriſt; not only that in the Fleſh, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that in the

not read of, but of a Second Coming, without Sin unto Salvation, which
in the Apoſtles days was looked for:</q> And theſe words of <hi>Paul, The dead

               <p>
                  <hi>To this</hi> G. W. <hi>Anſwers very fallaciouſly, in his</hi> Truth and Innoc. <hi>p.</hi> 61.
But is this to deny or oppoſe Chriſt's coming to Judge the Quick and the Dead?
'Twas never ſo intended. And queſtioning ſome Men's carnal Expectations of
a fleſhly coming of Chriſt, to be ſeen with their carnal Eyes; was this to deny
his coming in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels, to reward every Man
according to his works, [<hi>quoting, Matth, 16. 27. Luke</hi> 9. 6.] no ſure, for that's
confeſſed and undeniable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> His and his Brethren's common evaſion to hide their Infidelity, is
to quibble about the Word FLESH; as if their meaning were only to
deny, That Chriſt is to Come, in a fleſhly Body, ſubject to the like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
it had in his ſtate of Humiliation, when upon Earth, as <hi>Hunger,
Thirst, Pain, Death,</hi> &amp;c. But this is no part of the Controverſie, betwixt
the Quakers and their Opponents. But, why may not Glorified Fleſh be
taken to ſignifie <hi>Spiritual Fleſh,</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>Mortal Fleſh,</hi> as well as
<hi>Glorified Body</hi> ſignifies <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> without any change of <hi>Subſtance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is evident that <hi>G. W.</hi> not only denyed, that Chriſt would Come to
Judge the World, in a Body of natural and paſſible Fleſh, but that he
would not Come, in the ſame Subſtance of that Body he had on Earth,
which was a mortal and paſſible Body, of the ſame Nature with ours; for
he makes it moſt abſurd, That an earthly Body and an heavenly Body can
be the ſame Subſtance, as above-quoted.</p>
               <p>Now, That he denyeth that Chriſt was in Heaven in a <hi>bodily Exiſtence,</hi>
or would come to Judgment, as the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> in a <hi>bodily Exiſtence,</hi> [to

Hand, ſo he would come in that very bodily Exiſtence to Judge the World;</hi> for
which <hi>G. W.</hi> doth evidently oppoſe him as above-quoted. The Phraſe, <hi>Thy
Eyes will drop out before thou wilt ſee ſuch an Appearance,</hi> is equivalent to
this, <hi>Thou wilt never ſee ſuch an Appearance, nor any other Man ſor thee,</hi> as
that common Phraſe, <hi>at the Greek Calends.</hi> And whereas he adds: <hi>And
Christ's last Coming in Power and great Glory in his Glorious Body, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with his mighty Angels, at the Reſurrection, must be ſeen with ſtronger,
clearer, and more celeſtial Eyes, than periſhing Eyes.</hi> Here he ſtill hides his vile
Error. What are theſe more <hi>celeſtial Eyes,</hi> ſeeing he will not have Chriſt's
Coming to be without Men in a bodily Exiſtence? For in his <hi>Light and
Life,</hi> he quotes <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27, 28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 26, 27. in plain oppoſition
to Chriſt's <hi>outward Coming,</hi> ſaying,—<hi>When was that Coming to be? Is it
now to be looked for outwardly; and ſeeing he is not to Come outwardly but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
theſe celeſtial Eyes, in his ſenſe, muſt be <hi>inward Eyes.</hi> But then, how
ſhall the Wicked ſee him? for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Every Eye ſhall ſee him, even
they who have pierced him;</hi> muſt they have celeſtial Eyes wherewith to ſee
him? And tho' the Wicked ſhall not ſee him in the ſame manner that the
Godly ſhall ſee him, yet certainly, according to Scripture, and the Faith of all
true Chriſtians, all that ever lived, as well as they that ſhall be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
in the Body at his Coming, both good and bad, ſhall ſee him, as an
object without them; yea, Chriſt told the Chief Prieſt and the <hi>Jews,</hi> Mat.
26. 64. <hi>Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</hi> At which ſaying, the High Prieſt
rent his Cloaths, and ſaid, he had ſpoke Blaſphemy. It ſeems if <hi>G. W.</hi>
had been preſent, he would have given the ſame judgment. Doth <hi>G. W.</hi>
think that the High Prieſt and thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall ſee Chriſt with celeſtial
Eyes, ſeeing, according to his Philoſophy, no other Eyes but celeſtial Eyes
can ſee him at his Coming?</p>
               <p>But again, <hi>Note, G. W.</hi>'s palpable contradiction both to himſelf and to
<hi>T. E.</hi> in his <hi>Truth and Innoc.</hi> above-quoted, p. 61. he ſeems to own Chriſt's
Coming, as a thing yet to be at the end of the World, tho' in <hi>Light and
Life,</hi> p. 41. from that very place, which he now quotes for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.
27, 28. he did argue againſt it; and thus in expreſs words doth <hi>T. Elwood</hi>
in his pretended Anſwer to my Firſt Narrative argue, <hi>p. 160. That Coming</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>there ſpoken of by Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 16. 27. <hi>could not be meant of his
Coming at the end of the World, becauſe it was to begin in that very Age.</hi>


                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:97123:55"/>
And yet <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Truth and Innoc.</hi> contrary to his former gloſs, and
<hi>T. Elwood</hi> alſo, would ſeem now to underſtand it of Chriſt's coming, as a thing
yet to be at the end of the World, and if he do not ſo underſtand it,
he moſt groſly deceives his Reader, and if he do ſo underſtand it, he
palpably contradicts himſelf, as well as his Brother <hi>T. E.</hi> and yet he is
the inſallible <hi>G. W.</hi> ſtill, without any change. And for all <hi>G. W.</hi> his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now at laſt, to be drawn, to a plain confeſſion of his Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt without us, in his, <hi>Appendix to the Switch,</hi> p. 544. yet
he is ſtill fallacious, and lurks like a <hi>Snake</hi> in the Graſs. He profeſſeth
to own his belief, concerning Chriſt without us, in Eight ſeveral <hi>ſteps,</hi>
from his <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> without us, to his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
without us, <q>Being ſeen (ſaith he) to aſcend without us, and a
Cloud received him out of their ſight, who beheld him aſcend; unto
whom it was ſaid by the Two Angels preſent, This ſame Jeſus which
is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as
ye have ſeen him go into Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3, 9, 10, 11. And doubtleſs
when he ſo comes, and all his mighty Angels with him, it will be in
great Glory and open Triumph, and he will in that Day be greatly
glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> How he gooth no further in his confeſſion to Chriſt without us,
but to his Aſcenſion, and the Cloud receiving him out of their ſight.
But in the other two following ſteps of the Chriſtians Faith, fully as
neceſſary as the former <hi>Eight,</hi> and without which the other <hi>Eight</hi> are of
little or no ſignification, to demonſtrate a true Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's being
ſat down without us, at the Right Hand of God, in the true Nature
of Man, conſiſting of a Created glorified Soul and Body, the ſame he had
on Earth, the ſame in Subſtance, but wonderfully changed in manner
and condition, and in that very glorified Nature of Man that he will
come without us, to Judge the Quick and the Dead; he is altogether
ſilent, and his Words ſeem rather to imply a denial of them, than any
affirmation, as with reſpect either to Chriſt's being now in Heaven, without
us, in that Body which roſe from the Grave, or his coming without
us from Heaven in that Body to Judgment.</p>
               <p>Again, take notice of another fallacy of <hi>G. W.</hi> in his anſwer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
propoſed, whether they (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Quakers) believe in Chriſt as without
them, as without all other Men, he varieth the terms of the queſtion,
from a believing in Chriſt without them, to a Hiſtorical Faith of their
believing that Chriſt was Conceived without them, Born without them,
Crucified without them; all which he and his Brethren may believe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically,
as they believe the Hiſtorical Relation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Birth, Death,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet have no Faith in Chriſt without them, as the great Saviour
of Men, for remiſſion of Sin, Juſtification and Eternal Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Light and Life, <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note>
as the great Object of ſaving Faith, for this he hath fiercely oppoſed
in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> arguing againſt <hi>W. B.</hi> who aſſerted Chriſt without
us in Heaven, to be the Object of our Faith, for Juſtification. (Saith G. W.)
Is the Object and Foundation of Faith divided from the Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:97123:55"/>
But what the Cloud is that received Chriſt out of the ſight of Men, and
with what Body Chriſt did aſcend, and whether as a Perſon without us,
Chriſt is to be Prayed unto, and whether he is to return as a Perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us to Judge the World; hear what <hi>W. Bailie,</hi> a great Author among the
Quakers, ſaith. In his Printed <hi>Collection,</hi> p. 300. <q>—But methinks I
hear ſome ſay (in their Reaſonings and Imaginations) What Body hath
he, and where is it, ſeeing it is ſaid, he is at the Right Hand of God? This
I ſhall Anſwer (ſaith he) with his own words, which he ſpake here on
Earth, <hi>viz. No Man aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from
heaven, the Son of Man which is in heaven;</hi> he that hath an Ear to hear
let him hear and take notice, what <hi>Body</hi> that was which came down
from Heaven, when <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid unto the Angel, <hi>How can this be, ſeeing I
know not a Man?</hi>
                  </q> Thus we ſee he falſifies our Saviour's words, and will
have no <hi>Body</hi> that aſcended to Heaven, but what came from Heaven;
whereas our Saviour, in the place quoted, mentions not the Word
BODY.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, In his Treatiſe</hi> Deep calleth unto Deep, <hi>p. 30. he ſaith,</hi>—And
ſo he taught them to Pray, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. not to look at his Perſon, and
Pray to him as a Perſon without them, but bad them Pray to their Father which
ſeeth in ſecret, <hi>&amp;c. Again, in his</hi> p. 26. But, indeed, it is but a Cloud that
hath received him out of the ſight of the Gazers; but ſaith the Lord to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
I have blotted out your Iniquities like a thick Cloud.—And, indeed,
this [viz. <hi>the Cloud of their Sins</hi>] hath hid both his Body and Face from you,
for the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Lord from Heaven, comes not with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
obſervation, but the Kingdom is within. <hi>And in his p.</hi> 29. I never read
in all the Scriptures (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) as I can remember, of a Third Coming of Chriſt,
perſonally in his own ſingle Perſon, or of a perſonal Reign, beſides, what ſhall be
in his Saints. <hi>And</hi> G. W. <hi>in his</hi> Christ Aſcended above the Clouds, <hi>not only
denyeth any perſonal Coming of Chriſt, yet to be at the end of the World,
but denyeth him to have a perſonal Exiſtence in Heaven, without the Saints,
and chargeth it to be</hi> Anthropomorphitiſm <hi>and</hi> Muggletoniſm. <hi>And, indeed, I
know not one place of Scripture, of the many that are juſtly brought by ſound
Chriſtians to prove Chriſt's Coming without us, in his Glorified Body to
Judge the World, at the great Day of Judgment, but they have turned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to his inward Coming, which, they ſay, they witneſs already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in them, and they look for no other Coming.</hi>

                  <hi>G. W.</hi> inſtead of anſwering to the Quotations brought out of his and his
Brethren's Books againſt the Reſurrection of the Body that Dyeth, has
not ſo much as produced them; or any part of them, they are ſo broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97123:56"/>
whereas he ſaith, their Arguments not being anſwer'd by their Oppoſers,
he ſhall need ſay the leſs to them; and concludes, That he would have them
ſo Charitable, that they would not condemn them as Blaſphemers, for
believing that their Reſurection-Bodies ſhall be Spiritual and Glorious,
far excelling theſe natural, carnal and earthly Bodies; for elſe, how ſhould
the Saints Bodies be like unto Chriſt's Glorious Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> here again, He ſeeks to cloak his and his Brethren's Infidelity, by
perverting the true ſtate of the Queſtion, which is not, That the <hi>Reſurrection-Bodies</hi>
of the Saints ſhall not be wonderfully changed, and far excelling
theſe natural, carnal and earthly Bodies, and made Spiritual and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
like to Chriſt's Glorious Body, for that is acknowledged; But the true
Queſtion is, Whether the Saints Bodies, at the Reſurrection, ſhall be ſo
changed, that they ſhall not be the ſame in <hi>Subſtance,</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Bodies,
and conſequently in no reſpect the ſame; for if the Subſtance be not the
ſame, to be ſure, the Accidents are not; and conſequently, nothing of
that Body that dyeth, either in Matter or Manner, in Subſtance or Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
riſeth again; for our Lord's Body, tho' it was wonderfully chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in Manner and Qualities, at his Glorification, yet it remained the ſame
in <hi>Subſtance or Eſſence of a Body.</hi> And yet more fully to detect their Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
the following Quotations will prove, That they look for no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Body out of the Grave, at the end of the World; but all the
Reſurrection they look for, is, The New Birth, or what they expect, as
ſome of them ſay, immediately after Death, which, to be ſure, is no part
of the Body that is laid in the Grave. But whereas he ſaith, that <hi>W. P.</hi>'s
and <hi>T. Elwood</hi>'s Arguments about the Reſurrection have not been anſwer'd

               <p>
                  <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> p. 353. brings <hi>T. Danſon</hi> ſaying, The
happineſs of the Soul is not perfect without the Body, its dear and beloved
Companion; the Soul having a ſtrong deſire and inclination to a re-union
to the Body, as the Schools not without ground determine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>G. W.</hi> Anſwers; Both <hi>Calvin, T. Danſon,</hi> the Schools, and divers
Anabaptiſts, are miſtaken in this very matter, and ſee not with the Eye of
true Faith, either that the happineſs of the Soul is not perfect without the
Body, or that the Soul hath a ſtrong deſire to a re-union to the Body,
while they intend the terreſtrial elementary Bodies; for this implies the Soul
to be in a kind of Purgatory, or diſquietneſs, till the ſuppoſed Reſumption
of the Body.</p>
               <p>To the ſame effect doth <hi>W. P.</hi> argue againſt <hi>T. Hicks, Reaſon againſt Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
p. 137. He quotes <hi>T. Hicks</hi> arguing for the Reſurrection of the Body;
the Joy's of Heaven imperfect elſe. To this <hi>W. Penn</hi> oppoſeth. I Anſwer,
Is the Joy of the Ancients, now in Glory, imperfect? Or are they in
Heaven but by halves? If it be ſo unequitable, that the Body which hath
ſuffer'd ſhould not partake of the Joys Celeſtial, is it not in meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
that the Soul ſhould be rewarded ſo long before the Body? This
Principle brings to the Mortality of the Soul (held by many Baptiſts)


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97123:56"/>
or I am miſtaken. But why muſt the Felicity of the Soul, depend upon that
of the Body? Is it not to make the Soul a kind of Widow,, and ſo
in a ſtate of Mourning and Diſconſolateneſs, which ſtate is but a better
ſort of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> We ſee from both their Reaſonings, they would infer divers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
that would follow upon that Doctrine, that the Souls of the
deceaſed Saints now in Glory, do look for a re-union to their Bodies,
which they put off at the Bodily Death. So that by their manner of
Reaſoning, as well as their expreſs Words, they declare themſelves in
their own behalf, and in the Name of the Quakers, whoſe Faith they
pretend to give an account of, to be poſitive Unbelievers as concerning
any Reſurrection of the Body that Dyeth, or any re-union of that Body,
to the Soul to which it was formerly united before the Bodily Death.
But ſtill <hi>G. W.</hi> as his manner is, perverts the true ſtate of the queſtion
by his ſaying, While they intend the terreſtrial elementary Bodies: For
if he mean that the Bodies after they are raiſed ſhall have the ſame
terreſtrial elementary Qualities, Paſſions and Accidents, that they had
before Death, he wrongs his Opponents, for none of them have ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed:
But if he mean the ſame Subſtance or Eſſence of Bodies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
more excellent Qualities and Endowments, as far excelling the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as Spiritual excells Natural, or Animal and Carnal, Immortal and
Incorruptible excells Mortal and Corruptible, and Heavenly excells Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are the ſame: For in all changes that Bodies are capable of,
as well as Souls or Spirits, from worſe to better; the ſubject of theſe
changes muſt remain the ſame, and that is what is juſtly called the
Subſtance, as when the Soul or Mind of Man is converted and changed
from Earthly affections to Heavenly, the Subject or Subſtance which is
the Soul or Mind is the ſame, and by as good Reaſon, when a Body is
changed from Earthly qualities to Heavenly, the Body is ſtill the ſame
Subſtance or Subject, tho' changed in Qualities and Conditions: For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofs out of both <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> I refer to my Third Narrative,
p. 26, 27, 28.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Rich. Hubbertborne,</hi> a great Author among the Quakers in his
<hi>Coll.</hi> p. 121. proceedeth at the ſame rate againſt the deceaſed Saints, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Reſurrection of their Bodies.—And theſe are they (ſaith
he) that plead for a Life in Sin, while they are here, and that ſay,
that the Saints glorified in Heaven, do yet hope, <hi>For the Reſurrection of

is <hi>R. Hubb.</hi>'s inference, by which he doth plainly diſcover his, and his
Brethrens infidelity in that great Article of the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Reſurrection of the Body.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Coll.</hi> p. 275. he gives us his ſenſe of the Reſurrection. <q>The
Seeds (he ſaith) are but two in the whole World [<hi>viz.</hi> the Seed of the
Woman, and the Seed of the <hi>Serpent</hi>] having each Seed its own Body,
and in every one, until the one be caſt out, and every one of theſe two
Seeds in every Man ſhall ariſe in its own order, the one ſhall riſe
unto everlaſting Life, the other unto Condemnation,—Chriſt the
Seed made his Grave, IN the Wicked, and IN the Rich in his Death,
and out of that Grave ſhall riſe with his Body unto everlaſting Life,
if thou canſt receive it, thou may'ſt be ſatisfied.</q> Are not theſe Words
horrid Perverſions of Scripture, and containing abominable Blaſphemy!</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>G. F.</hi> in his <hi>Diſtinction betwixt the Two Suppers,</hi> p. 20. ſaith,— <q>And
the Apoſtle ſaid, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead, both of the
Juſt and Unjuſt, and for Preaching the Reſurrection of the Dead (namely,
Chriſt Jeſus) he was called in queſtion, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15, 21. And in <hi>p.</hi> 21. quoting
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17, 18. he ſaith, But <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> concerning the Truth
erred, who ſaid that the Reſurrection was paſt already; ſuch overthrew
People from the Faith, that ſtands in Chriſt, who is the Reſurrection and
the Life, through which Faith, they attained to the Reſurrection, and
had their vile Bodies changed, and made like unto his Glorious Body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> How he perverts the Scripture both in words and ſenſe; the
Scripture words, <hi>Who ſhall change our vile or low Bodies,</hi> reſpecting the time
to come, at the Reſurrection of the Dead; but he ſaith, they attained the
Reſurrection, and had their vile Bodies changed, as a thing already fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Alſo he makes the Reſurrection that <hi>Paul</hi> Preached in the <hi>Acts</hi> 17.
18, 22. and 23. 6. to be Chriſt himſelf, perverting our Saviour's words, who
called himſelf the Reſurrection and the Life, to a literal ſenſe, which (as
is obvious to all intelligent Perſons) contain a figurative ſenſe, to wit, the
metony my of the Cauſe getting the Name of the Effect, as is frequent in
Scripture, and in all Authors; as when God is call'd in Scripture the Saints

rational Faculty of the Soul, as it is enlightned and aſſiſted by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the primary Cauſe, and by the works of Creation and of general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
as ſecondary Cauſes; whether one or both of theſe ways is not ſo

and conſented unto by the generality of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity,
and which I not only conſent unto, but highly value as an excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
labouring daily, by the Grace of God, practically to improve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
true Light within I have, both Common and Special, and, I hope, ever
I ſhall ſo do, and ſo I pray that God may enable all and me to do the ſame:
But the Quakers Notion of the Light within, held in general by them,
and authentickly received from their Principal Teachers, particularly <hi>G. F.
G. W. E. Bur.</hi> and others, is extremely contrary to the Holy Scriptures, and
alſo to the beſt dictates of our rational Faculties, to which no divine Light,
either within Men or without Men, can contradict.</p>
               <p>To ſhow which hath been a principal part of my buſineſs in all the
the three Meetings, above-mention'd, and is the ſame in all the three Parts
of this Narrative, the which contrariety I intend to ſhow in a ſhort Scheme
of their abſurd, unſcriptural, as well as irrational Notions of what they
call the Light within; which, upon due examination, will be found to be
Darkneſs, and not Light, within.</p>
               <p>1. It's natural to Man to have a Supernatural Light, <hi>W. P.</hi>'s <hi>Prin. Chriſt.</hi>
p. 15.</p>
               <p>2. There is no natural Light in Men, <hi>Prin. Chriſt.</hi> p. 30. There are not
two Lights in Men, <hi>p.</hi> 31. Thus he allows no diſtinction betwixt natural
Reaſon, which is a good and true Light, and Gift of God to Men, and the
Light of Faith, given to all true Chriſtians, and the Light of prophetical
Inſpirations given to the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, but confounds them,
by making them all to be one and the ſame thing, whereas they, are all
very diſtinct, tho' all coming from one Fountain and Author, God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

3. Man at his coming into the World hath a Light from Chriſt, which
is more than Conſcience, <hi>G. F.</hi>'s <hi>G. M.</hi> p. 209.</p>
               <p>4. And ſeeing the Light is but dim in Heathens and Chriſtians, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, by <hi>Prin. Chriſt.</hi> as above-quoted, no Man has, or ever
had, any other Light, but what he had at his coming into the World.</p>
               <p>5. The Light within, not only true Chriſtians, but within all Men,
<hi>Heathens, Turks, Jews,</hi> is ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe, <hi>G.W.</hi>'s
<hi>Antid.</hi> p. 28. Thus the Man Chriſt without us (who is both God and Man)
and his Death and Sufferings, and Blood outwardly ſhed, and Mediation
for us in Heaven, are all excluded from being ſo much as concurring Cauſes
of our Salvation.</p>
               <p>6. The Light within every Man (litterally underſtood without any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymy)
is God, Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, the Unction or Anointing, is
blinded in ſome by the God of this World (<hi>G. F. News out of the North,</hi>
p. 19.) is Crucified, Impriſoned, Slain, in wicked Men, and its Blood is
ſhed in them, and that is the Blood that they trod under feet (ſee the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
above-quoted) and is the Blood of Atonement.</p>
               <p>7. This Light is firſt a Seed, then a new born Child, and laſtly, the
Mighty God; ſee <hi>W. P.</hi>'s and <hi>W. B.</hi>'s words above-quoted.</p>
               <p>8. This Light within being God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> teacheth the Quakers immediately
and infallibly, as it did the Prophets and Apoſtles, and they Speak and
Write from the ſame Prophetical Illumination and Inſpiration that the
Prophets and Apoſtles had; yea, from the ſame degree, at leaſt ſome of
them; and <hi>G. F.</hi> was come to the ſame Fulneſs that was in Chriſt, and
the Works of their Miniſtry is to bring People to the ſame Fulneſs, that
was in Chriſt, that it may be in them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make them all equal to
Chriſt and God, as above-quoted.</p>
               <p>9. The Light within, teacheth them, what they Preach and Write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Scriptures, being the means, or a means to help or aſſiſt them
in ſo Preaching and Writing: hence it is that <hi>E. B.</hi> upbraids all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Miniſters, <hi>Coll.</hi> p. 126. ſaying—Their Prophecy and Preaching
would ſoon be ended, if they had not the Scripture, which is other Men's
Words, and that which was ſpoken to others, to ſpeak their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from.</p>
               <p>10. That this Light within every Man, is the Goſpel, the Power of God,
unto Salvation, to every one that believeth in it, and is the alone Object
of Faith, [as above-quoted] and that Prophet whom God promiſed to
raiſe up.</p>
               <p>11. That the Light within every Man, is the Rule of Faith, and Life to
all Men, as above-quoted, yea, a full Rule to lead to Salvation, where it
is obeyed. The Glory of Chriſt's Light within, by <hi>G. W.</hi> and others <hi>p.</hi> 32.
and <hi>p.</hi> 28. from the Light of Chriſt within, they [<hi>i. e.</hi> all Men] have ſo
much of the Inſtructions or Precepts therein [in Scripture] contained as
are neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Note,</hi> This is to teach People to be ſaved, by a
meer Covenant of Works, Do and live, which none ever yet fulfilled,
but Chriſt, for all have ſinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>

12. This Light within them is whole Chriſt, God and Man, Fleſh and
Spirit, <hi>G. F. G. M.</hi> p. 246. 249. and <hi>G. E.</hi> is ſo much for the Fleſh, Body,
Blood and Bones of Chriſt within, that he denyeth that Chriſt has any
Body that is abſent from his People, and is now in the preſence of his
Father, <hi>G. M.</hi> p. 211.</p>
               <p>13. It is the Fleſh and Bone of Chriſt, a meaſure in one, and a
meaſure in another. <hi>Note,</hi> This is to make the whole to be the part and
the part or (<hi>G. M.</hi> 246.) meaſure to be the whole.</p>
               <p>14. The Saints eat his Fleſh, and they that eat this Fleſh, hath it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them. <hi>G. M.</hi> p. 322. Thus arguing moſt groſly from a Metaphorical
eating to a Literal.</p>
               <p>15. The Light within is the Urim and Thummim, as <hi>G. W.</hi> ſays <hi>Truth and
Inno.</hi> p. 16. which not only the Quakers have, but all Men, Heathens and
Infidels as really as they.</p>
               <p>16. Chriſt within is the Doctrine of Salvation, which IS ONLY neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be Preached, and he is a deceiver, that exhorts People for Salvation
to any other thing than the Light of Chriſt, as he hath enlightned them
within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This evidently appears from thoſe paſſages in <hi>E. B.</hi>'s <hi>The true Faith

which account is in the ſeveral heads of this Narrative fully replyed unto]
which theſe Seven Quakers are ſo far from Cenſuring, that they have
juſtified them, <hi>p.</hi> 16. 17. But to hide their deceit in their reply they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Words of <hi>E. B.</hi> in his Q. 12. which were <hi>the Light of Chriſt</hi> to
<hi>Christ</hi> who is that <hi>true Light,</hi> whereas it is manifeſt, that by Chriſt that

or that of the Quotations brought againſt them be againſt the Foundation
of the Chriſtian Religion, as was ſaid in the Title-Page of the Sheet,
to which they have made a pretended reply; but are they ſo ignorant as
not to know that every Error is againſt the Foundation, in ſome degrees

2. That Errors as well as other ill things receive their denomination
from the greater and worſe part; as indeed, the far greateſt part of all
therein contained is deſtructive to the very Foundation of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as is on the ſeveral Heads plainly ſhown.</p>
               <p>And as to the Printed Teſtimony of <hi>John Gledhill,</hi> Nonconformiſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
which they have prefixed to their <hi>Some Account,</hi> it avails them nothing,
for he grants that he did witneſs to the truth of the Quotations, and no
more was deſired from him. The Printing of his Name without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and conſent, reflects no blame on the Perſon who deſired him to ſet
his hand to it, even tho' he told him, that that Paper was not deſigned for
the Preſs, for that Perſon did not put it to the Preſs, but it was Printed
without his leave or conſent; and the Perſon who put it to the Preſs, was
under no tye to hinder him from ſo doing, but judged it would be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Truth to make it publick, as he ſtill ſo judgeth; and it is no
diſhonour to <hi>J. Gledhill,</hi> nor his Brethren, but commendable to have their
Names in Print, to atteſt to the great Truths of the Goſpel, in oppoſition
to the Quakers great Errors, that do ſo manifeſtly contradict them. And it
would be yet more commendable in him and them, to bear a more full
and zealous Teſtimony againſt them, to ſtop the gangrene of the Quakers
vile Errors, that have ſo much prevailed in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> as in many other
places of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> By this and all the foregoing Quotations it is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Light within, not as taught by the Scriptures, but as taught
by the Quakers, hath led them into manifold Blaſphemies, and vile Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,

being more conſcientiouſly tender in the obſervation thereof, we are

Perſons, but that thereby they ſeek to deceive the weak and ſimple,
ſeeing they will not acknowledge, that they are changed in any reſpect
from what they were in the beginning, either in point of Perſwaſion, or
Charity? They mean the ſame now, as when they called them, univerſally
and without exception, beggarly Elements, worldly Rudiments, Idolatry,
Invention of Man, and meer Deluſion?</p>
               <p>But ſeeing they are not changed in their Faith and Perſwaſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Water Baptiſm and the Supper, they cannot with any good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
be changed in their being more charitable now then formerly, ſo
that <hi>G. W.</hi>'s ſaying, they do not cenſure or condemn them, who are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentiouſly
tender in the obſervation thereof, meerly for practiſing that
which they believe is their duty, is a meer fallacy. Do they not condemn
all viſible Chriſtian Societies but their own, and call them <hi>Apoſtates, the
World, Idolaters, Worſhippers of</hi> Baal, <hi>and the Preachers belonging to thoſe Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Prieſts of</hi> Baal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do they not cenſure them, who practiſe Idolatry,
and Man's Invention, and meer Deluſion? as they have paſt Judgment
on thoſe outward practiſes, to be ſuch. And if People's practiſing what
they believe is their Duty, being miſled by an erring Conſcience, and
Ignorance of Mind (as the Quakers think all are ſo miſled who practiſe
the outward Baptiſm and Supper) can excuſe them from cenſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>G. W.</hi>'s way of Argument, they may extend as much Charity,
not only to Judaiſing Chriſtians, that would practiſe outward Circumciſion,
but to <hi>Inſidels, Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> yea, and the moſt Superſtitious and
Idolatrous Papiſts, for no doubt many of them practiſe what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is their Duty, when they pray to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and other Saints,
and adore the Bread in the Maſs, being miſled by an erring Conſcience,
to believe it is the real Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But they falſely infer, that becauſe unworthy Perſons do partake of the
outward Supper, that therefore it is the Table of Devils, and the Cup of


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97123:60"/>
Devils, <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſay, he that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats at
the Table of Devils; <hi>But he that eats this Bread, and drinks this Cup of the
Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor.
11. 27. Thus we ſee that according to Scripture, that Cup which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
drink is the Cup of the Lord, and not the Cup of Devils, and that
Bread which they eat is the Bread of the Lord, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
they eat <hi>Panem Domini,</hi> but not <hi>Panem Dominum</hi> the Bread of the
Lord, but not the Bread which is the Lord?</p>
               <p>Some of the Quakers ſaid, <hi>George,</hi> ſeeing thou art for the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
and the Supper, why doſt thou not practiſe them.</p>
               <p>To this I gave the following account, which many declared was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
unto them, that not having an outward Call, I ought not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
them to others upon the pretence of an inward extraordinary Call,
which too many pretend to have. And for my Speaking at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi>
and elſewhere as I had occaſion, I do not pretend to any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Call in ſo doing, but what I did, was what a private Chriſtian,
who has a Spiritual Gift and Ability given him of God (eſpecially to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Hereſie) may and ought to do, to teach his Neighbours Catechiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(not to ſet up any Sect, or make any Schiſm) as <hi>Origine</hi> taught in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Aſſemblies, when a Lay-man, before he received Ordination; and ſo
did others, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhoweth in his Church-Hiſtory: And as to Baptiſm,
I was ſatisfied with what I had received in Infancy, being Born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Parents; for I believe, That Baptiſm, being a Seal of God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, doth as really belong to Infant Chirdren of Believers under
the New Teſtament, as Circumciſion did to Infant Children of Believers
under the Old Teſtament. Next as concerning the Lord's-Supper, after it
pleaſed God to convince me that it is an Inſtitution of Chriſt, and let me
ſee my Error and Sin, in rejecting it, for which I have been humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and asked his Forgiveneſs, and which, I hope, God for Chriſt's
ſake, has given me; I had ſome conſiderable time of heſitation, about the
lawful and due Adminiſtrator, and after I had clearneſs in that, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd
for ſome time, for the ſake of ſome others, leſt my forwardneſs ſhould
be an hindrance and offence to them; but, through Mercy, that being much
removed, I became uneaſie to delay it longer, ſo that I declar'd I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
God willing, with the firſt opportunity, to receive it. And whereas
my Adverſaries among the Quakers did object againſt me, that I am a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of no viſible Society, and on that pretence refuſe to have any publick
Diſpute or Conference with me. To this I anſwer'd, firſt, Suppoſing it
were ſo, why ſhould that be made a Crime in me, which <hi>W. P.</hi> in his
<hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> eſteem'd ſo great a Virtue in <hi>G. Fox,</hi> viz. <hi>That
he was of no particular Society;</hi> but, ſecondly, I told them I was a Member
of the Catholick Church of Chriſt, and I did own the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to be a part of the Catholick Church, and other Proteſtant Churches to be
other parts of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of the Meeting I told the Auditory, I was ready, by God's
Aſſiſtance, to prove againſt my Adverſaries, the Chief Leaders and Teachers
of the Quakers, particularly <hi>George Whitehead, Joſ. Wyeth,</hi> and them of the


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97123:61"/>
Second-Days-Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> who have approv'd the Quakers Books,
That they do not believe <hi>One Article of that call'd the Apoſtles Creed,</hi> in the
true ſenſe of Scripture, and of all true and Orthodox Chriſtians throughout
the World; and I deſir'd the Quakers preſent, to acquaint their Brethren
with my ſaid Propoſal: I alſo told the Auditory, that the falſe pretences of
the Quakers Teachers to extraordinary prophetical Inſpirations gave them
the juſt Character of falſe Prophets, and all ſuch who had the like falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
with them; and that none could juſtly be ſo called, however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
unſound or miſtaken, that had not thoſe high pretences. That it was
ſome of the moſt crying Sins committed in this Land, that ſo many falſe
Prophets ſhould abound in it, ſpeaking Lyes in the Name of the Lord, and
ſaying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> pretending the fame <hi>Immediate Meſſage and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
that the true Prophets had, whenas they can give no proof of it, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
undeniable proofs can be given to the contrary, as particularly their
vile Antichriſtian Errors publiſh'd in their Books, and that lewd Swearing
and open Prophanation of the Name of God, are not greater Sins, nor ſo
great nor dangerous, in many reſpects, as their ſpeaking Lyes in <hi>the Name
of the Lord,</hi> and entituling their vile Errors and Blaſphemies to the Spirit
of God, as they commonly do.</p>

            <head>POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>FOR an Evidence of my owning the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be a part
of the true Catholick Church of Chriſt, I did with great inward Peace
and Satisfaction, I bleſs God, receive the Lord's-Supper, by <hi>D. Bedford,</hi> in
his Church in <hi>Buttolph-lane,</hi> with others of that Congregation, the firſt Lord's
Day of the Month of <hi>February,</hi> 1699, and ſince again in the ſame place,
by the ſame Perſon, the firſt Lord's Day of this Inſtant Month of <hi>March,</hi>
1699. On which ſame day <hi>Robert Bridgeman,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Everard,</hi> and
ſome other of my Friends (formerly under the profeſſion of Quakers, and
in great repute among that People, whom God, in his great Mercy, hath
of late times enlightned, to ſee their former Error, and to renounce it)
did receive the Lord's-Supper in <hi>Huntington,</hi> and have declar'd that they
receiv'd it with great inward Peace and Satisfaction; the account whereof
I have from the ſaid <hi>Robert Bridgeman,</hi> by his Letter to me, bearing Date the
5th of this Inſtant; in which Letter he alſo informs me, and in another of
a former Date, of about Ten of my Friends in <hi>Huntington</hi> and <hi>Godman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
and there-about, who formerly were Quakers all of good repute,
who now go to Church there; and that <hi>Margaret Everard</hi> has had her
youngeſt Son, and three Daughters lately Baptized: Alſo, by Letters from
<hi>Bedford,</hi> I have an account, that ſome both in the Town and County of
<hi>Bedford</hi> are come off from the Quakers and gone to Church, particularly


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97123:61"/>
               <hi>W. Mather</hi> and his Wife; alſo at <hi>Reading,</hi> divers who were formerly Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
and were ſo Educated, have gone to Church and have been Baptized,
and ſome there have brought their Children to be Baptized, and here at <hi>London,</hi>
divers of both Sexes who were educated under the profeſſion of Quakers
have been lately Baptized and go to Church, one of whom is my Youngeſt
Daughter, my Elder Daughter having been Baptized above a Year ago, ſo
that to my certain knowledge above forty Perſons within a few Months
paſt are come off from Quakeriſm, and brought to the Church, which gives
a good ground of hope, that many others will follow, which God in his
great Mercy grant, and proſper my ſincere, tho' mean Endeavours and
Labours, and other his Servants, whom he has made inſtrumental in this
Work, and for the ſucceſs he has been pleaſed to give us therein, all
Glory, and Honour and Praiſe be given to his moſt worthy Name, through
Jeſus Chriſt, Amen. And whereas my adverſaries <hi>G. W.</hi> and other of the
Preachers of the Second Days meeting at <hi>London,</hi> had given it as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they would not meet me at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> to diſpute with me,
at the former Meetings for the Years 1696, 97, 98, according to my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
Advertiſements, that they knew none who had been in Unity
with them, ſince I came into <hi>England,</hi> who did own me, or were in danger
by me to be brought off from them, that Objection, to their Knowledge
and full Conviction, is now quite removed, for both <hi>R. Bridgeman</hi> and
<hi>M. Everard,</hi> (beſides divers others that might be mentioned) were not
only in Unity with them, ſince my arrival into <hi>England,</hi> but in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
among them. <hi>R. Bridgeman,</hi> having been but lately a Member of
their Men's Meetings at <hi>London,</hi> and one of the Twelve, who were entruſted
with the receiving and diſtributing the Money collected for their poor in
the City of <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Margaret Everard</hi> having for many Years, till
of very late, been received and well owned as a Speaker among them, both
in City and Country. And it is moſt certain, that the Quakers refuſing
to meet with me, at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> to anſwer to the Quotations I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of their Books, has been a great means to let many of thoſe
formerly in Unity with them, ſee their ſandy Foundation, and the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Cauſe, and will yet be a further means to give many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the like diſcovery, who are diſſatisfied with their not appearing either
to vindicate their Books and Authors, or to acknowledge the great Errors
contained in them, and publickly to retract them. They are indeed
brought to a very pinching dilemma, if they will not appear in publick
view, to anſwer to the charges of the vile Errors and Hereſies, yea, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes
brought againſt them, by plain Quotations out of their Books pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the People preſent by ocular inſpection, they now ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of what is paſt, what the conſequence will be, even that many
of themſelves will ſee they have a bad Cauſe, which becauſe they are not
able to defend, they find out and deviſe frivolous excuſes, why they will not
appear. And if they will appear, there is the like and equal danger,
that their Errors, Hereſies and Blaſphemies will be detected to their own
People, as indeed the laſt Meetings, where ſome of them, (though none
principally concerned,) did appear, have had a good ſervice in ſome
owned by them, to give them a diſcovery of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97123:62"/>
There remains but two ſhadows of Reaſon why they will not appear,
one is, that it is offenſive to civil Authority, but this is a meer pretence,
for whatever offence it may be to ſome particular Perſons that may too
much favour their errors, yet it can be no juſt offence to Civil Authority,
there being no Law againſt it, and where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor can it be ſuppoſed, that it can offend the civil Authority, that
ſuch an innocent and probable way to reduce the Quakers from their vile
Hereſie, which God has in meaſure manifeſtly bleſſed with ſome Succeſs,
and to bring them to the Church, is uſed to that effect: For, muſt not
ſome means be uſed to reclaim them, and what means ſo probable as
this? The Act of Tolleration, to be ſure, doth not forbid any, by fair
Reaſon and Argument, to deal with them, for their Convincement; and
for an Inſtance, that this manner of proceeding is not offenſive to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
I had the leave of the <hi>Lord Mayor of London,</hi> for each of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
I have yet had.</p>
            <p>Their other ſhadow of Reaſon, is, That they think it better to Anſwer
in Print to what is objected againſt them, out of their Books, than by
Word of Mouth. I confeſs, indeed, it is the moſt ready and expedient
way for them to hide and cloak their vile Errors, and boldly to deny them,
whenever ſo juſtly charg'd with them, by their Sophiſtical Quibling and
Evaſions; and particularly, by their boldly aſſerting the Quotations to be
falſely, or lamely given, when they are ever ſo truly and fully given,
which not one of many thouſands, ſimply by Reading their pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
and Defences in Print, can be able to judge, whether the Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be true or falſe, perfect or lame; becauſe they have not, nor can they
eaſily find out the Books, out of which the Quotations are taken, whereby
to compare them; and ſuppoſe the Books could be found, yet few will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
ſo much, either time or labour, to compare them; whereas the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Books and the Quotations contain'd in them, by Ocular inſpection,
to Perſons preſent, ſaves all that labour, and is the ſureſt and readieſt
way, to find out the truth of Matters, in point of Truth or Error, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or not the Quakers are juſtly charged with thoſe Errors. Beſide, if
they think their Anſwering to the Charges againſt them, by Print, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to them, had they Truth on their ſide, they would be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Principles and Profeſſion both ways, that is, both by Word of
Mouth, and alſo by their Pens, for ſtill two ways are better than one;
if both be proper to the ſame true end, which is the Diſcovery of Truth
and Error.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding of their brags, and telling that they have Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me from time to time in Print, yet this is but an empty flouriſh;
divers of my chiefeſt Books againſt them, for the detection of their Errors,
they have not given the leaſt Reply unto; as my Second and Third <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives;</hi>
my Book, call'd, <hi>The Quakers Arguments against Baptiſm and the
Supper,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Examin'd and Refuted;</hi> my <hi>Larger and Shorter Catechiſms;</hi> my
Book, call'd, <hi>The Deiſm of</hi> W. Penn, and that call'd, <hi>The Fallacies of</hi> W. P.
<hi>and his Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. And tho' <hi>T. Elwood</hi> Printed a pretended Reply to
my <hi>First Narrative,</hi> yet the Anſwer given to it, call'd, <hi>Satan Diſrob'd,</hi> which


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97123:62"/>
hath effectually diſcover'd the falſeneſs and folly of it, hath not received
an Anſwer from them to this Day. And their uſual way of anſwering Books
writ againſt them, is to Quible and Evade in ſome few particulars, and wholly
to paſs by the moſt material things urged againſt them: And yet to boaſt
and brag, that they have given a ſufficient Anſwer.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Joſ. Wy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th,</hi> in his Printed Paper, in Anſwer to my late
Printed Advertiſement, ſaith, <hi>They</hi> (i. e. the Quakers) <hi>in common with all
Proteſtant Diſſenters, are Intituled to the peaceable Profeſſion of their Chriſtian
Principles, and may be deemed imprudent to call it in Queſtion,</hi> &amp;c. To this I
ſay, it is a meer begging the Queſtion, That either their Principles are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
or that they are Intitul'd to the peaceable Profeſſion of what they
call ſo, <hi>In Common with Proteſtant Diſſenters.</hi> The Act of Toleration has no
more declared their Principles to be Chriſtian, than the Toleration that
<hi>Holland</hi> and other <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> have given to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> doth
declare their Principle to be Chriſtian. Beſides, tho' the Quakers think it
imprudent in them, to call their Principles or Profeſſion in queſtion, yet
it is no breach of the Act of Tolleration, nor imprudence in me, or any,
who have ſufficient evidence to give of their Unchriſtian, yea, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Principles, to call them in queſtion, and that publickly in the Face
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>And cannot the Quakers defend their Principles in Sober Diſputes, in a
Chriſtian Aſſembly, without breach of Peace, or invading their peaceable
Profeſſion? How frequently did they provoke, but ſome Years ago, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Diſputes, Miniſters of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whoſe Religion (was more
than Tollerated) was Eſtabliſh'd by Law? By the Quakers Argument, this was
a breach of the Peace, and an Invaſion of the peaceable Profeſſion of the
Religion Eſtabliſh'd by Law in the Nation.</p>
            <p>But, to deal plainly with them, I do not think that either the Profeſſion
of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> or <hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi>'s Principles is ſo much as Tollerated by the
Act of Tolleration; and if they will call me to an Account for this my
plain dealing with them, before any Judicatory, I ſhall, by God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
be ready to Anſwer.</p>
            <p>I neither envy, nor grudge the connivance they have, but ſeeing they are
become ſo inſolent with their falſe and unjuſt pretences, to what they have
not, as if the Act of Tolleration did not only give them a permiſſion, but did
entitle them to a peaceable profeſſion of their moſt Antichriſtian Principles,
which they moſt falſely call Chriſtian, that their Principles may not be called
in queſtion, and fairly examined, and the falſhood of them detected in
that publick manner that I have hitherto uſed, it is high time to tell
them of their miſtake, that the Act of Tolleration doth neither of them,
and that therefore the beſt and only ſafeſt and readieſt way to be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Act of Tolleration, is for them to reject, retract and renounce
their vile errors, eſpecially thoſe againſt the holy and ever bleſſed Trinity,
whereof I have ſufficiently proved them guilty if this foregoing Narrative.
<hi>Joſ. Wyeth</hi> indeed, hints at the moſt politick Reaſon they have for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to meet with me, to hear themſelves proved guilty of vile Hereſies,
that it would be a too publick expoſing themſelves to the danger of loſing


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97123:63"/>
their pretence, <hi>to their being intituled to the peacable profeſſion of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
which in other words he expreſſes thus, <hi>To trifle away that for which
they account themſelves ſo thankfully engaged to their Superiours, the intent of
which he ſaith,</hi> [viz. The Act of Tolleration] In it's Preamble, is declared
to be, <hi>to Unite the King's Proteſtant Subjects in intereſt and affection.</hi> Surely
by this way of his Arguing he muſt needs think that to come to a publick,
fair, and free Tryal, were to endanger their liberty of Profeſſion, or trifle
it away: But how can this trifle away their liberty, if their principles
be Chriſtian, and that they are ſure, they are by virtue of their Chriſtian
principles included in that Act? To ſuppoſe their may be a danger <hi>to
trifle away their liberty, or peacable profeſſion</hi> of what they call their Chriſtian
principles, by publick Tryal, is to ſuppoſe, that upon due examination,
their principles may be found not to be Chriſtian, which if once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<hi>would trifle away that liberty,</hi> and therefore it is their beſt policy
to hide and cover their principles, all that they can, and ſtill lie hid as the
<hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> for the evil doer hates the Light, and is not willing
to be brought to the Light. But how little do the Quakers regard the
intent of the Act of Tolleration, declared in its Preamble <hi>to Unite
the King's Proteſtant Subjects in intereſt and affection,</hi> when they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
generally to this very Day, in their <hi>horrid uncharitableneſs</hi> towards all
viſible Chriſtian Societies, both <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and all Proteſtant Churches,
<hi>That they are no part of the Church of Chriſt, that their Religion, and Worſhip
is falſe and idolatrous, the people belonging to thoſe Societies are Worſhippers of</hi>
Baal, <hi>and their Miniſters Prieſts of</hi> Baal, <hi>Deceivers, Antichriſts, denyers
of Chriſt come in the Fleſh, the bane of Soul and Body of Mankind,</hi> &amp;c.
And have never to this Day, retracted this Language; is this to <hi>Unite
the King's Proteſtant Subjects in intereſt and affection,</hi> to rail againſt that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and Church, whereof the King himſelf, and the beſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are members, and to call me and my Friends for owning that Church,
and coming into Communion with her, and relinquiſhing the errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by that Church, Apoſtates, and Runagadoes, as they have done,
and ſtill continue to do. For his inſinuation of my envy, which (he ſaith)
increaſing, <hi>has led me into a diſturbance of Mind, which in its courſe reſembles
the returns of a delirious affliction.</hi> I think it not worth noticing further
than to give it as an inſtance of his and their Scornful, Proud and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well as Uncharitable and Unchriſtian Temper and Spirit. They
reckon me their Enemy, becauſe I tell them the truth, and labour to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
them from out of the Snares of Satan, and ſeeing my ſincere labours
God has been pleaſed to bleſs with ſucceſs both in <hi>America</hi> and here
away, none of their malicious Inſinuations or Accuſations againſt me, are
nor I hope, ſhall be of force to ſtop me from my Chriſtian Duty, to contend
earneſtly for the Faith of Chriſt, which they ſeek to deſtroy.</p>
