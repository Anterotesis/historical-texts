            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour pronounces no leſs than Eight dreadful Woes againſt the Scribes and Phariſees for their groſs Hypocriſy; and amongſt the reſt, for the pretended Reverence they bore to the Memory of the Ancient Prophets, whom their fore-fathers wickedly Abuſed, Perſecuted, and Killed; ſo that they ſaid, <hi>If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets,</hi> v. 30.</p>
            <p>But our Saviour ſhews, that if they had lived in thoſe Days, they would have acted in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62716:4"/>
ſame way; ſince the ſame temper was exiſtent in them, as had been heretofore in their Fathers. So <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Ye are witneſſes unto your ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Fill ye up then the meaſure of your Fathers,</hi> for that ye are now in the way to: <hi>Wherefore, behold I ſend unto you prophets,</hi> &amp;c. and ye will do unto them as your Fathers heretofore did unto thoſe Prophets, whoſe Sepulchres ye now Garniſh, and whoſe Praiſes ye Celebrate. So that in the Event, upon you will come the ſoreſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it will be, as if all <hi>the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias,</hi> &amp;c. were required of this Generation.</p>
            <p>There is ſome doubt to be made concerning the <hi>Zachariah</hi> referred to in the Text; for there were ſeveral of that Name in Scripture, as alſo in <hi>Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian. But this we may obſerve, that whoever he was, he was Slain before the time that our Saviour here ſo ſharply inveighs againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> for it is by him charged upon them as a thing paſt, <hi>whom ye ſlew.</hi> Again, it was a ſtory well known to that People, and a caſe very notorious; and if ſo, as there was no caſe more notorious than <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24. 20.</note>that of <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehoiada;</hi> ſo there was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62716:4"/>
none that this Character could agree to, but to him, who was ſlain <hi>in the court of the houſe of the Lord;</hi> or as it is here, <hi>between the Temple and the Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then there are Two or Three difficulties remaining, one of which is, That <hi>Zachariah,</hi> who is here called the Son of <hi>Barachias,</hi> is in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Story ſaid to be the Son of <hi>Jehoiada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 21. Prov. 31. 1. 2 Kings 23. 34. 2 Chron. 36. 4. <hi>Vid.</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph. Ant. l. 2. c. 12.</note> In anſwer to which, We may obſerve from Scripture, That it was common among the <hi>Jews</hi> (as among many other Nations) to give ſeveral Names to the ſame Perſon; as <hi>Solomon</hi> was called <hi>Lemuel</hi> and <hi>Jedidiah;</hi> and eſpecially where thoſe Names were of the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Jehojakim</hi> and <hi>Eliakim.</hi> And thus it is with <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> and <hi>Barachiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It was uſual to give, or to have Names given, upon ſome Eminent Service done by them, or ſome Eminent Bleſſing that befel them. So <hi>Gideon</hi> had the Name of <hi>Jerubbaal</hi> given to him by his Father <hi>Joaſh,</hi> upon his breaking down <note place="margin">Jud. 6. 32.</note>the Altar of <hi>Baal:</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> was called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28.</note>becauſe <hi>as a prince he had power with God and men.</hi> Thus <hi>Zacharias</hi> is here called the Son of <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> or (as that Name ſignifies) the <hi>bleſſed of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 31. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
               <hi>the Lord,</hi> which was among them a term of Honour and Reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62716:5"/>
And a Name without doubt, as it was due, ſo was given to <hi>Jehoiada</hi> in a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe of his eminent Piety, and of his Zeal in advancing <hi>Joaſh</hi> to the Throne; and for reſtoring the Liberties and Religion of that People, after they had both been invaded by <note place="margin">2 Chron. 23.</note>the Infamous Practices of the Idolatrous <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.</hi> He may for this reaſon well deſerve the Name of <hi>Barachias,</hi> or <hi>the bleſſed of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then the Aggravation of the Sin was, That this <hi>Zachariah</hi> martyr'd by them, was the Son of that brave <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> that Patriot of their Countrey; and whom, without any regard to his Anceſtor, to his own Quality, his Meſſage, or the Place, they furiouſly ruſhed upon, and <note place="margin">Levit. 24. 16.</note>ſtoned him (the Puniſhment of Blaſphemers) in the Court of the Lord's Houſe, or Court of the Prieſts.</p>
            <p>A Fact ſo heinous, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, his Blood <note place="margin">V. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</hi> Vol. 2. Talmud. Exercitat.</note>continully bubbled up, and was not expiated till the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, which was about Two hundred and fifty years after.</p>
            <p>But if it was at this diſtance from the time of our Saviour, how comes this Inſtance of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> to be the laſt, as that of <hi>Abel</hi> was the firſt?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Becauſe that Blood was ſuppoſed to lye upon that Nation till the Captivity; after
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62716:5"/>
which they were as averſe to Idolatry, as ever they were before addicted to it; and therefore that ſort of Perſecution ended with it.</p>
            <p>But if it were ſo that <hi>Zacharias</hi> was the Son of that <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> it ſeems very hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt that this Blood, and much more the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and all the Righteous Blood ſhed upon the Earth, ſhould be required of that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as our Saviour here affirms.</p>
            <p>For what was the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> to them, who was Killed by his Brother <hi>Cain,</hi> all of whoſe Poſterity periſhed in the Deluge? Or how were they concerned in the Blood of ſuch Righteous Perſons, as were ſlain in other parts of the Earth, or even in that of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> who, though killed by their Anceſtors, was ſlain above Seven hundred years before?</p>
            <p>I grant, this Blood could no more literally be charged upon that Generation, than they could be ſaid to have been Cotemporaries with thoſe Ages of <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Zacharias:</hi> But it is here thus repreſented, partly becauſe they were of the ſame Temper, and were acted by the like ſpirit of Envy and Hatred, as the Murtherers of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Zacharias,</hi> &amp;c. Partly it was as to <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> becauſe the courſe of impiety in former Ages was carried along (though in a different
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62716:6"/>
way) even to that Age; and laſtly, becauſe that what they were now agitating, and would ſhortly accompliſh, would be a Crime of ſuch malignity, as would <hi>fill up the meaſure of their fathers;</hi> and would determine in their Ruin, <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38. <hi>O Jeruſalem! &amp;c. behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is as if he had ſaid:</p>
            <p>Ye think your ſelves clear of your Fathers Iniquity, foraſmuch as ye Garniſh the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of thoſe Prophets whom they wickedly Killed, and that ye are not Idolaters and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors as they; and ſay, <hi>If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them in the blood of the prophets;</hi> but you will ſo far outdo them, that ye will Kill and Crucify thoſe whom I ſhall ſend, and reject the laſt tender of Divine Mercy, and thereby bring upon your ſelves ruin as inexpreſſible, as irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For think of all the Blood of Pious and Juſt Men, that has been ſhed through all Ages of the World; think of that of <hi>Abel,</hi> and of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and all that ye can think of, and yet the caſe will hold no compariſon with what ye will do, in Perſecuting, Killing, and Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophets, and Wiſe Men, that ſhall be ſent to you, and alſo Him that ſends them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>And if the Blood of</hi> Abel cried for vengeance, <hi>and that of</hi> Zacharias <hi>was</hi> required <hi>of your Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors; Then what will not fall upon this Generation! It will be</hi> ſuch as was not from <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 19.</note>the beginning of the creation; <hi>It will be ſuch as if all the Blood of the Prophets, and of Righteous Men from</hi> Abel <hi>downward to that of</hi> Zacharias, <note place="margin">Luke 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 50.</note>
               <hi>were</hi> required <hi>of you;</hi> Behold, I ſend unto you prophets, and wiſe men, &amp;c. that upon you may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth; verily theſe things ſhall come upon this generation.</p>
            <p>In Diſcourſing upon which Argument,</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew;</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it often happens to the Beſt of Men, to be Oppoſed, and Perſecuted, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſed in this World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That this is conſiſtent with the Providence of God and his Government of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That in the ſequel God doth right to his Providence, and to their Piety and Virtue by extraordinary Events.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It often happens to the beſt of Men to be Oppoſed and Evil-Treated.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not go about to prove that which is matter of Fact, and has been the conſtant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all Ages more or leſs. We need not go farther for the confirmation of it than the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62716:7"/>
Inſtances of the Text, <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Righteous</hi> Men upon Record: Or than the ſad Inſtance which this Day ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; when a Perſon as Eminent for his Piety, as his Character and Dignity, was treated, as if he had been the Off-ſcouring of all things, and was, as many of the Righteous Men of Old, Perſecuted and Slain.</p>
            <p>And the Cauſes are as obſervable as the Fact, and of which there are as many, as there are Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Miſunderſtandings, contrary Paſſions and Intereſts. As long as there are Ambition and Pride, Envy and Malice, Covetouſneſs on one hand, or expenſive Vices on another. As long as there are contrary Habits, which are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that rule in all Mankind, there will be Enmities and Oppoſitions; and if Virtue, and Religion, and the Beſt of Men are againſt Perſons in theſe Circumſtances, they will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate the Injury, and be againſt Virtue, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the beſt of Men. For then it is not what the thing is in it ſelf, but what it is as to them; and it often is not becauſe it is Religion, or Virtue, or the Beſt of Men, that they thus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe them; but becauſe they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to their Intereſt, or their Inclination, or ſometimes are to their Reproach. Then it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62716:7"/>
that the Phariſees are for condemning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when they thought that <hi>the Romans would</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 11. 48.</note>
               <hi>come and take away both their place and nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And eſpecially is this of the more fatal and pernicious conſequence, if this Spirit be edged on by a falſe and miſtaken Zeal; and Religion is pretended to by ſome to face an evil deſign, and is believed by others to be concerned in it, and is in danger to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>For then this doth, as they will have it, juſtify and eſtabliſh the Contention, and make it to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Then they think it laudable and meritorious even to <hi>kill,</hi> when, in their Opinion, it is <hi>to do God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 16. 2.</note>
               <hi>ſervice.</hi> It is then a Cauſe fit to venture their own life in, and a Cauſe that will oblige them to take away that of another: Nay, it will even ſerve to break through the Laws of Nature it ſelf, and will have them to put thoſe to Death, whom Nature would otherwiſe teach to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and with the hazard of their own Life to ſave from it. Thus it was foretold by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>The brother ſhall deliver up the brother to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 21.</note>
               <hi>death, and the father the child,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By theſe and the like means, the Beſt of Men too often fall under the heavy hand of Violence and Oppreſſion; and if we were then to judge of them by the uſage they meet with, they muſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62716:8"/>
have been the worſt of Mankind. A caſe which hath tempted ſome to queſtion, and others to deny a Providence.</p>
            <p>But this without reaſon, if there be nothing in theſe Proceedings and Events, but what is conſiſtent with the Divine Overſight and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Which is the next thing to be Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of:</p>
            <p>The Providence of God is ſeen in Preſerving all things in the ſame State and Order as at the firſt eſtabliſhment: And as he ordinarily leaves Natural Cauſes, and neceſſary Agents to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their proper Nature, and to keep to the Law and the Seaſon, at the firſt appointed and preſcribed; ſo he generally leaves voluntary and intelligent Beings to follow their own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and to Chuſe, and Reſolve, and Act as they ſhall ſee meet.</p>
            <p>And if it happens that ſuch Agents proceed upon wrong Principles, or miſtaken Meaſures, it is no more than if in meer Natural Cauſes there are ſome Preternatural Accidents happen, through the concourſe of different parts of Matter together.</p>
            <p>And if ſometimes Good Men are left to their own Precipitance, as <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when he was not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62716:8"/>
to be diſſwaded from Attacking <hi>Pharaoh-Necho;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 20.</note>and Wicked Men are left to their own Perverſeneſs and Obſtinacy, as <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> or to their Pride, as <note place="margin">Iſa. 10.</note>the Haughty <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> and they periſh in it: This in the Voluntary World is no more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, than when there is Seed-time and Harveſt in the Natural World; that is, that each acts according to the Nature they are of, and the Condition they are in.</p>
            <p>And it is no imputation upon Providence, if in this way Good Men, or the Beſt of Men, fall ſometimes into hard Circumſtances, when Cauſes are left to their own tendency, and are (as it were) in their own Power. For Nature is but Nature; and to keep Nature in its courſe, is an Act of Providence; to keep Stated and Permanent Beings in their Station and Order, and Tranſient in a continued Succeſſion, and Voluntary in their own Power and Liberty; is a ſpecial Fruit of the Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs, if there were no more, and that Providence were a meer Superviſor, it would not be the Providence worthy of ſo Divine a Power, nor ſo worthy of that Veneration we owe to it.</p>
            <p>There is therefore a more noble part of it behind, and that is, That though God gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62716:9"/>
keeps to the Laws he has given, and Preſerves the World as he made it; yet he upon occaſion interpoſes, and doth as well Govern the World as Preſerve it; and as he can when he pleaſes ſtop the current of the violent Ocean for a Paſſage to his People, and make the <hi>ſtars</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judg. 5. 20.</note>
               <hi>in their courſes to fight</hi> againſt their Enemies; ſo he doth Govern the Wills and Paſſions of Men, <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note>and turns them <hi>as the rivers of water,</hi> to or from their Purpoſe and Deſign, or promotes or hinders their Deſign from Succeſs, as he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>And if it be asked, Why he doth not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in caſes that ſeem to us to be of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſequence, and which the Welfare of a Nation, the Safety of his People, the Good of his Church, turn upon; Why, for example, he doth not prevent the Sufferings and Oppreſſions of Good Men?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Becauſe it is for a greater Good, ſometimes to themſelves, ſometimes to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by making them an Example of <hi>Patience, Charity, and Conſtancy;</hi> ſometimes for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Church, and for the Propagation of Religion, and always for his own Honour and Service. Need we a greater Inſtance of this than the Sufferings and Death of our Bleſſed Saviour, with which ſeemingly, the Cauſe ſeemed to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62716:9"/>
loſt; <hi>We truſted that it was he which ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 24. 21.</note>
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaid the deſpairing Diſciples.</p>
            <p>And his Enemies thought they had prevented all after-growth of that Doctrine he Taught, when they had Slain him, and made ſure the <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 65.</note>Sepulchre by Sealing the Stone, and ſetting a Watch. But his Reſurrection baffled all their endeavours, and ſhewed how conſiſtent this his Crucifixion was with the Divine Providence, proceeding from the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> of God. <note place="margin">Acts 4. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it happened, in a lower degree, with the Enemies of our Government, Church, and Religion, who thought all at an end, when they had cut down the Defender of it. But we know what the Event was, Confuſion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and, in proceſs of time, a Glorious Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and <hi>Reſtoration</hi> to our Ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Liberties, and Eſtabliſhed Religion.</p>
            <p>And if God hath theſe noble Ends in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and thus brings Good out of Evil; the Objection is foreclos'd, and the mouth of all Gainſayers muſt be ſtopp'd.</p>
            <p>Thus it ordinarily is; and if in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this be not ſo evident, and the Judgments of God prove a <hi>great deep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and too deep for us to fathom, it is no more an Objection againſt a Providence, than it is an Argument that a Child
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62716:10"/>
is not a Rational Creature, becauſe at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we cannot find in it the exerciſe of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>In many caſes there is Faith and Expectation, and the farther Succeſs and Events of things, which we are to defer our Judgment to.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient God doth put forth ſuch acts of a Divine Power in ſome ſpecial Caſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as ſhall enforce the Perverſeſt, the moſt <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 27. 8. 19.

            </p>
            <p>And this will bring us nearer yet to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Day, in the next Head: Which is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That God doth in very eminent Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Caſes, and Events, do Right to his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to the Righteous Men that frequently Suffer and meet with the hardeſt Uſage in this World.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enlarge upon this Argument, but confine my ſelf to what is intimated in the Text, when the Puniſhment of Antecedent Crimes is transferred to, and falls upon Succeſſors; and an after-Age, or Ages, ſuffer for the foregoing, whether Perſonal, Domeſtical, or National; this is intimated here, <hi>That upon you may come all</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62716:10"/>
               <hi>the righteous blood,</hi> &amp;c. but more expreſly is it in that Clauſe, <hi>whom ye ſlew;</hi> which the <hi>Greek</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being in the Singular, refers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to <hi>Zacharias;</hi> for it is not ſaid the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and of all other <hi>Righteous</hi> Men through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, <hi>which they ſhed,</hi> as it is of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias whom ye ſlew.</hi> Which ſhews, that it is in another relation that they ſtood in to <hi>Zacharias</hi> than they did to <hi>Abel;</hi> and that was, becauſe <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> was ſlain by their Fathers, and which they owned to have for ſome Ages been imputed to their Nation before the Captivity (as has been beforeſaid).</p>
            <p>The imputation of one Man's, or one Age's Sin, in the Puniſhment of it to another; and that Princes have ſuffered for the People <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 28. 2.</note>, and People for their Princes <note n="†" place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 1.</note>, and Children for their Fathers, and an after-Generation for a fore-going, has been owned by all; the Heathens are full of it, and the Scriptures often appeal to it; and <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 4. Dan 9. 16.</note>therefore this was a part of their ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; and their Fathers Iniquity, as well as their own, was either Confeſſed, or Diſclaimed.</p>
            <p>But it concerns us to look ſomewhat further into this Argument, for the uſe it may be of. And in Diſcourſing upon it,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62716:11"/>
In proſecution of which I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What thoſe Sins are, whoſe Puniſhment above others is thus transferr'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The caſe of Perſons, or Nations, with reſpect to thoſe Sins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is to be done by way of relief and remedy.</p>
            <p>As to the former, there are Two ſorts of Sins, Perſonal and Relative; Perſonal are ſuch as in their Effects paſs no farther than the Perſon, and reſpect not others, when all the hurt is as to himſelf, bating only what it may be in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note>and then where the Sin reſts, there reſts the Puniſhment; and <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye; the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,—and the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon himſelf</hi> alone; as it is ſaid in the Prophet.</p>
            <p>But now where the Sins are Relative, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect others, and which they are damnified by, then the Puniſhment is farther dilated and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo it falls upon the Perſon and the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as God the Supreme Lawgiver doth direct.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that there is one Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> That of Idolatry, to which a Threatning of this kind is annexed, as we find it in the Second Commandment; though it doth not immediately affect others; but being it ſo directly ſtruck at the foundation of all Religion, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62716:11"/>
that of the <hi>Jews</hi> (whoſe Conſtitution was a Theocracy, immediately under God) there was this terrible Sanction added to it, to make Perſons the more cautious of Offending. But otherwiſe the Sins ſo Threatned, and for which Perſons in Succeſſion were Puniſhed, were the Sins that the Intereſts of others, or the Publick, were concerned in and damnified by (as has been ſaid)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The reaſon of which ſeems to be, Becauſe as to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Vices, the Offenders ſhall anſwer for them in another World; where every Man ſhall bear his own Burthen, and give an Account of himſelf to God. But thoſe Sins which reſpect others, and which the Welfare and Peace of Societies are Prejudiced by, they (beſides the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in reſerve in the next Life) ſhall here be Puniſhed for: And that they may be deterred from ſuch Practices, the Threatning involves their Poſterity with them; than which nothing, generally, more awes Mankind. And eſpecially is this more to be obſerved in thoſe caſes, which the Laws of Men cannot, or do not, reach, or the Executive Power in a Government is too Weak to Puniſh.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give an Inſtance or two of this kind, omitting others, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Notorious Injuſtice; the Oppreſſing of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62716:12"/>
others that are not able to Help, or Right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>In this caſe the Providence of God doth often (I dare not ſay, always) concern it ſelf: So that if Reſtitution be not made, either the Perſon himſelf ſhall ſee it moulder away before his <note place="margin">Luke 12. 20.</note>Eyes, or is ſnatched away from it, as the Fool in the Goſpel, with a, <hi>This Night,</hi>—and then <hi>whoſe ſhall all theſe things be which thou haſt provided?</hi> Or ſuppoſe the Eſtate thus acquired be turned over entire to his Heir, ſome ſecret Worm goes along with it, that like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd it withers away, and he is expoſed to all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of an indigent Life; and ends, perhaps, where the Father began.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation is not new, nor rare; it was Proverbial among the Heathens, as is well known, <hi>De male quaeſitis vix gaudet tertius haeres;</hi> and no Nation but can anſwer it in their own Language.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Inſtance is that of Blooddſheding, or Murther. The Life of Man is eaſily taken away, and what any deſperate Perſon may Command; and therefore when nothing is more Valuable, or that the World in Succeſſion more depends upon, Almighty God by a ſpecial and early Law took care for the ſecurity of it.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62716:12"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> For which no ſatisfaction was to be allowed, and nothing leſs than Blood was eſtimated as an equivalent for it, where it was diſcovered; and where it was not, it was to lie upon the Place, till it was ſome way or other Expiated, and as far as could be, there was an Atonement made. This was the caſe of unknown Homicide under the Law, when <note place="margin">Numb 35. 31.</note>the Elders of the City, next to the Slain, were required to waſh their Hands over the Heifer, and to ſay, <hi>Our hands have not ſhed this blood, neither have our eyes ſeen it; be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people Iſrael, and lay not innocent blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy people's charge, and that blood ſhall be forgiven them. So ſhalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you,</hi> Deut. 21. 3. For Blood was ſaid to Defile the Land, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 35.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears that innocent Blood was reputed to lie upon the Land till an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made. The proper Expiation was the Blood of the Guilty himſelf, where-ever he was to be found; and in that caſe there was no Commutation, no Subſtitution, no Sacrifice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but Life was to go for Life, according to the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 30, 31. <hi>Whoſo killeth any perſon, the murtherer ſhall be put to death,</hi>—
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62716:13"/>
               <hi>Ye ſhall take no ſatisfaction for the life of a murtherer who is guilty of death, but he ſhall be ſurely put to Death.</hi> If he was not diſcovered, then the courſe before ſpoken of, in killing the Heifer, and uſing the Rites preſcribed on that occaſion, was to be taken: And in either of thoſe caſes, the Guilt went no farther. It was not then imputed to the Nation, it lay wholly on him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Fact; and who in the ſecret Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God was to Anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>But if it were diſcovered, and the Murtherer was ſuffered to eſcape without that condign and perſonal Puniſhment required; then beſides what he himſelf ſhould account for to God, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, the Charge fell upon the Place or the People, and they were to Anſwer to God for it.</p>
            <p>And this tranſlation of the Guilt is ſo much the more Obſervable, as the Fact is Aggravated by the Quality of the Perſon Suffering, and thus Uſed; or by the Relation the Perſon or Perſons Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending are in. It was ſo here, when they were Righteous Men, and Prophets that were Slain, as <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Zacharias:</hi> And when it was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Act, as was the Killing of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> in which Fact there was a concurrence of all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Degrees, as you may ſee it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 17, 21.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62716:13"/>
And this was above all manifeſt in the Caſe here tacitly referr'd to, which is the Crucifixion of our Saviour; and which that infatuated People fixed the Guilt of upon themſelves by an indelible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, when they cried out, <hi>His blood be on us and our children,</hi> Matth. 27. 25.</p>
            <p>And there is ſomewhat like this, in the Fact which gave the ſad Occaſion to this Day's Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; it was Heinous in it ſelf, Aggravated by the Quality of the Perſon, and too great a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Guilt of it, though not ſo great as to make it Univerſal, or a National Crime. God forbid it ſhould ever be ſo in the Effects of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this leads me to conſider the Caſe; and that is Twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Of thoſe that are in the ſame State with their Anceſtors, and are either Guilty of the ſame Facts, or are of the ſame Temper with them. As is the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> repreſented by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who though not Idolaters as their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before the Captivity, were yet of the ſame rancorous temper; and would in Fact be Guilty of the ſame Perſecution of Righteous Men as they; and ſo they might well be called their Children, whoſe meaſure they were haſtening to fill up. This is a Caſe all muſt acknowledge, and is agreeable to the common Senſe of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62716:14"/>
(2.) There is the caſe of thoſe, that though Deſcendants from ſuch as have been Guilty of great Crimes, yet are not involved in them; and ſo in reaſon may be thought not obnoxious to any Puniſhment for their ſakes, or for the ſake of what has been done by Progenitors. And the caſe is reſolved in favour to ſuch, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 4, 20. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die, the ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father,</hi> &amp;c. according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law given to that People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 16. <hi>The fathers ſhall not be put to death for their children, neither ſhall the children be put to death for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: every man ſhall be put to death for his own ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here we are to Obſerve, That the ſtreſs lies upon that, That <hi>the ſon ſhall not be put to death</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 14. 6.</note>
               <hi>for the father;</hi> this was a ſtanding Law they were to keep to, and which none but Almighty God, the Great Lawgiver, could reverſe, as he did, only in ſome ſpecial caſes, ſuch as that of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Achan,</hi> Numb. 16. 32. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 24.</p>
            <p>But it is not to be denied, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, there are Caſes in which the Innocent may ſuffer for the Nocent; Innocent Poſterity, I mean, for their Nocent Anceſtors, as has been beforeſhewed. I acknowledge it is a difficult matter to ſtate this Caſe, as to all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Meaſures of it. There is no conſtant
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62716:14"/>
Rule that the Providence of God inviolably keeps to in the Government of the World; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Judgment we may be liable to make as to ſome Events, and in which the Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God is conſpicuous to all; and however in ſome caſes he may generally ſo proceed, as that we may raiſe Maxims from thence; yet being it is not univerſally ſo, we are not to apply them without great Caution, nor can we particularly apply them without danger of miſtake: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has taught us not to Judge raſhly; in anſwer to that Queſtion put to him by his Diſciples, <hi>Who</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 9. 2.</note>
               <hi>did ſin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</hi>

            <p>That God may Puniſh one Generation for the Faults of another, is not inconſiſtent with his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and that he doth ſo, is no uncommon Obſervation: But this is not always viſible; it ſometimes, for ought appears to us, doth not proceed to ſuch ſeverity in the Inſtances belonging to this Argument.</p>
            <p>What becomes us to Obſerve from hence, is to lay reſtraints upon our ſelves from ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That as we would not leave a Curſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us upon our Poſterity, ſo we ſhould be Juſt and Faithful in all our Concernments.</p>
            <p>And again, That we ſhould prevent any ſuch Curſe from falling upon our ſelves, that we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62716:15"/>
may be liable to from our Fore-fathers; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where there is a manifeſt reaſon for a juſt ſuſpicion at leaſt. Which brings to</p>
            <p n="3">3. To conſider what is to be done by way of relief and remedy, where this is the caſe known, or vehemently ſuſpected to be. If the caſe be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſecret or unknown, no Perſon is therein concerned, more than he is in ſuch as are ſimply Sins of Ignorance; in which a general Confeſſion and Repentance is ſufficient. But in a caſe known, or much ſuſpected, other meaſures are to be taken.</p>
            <p>And the firſt thing here to be propoſed, is, That Poſterity be very careful to avoid thoſe Sins, which they know, or may conceive, their Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors to have been guilty of; becauſe elſe they may be accountable, not only for thoſe Sins which are properly theirs, but for thoſe of others ſo far as that Guilt loſes not by a progreſſion, <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16. Rev. 14. 15.</note>but every Age Contributes their ſhare; till (as it was with the <hi>Amorites)</hi> their iniquity be <hi>full,</hi> and they become <hi>ripe</hi> for exciſion and deſtruction (as has been before ſaid).</p>
            <p>And the next thing is, that they ſhew their averſion to them by ſome particular and ſpecial marks and ſignifications of it. I acknowledge that there are ſome caſes ſo extreme, that ſuch a remedy may come too late; and there are ſome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62716:15"/>
reaſons why Almighty God will not altogether paſs by the tokens of a high diſpleaſure. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> though a true Penitent. And <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 14.</note>ſo it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom neither the Religion and Conduct of an Excellent Prince, <note place="margin">2 Kings 23. 25.</note>
               <hi>Joſiah;</hi> nor even the Interceſſion of ſuch Pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <note place="margin">Jerem. 15. 1. Ezek. 14. 14.</note>as <hi>Noah, Job,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. could have ſaved.</p>
            <p>But let the caſe be what it will, as we know not how far the Mercy of God may extend, and <note place="margin">Jonah 3. 9.</note>
               <hi>who can tell if God will turn and repent,</hi> as the <hi>Ninevites</hi> rightly argued; ſo if it be otherwiſe determined, that God will not ſpare nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give as to Temporal Puniſhment; yet ſuch Perſons, and ſuch a People, have done all that is poſſible for them to do, and muſt ſubmit the whole to the ſecret Judgment of God.</p>
            <p>From the whole we may be able to judge of the Caſe before us this day. The Crime was indeed Publick and Notorious, but I am not willing to call it National; for a National Act implies a National Conſent, and a National Conſent is by a Univerſal Voice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of all degrees, or by their proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives. But the Contrivers and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Bloody Deſign, were far from being in ſuch a Capacity, being no more truly the Repreſentatives of the People, than Pyrates
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62716:16"/>
and Robbers, that for a ſeaſon obtain ſo ſtrong a Force as is not to be oppoſed.</p>
            <p>All that can be ſaid is, That too great a part of the Nation might have been guilty of ſuch things as gradually and inſenſibly led to it, and contrary to whatever they fore-thought, ended in it; or at leaſt our other <hi>crying ſins</hi> (as the Office for the Day ſignifies) might have provoked Almighty God to ſuffer it ſo to be.</p>
            <p>This may render it a ſuſpected caſe, and what may be a reaſon ſufficient for a National Humiliation; as it was of <hi>Job</hi>'s Sacrifice, <hi>it may</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 5.</note>
               <hi>be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that my ſons have ſinned,</hi> in their Feſtival Entertainments.</p>
            <p>And accordingly we have the proper courſe taken by the Nation and their Repreſentatives (as ſoon as it was in its own power) to prevent any further Puniſhment, and that was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it before God and Men, and to ſhew their Reſentment of it by the moſt publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and their Eſtabliſhing an Anniverſary Day of Faſting and Humiliation, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Guilt might lie upon the Nation, by that means, might be averted.</p>
            <p>And we have good reaſon to hope this courſe has not failed of ſucceſs, and that God has had, and will have a Favour for us, and be Merciful to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62716:16"/>
us, by the many Teſtimonies he has given us of it in our frequent Deliverance, in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from thoſe Dangers which threatned us, and we were encompaſſed with, wherein he has done right to his Providence, and ſhewed that there is nothing too hard for him to do.</p>
            <p>What remains, but that this ſhould be a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all, that they be cautious how far they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any Deſign againſt the Publick Peace and Welfare of a Nation; that they preſs not too near upon the fences of Government, leſt by ſome violent motion they be tranſported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the conduct of their own Reaſon and Duty. For as no Man is ſafe in his own cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without the Divine Aid; ſo neither is he in his own cuſtody if he is not watchful over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And when he is neither in his own keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor in that of Divine Providence (as He is not that ventures beyond the bounds of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) who can tell how far he will go, or what the event may be?</p>
            <p>But however, let Men be as bad as they will, and want neither boldneſs to undertake a bad Deſign, even that of Aſſaſſinating Princes, nor others to inſtigate them; let Princes be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Danger (as <hi>David</hi> was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 16.) and be never ſo liable to it; yet <hi>He that is higher</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62716:17"/>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>than the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher than they,</hi> that will Protect them. It is that Divine Providence, that not only ſits at the Helm, and ſteers all Publick Counſels and Affairs, but alſo watcheth over the Perſons and Lives of the greateſt Monarchs (who ſtand in as much need of ſuch an Inviſible Guard, as we of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection).</p>
            <p>And what therefore, as it becomes the greateſt to Acknowledge, and to Implore the Protection of for themſelves, ſo what it becomes all that are Lovers of their Prince, their Country, and their own Intereſt to join in, according to the Apoſtle's direction, <hi>I exhort, that firſt of all</hi> (in a more eſpecial manner) <hi>ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving thanks, be made for all men: for kings, and all that are in authority; that we may lead, &amp;c. For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 1.</p>
