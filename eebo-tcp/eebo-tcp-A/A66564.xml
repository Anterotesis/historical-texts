            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
AUTHOR
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MAtchiavel</hi> (whether the Original were his own, or
<hi>Straporola</hi>'s, for both liv'd near the same time, and
both play'd with the same Story) gave me the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the ensuing Play; the substance of which, is
briefly thus.</p>
            <div type="argument">
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>IT having been observ'd in Hell, that the Souls of such as
came thither, generally complain'd, That their Wives sent
them; it was at last resolv'd, that some one of themselves (as by
Lot it fell) should for the better discovery of the Truth thereof,
repair to the Earth, take upon him some Humane Figure, and
for his better Encouragement, carry with him a round Summ of
Money in his Pocket; subjected nevertheless to all the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Humanity, and, in the first place, to Marry a Wife,
and live with her Ten Years (if possible) and after that, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and make them a true Account, upon his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>This Lot fell to <hi>Belphegor,</hi> their old General, who assuming
a brisk young Figure, settles in <hi>Florence,</hi> under the Name of
<hi>Roderigo,</hi> and Quality of a Merchant, newly come from the
<pb facs="tcp:106709:3"/>
                  <hi>Indies;</hi> and Marries a Lady, of greater Blood, than Fortune,
whom he so loves in earnest, that she finds it, and seeks all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of squandring his Estate; which yet, he as readily complies
with, because it pleases his Wife: However, the Trade of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
goes forward, and his Adventures at Sea, fall nothing short
of her Extravagance at Home.</p>
               <p>This, and other Accidents, make him incurr Debts; and, as
other Men in like Cases, he takes up Money to support his Credit;
till at last, his Ships at Sea being all lost, what with his Creditors
pressing him on the one hand, and his Wife's Vneasiness on the
other, he fairly Breaks.</p>
               <p>And now, being subjected to all the Conditions of Humanity,
like those other Men, he flies, and takes Sanctuary with one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo</hi>
(a Neighbouring Vineyard-Keeper) tells him his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and that if he'll shelter him from the Bailiffs, that are
in close pursuit of him, he'll make him a Man for ever: In
short, <hi>Matheo</hi> does it; and expecting the performance of his
Promise, <hi>Roderigo</hi> tells him, that he is not what he appears to
be (a Man) but a very Devil; and gives him some pregnant
instances of it: However, to shew him what a Gentleman of a
Devil he had met in him, further tells him, that as soon as he
parted from him, he would instantly possess such a Great Lady,
and that nothing should remove him; till he came, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bad him be assur'd, and make his terms; and so, leaves
him.</p>
               <p>Nor was he worse than his Word; but immediately possess'd
the said Lady, and suffer'd himself to be dislodg'd from her by
<hi>Matheo;</hi> as also of a second; with this Caution nevertheless,
that if he put him to't a third time, he should find him his mortal
Enemy.</p>
               <p>On this <hi>Belphegor</hi> makes a trip into <hi>France,</hi> and possesses that
King's Daughter, but not sooner than the Report of the Two
former Ladies had reach'd that Court. Whereupon, the King
sends several Messages, with large Promises of Reward to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo,</hi>
to come and dispossess his Daughter, which he as often shifts;
till at last, the King having gotten him into his Hands, tells him,
that unless he dispossess her, he will certainly hang him. To be
<pb facs="tcp:106709:3"/>
short, <hi>Matheo</hi> puts on a bold Face, and accosts <hi>Belphegor;</hi>
but, finding all to no purpose, throws himself upon the King's
Mercy, in favourably accepting his Endeavours; and demands a
large Stage, with all sorts of Musick, and Pomp imaginable;
and that the Lady be brought upon it: to be sure withal, that when
he threw up his Cap, that they all strike up together, with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Shout: And this (said he) with some other Ingredients he
had, would, he doubted not, but deliver the Lady.</p>
               <p>In fine, all things being accordingly prepared, and ready, the
Lady is brought upon the Stage, and from one thing to another,
they at last, quarrel, and <hi>Matheo</hi> throws up his Cap; which is
seconded with a full shout; at which the possess'd Lady starting,
and demanding the meaning of all that noise; <hi>Matheo</hi> tells the
Devil in her, his Wife had found him out, and was just coming
up Stairs; on which the Lady gives a Spring at him, and drops;
and <hi>Belphegor</hi> leaves her.</p>
               <p>Thus far <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> whom I have chiefly follow'd;
saving, that where he runs his Fable from one Country, to
another, I found my self necessitated (for preserving the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Time, and Place, as much as it would bear) to fix the
Scene, in some one place; and accordingly, chang'd it from
his <hi>Florence, &amp;c.</hi> to <hi>Genoa;</hi> and this, the rather; partly,
in that the Women of <hi>Genoa,</hi> have a greater liberty, than
in other parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> and partly, that the Dukedom of
<hi>Genoa</hi> being elective, from two Years, to two Years, I might
make way for a cross Walk of Vertue, and thereby divert the
tediousness of a single Walk. A Path (I must confess) not so
generally trodden, yet even in that, the less subject to Sloughs,
or Dust.</p>
               <p>To this purpose, I fancy, <hi>Imperia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Belphegor</hi> had
a Sister <hi>Portia</hi> (of as high Vertue, as herself was void of it)
married to <hi>Montalto,</hi> a noble <hi>Genoese,</hi> who had sunk his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
in serving the Republick; which yet (unknown to him)
had been generously restor'd, by another Nobleman his Friend; and
thence, endeavour some short Characters of Friendship, and
Gratitude—Of a Woman, that sweetens her Husband, on all
occasions of discontent; One, whom no accident of Fortune can move,
<pb facs="tcp:106709:4"/>
nor Injury how design'd soever, provoke to an Indecency: And of
a Man in him, that weathers his Troubles with an evenness of Mind;
One, whom his Country's Ingratitude cannot tempt to a Revenge,
and so little affecting his own Grandeur, that when the Senate had
at last elected him Duke, he modestly refus'd it.</p>
               <p>And having wrought altogether the best I could, I absolve
the whole: Of which yet, because I may not be so compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
a Judge my self, I here give it, as I wrote it, and leave it
to my unbiass'd Reader to determine, whether it might not
have expected as much Justice from the House, as it found
from the Actors.</p>

perhaps, be willing to hear all that may be said of his; and that's
the Reason, why so many of the Ancients were descended from the
Gods: For, when their Birth was so obscure, that they were asham'd
to own it, the Jade the Mother, or some blind Poet, found out a God,
to Father the Bastard.—What, I pray', were <hi>Bacchus, Hercules, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malus</hi>
and several others?—Story Lyes, or their Fathers were of the
doubtful Gender, and their Mothers of the Common.—But this, by
the by.—And, because I hear some Body coming, I'll withdraw, for
