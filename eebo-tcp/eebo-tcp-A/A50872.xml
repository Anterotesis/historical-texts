            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 1.</hi> The Introduction.</head>
               <p>I Need not inlarge in the praises of that great ornament of his Age, See and Country, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher.</hi> They that would be satisfied of the worth of that excellent person may read his Life with the Appendix to it, and more especially his Works, which sufficiently praise him in the gate: As they that would know how great an esteem the most eminent men for Piety and Learning in his time (not only in great <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but also in other parts) had of him, may consult the Letters writ by them to him, and since Printed with his to them. Yet since his death several have appear'd publickly against him, and some of them have treated him very unbecomingly, to say no more. Of these I shall single out the Author of the <hi>Palaeologia Chronica</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cary,</hi> and him whom he hath call'd to be his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>viz.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Vossius,</hi> Both these are displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Arch-Bishop for shortning the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43633:4"/>
time from the Creation of the world: but more especially D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cary.</hi> He is displeased with <hi>Petavius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> upon the same account, but the storm of his displeasure falls most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely upon the Arch-Bishop. <q>Yet this (says he) was nothing to that which Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> did since in vindication of the <hi>Masora,</hi> by a way of new righting of times and new sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of persons, far otherwise then was ever taken notice of by any man living before.</q> Thus D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cary Part 2. Bo. 2. §. 3. Ch. 17.</hi> Now (to pass by those obscure expressions New right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of times and New shaping of persons) I grant that the Arch-Bishop may have offer'd some things to his Readers consideration, which no man had ever taken notice of before; but then he doth it with such candor and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, as (if he do erre) may obtain his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from all ingenuous persons, And withall he confirms them with such Authorities and Arguments, as that it is not very easie for those that are not of his opinion to refute him. A further plea may be offer'd for him, drawn from the uncertainty of the greatest part of Chronology, by reason whereof no man can state the account, especially of Ancient times so, as that one or other shall not be ready to quarrel with it.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43633:4"/>
               <p>Of the uncertainty of the greatest part of Chronology.</p>
               <p>I Say of the greatest part of Chronology, for I most willingly grant that part of it is certain: as 1. Whatsoever relating to Chronology is plainly expressed in sacred Writ, or may be deduc'd from it by a clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable consequence, that must be concluded to be certain. 2. The Chronology of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then writers, so far as it agrees with and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the Scripture Chronology, is also to be look'd upon as certain. 3. <hi>Josephus c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. l.</hi> 1. says that all men confess that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great dy'd in the 114<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> and if any one shall affirm that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his death (or any thing else, that is as universally and unanimously attested, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Josephus</hi> it is) is certain, I shall not gainsay. But as to other things, thô some have expressed very much confidence, and seem to have firmly perswaded themselves that they had demonstrated the certainty of them: yet I think it will appear that they have rather demonstrated their uncertainty. However I doubt not but every unprejudic'd Reader will be satisfi'd of the uncertainty of them. To manifest which, I shall not run through all the 4 Monarchies (that would be too tedious) but confine my self to the first,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43633:5"/>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Assyrian:</hi> and I the rather pitch upon it, because D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cary</hi> is so much displeased with <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Petavius,</hi> and especially the Arch-Bishop, for shortning the time of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. The method which I shall observe will be to take a view 1. Of Kingdoms, <hi>viz</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Assyria</hi> it self and the Kingdoms contemporary to it, 2. Of persons and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and to shew how uncertain an account is given of the time of all these. I begin with Kingdoms, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Kingdom of the <hi>Assyrians.

                  <hi>Syncellus</hi> himself grant him 30 years, and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> says that he was 18 years before the first Olympiad (or, if we will believe the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal correction, he was 25 years before it.) <hi>Solinus c. 6.</hi> writes that <hi>Perdiccas</hi> succeeded <hi>Caranus,</hi> or was first named King in the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Olympiad, but <hi>Eusebius</hi> refers the beginning of his reign to the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Olympiad. In that succession of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings which we have in the Text <hi>ap. Syncellum p. 262, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi> is omitted.

               <p>The uncertainty of Chronology as to the Kingdoms that were in the time of the first Monarchy hath appear'd sufficiently.

Xenophon</hi> makes him to have been about the time of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> and he seems to speak of those first <hi>Heraclidae</hi> that liv'd not long after <hi>Hercules</hi> himself. Thus <hi>Plutarch.</hi> And as to <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> he <hi>ap. Clem. Alex.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Hesiod.</hi> The like uncertainty there is as to the age wherein <hi>Hesiod</hi> liv'd. <hi>A.

               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we have taken a view of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and some illustrious persons that were in the time of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that we take notice of some remarkable occurrences that were in the same time, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. The floud of <hi>Ogyges.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Aug. de civ. Dei l. 18. c. 8.</hi> observes that Historians are not agreed what time <hi>Ogyges</hi> himself was. <hi>Syncellus p.</hi> 148. says that some refer the floud to the time of <hi>Phoroneus</hi> King of the <hi>Argives,</hi> others to the time of <hi>Apis</hi> the successor of <hi>Phoroneus. Africanus ap. Euseb. de praepar. Evang. l. 10. c. 10.</hi> writes that it happen'd in the first of the 1020 years which were from <hi>Ogyges</hi> to the first Olympiad; whereas accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Eusebius</hi> there were but about 987 years from this floud to the first Olympiad. <hi>Censorinus c.</hi> 21. seems to make it to have been above 800 years before the first Olympiad. From <hi>Ogyges's</hi> floud (says he) to the reign
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43633:14"/>
of <hi>Inachus</hi> were about 400 years, from thence to the first Olympiad somewhat more then 400.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deucalions</hi> floud. According to <hi>Solinus c.</hi> 11. there were 600 years from the floud of <hi>Ogyges</hi> to this of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> according to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius An.</hi> 237, according to <hi>Orosius l. 1. c.</hi> 7 and 9, <hi>An.</hi> 230. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>August. de civ. Dei l. 18. c.</hi> 10. takes notice that <hi>Eusebius</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> refer this of <hi>Deucalion</hi> to the time of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> but that <hi>Varro</hi> refers it to the time of <hi>Cranaus</hi> who was successor to <hi>Cecrops,</hi> and he might have added that <hi>Justin l. 2. c.</hi> 6. says that it was in the reign of <hi>Amphictyon</hi> who succeeded <hi>Cranaus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The taking of <hi>Troy. Censorinus c.</hi> 21. hath these words, <hi>Sosibius</hi> indeed did write that there were 395, But <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> 407, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> 417, <hi>Aretres</hi> 514, and besides these many have written diversly, whose very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent doth declare that the thing is uncertain. Thus <hi>Censorinus.</hi> Now what it is about which there were so many different opinions is not clear. It may seem to be the time from the reign of <hi>Inachus</hi> (what <hi>Inachus</hi> I know not) to the first Olympiad. But learned men have thought that he intended this of the time from the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> to the first Olympiad, it being well known that <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> makes the time from the taking <hi>Troy</hi> to the first Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43633:15"/>
to have been just that number of years which <hi>Censorinus</hi> mentions, <hi>viz.</hi> 407. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be as to this, yea let it be supposed that those Learned men were mistaken in thinking that <hi>Censorinus</hi> refer'd to the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> in this passage; yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that it is a considerable Testimony of the uncertainty of Chronology, and we shall sufficiently manifest the incertitude of the time when <hi>Troy</hi> was taken from other Authors. <hi>Velleius Paterc. l. 1.</hi> makes it to have been <hi>An.</hi> 414 or 415 before the first Olympiad (not only 407 as <hi>Eratosthenes</hi>) <hi>Solinus c. 1. An.</hi> 408, <hi>Eusebius</hi> 406 (in some Editions 405.) Very Learned men interpret the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor Arundel.</hi> so that it makes the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val twi'xt the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> and the first Olympiad to have been <hi>An.</hi> 434. As also they so interpret <hi>Dicaearchus ap. Apollonii Sko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasten l. 4. ver. 272. Argonaut.,</hi> that he makes it to have been <hi>An.</hi> 436: for when <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> says (From the reign of <hi>Nilus</hi> to the first Olympiad <hi>An.</hi> 436) they by the reign of <hi>Nilus</hi> understand the time of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> war, as perhaps by the reign of <hi>Inachus</hi> in <hi>Censorinus</hi> the same may be understood. Add hereto that the <hi>Marmor Arundel.</hi> makes <hi>Troy</hi> to have been taken <hi>An.</hi> 373 after the beginning of the reign of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> and in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of <hi>Menestheus;</hi> whereas by <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius's</hi> account it was taken <hi>An.</hi> 375 after the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43633:15"/>
beginning of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> and in the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of <hi>Menestheus;</hi> and by <hi>Syncellus's</hi> it was taken <hi>An,</hi> 385 after the beginning of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> and in the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Menestheus.</hi> Also the <hi>Marmor Arundel.</hi> computes <hi>An.</hi> 320 from <hi>Deucalions</hi> floud to the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> but in <hi>Clemens Alex. Strom.</hi> 1. the very same number of years is assign'd from <hi>Deucalions</hi> floud to the rape of <hi>Hellen</hi> by <hi>Paris;</hi> now according to <hi>Homer Iliad. w. ver.</hi> 765. there were 20 years between that rape of <hi>Helen</hi> and the taking <hi>Troy,</hi> and consequently from the floud of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion</hi> to the taking of it there were <hi>An.</hi> 340 according to <hi>Clem. Alex.,</hi> so that his compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation exceeds that of the Marble <hi>An.</hi> 20. From the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> to the building of <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>An.</hi> 432, so <hi>Dionysius Halic. l. 2. An.</hi> 433 says <hi>Solinus c. 1. An.</hi> 437 according to <hi>Velleius Paterc. l. 1.</hi> I might take notice that <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> writes how some refer <hi>Troys</hi> being taken to the first year of <hi>Demophoons</hi> reigning at <hi>Athens,</hi> as well as others refer it to the last year that <hi>Menestheus</hi> reign'd there, as also that <hi>Constantinus Manasses</hi> makes the <hi>Trojan</hi> war to have been in <hi>Davids</hi> time (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Priamus</hi> requested aid of him) whereas according to <hi>Eusebius</hi> it was in the time of the Judges, particularly when <hi>Abdon</hi> judged <hi>Israel:</hi> but enough hath been produc'd already to shew how great discord there is about the year when this calamity befel <hi>Troy.</hi> There
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43633:16"/>
is no less difference about the time of the year (whether it was in the Spring, Summer or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn) as also about the month and day (of which they that please may consult <hi>Alex. Strom. 1.</hi>) and therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Camillus</hi> expresseth himself very cautiously speaking of the day of the month.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The return of the <hi>Heraclidae.</hi> Which was 80 years after <hi>Troys</hi> being taken says <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratosthenes ap. Clem. Alex.,</hi> almost 80 years says <hi>Velleius Paterc. l.</hi> 1. By <hi>Eusebius</hi> it is refer'd to the time of <hi>Melanthus's</hi> reigning at <hi>Athens,</hi> but by <hi>Syncellus</hi> to the time of his Son and successor <hi>Codrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Ionick</hi> migration or the passing of the <hi>Iones</hi> from <hi>Attica</hi> to that part of lesser <hi>Asia</hi> which is call'd <hi>Ionia. Philostratus</hi> in <hi>Euphorbo p.</hi> 702. says that it was according to some 124, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others 127 years after the war of <hi>Troy</hi> that the <hi>Athenians</hi> sent a colony into <hi>Ionia,</hi> but <hi>Eratosthenes ap. Clem. Alex. Strom.</hi> 1. makes it to have been 140 years after the expugnation of <hi>Troy;</hi> for (says he) from the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> to the return of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> were <hi>An.</hi> 80, and from that to the <hi>Ionick</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration <hi>An.</hi> 60. And <hi>Strabo l.</hi> 13. seems to dissent from them both, when he says that the <hi>AEolick</hi> migration was said to be 4 gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations before the <hi>Ionick.</hi> Now 4 generations according to the usual account (that 3 gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are 100 years, see <hi>Herodotus l. 2. c. 142.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43633:16"/>
and <hi>Clemens Alex. Strom.</hi> 1.) are above 130 years, so that the <hi>Ionick</hi> migration was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this computation above 130 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>AEolick,</hi> and the <hi>AEolick</hi> was some years after the taking <hi>Troy,</hi> yea according to <hi>Strabo</hi> above 50 years. For his account of it is that <hi>Orestes</hi> was the first Author of it, but he dying, it was carried on by his Son <hi>Penthilus,</hi> who came into <hi>Thrace</hi> 60 years after the war of <hi>Troy,</hi> about the time of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> into <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> Thus <hi>Strabo.</hi> So that when <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> says From the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> to the return of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclidae An.</hi> 80, <hi>Strabo</hi> accounts only about 60; and when <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> computes from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> to the <hi>Ionick</hi> migration only <hi>An.</hi> 60, <hi>Strabo</hi> speaks of 4 generations between the <hi>AEolick</hi> and it, and makes the <hi>AEolick</hi> to have been about the same time with the return of the <hi>Heraclidae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>To these we may add that <hi>Petavius</hi> makes one and the same year to answer to several years. It is <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3961, in which he supposes <hi>Rome</hi> to have been built. This answers to <hi>An.</hi> 752 before the birth of Christ (so <hi>Petav. de doctr. temp. l. 9. c. 50.</hi>) to <hi>An.</hi> 753 before Christ (so in his <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar. part. 1. l. 2. c. 7.</hi>) to <hi>An.</hi> 754 before Christ (so in <hi>Rationar. part 2. l. 3. c. 2.</hi>) Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the end of his Books <hi>de doct. temp.</hi> being about to give us the succession of the Kings in several Kingdoms he himself is pleased
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43633:19"/>
to acquaint us, that he there gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the beginning of the reigns of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Kings somewhat different from that which he had given before in the Books themselves, and this more especially in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>We see then how wavering and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant these Learned men are in their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, and the great cause of their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy is the uncertainty of it. This uncertainty <hi>Petavius</hi> acknowledges as to the time of the creation of the World. The number of the years from the Worlds creation to this time neither is certainly known, nor can be without a Divine Revelation. These are the words of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius de doct. temp. l. 9. c, 2.</hi> which may be appli'd to many other <hi>Epocha's,</hi> about which Chronologers dispute with very great earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>I have inlarged the more upon this subject, because of the great necessity and usefulness of mens being convinc'd of this uncertainty of Chronology of which we treat; which will appear, if we consider the many mischiefs which have been occasion'd by the want of such conviction. From the want of this have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded many eager disputes about matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Chronology, and those manag'd with the greatest wrath and bitterness imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. If <hi>Syncellus</hi> had been convinc'd of this uncertainty, he would have been more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43633:19"/>
to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and not taken all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of reprehending him, and that many times in very rude and unbecoming language. Had others after him been throughly convinc'd of it, and seriously consider'd it, it would have prevented the heats between <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Divines, and <hi>Scaliger</hi> would not have fallen so foul upon our M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lydiat,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to expose him, and triumphing over him with the greatest scorn and contempt. In like manner he treated all others that opposed him, or only dissented from him, inveighing against every one that did not fall down and worship every imagination of his; not sparing either Ancient Writers or Modern, but passing the severest censures upon both. The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this uncertainty might also have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the scuffles between <hi>Is. Vossius</hi> and his Countrymen that set themselves so fiercely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Add hereto that if this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty had been duly considered, the World would not have been burthen'd with many tedious and voluminous writings, such as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligers</hi> two Editions of his <hi>De emendatione Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum,</hi> and his Canones <hi>Isagog.</hi> &amp;c. also <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius's</hi> two Volumes <hi>De doctrina Temporum.</hi> Finally, for want of the consideration of this not a few have spent a great part of their life in the study of Chronology, and many of them men of extraordinary parts and great diligence; so that if the time and industry, which they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43633:20"/>
laid out upon Chronological niceties, had been imploy'd in more useful Studies, they might have been very serviceable both to the time in which they liv'd, and also to future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Therefore seriously weighing these and the like mischiefs occasion'd by the want of such conviction and consideration, I thought that I could not do any thing more necessary and beneficial, then to endeavour to convince men of the uncertainty of the greatest part of Chronology.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Whether Lunar Months were in use with the</hi> Israelites <hi>before the Captivity of</hi> Babylon.</head>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Cary part</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12. singles a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage out of Arch-Bishop <hi>Oshers</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Annals,</hi> in which he says that it cannot be proved that the <hi>Israelites</hi> used Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar months before the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, but their year consisted of 12 equal months, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry month having 30 days, and 5 days being added at the end of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> month in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common year, 6 days every 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or Leap-year. Thus the Arch-Bishop. The arguments wherewith the Doctor opposeth this are either
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43633:20"/>
from authority or reason. His authorities are 1. The Penmen of holy Scripture. 2. Other Writers. 1. The Scriptures which the Doctor produceth are <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 10. 28. 11. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 1, 4, 5, 27, 34. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8. 12, 13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 17. 46. 3, 6. It is evident (says he) from one or more of these Texts that the Lunar month was in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular use, particularly from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. If you ask him how it is evident from one or more of these Texts, all that he says to this purpose is 1. That the beginnings of the months in the letter of the Law (i. e. <hi>Num.</hi> 10. and 28.) are interpreted by the <hi>Psalmist (Psal.</hi> 81.) to be the New moons. 2. That the <hi>Septuagint</hi> thought so doubtless, who use the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in these places. 3. That these Texts do certainly mark out the New moon to be a day of solemnity. 4. That the morrow after the New Moon is call'd the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of the month. And now we have the whole strength of the Doctors argument from Scripture. To which I answer 1. None of those four propositions is evident, and consequently they cannot make it clear that Lunar months were in popular use before the Captivity. I grant that if the Translations of the Scripture were authentick, then three of the foresaid propositions would be evident, <hi>viz.</hi> all except the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: but if we must have recourse to the Original, then the other three are no more evident then it. For instance,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43633:21"/>
The first proposition is that the beginnings of the months <hi>Num.</hi> 10 and 28. are interpreted <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. to be the New Moons: now the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> words for <hi>The beginnings of the months</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 11. and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> word which is translated the New Moon <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 3. is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to say that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is interpreted by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to say that an expression that is more plain is interpreted by one that is more obscure. But let it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed (thô not granted) that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is interpreted by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then we may say that the beginning of the month is interpreted by the first day of the month; for the first day of the month is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> says <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> both in his <hi>Radices</hi> and in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 3: and therefore instead of <hi>Blow the Trumpet in the New Moon,</hi> we may Translate it, <hi>Blow the Trumpet in the first day of the month.</hi> Thus it appears that the first proposition is not evident, and upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same account the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> propositions are not. For in all the Texts which the Doctor hath alledg'd for confirmation of those propositions (<hi>viz. 1 Sam. 20. 5, 27, 34. 2 Kings 4. 23. 2 Chron. 8. 13.</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 17. 46. 3, 6.) the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 27, 34. signifies the month (and is rendred so by our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) in the rest of the places it may signifie the first day of the month, or (which is the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43633:21"/>
same) the New month, though in our Bibles it is rendred in every one of them the New moon. So (to run over the Texts) we may read <hi>To morrow is the first day of the month</hi> or <hi>the New month,</hi> 1 Sam. 20. 5. <hi>It is neither the first day of the month nor the Sabbath,</hi> 2 Kings 4. 23. <hi>On the first days of the month,</hi> 2 Chron. 8. 13, and Ezek. 45. 17. 46. 3. and finally, <hi>In the day of the New Month,</hi> Ezek. 46. 6. So that it is the first day of the month which these Texts do mark out to be a solemn day, and the day after it is reckon'd the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of the month: but it will not be easily made out that the New Moon is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in any of those places. I acknowledge that this account of the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not agree with that which the Doctor gives of it, but his account will be fully examin'd in the Appendix. It remains that I examine the Doctors 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> proposition, which is that the 70 who use the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in all those places (<hi>viz. Num.</hi> 10. 10. 28. 11. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 3.) doubtless thought that the beginnings of the months <hi>Num.</hi> 10. and 28. are interpreted by the New Moons <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. Now I deny, that this consequence is evident, or that from their using the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in all those places it can be evidently deduc'd that they thought so as the Doctor says they did. We may rather conclude from it that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. signifies (not the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43633:22"/>
New Moon but) the first day of the month. For the beginnings of the months are call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. and 28. and then why should we not think that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath the same signification <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 3: But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will also be considered more fully in the Appendix.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppose that it was evident that the New Moon is mark'd out to be a day of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, it doth not follow that the Lunar month was in popular use (which is the thing in question) for the New Moon might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd as a solemn day, on what day soever of their month it happen'd; though it fell out toward the middle or end of their month as well as if their month began with it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain suppose that it was evident, that the marrow after the New Moon is reckoned the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of the month 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20, 5, 27, 34. yet it cannot be thence concluded that the <hi>Israelites</hi> used Lunar months; for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after the New Moon might fall out at that time to be the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of the month, though at other times it was on other days of it. Thus his Text on which he chiefly relies, <hi>viz. 1 Sam.</hi> 20. fails him upon a double account, 1. It is not evident that the morrow after the New Moon is reckon'd the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of the month. 2. If it was, the use of Lunar months cannot be concluded from it. This may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for answer to his argument from Scripture.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:43633:22"/>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Doctors argument from the authority of other Writers, he says that All the Doctors, Ancient and Modern, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> (except <hi>Kepler, Petavius</hi> and Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>) were of opinion that the <hi>Jewish</hi> year after the <hi>Israelites</hi> departure out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was Lunar. Now what shall we say to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident assertion? The least that we can say is, that it might have been expected that so great an undertaker in Chronology should have acquainted himself with Chronographers better then it seems he hath done. If he had more diligently consulted them, he would have found <hi>Massaeus</hi> and <hi>Temporarius</hi> very positive for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar years. It is manifest that the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways every where useth Solar years and equal months consisting of 30 days, so <hi>Massaeus Chronicorum l. 1. in fin.</hi> It cannot be doubted but that both in Sacred and profane History we are to understand Solar years, the days of every year being 365¼, so <hi>Temporarius Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolog. Demonstr. l. 3. Harvillaeus</hi> also in <hi>Isagog. Chronolog. l. 1. s. 11. p. 116.</hi> declares that he inclines chiefly to this opinion. I incline (says he) more especially to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> (as he expresses it a little before <hi>p.</hi> 112, 113.) that till the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> the years are to be understood to be Solar, consisting of 12 equal Solar months of 30 days with the addition of 5 days, and also of one more every 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year. And finally doth not <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43633:23"/>
sometimes seem to incline to this opinion? as in his <hi>De emendat. Temp. l. 3. de anno pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorum Hebraeorum Abrahameo,</hi> where he says that always even after the coming out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> there were 5 days added at or near the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox,</hi> as is sufficiently known by that which is disputed above out of <hi>Moses.</hi> And that moreover the first day of the month is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which signifies <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, although there was no New moon on that day, no more then there was on the first days of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> months. Also a little before this he says that the sacred History testifies that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did appoint 12 Officers according to the number of the 12 months of the year, see 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 7. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. 1. &amp;c. The same <hi>Scaliger de emend. l. 3. p. 637.</hi> says that when the <hi>Jews</hi> received the form of the <hi>Alexandrean</hi> year and the <hi>Calippick</hi> Period, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them they also receiv'd the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar year. Thus <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who in all these particulars <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> receiv'd the Lunar year after the Captivity, that they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded 5 days after their coming out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> that their year consisted of 12 months, and that they call'd the first day of the month <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> although the New moon did not happen on that day, no more then it did on the first days of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> months, agrees very well with Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher.</hi> It appears then that <hi>Kepler</hi> and <hi>Petavius,</hi> are not the only persons
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43633:23"/>
that have inclin'd to the Arch-Bishops opinion, and that it had been more prudent, if the Doctor had forborn that expression that all the Doctors except those two were against him. Thus we have consider'd the Doctors Arguments from Authority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Argument from Reason is very long, and they that would see it at large may consult the Doctor himself <hi>Part. 1. l. 1. c. 12.</hi> beginning towards the end of <hi>sect. 5.</hi> and reading on to <hi>sect. 8.</hi> I shall only give a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of it. He says that it is not deny'd that before Christs time the Lunar year was in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular use. If then we hold that they used the solar year before the Captivity, 1. He says us necessary that we shew when, in what age and by what means the change from Solar to Lunar was effected. 2. He wonders that neither <hi>Josephus</hi> nor any other did take any notice of it. 3. He affirms that the <hi>Jews</hi> would not suffer such a change. Now for answer to these.</p>
               <p>As to the first, Why is it necessary to shew when and in what age this change was made, when the Doctor himself tells us that some have done it already? They set it (says he <hi>s. 6.</hi>) after <hi>Alexanders</hi> time, under the Government of the <hi>Seleucidae.</hi> Besides have not many innovations and corruptions crept into particular Churches, and yet we do not think ourselves oblig'd to shew the precise time that they first sprung up?</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:43633:24"/>
               <p>As to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, Why doth the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> wonder that <hi>Josephus</hi> and others take no notice of this change, when he himself holds that after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> there was the same change of the year from Solar to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar, and yet they have taken no notice of that? The Doctor says in the beginning of <hi>s. 15.</hi> that when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in <hi>Egypt</hi> their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning was according to the Solar year, but after their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> he maintains against the Arch-Bishop that they used the Lunar year; now where is this change taken notice of by <hi>Josephus? Josephus Ant. l. 1. c. 4.</hi> and <hi>l. 3. c. 10.</hi> says that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep the Passover on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Moon in the month <hi>Nisan,</hi> and that <hi>Moses</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Nisan</hi> to be the first month with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Feasts and the things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Divine worship; but as to buying and selling and the rest of the dispensation of the year he made no alteration, but retain'd the first rite, form or order. These are the words of <hi>Josephus.</hi> So that if from hence that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> appointed <hi>Nisan</hi> to be the first month with reference to Feasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Passover to be kept on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Moon in that month, it can be necessarily concluded that he chang'd the year from Solar to Lunar, so that in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one <hi>Josephus</hi> in effect says the other, then indeed he doth take notice of that change; but if it cannot be certainly concluded (that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43633:24"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> made such a change) from those words of <hi>Josephus</hi> (as I am well assured it cannot) then he hath taken no notice of it. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon this the longer because of that which the Doctor says <hi>s. 5.</hi> of <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Philo Judaeus.</hi> He says that they plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that the year even of old time from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was Lunar, and imply somewhat more, namely this, that there was never any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion made of it before their time. Now I would gladly be inform'd where they either plainly signifie the one, or imply the other. I have produc'd <hi>Josephus's</hi> words already. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Judaeus de vita Mosis</hi> having said that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> made the beginning of the vernal Equinox the first month, adds, In this month about the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, the Moon being about to be at the Full, the Feast of the Passover is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the present tense, so that <hi>Philo</hi> speaks of that which was done in his time. Withal if he had spoken of the old time from <hi>Moses,</hi> he neither plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that the year was then Lunar, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that there was never any question made of it.</p>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> particular remains, which is that the <hi>Jews</hi> would not suffer such a change. The Doctor useth many words to prove this, the summ whereof is this. The <hi>Jews</hi> (says he) believ'd that their ancient custom as to the time of beginning the year and observing the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43633:25"/>
Passover was of Primitive Divine institution, or bound upon them by Divine Law; and therefore they would not suffer a change of it. To which I answer, that if this be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood more generally of their custom of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the year with the month <hi>Nisan,</hi> and observing the Passover upon the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that month, it will be granted that they believ'd it to be of Divine Institution. But if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to particulars, as that the first day of <hi>Nisan</hi> or their New years day was to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that day which answered to such or such a day in our Calendar, or what other day you please; or that the day of the Passover was always to be that day which answered (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) to our 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> I cannot say that the <hi>Jews</hi> believ'd that this was of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and the Doctor should have prov'd it otherwise then by saying <hi>Questionless they must believe so.</hi> Yea, I could tell him that some <hi>Jews</hi> have believ'd, that the precept for beginning the year with the month <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san</hi> was only temporary, and did not oblige them always to account it the beginning of months.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the month Dioscorinthius, <hi>2 Mac. 11. 21.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE month Dioscorinthius seems to have been <hi>mensis embolimus in Anno Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daico,</hi> i. e. a month superadded in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> year, and interpos'd between <hi>Dystrus</hi> and <hi>Xanthicus,</hi> in which month <hi>Xanthicus</hi> the letters from the King and the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> were written; so the Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 3841. The Doctor <hi>p.</hi> 84. falls upon him very insultingly for this. Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the premises (says he) we may ask the question what then becomes of that conceit of Dioscorinthius as if it should be the Embolimaear month? Thus the Doctor. Now 1. Suppose it was only a conceit, why does the Doctor single out the Arch-Bishop as if it was peculiarly his? especially when the Arch-Bishop expresses himself so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously and modestly, saying only that it seems to be so. <hi>Scaliger de emend. Temp. l.</hi> 2. <hi>de periodo Syro-Macedonum Alexandrea Salianus A. M.</hi> 3891. and <hi>Menochius in loc.</hi> are all of the Arch-Bishops opinion; yet we hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, but the Arch-Bishop alone must be arraign'd and try'd, and the opinion (or conceit, for so the Doctor will needs call
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43633:26"/>
it,) condemned. Now if you ask upon what evidence or grounds the opinion is condemn'd, the Doctor tells us it is upon consideration of the premises; and if we would know what those premises are, we must look back to the beginning of the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> section in that 84<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page which I alledg'd above. Also that we may the better understand that which the Doctor would be at, we must observe that in 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 11. 21. the date of <hi>Lysias's</hi> letter is thus express'd; The 148<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month Dioscorinthius. Now the summ of that which the Doctor says is this, That according to his Tables the 147<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> was Embolimaear (as he calls it) <hi>i. e.</hi> a year in which one month was superadded. Yet (says he) according to popular estimation (and that very just and good) not the 147<hi rend="sup">th</hi> but the 148<hi rend="sup">th</hi> was Embolimaear. Then he adds in <hi>sect.</hi> 26. Whether the year 147 or 148 were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolimaear it matters not, once I cannot see how the year 149 could be such; And I speak of the 149 year <hi>Jewish</hi> reckoning according to our Tables, which in the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> account was the 148 according to the date of <hi>Lysias's</hi> letter 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 11. Thus the Doctor. So that in short which year was Embolimaear he knows not, but resolves that the 149 or 148 according to 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 11. could not be such, that he might conclude against the Arch-Bishop that Dioscorinthius was not <hi>mensis Emboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43633:26"/>
a superadded month. But it may be said that the Doctor gives a reason why the 149 year could not be Embolimaear, because then the vernal New moon in the 150 year must be set over to the 15 of <hi>April.</hi> To which I answer, that (possibly) according to the Doctors Tables it must have been set so late, but who will regard his Tables, when he himself hath told us, that an account dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that in his Tables, may be very just and good, and agree very well with the truth, thô not with the precise strictness (as he expresses it) of those his Tables? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Tables have reference to the <hi>Jewish</hi> year, whereas the Arch-Bishop speaks express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> year, and that which the Doctor calls the 149 <hi>i. e.</hi> the 148 in 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 11. might be an intercalary year in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> account, thô not in the <hi>Jewish.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consideration of the Doctors premises does not perswade us to slieght the Arch-Bishops conjecture so much as he doth. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if we should ask now What will become of the Doctors conceit, that Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinthius was that month which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? especially when we consider that it ingageth him to say that <hi>Lysias's</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Jews</hi> was of a later date then the Kings letter to them; the Kings letter bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing date <hi>April 9, Lysias's June 16</hi> after (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43633:27"/>
to his reckoning) then which scarce any thing can seem to me more incredible. When the King himself had by letter certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd the <hi>Jews</hi> that he granted their desire, can any one imagin that <hi>Lysias</hi> should write above two months after, only to signifie the same thing to them? If the Doctor had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said that <hi>Lysias's</hi> letter to the <hi>Jews</hi> was of later date then the Kings letter to him, he had said that which is no less probable then the other is improbable. For I make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that <hi>Lysias</hi> first inform'd the King what the <hi>Jews</hi> desir'd, then the King writ to him to certifie them that he granted their desire (a copy of this letter we have a <hi>Mac.</hi> II. 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>Lysias</hi> having received that letter, writes to the <hi>Jews</hi> as the King directed him, and his letter bears date the 24 of Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthius. Lastly the King himself writ a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Jews</hi> dated the month following (according to the Arch-Bishop) <hi>Xanthicus</hi> the 15, which he sent with <hi>Menelaus</hi> (by whom also he had been acquainted with the desire of the <hi>Jews)</hi> to give them-full assurance, that he granted their request. In this there is nothing improbable. But that the King should give order to <hi>Lysias</hi> to write to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that he should not do it till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two months or three months perhaps af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is that which I can by no means sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M. 3531</hi> sets thè beginning of <hi>Artaxerxes's</hi> reign 9 years before the received account. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to set it so soon by the Testimonies of <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Thucydides. Eusebius</hi> says that <hi>Themistocles</hi> fled to the <hi>Persians</hi> Olymp. <hi>76. An. 4,</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> accordingly refers <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles's</hi> coming to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the siege of <hi>Naxos,</hi> and the noble victory which <hi>Cimon</hi> obtain'd against the <hi>Persian</hi> at <hi>Eurymedon;</hi> also he refers the beginning of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes's</hi> reign to the same time. For he says that <hi>Themistocles</hi> writ a letter then to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> newly reigning. Thus the Arch-Bishop. Now it may be that he is singular in this opinion about the beginning of the reign
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43633:28"/>
of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> he himself insinuates so much. It must be granted also that the time of <hi>Themistocles's</hi> flight is not agreed upon, and indeed is one great instance of the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chronology. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes that <hi>Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heraclides</hi> and many more say, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> came into <hi>Persia</hi> in the time of <hi>Xerxes:</hi> but that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Lamsacenus</hi> agrees with <hi>Thucydides</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that he came to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his son, <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> being dead; also <hi>Plutarch</hi> adds that <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> agrees better with the Annals. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Nepos</hi> also follows <hi>Thucyaides,</hi> thô he was not ignorant that others were of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion from him. But suppose <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides, Charon, Lamsacenus</hi> and <hi>Cornel. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi> to be certainly in the right, in affirming that <hi>Themistocles</hi> fled to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be infer'd thence that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Artaxerxess</hi> reign was so soon as the Arch-Bishop hath set it, is another question, which I shall not take upon me to determine. I shall therefore only 1. Briefly thew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of the Doctors answer to that which the Arch-Bishop alledges. 2. Take notice of an unbecoming reflection of his upon the Arch-Bishop.</p>
               <p>The Doctors answer to the Arch-Bishop we have <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>s.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 1, 2, 3. To <hi>Eusebius</hi> he opposes <hi>Diodorus Sioul. l.</hi> 11. by whom he says it is clearly asserted that the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43633:28"/>
time of <hi>Themistocles's</hi> flight was Olymp. 77. <hi>An.</hi> 2, not Olympiad 76. <hi>An.</hi> 4. as <hi>Eusebius.</hi> To <hi>Thucydides</hi> he opposes the same <hi>Diodorus Sie.</hi> and <hi>Justin,</hi> who (as he says) clearly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that <hi>Cimons</hi> victory at <hi>Eurymedon</hi> was in the time of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> As to <hi>Themistocles's</hi> letter to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> he says 1. The date of it is not known, possibly was not known to <hi>Thucydides</hi> himself. 2. It is not without great suspition that it was an <hi>Athenian</hi> trick, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Themistocles's</hi> enemies, a letter fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on purpose to blast his reputation even after his death. 3. If it was true, it only evinceth this, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> lived so long an Exile abroad as to the time of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his reign. This is the summ of the Doctors answer. To which I reply;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not clearly asserted by <hi>Diodorus Sicul.</hi> that the time of <hi>Themistocles</hi> his flight was Olymp. 77. <hi>An.</hi> 2. He indeed speaks of it in that year, as he does also of his Ostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism and death. He thought it best to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch at once all that concern'd <hi>Themistocles's</hi> fall, and so in that year he gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Ostracism or Banishment, his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Argos,</hi> his flight from thence to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus,</hi> and afterwards from <hi>Admetus</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> his journey from thence to the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, and what befel him there, and lastly of his death. Not that all these fell out in that year, (for there was a considerable time from his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43633:29"/>
Ostracism to his coming to the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, and a considerable time again from his coming thither to his death) but it is <hi>Diodorus Sicul.</hi> his usual way to throw things thus together that belong to the same subject. As then from his mentioning <hi>Themistocles's</hi> Ostracism and death in that year, we cannot conclude that they fell out that year: so from the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his flight in that year i: cannot be concluded, that it happen'd then. However, it is plain, that it is not clearly asserted by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> that the time of <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles's</hi> flight was Olymp. 77. <hi>An.</hi> 2, let the Doctor say what he pleases.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very true that <hi>Diodorus Sicul.</hi> and <hi>Justin</hi> do make <hi>Cimons</hi> victory to have been in the time of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> differing therein from <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and (as is probable) following <hi>Ephorus, Dinon</hi> and others, who refer <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles's</hi> flight to the time of <hi>Xerxes:</hi> but as <hi>Cornel. Nepos</hi> rather believ'd <hi>Thucydides</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of <hi>Themistocles's</hi> flight, because he liv'd near the time of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> and was of the same City, so may we rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him about the time of <hi>Cimons</hi> victory upon the same motives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the letter with which the Doctor is so much troubled, 1. If the date of it be not known, how comes the Doctor to know it so well, as to be able to tell us that it is of the same date with the story of <hi>Themistocles's</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:43633:29"/>
drinking Bulls bloud? 2. Why says the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, that possibly the date of it was not known to <hi>Thucydides,</hi> when <hi>Thucydides</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tels us that <hi>Themistocles</hi> writ the letter after that he was come to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being gone from thence into the midland Countries? 3. If there be so great suspition that it was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> trick, it is strange that <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Corn. Nepos</hi> (who transcribes the letter from him) were not aware of it. It must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that the Doctor was very quick sented that could smell it out at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when those Authors which were much nearer did not. 4. It is most strange that the Doctor should say that if it be true, it evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only this, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> liv'd so long as to the time of <hi>Artaxerxes's</hi> reign. As if the writing this letter was one of the last acts he did, whereas he writ it (as we have seen) before his coming to the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, and consequently <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had begun his reign then. Finally should we be so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Doctor as to grant that the letter is supposititious, he will gain little by it; for it is still apparent that <hi>Thucydides</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had begun to reign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Themistocles's</hi> coming into <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctors unbecoming reflection upon the Arch-Bishop is in <hi>s.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 4. where he says that we must take notice that the knitting all these knots, and patching together those shreds,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43633:30"/>
as 1. <hi>Themistocles's</hi> courtly letter, 2. <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius's</hi> incongruous Annotation, 3. <hi>Ctesias's</hi> authorizing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Artabanus</hi> nothing to the purpose, these are upon design to make a boulster for the Bishops interpretation of the 70 weeks of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Thus the Doctor. As if the Arch-Bishop foresaw that the Doctor would lay his interpretation to sleep, and so set himself to knit knots and patch shreds together to make a boulster for it. Or as if the Arch-Bishops design was to serve his Hypothesis, whatsoever became of the Truth. In the mean time the Arch-Bishops interpretation is that which very many Expositors, Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, have approv'd and follow'd, computing the 70 weeks (as the Arch-Bishop doth) from the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> This 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (according to the Arch-Bishops calculation) was <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 4260, thô it is represented here by the Doctor as if the Arch-Bishop made it to be <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 4261. To conclude this, I wish the Doctor had not <hi>Part 2. l. 2. §. 1. c. 9. s. 11.</hi> after a profession of all humility, insulted with such contempt and scorn over many that have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd as much to clear the sense of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Prophecy of the 70 weeks, as he hath done to obscure and pervert it. See the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> chapt. of the same Book and Section.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c. 18. s. 11.</hi> tells us, that the world is made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Semiramis</hi> was in the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> war, or near thereabouts according to <hi>Sanchuniathon.</hi> This is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of which he speaks in the same sect., which (says he) bears it self out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and the credit of <hi>Sanchuniathon.</hi> And in the margin he cites Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> for all this. Now it is true that the Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 2789 will have <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> to have been in the time of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> war or thereabouts; but I would know where it is that the Arch-Bishop alledges <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuniathon</hi> for this, or reports it upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of <hi>Sanchuniathon.</hi> It is not <hi>Sanchunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> that the Arch-Bishop alledges, but <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi> as cited by <hi>Euseb. de Praepar. Evang. l. 1.</hi> and 10, who says that <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> was contemporary to <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and that she is said to have been either before the <hi>Trojan</hi> affairs, or about the same time with them. But let this strange oversight be past by. To <hi>Sanchuniathon</hi> and the Arch-Bishop the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor opposes <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43633:31"/>
would make us belive in this <hi>s. 11</hi>) rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons <hi>Semiramis</hi> to have been 520 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> But if we read on and peruse the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> sect., it will appear that he is not serious in it. For thô here after having spent many words about it, he concludes, that this is most certainly the reckoning of <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> yet there he says that it is not imputable to <hi>Herodotus</hi> but his transcriber, who writ <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The meaning of this is, that if <hi>Herodotus</hi> had indeed said that <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> was only five generations before <hi>Nitocris</hi> (as it is in our copies, see <hi>Herodotus l. 1. c. 184.</hi>) then the Doctor thinks that it would have follow'd, that by <hi>Herodotus's</hi> account <hi>Semiramis</hi> had been 520 years after the siege of <hi>Troy:</hi> but (says the Doctor) our copies are faulty, and 50 being put instead of 5 we must read that <hi>Semiramis</hi> was Fifty genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before the other. The question then will be, whether we must follow our copies, or the Doctors correction, who produceth no other authentick copy to warrant it. Yea but the Doctor will demonstrate that this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection must be admitted. Let us (says he) rate these 50 generations by <hi>Herodotus's</hi> rule (which is that 3 generations are 100 years) the product will be <hi>An. 1666.</hi> Let these be deducted from 4160 the age and time of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocris,</hi> the remainder is 2494. which falls just with the time of <hi>Semiramis</hi> her reign, the 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:43633:31"/>
year of her reign, according to the years of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> describ'd in our Scheme. These are the Doctors words, who triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concludes, <hi>This is a demonstration, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon it, taken from Herodotus, a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that Herodotus is on our side contra gentes.</hi> And I would have given the Doctor leave to have been transported thus, if he had prov'd these three things, 1. That the age and time of <hi>Nitocris</hi> was <hi>An. Per. Jul. 4160.</hi> 2. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this place of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> is to be taken in that sense in which three generations make a Century, 3. That his Scheme is a right Scheme. But if he fail in the proof of any one of these, what becomes of the demonstration, which he must insist upon, and which occasion'd such triumph.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctor in his demonstration (as he calls it) takes it for granted that <hi>An. Per. Jul. 4160.</hi> was the age and time of <hi>Nito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris,</hi> whereas in <hi>sect. 11.</hi> he was more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and only said it was about that year. And yet he brought neither Authority nor reason to satisfie us that it was about that year, unless his saying without doubt it must be so, be Authority enough.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He takes it for granted, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Herodotus l 1. c. 184.</hi> is to be taken in that sense in which three generations are accounted 100 years, whereas it hath various significations, and we may observe in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus l. 2. c. 142.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. He tells us that <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2494. falls just with the 35 year of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Scheme. So that in the upshot all depends upon his Scheme, and if that will not bear the weight of the demonstration which he builds upon it, it must fall to the ground. His Scheme we have in the end of this 18 Chapter, and to recommend it to us, he says that it is <hi>Africanus's.</hi> But how comes it then that in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he gives us another Scheme differing from this, and tells us that that is from <hi>Africanus?</hi> About the time that <hi>Semiramis</hi> begun to reign the difference between the two Schemes is no less then 25 years. But the Doctor solves this by saying that the one is <hi>Africanus's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Syncellus,</hi> the other according to <hi>Helvicus</hi> and <hi>Ricciolus.</hi> So that it is questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable whether of them is <hi>Africanus's</hi> (if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them be) but there is some reason
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43633:32"/>
why we should rather believe <hi>Syncellus</hi> then them, because he had greater advantages for knowing what was deliver'd to Posterity by <hi>Africanus</hi> then they had. Add hereto that <hi>Helvicus</hi> seems not to have valu'd the Scheme which he gives us as from <hi>Africanus</hi> so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Doctor doth; for he gives us also another Scheme out of <hi>Justin,</hi> and observing that <hi>Justin</hi> makes the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire to have continued only 1300 years, he adds that this comes nearer to the Scripture, and again that it agrees very well both with the Scripture and with the <hi>AEra Babylonica.</hi> In a word, unless there was a better accord among Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers about the time of the duration of that Empire, about the number of the Kings and of the years that they reign'd, there can be no certainty either in the Doctors Scheme, or in any other whatsoever. It is plain then that he hath fallen far short of demonstrating that we must read Fifty generations instead of five.</p>
               <p>By the way, the Doctor forgot to tell us that he was oblig'd to <hi>Scaliger (fragment. p. 42.)</hi> for this Criticism, or perhaps he was not willing to mention him for this reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, because thô <hi>Scaliger</hi> thought that it should be Fifty generations, yet he differs from him in the conclusion; for he says that they amount to more then 1666 years, and being computed backward end in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43633:33"/>
reign (not of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> but) of <hi>Ninus</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, If we retain the usual reading, it will not help the Arch-Bishop at all, who makes <hi>Semiramis</hi> to have reign'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> war. For if she was but Five generations before <hi>Nitocris,</hi> and if <hi>Nitocris</hi> liv'd about <hi>An. Per. Jul. 4160,</hi> then <hi>Semiramis</hi> must have been 500 years at the least after the siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> since accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this account she was only 166 years before <hi>Nitocris,</hi> for Five generations according to the foremention'd rule amount to no more. But to answer this briefly, Suppose that all the rest was granted, the Doctor (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd before) hath not prov'd either that <hi>Nitocris</hi> liv'd about <hi>An. P. J. 4160,</hi> or that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in <hi>Herodotus</hi> amount to no more then 166 years. All his proof for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is that, Without doubt it must be so. For the later he brings a rule out of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus l. 2. c. 142.</hi> to which I have already answer'd that it is not necessary that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> should have the same signification in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus l. 1. c. 184.</hi> that it hath <hi>l. 2. c. 142;</hi> especially when the word <gap reason="foreign">

signifies an Age or 100 years, but sometimes above 100 years, <hi>Imo etiam 100 aliquando uti est apud Theophrastum, vel etiam 110 an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum intervallum continet <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>THE Arch-Bishop <hi>A.

That which he doth say is 1. That there is a project in it, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring down <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> 100 years and more lower in time, then all Historians and Chronologers before did set him. 2. That he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. 3. That <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath no cover
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43633:34"/>
for this dish. Now for answer to these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I need not insist upon any of them but the first. For as to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, Thô the Doctor will not believe that <hi>Belesis</hi> was <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonasar,</hi> this notwithstanding, it may be very true. And as to the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, We need not go to <hi>Herodotus</hi> for a cover, since the Doctor hath not discover'd any nakedness in the Arch-Bishops opinion. The first then only remains, in which the Doctor hath brought forth all the Historians and Chronologers that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him against the Arch-Bishop; all these set <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> more then 100 years higher then he doth. To which I shall only say, that I cannot commend the Doctors prudence in using this large expression, <hi>All Historians and Chronologers,</hi> for I can affirm that there are some who do not set <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> so high as he pretends. <hi>Bibliander</hi> refers the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reign of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> to the 25 year of <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>W. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> to his 21, <hi>Funccius</hi> and <hi>Salianus</hi> to his 20, <hi>Torniellus</hi> to his 19, <hi>Constantinus Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> and <hi>Bunting</hi> to his 18, <hi>Eusebius</hi> to his 16, <hi>Gordon</hi> to his 13 or 14, <hi>Simson</hi> to his 10, <hi>Syncellus</hi> to the 7, and <hi>Freculphus</hi> to the time of <hi>Azariah</hi> or <hi>Vzziah</hi> the Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of <hi>Amaziah, Orosius l. 1. c. 19</hi> to the 64 year before the building of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now there is not one of all these that sets <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus</hi> more then 100 years higher then the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43633:34"/>
Arch-Bishop doth. According to the Arch-Bishop <hi>Sardanapalus's</hi> reign begun 19 years before the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and according to <hi>Orosius</hi> it begun but 64 years before it, the difference between them is only 45 years. <hi>Freculphus</hi> and the Arch-Bishop refer the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reign to the time of the same King of <hi>Judah,</hi> viz. <hi>Vzziah,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop particularly to <hi>Vzziahs</hi> 44 year, and so they cannot differ above 43 years. They that make him to have begun his reign in the time of <hi>Amaziah</hi> do indeed set him higher then <hi>Orosius</hi> and <hi>Freculphus</hi> do, but <hi>Syncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> who goes the highest of them differs not above 66 years from the Arch-Bishop; for from the 7 of <hi>Amaziah</hi> (who reign'd but 29 years in all, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 2. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 1.) to the 44 of <hi>Vzziah</hi> there are no more, unless it be admitted that there was an interregnum. And it must be a very long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum of almost 40 years, to make the distance twixt the 7 year of the Father to the 44 year of the Son to have been above 100 years. Add hereto that <hi>Bede</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the death of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> to the time of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> and so the <hi>Chronicon</hi> at the end of <hi>De la Hays Biblia magna</hi> which refers it to the 9 year of the same <hi>Vzziah,</hi> do not set him more then 100 years higher then the Arch-Bishop doth. The same must be said of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholzer,</hi> who makes <hi>Sardanapalus's</hi> his death
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43633:35"/>
to have happen'd <hi>An. 823</hi> before Christ, when according to the Arch-Bishop it fell out <hi>An. 748</hi> before him. Finally <hi>Genebrard</hi> and our M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lydiat,</hi> who will have <hi>Saraanapalus</hi> to have been the same with <hi>Esarhaddon Isa. 37. 38.</hi> or <hi>Assaradon-Pul</hi> (as they call him) do bring down <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> many years lower then the Arch-Bishop sets him; for <hi>Esarhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> did not reign before the time of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah.</hi> I may then safely conclude, that the Arch-Bishop had no such project to bring down <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> more then 100 years lower then all Historians and Chronologers had set him.</p>
               <p>To return to <hi>Nabonasar,</hi> with the Doctors good leave I would ask the question, Why is the Arch-Bishop only quarrell'd with for holding that he was <hi>Belesis?</hi> They that please to consult M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lydiats Emendatio temporum A. M. 3257</hi> will find, that we were told the very same thing in express terms by him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years since.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Arch Bishop <hi>A. M. 3483</hi> and 3490. modestly offers some conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> as 1. That he was <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> in the Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> 2. That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tossa</hi> was <hi>Vashti,</hi> 3. That <hi>Artystona</hi> was <hi>Esther.</hi> For this he must not escape the Doctors lash <hi>Part 2. l. 2. s. 1. c. 4.</hi> notwithstanding that the Doctor might have known, that many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, as <hi>Bertram de Repub. Jud. c. 13. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, Melancthon, Funccius, Bunting,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Chronicon in De la Haye's Biblia magna, Fevardentius,</hi> &amp;c. have thought that <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> was the husband of <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,</hi> as well as the Arch-Bishop; as likewise that there are not many questions about which the differing opinions are so many, as about this; <hi>Esther</hi> having been married by one or other to most of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and to some of the Kings of the <hi>Medes. Melancthon</hi> also thought that <hi>Artystona</hi> was <hi>Esther,</hi> and <hi>Atossa Vashti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the conjecture that <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> was that <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> who reign'd from <hi>India</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:43633:36"/>
to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> over 127 provinces, <hi>Esther</hi> 1. 1. the Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 3483 observes from <hi>Valerius Maximus l. 9. c. 2.</hi> that this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> before he obtained the Kingdom was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ochus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being added after his being King, he had the name <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus,</hi> as <hi>Cambyses</hi> had before him. And <hi>A. M.</hi> 3509 he says, that he is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in his opinion by that which we read of <hi>Ahasuerus Esth.</hi> 10. 1. that he laid a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute upon the land, and upon the Isles of the sea. This (says he) agrees to <hi>Darius,</hi> who was the first that instituted the paying of tribute, when they brought gifts before: (for which he alledges <hi>Herodotus l. 3. c. 89. Strabo l. 15. Polyaenus Stratagem. l. 7.</hi> and <hi>Plutarch Apophthegmat. Regum &amp; Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum)</hi> who also subdu'd and rul'd over the Isles in the <hi>AEgean</hi> sea (as he gathers from <hi>Thucydides l. 1.</hi> and <hi>Plato in Menexeno</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Xerxes</hi> after his overthrow in <hi>Greece</hi> lost those Isles, so that only <hi>Clazomenae,</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> remain'd under the dominion of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, for which we may consult <hi>Xenophon Hellenicwn l. 5.</hi> Thus the Arch-Bishop.</p>
               <p>And what says the Doctor to all this? He dispatches it in very few words. For 1. The name <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> 2. The dignification or title of being ruler over 127 Provinces, from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> 3. The imposing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute upon the Islands, all and every of these
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43633:36"/>
(says he) did as much belong to the Kings of <hi>Darius's</hi> succession, as to himself in particular; therefore nothing can be concluded certain from hence in special for <hi>Darius.</hi> Thus the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I reply, 1. That the Arch-Bishop never design'd to conclude any thing certain from thence, he knew full well that nothing can be concluded certainly in such difficult questions as this is. 2. How appears it that all and every of these did as much belong to <hi>Darius's</hi> Successors as to himself? the Doctors own saying it is all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or proof that is brought for it. Possibly some have said that <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> was a common name of all the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> but we are not obliged to believe every bold conjecture or confident assertion. And when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor says that the being Ruler over 127 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces belong'd to <hi>Darius's</hi> Successors indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, he seems to forget what he had said <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c. 20 viz.</hi> that <hi>Egypt</hi> (which was certainly one of the Provinces) did revolt from the <hi>Persians</hi> in the time of <hi>Darius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> and was not reduc'd till the reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Ochus.</hi> And then, as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing tribute upon the Islands, the Arch-Bishop produces the Testimonies of sundry Writers to prove 1. That this <hi>Darius</hi> was the first that impos'd tribute (which could not belong to his Successors.) 2. That he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43633:37"/>
and rul'd over the Isles in the <hi>AEgean</hi> sea, which his Successors did not; for his Son <hi>Xerxes</hi> lost them upon his overthrow in <hi>Greece.</hi> But to all this the Doctor says nothing. I shall only add to that which the Arch-Bishop hath observ'd of this matter, that in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus l. 3. c. 96.</hi> there is express mention of the Isles paying tribute to this <hi>Darius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now to make tryal whether the Doctor be more happy in his arguing against the Arch-Bishop, then he hath been in answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arguments. He objects against the Arch-Bishops conjecture, 1. That <hi>Darius</hi> was a name so well known to all the <hi>Jewish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether at <hi>Babylon, Sufa</hi> or <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so appropriated to him that was the Son of <hi>Hystaspis,</hi> that it would be a very strange thing to see his name suppress'd by any of them. 2. That this <hi>Darius</hi> was an eminent Benefactor to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation from the first of his reign to his 6 year, and that it was his interest to confirm all <hi>Cyrus's</hi> decrees, and so it is not likely, that in the 12 of his reign he should so much forget himself, as at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of a malapert Courtier to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for the utter destruction of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> throughout all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. 3. That this Prince's levity in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ostentation of the Queens beauty, and peevishness in taking so deep an offence at her refusal, and petulancy in the use of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43633:37"/>
and lastly rashness in granting a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for an universal massacre of the <hi>Jews,</hi> will not suit with <hi>Darius,</hi> who before he obtain'd the Kingdom had been one of the Seven Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers or Ministers of State, and was full 28 years old when he came to the Crown. Thus the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Before I return answer to all this I must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that the Doctor is of opinion that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes Longimanus</hi> was the husband of <hi>Esther.</hi> Now I say that these objections make as well against <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as they do against <hi>Darius.</hi> The Doctor himself confesses this to be true of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> objection. And as to the first, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> is a name which was as well known to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Writers as <hi>Darius.</hi> For the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, the levity, peevishness, petulancy, rashness and cruelty in granting a decree for a Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of all the <hi>Jews</hi> mention'd in it will not suit with <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who is commended by <hi>Plutarch</hi> for his mildness or lenity, as well as magnanimity, and by <hi>Diodor. Sicul.</hi> and others for his prudence in managing affairs at the very first. So that the Doctor is oblig'd to answer these objections as much as we. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Doctor is guilty of not a few mistakes. 1. I cannot understand why he says in the first objection, that the name of <hi>Darius</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to him who was the Son of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staspes,</hi> since there were two other <hi>Persian</hi> Kings that had this name, <hi>viz, Darius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:43633:38"/>
and <hi>Darius Codomannus;</hi> not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede.</hi> 2. I do not know how the Doctor will prove that <hi>Darius</hi> was one of the Seven Counsellers of Ministers of State before he obtain'd the Kingdom, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he was but newly come to <hi>Susa</hi> when the other conspirators against the <hi>Magi</hi> took him into their number; see <hi>Herodotus l. 3. c. 30.</hi> The same <hi>Herodotus l. 3. c. 139.</hi> tells us indeed, that he was one of <hi>Cambyses</hi> his guard, his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>satelles,</hi> but adds that he was a man of no great note. 3. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it granted that the levity, peevishness and rashness noted in <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> did not suit with <hi>Darius's</hi> usual temper, yet when he was heated with Wine (see <hi>Esth.</hi> 1. 10.) that might betray him to miscarriages of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It was therefore a mistake in the Doctor to think that he might conclude thence, that <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> was not <hi>Darius.</hi> I add that if cruelty was one of <hi>Ahasuerus's</hi> qualifications (as his giving commandment utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all the <hi>Jews</hi> in all his Dominions must be confess'd to be an act of cruelty) no man will acquit <hi>Darius</hi> of that, who calls to mind his merciless slaughter of all the Sons of <hi>Oeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus,</hi> only because he desir'd that one of them might be permitted to stay behind, and not to accompany him in his expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Sythians, Herodot. l. 4. c. 84.</hi> This may suffice for the first conjecture that <hi>Ahasue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was <hi>Darius.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:43633:38"/>
               <p>For the two other conjectures, that <hi>Atossa</hi> was <hi>Vashti,</hi> and <hi>Artystona Esther,</hi> the Doctor objects that the agreement of the names <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tossa</hi> and <hi>Vashti</hi> is of no moment against the authority of History and Testimony of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> who writes that <hi>Atossa</hi> was married to <hi>Darius</hi> after his obtaining the Kingdom, and that he had four children by her, and that she continu'd all the time of <hi>Darius</hi> to have a great power, yea all the power with him. How then (says he) is it likely that in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of this Kings reign she should be put away? And to say that <hi>Artystona</hi> was <hi>Esther,</hi> because the King had a greater kindness for her then any of his other wives, yea and that the <hi>Persian</hi> Genealogies were falsifi'd out of envy to the <hi>Jews,</hi> this (says the Doctor) is worse then saying nothing at all. To which I answer, that the Arch-Bishop doth not say, that the <hi>Persian</hi> Genealogies were falsifi'd out of envy to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but only that we may think either that the <hi>Persians</hi> out of envy dissembled the parentage of <hi>Esther,</hi> or that <hi>Herodotus</hi> had not rightly understood the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Genealogies. Again, the Arch-Bishop doth not insist upon the agreement of the names <hi>Vashti</hi> and <hi>Atossa,</hi> thô it is true he thought as <hi>Melancthon</hi> also did that <hi>Atossa</hi> was <hi>Vash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti:</hi> as he also thought with <hi>Carion</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> that <hi>Artystona</hi> was <hi>Esther;</hi> and he was the rather mov'd to think so, because of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43633:39"/>
the singular affection that <hi>Darius</hi> bare to her, having her Image all of solid Gold; see <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus l. 7. c. 69.</hi> Now whether this is worse then saying nothing at all let others determine.</p>

Animal. l. 2. c. 21.</hi> is call'd <hi>Tilgam,</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 29. and 16. 7, 10. <hi>Tiglathpileser,</hi> but in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 6, 26, and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Tilgathpilneser.</hi> This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is disliked by the Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 2. s. 3. c. 4.</hi> and yet all that he says against it is, that there is just as much in <hi>AElian</hi> to shew that this <hi>Ninus</hi> junior was <hi>Tilgam,</hi> as there is in the Scripture to shew that he was <hi>Tiglathpileser,</hi> and no more. His meaning is, that there is nothing either in <hi>AElian</hi> to shew the one, or in the Scripture to shew the other. To which I answer 1. That there is as much in the Scripture to shew that this <hi>Ninus</hi> was <hi>Tiglathpileser,</hi> as there is in it to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43633:39"/>
shew that <hi>Phul</hi> was in a distance of some 85 years after this <hi>Ninus,</hi> which the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirms in this Chapter. 2. Thô there be nothing in <hi>AElian</hi> to shew the one, or in the Scripture to shew the other, yet they may be true. The Doctor is willing to grant that <hi>Tilgam</hi> in <hi>AElian</hi> and <hi>Tilgathpilneser</hi> in the Scripture are one and the same person, and yet there is nothing either in the one or the other to shew this. 3. The Arch-Bishop knew that there is nothing in Scripture directly to prove that <hi>Ninus</hi> junior was the same with <hi>Tiglathpileser,</hi> but the ground of his conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture seems to have been this, that <hi>Tiglath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileser</hi> according to the Scripture was King of <hi>Assyria</hi> at that time, when this <hi>Ninus</hi> was King of <hi>Assyria</hi> according to Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

               <p>THE Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 2. s. 3. c. 10.</hi> says that it is fairly acknowledged by the Arch-Bishop, that it was the opinion of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus, Justin Martyr, Clemens, Josephus, Justus Tiberiensi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> with others, that <hi>Moses</hi> was born in the time of <hi>Inachus,</hi> and that the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43633:40"/>
migration of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was in <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneus's</hi> time. Wherein the Doctor hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Arch-Bishop not much amiss, for <hi>A. M.</hi> 2179. he says that the forecited Authors believ'd that <hi>Moses</hi> was equal <hi>i. e.</hi> contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary to <hi>Inachus,</hi> thô it was the Arch-Bishops own opinion that the departure of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was long after the reign of <hi>Inacbus.</hi> But if the Doctor have dealt well with him in this, I am sure he hath not done so in that which follows. For he adds that All that which he (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) says to it is this, that his calculation, which he is sure is right, will not permit it to be so, i. e. <hi>Moses</hi> to be contempory to <hi>Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> Whereas the Arch-Bishop doth not say this, and suppose that he had said it, it is not all that which he says.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Arch-Bishop doth not say this. He doth not say, that he is sure that his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is right. He says indeed that the right account of times doth not permit us to doubt of this, that the departure of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was much later then the reign of <hi>Inachus;</hi> but all that can be made of this is, that the Arch-Bishop thought that the account of times which he follow'd is right; that he was sure that his calculation is right, he no where saith. And yet if he had said this, it is not much more then that which the Doctor himself says in the first
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43633:40"/>
words of this Chapter; I shall proceed (says he) a point beyond illustration, I shall go near to make a fair demonstration; and again in this Chapter I doubt not (says he) but my deductions are as just as any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, for they are deduc'd by manifest proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppose that the Arch-Bishop had said this, it is not all that he saith. For he shews how it came to pass, that those Learned men did believe <hi>Moses</hi> to have been contemporary to <hi>Inachus, viz.</hi> Having read of certain Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of <hi>Inachus,</hi> they understood this of the <hi>Israelites</hi> coming from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi> whereas those Sheepherds were the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> of whom <hi>Herodotus l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 89. with <hi>Stephanus Byzant.</hi> in <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> testifies that they came from the Red sea.</p>
               <p>That it may not seem strange, that the Arch-Bishop should depart from the opinion of all those Learned men, I add that <hi>Eusebius</hi> did the same before him, as also the greatest part of our later Chronologers. But the Doctor adheres to their opinion, and will by all means demonstrate the truth of it, and if you will be so liberal as to grant his suppositions, and that his Deductions and Tables are right, then he may do something; but if you be resty and will not grant him these, then you will put him out of the humor of demonstrating.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of that <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was reported to have made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> his heir.</head>
               <p>THE Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 3924. affirms that <hi>Alexander</hi> who was expell'd by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and dy'd at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and was reported to have left the Commonwealth his heir, reigned at the least 15 years. And for this he alledges <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Suetonius;</hi> see him also <hi>A. M.</hi> 3939 and 3940. The Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c.</hi> 13. takes notice of this, and though the Arch-Bishop and he were friends a little before in the very same Chapter (insomuch that he calls him the most Learned Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi>) yet he presently takes up the cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels against him, and denies that it can be prov'd by any Authorities alledg'd by the Arch-Bishop and others, that the foresaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> reign'd 15 years. If it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any of them, the Doctor thinks it must be that of <hi>Cicero Orat.</hi> 1 and 2 <hi>de leg. Agrar.,</hi> but to take off the force of this, he urges those words in <hi>Orat. 2 Haec L. Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum in Senatu confirmasse in memoria teneo.</hi> Which words seem to the Doctor to argue, that the Testament and death of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43633:41"/>
and the discourses of <hi>L. Phillipus</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate concerning them, were more then a year or two before <hi>Cicero's</hi> delivering those Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Furthermore (says the Doctor) let it be granted that the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> was in the year in which the Arch-Bishop sets it; yet of the time of his expulsion, and how long he liv'd an Exile, there is not a word to be found in any of those Authorities. Thus the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Who might have been more easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, if he had set down the passages in <hi>Tullies</hi> Orations on which the Arch-Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, or directed us to the place where the Arch-Bishop hath transcrib'd them at large, <hi>viz. A. M.</hi> 3940. And his snatching at the words <hi>Memoria teneo</hi> (as if they argued that <hi>Alexanders</hi> death and the Speeches of <hi>L. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> were more then a year or two before <hi>Cicero's</hi> delivering the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Oration) seems to me to argue that the Doctor was at a loss for an answer. For certainly a man may say pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough, I remember or retain in memory that such or such things were discoursed of by such a person, though it be not more then a year or two since he discoursed of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Doctors saying that of the time of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi> expulsion there is not a word in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Authorities, doth more then seem to argue, that he had not consulted the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Suetonius in Julio Caesare. c.</hi> 11. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43633:42"/>
by the Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 3939, for it is manifest from him, that <hi>Alexanders</hi> expulsion was at the time of <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> being <hi>AEdilis</hi> (as the Arch-Bishop sets it) or very shortly after it.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor also produceth the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Historians and Chronographers, and the Mathematical Canon against the Arch-Bishop. He cannot imagin why the Canon should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a King of the direct line of 15 or 16 years reign, to substitute a stranger in the place of him. He concludes that allowing first <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and then <hi>Alexander</hi> to have succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ptolomaeus Lathurus;</hi> yet because the time of their reigning was short, under the length of a year, therefore the Canon casts it in to the reign of <hi>Ptolem. Auletes.</hi> Thus the Doctor.</p>
               <p>But why doth he urge the Arch-Bishop with the Authority of the generality of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians and Chronographers? when he had told us but a little before, that the Arch-Bishop did acknowledge the generality of Historians and Chronographers to be against him? Thò there are very Learned men that are for him, not only <hi>Petavius de doct. tem. l. 10. c. 46.</hi> and in <hi>Paralipomen. item in Rationar. Part 1. l. 4. c. 15.</hi> and <hi>Part 2. l. 3. c. 12,</hi> but also <hi>Ricciolus To. 3. p. 34,</hi> and <hi>To. 4. p. 82,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them <hi>Paulus Manutius in Comment. in Orat. 1. de leg. Agrar.</hi> As to the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Canon, the Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c. 3.</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:43633:42"/>
acknowledges that it is not free from imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections aud oversights, and therefore promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to rectifie the things that seem to be amiss in it. Withal he should not have told us that the time that both <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> reign'd was not the space of a year, until he had offer'd some answer to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Suetonius</hi> alleag'd by the Arch-Bishop to prove that <hi>Alexander</hi> reign'd many years.</p>
               <p>Instead of answering <hi>Suetonius,</hi> the Doctor takes upon him to correct <hi>Justin,</hi> who in <hi>Prologo l. 39.</hi> hath these words, <hi>Ut post La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrum filius Alexandri regnarit, expulsoque eo suffectus sit Ptolomaeus Nothus.</hi> Here (if we will believe the Doctor) <hi>Justin</hi> wrote not <hi>Ptolemaeus Nothus,</hi> but <hi>Ptolemaeus novus;</hi> for (says he) this <hi>Ptolemee</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Diodorus Sicul.</hi> testifies. But I would know of the Doctor, how we can conclude from his being call'd a new <hi>Dionysius</hi> or a new <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that he had also the name of a new <hi>Ptolemee.</hi> I do believe that few have heard or read of a <hi>Ptolemaeus Novus</hi> before this. And what necessity is there of making an alteration as to the name? since it is believed that <hi>Ptolemaeus Auletes</hi> was really <hi>Nothus,</hi> with which agrees that passage in <hi>Tullies Orat. 2. de leg. Agrar.,</hi> where he says that he who reign'd then (<hi>i. e.</hi> as the Arch-Bishop and others interpret it <hi>Ptolemaeus Auletes</hi>) was <hi>neque genere neque

               <p>THE Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c.</hi> 16. falls very severely upon the Arch-Bishop, I must (says he) advise the Reader that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of being imposed upon by the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Herodotus-----------</hi> As if <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Belus</hi> forsooth, the first founders of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy, were the Grandchildren of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphitruo,</hi> for it is that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> which <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of. And then (says he) who can chuse but wonder at that of Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> in his Annals <hi>Part 1. p. 44.</hi> or <hi>A. M.</hi> 2781.) where this very <hi>Argon</hi> is made the Son of <hi>Ninus</hi> the first great <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarch, and this grounded upon the Authority of <hi>Herodotus?</hi> And he adds that this was not a slip of the pen, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious excogitation. After other words he thus concludes, That this <hi>Argon</hi> should be the Son of <hi>Ninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Belus</hi> founders
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43633:43"/>
of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy <hi>credat Judaeus Apella, non ego.</hi> Thus the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Whom the Arch-Bishop hath thus highly offended only with these three words <hi>Argon Nini filius.</hi> He doth not say <hi>Argon</hi> the Son of <hi>Ninus</hi> the first great <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarch or Founder of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy. Nor doth he say The Son of <hi>Ninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> though (if he had said this last) he had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transcrib'd the words of <hi>Herodotus l. 1. c. 7.</hi> which are these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Why then doth the Doctor talk of an industrious excogitation, when the Arch-Bishop says nothing but what he found in <hi>Herodotus?</hi> But the Doctor says that that which he found in <hi>Herodotus</hi> (particularly the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is not <hi>Herodotus</hi> his own, but the mistake of an unwary hand. In the Text of <hi>Herodotus</hi> (says he) it was not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Now I think that the Arch-Bishop is not to be blamed for not being so profound a Critick as to discover that <hi>Herodotus</hi> was to be thus corrected. And if he was now living, I believe he would scarce perceive, that there is so near an Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. as that an unwary hand should write the one for the other. I believe also that it would have puzzled the most learned Primate of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43633:44"/>
to construe this new Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.

               <p>Therefore the Doctor is content that this should pass only for a conjecture; he also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us upon what he grounds it, <hi>viz.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that <hi>Alcaeus</hi> the Father of <hi>Argon</hi> is by <hi>Diodorus Sicul.</hi> called <hi>Cleolaus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the time of servitude born of a servant maid of <hi>Jardanus,</hi> so <hi>Diodo. Sic. l. 4.</hi> according to the Doctor. But 1. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> only says Born of a servant maid, he doth not say Of a servant maid of <hi>Jardanus.</hi> 2. How appears it that <hi>Alcaeus</hi> was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Argon? Diodorus</hi> doth not say that either <hi>Alcaeus</hi> or <hi>Cleolaus</hi> was his Father; and <hi>Herodotus</hi> says that <hi>Argon</hi> was the Son <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> 3. How appears it that <hi>Alcaeus</hi> is by <hi>Diodor.

               <p>The Doctor very confidently affirms, that the <hi>Hercules</hi> of whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43633:44"/>
was the Father of <hi>Alcaeus,</hi> and according to the Doctor, the Grandfather of <hi>Argon,</hi> was <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphitruo.</hi> But <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> doth not say that he was the Son of <hi>Amphiatruo,</hi> and the Doctor doth not offer any proof of it. In the mean time this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be offer'd against it. If <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphitruo</hi> was born but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the <hi>Trojan</hi> war, and if <hi>Argon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his reign over the <hi>Lydians</hi> before that war, then it is not probable that <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphitruo</hi> was the Grandfather of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi> But the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphitruo</hi> was born but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Trojan</hi> war, is expressly affirm'd by <hi>Diodorus Sic. l. 3. in fin.,</hi> and the Doctor himself grants the later; for in his Canon at the end of his book <hi>p.</hi> 43 and 45. he sets the beginning of <hi>Argons</hi> reign 28 years before the destruction of <hi>Troy.</hi> This knot the Doctor is forc'd to cut, because it was not to be loos'd; and so let <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> say what he will, he sets the birth of this <hi>Hercules</hi> 85 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Trojan</hi> war; see his Canon <hi>p.</hi> 41 and 45. Also he would have <hi>Alcaeus</hi> to have been born some short time after the <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautical</hi> expedition, forgetting that which he says of <hi>Alcaeus</hi> in the margin, that he is call'd <hi>Cleolaus</hi> by <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> and that <hi>Cleolaus</hi> was born in the time of <hi>Hercules's</hi> servitude <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Omphale,</hi> which was long after the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43633:45"/>
expedition of the <hi>Argonautae;</hi> see <hi>Diodor. Sit. l. 4.</hi> Add hereto that the Doctor makes <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> to have been about 58 years of age when <hi>Argon</hi> begun his reign, whereas in <hi>Euseb. Chron. Hercules</hi> is said to have liv'd only 52 years in all, and that there were some who did not allow him so many. Lastly, the Doctor will have the expedition of the <hi>Argonautae</hi> to have been long before that <hi>Eurystheus</hi> first reign'd (see <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c. 8.</hi>) whereas <hi>Diodorus Sic. l. 4. p.</hi> 153 and 156. makes that expedition to have been long after <hi>Eurystheus's</hi> first being King, <hi>viz.</hi> after that <hi>Hercules</hi> had perform'd the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> task or labour that he enjoyn'd him. In these difficulties the Doctor hath intangled himself by holding that the <hi>Hercules</hi> in <hi>Herodotus</hi> must be <hi>Hercules</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphitruo,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we may suppose him to be another (for <hi>Diodorus Sic. l. 3.</hi> says that there were three <hi>Hercules's,</hi> and <hi>Cicero de nat. Deor. l. 3.</hi> writes that there were Six) and that the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> that were Kings of <hi>Lydia</hi> descended from that other <hi>Hercules,</hi> but the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after setled in <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> were the posterity of this <hi>Hercules</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Amphitruo.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c. 20.</hi> says that the Arch-Bishop makes 506 years to have interven'd from the beginning of the reign of <hi>Sethosis</hi> to the reign of <hi>Sesac, 1 Kings 11. 40;</hi> but according to the Doctor only 451 years were between them. In this he relyes upon the authority of <hi>Africanus,</hi> whose Numbers (generally speaking) he prefers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eusebius's,</hi> whom (as he tells us) the Arch-Bishop follows, saving that with <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> he gives four years more to <hi>Sethosis</hi> then <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth. But a brief answer to this will suffice. For as the Doctor only says that generally speaking <hi>Africanus</hi> is to be prefer'd (which implies that he is not always) so he himself in this very account doth not follow <hi>Africanus,</hi> but says expressly that <hi>Africanus</hi> may be rectifi'd as well as <hi>Eusebius.</hi> The Doctor pretends that he differs only two years from him, but take <hi>Africanus</hi> as he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by <hi>Syncellus,</hi> without <hi>Goars</hi> alterations,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43633:46"/>
and he differs above 20 years from him. Besides the Arch-Bishop is misrepresented by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, for the Doctor says that according to the Arch-Bishop, that interval of time from the first of <hi>Sethosis</hi> to the first year of <hi>Sesac</hi> was 506 years, whereas the Arch-Bishop makes it to have been 513 years; for according to him <hi>Sethosis</hi> begun his reign <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3223. (not 3230 as the Doctor would persuade us) and <hi>Sesac</hi> begun his <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3736.</p>
               <p>In the very same Chapter the Doctor will not allow that <hi>AEgyptus</hi> was the same with <hi>Sethosis,</hi> as the Arch-Bishop <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3232 will have him to have been; but <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thosis</hi> was the Son of <hi>AEgyptus,</hi> if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor be in the right. Yet the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that herein he differs from several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as from the Arch-Bishop, and I am apt to think that in making <hi>Sethosis</hi> the Son of <hi>AEgyptus</hi> he is singular; neither <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> nor <hi>Syncellus</hi> hath any cover for this dish, if I may use the Doctors own expression. Yea the Doctor contradicts <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> as well as the Arch-Bishop, for they say that <hi>Armais</hi> was the same with <hi>Danaus,</hi> and <hi>Ramasses</hi> the same with <hi>Egyptus;</hi> but the Doctor supposes <hi>Danaus</hi> and <hi>AEgyptus</hi> to have been other persons, and of another family. As to <hi>Sethosis</hi> the Arch-Bishop transcribes the words of <hi>Manetho ap. Joseph. c. Apion. l.</hi> 1. who says that <hi>Sethosis</hi> was call'd <hi>AEgyptus,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:43633:46"/>
and his brother <hi>Armais Danaus;</hi> who also distinguisheth <hi>Armais</hi> the brother of <hi>Sethosis</hi> from a former <hi>Armais</hi> that reign'd long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 2. s. 2. c.</hi> 1. says that whereas <hi>Josephus Ant. l.</hi> 13. 5. writes that <hi>Jonathan</hi> received the Stole four years after the death of <hi>Judas,</hi> Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censures this as an ofcitancy in him. Thus the Doctor. But I wish he had produc'd the words in which the Arch-Bishop roundly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures it as an oscitancy. Tis true <hi>A. M.</hi> 3852. he calls it an errour, but withall as he tells us what led <hi>Josephus</hi> into that errour, so he makes him so ingenuous as afterwards (viz. <hi>Ant. l. 20. c.</hi> 8.) to retract that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him into it.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43633:47"/>
                  <hi>Part 2. l. 1. c. 18.</hi> declaims most earnestly against the Arch-Bishop, calling it the model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a new Chronology, and asking what <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger, Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Africanus</hi> would have said, if they had heard of this adventure, how (says he) would they have stood amaz'd? In this heat he runs on till he is out of breath, and not content with this he brings in <hi>Is. Uossius</hi> inveighing against the Arch-Bishop in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. At last he begins to think it necessary to give some satisfactory answer to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> on whom the Arch-Bishop relies; and in order to this he prays us to review that which he had written in the Chapter of the <hi>Medes</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the 15 Chapter) foregoing. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> speaks of no Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Deioces,</hi> and says that after their revolt from the <hi>Assyrians</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> governed by their own Laws. Accordingly the Arch-Bishop after <hi>Arbaces,</hi> who deliver'd the <hi>Medes</hi> from the <hi>Assyrian</hi> yoke, so that they were now free to live by their own Laws, mentions no Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Deioces;</hi> see the Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 3257 and 3294. What says the Doctor Chapt. 15. to this? He says that because <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of no <hi>Kings</hi> before <hi>Deioces,</hi> we must not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from thence that there were none, as we must not by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of which <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> speaks, understand a perfect Anarchy, or that during that time they had no Kings at
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43633:47"/>
all; for (says he) this is disproved by the authority of <hi>Ctesias ap. Diodor. Sic.,</hi> who mentions both the names of several Kings, and the years of their reign. And so Chapt. 18. it is noted as one of the Arch-Bishops mistakes, that by <hi>Herodotus's</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he understands a perfect Anarchy. But what if the Doctor himself prove to be mistaken in thinking that the Arch-Bishop intended to conclude that there were no Kings only from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Herodotus's</hi> not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning any? <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes that Rapines and other lawless pranks growing more and more rife among them, some advis'd that they should set over themselves a King, that they might be govern'd by good Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So they were persuaded to submit to Kings, and presently enter'd into consultation about the person whom they should chuse. Thus <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus l. 1. c. 97, 98.</hi> From hence I think we may safely conclude, that according to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> they had no Kings at that time. 'Tis manifest that not only <hi>Vossius Castigat. adc. 10.</hi> but also <hi>Diodorus Sic. l. 2.</hi> did understand <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> thus, that they were without Kings. And as to <hi>Ctesias,</hi> probably the Arch-Bishop saw no reason why his authority should be prefer'd to that of <hi>Herodotus.</hi> This for the <hi>Median</hi> succession; only I must add, that the Doctor makes the Arch-Bishop to shorten it by 167 years, whereas the Arch Bishop makes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43633:48"/>
the duration of it but 130 years shorter then the Doctor himself doth; for from <hi>Arbaces's</hi> freeing the <hi>Medes</hi> from the <hi>Assyrian</hi> yoke to the end of <hi>Astyages's</hi> reign the Arch-Bishop reckons 187 years, and the Doctor reckons only 317.</p>
               <p>We now proceed to the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, to the duration of which (from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the reign of <hi>Ninus</hi> to the death of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>) the Arch-Bishop allots on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 520 years, grounding himself (says the Doctor) upon <hi>Herodotus.</hi> And it is very true, that the Arch-Bishop alledges <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus l. 1. c. 95.</hi> for this, who in express words saith (as the Doctor translates him) that the <hi>Assyrians</hi> holding the sway of the upper <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> some 520 years, the <hi>Medes</hi> were the first that begun to break from them. But then the Arch-Bishop also alledges <hi>Appian</hi> in <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.,</hi> who says that the three greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of the <hi>Assyrians, Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> altogether did scarce make up the summ of 900 years. And what says the Doctor to this? He makes a short answer serve, saying that there is no weight at all in it as to the purpose for which it is vouched. But then he promiseth to give a satisfactory answer to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> in order to which he first sets down the words of <hi>Herodotus</hi> at large both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> then he craves leave to note some mistakes, and at last he will bring the business to account.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:43633:48"/>
               <p>As to the mistakes, the Arch-Bishop is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in two of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the first and the third. The first is, the Arch-Bishop supposes that the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy old expire at the time of the <hi>Medes</hi> defection. The third is, that he supposes that <hi>Herodotus's</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was a perfect Anarchy. To the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which it hath been answer'd already, that the Arch-Bishop is not concern'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> necessarily denotes an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or no, for there are other passages in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> (transcrib'd by me a little above) from which the Arch-Bishop might gather that the <hi>Medes</hi> had no King at that time, and it is the Doctors mistake to think that the Arch-Bishop concluded it from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> only. As to the other mistake imputed to the Arch-Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> the supposing that the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy did expite at the time of the <hi>Medes</hi> defection, I grant that the Arch-Bishop doth suppose this, but deny that it is a mistake, for when, so large a Province as <hi>Media</hi> was revolted from them, the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had not the Monarchy of upper <hi>Asia</hi> as before, especially when <hi>Belesis</hi> had also obtain'd the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But they had still a large Empire or Government, as the Arch-Bishop tells us, making <hi>Ninus</hi> junior to have succeeded <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> in it. And yet the Doctor will prove that the Government was not extinguished, as if the Arch-Bishop had
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43633:49"/>
said that it was; whereas the Arch-Bishop says plainly that the Government was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, thô the Monarchy was.</p>
               <p>And now the Doctor will bring the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to account. He says that <hi>Herodotus's</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> begun about <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3000, and continued 1000 years; and yet when he descends to particulars he accounts but 800 years from the beginning of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the confederacy of <hi>Arbaces</hi> and <hi>Belesis,</hi> and 180 years after it, which two numbers do not make up 1000. But to pass by this, the Doctors meaning is that whereas the Arch-Bishop conceiv'd that the defection of the <hi>Medes</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Herodotus's</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was in the time of <hi>Arbaces,</hi> he should have set it 800 years sooner about <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3000, and so the beginning of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy 520 years before that, <hi>i. e.</hi> about <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2480. Now there will not need any long answer to this, since 1. The Doctor doth not alledge any Author that gives the least intimation of any defection of the <hi>Medes</hi> 800 years before <hi>Arbaces.</hi> 2. No man that reads <hi>Herodotus</hi> can think that he ever as much as dream'd that the <hi>Medes</hi> continu'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the space of 1000 years. 3. These accounts do not agree with the Doctors own Catalogues of the succession of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchs, which he gives us in the beginning and end of this Chapter. From the beginning
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43633:49"/>
of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3000, or thereabouts to the confederacy of <hi>Arbaces</hi> and <hi>Belesis,</hi> he accounts a space of 800 years, but according to his Catalogues there were above 830 years between them. He makes the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy to have begun 520 years before the beginning of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was about <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 3000, so that we must set the beginning of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy about <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2480: now the Founders of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy he makes to have been either <hi>Belus</hi> or <hi>Ninus,</hi> and bids us reckon from either of them, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former Catalogue <hi>Belus</hi> begun his reign <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2378, <hi>Ninus An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2433, according to the later <hi>Belus's</hi> reign begun <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2353 and <hi>Ninus An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2408; now how will any of these accounts agree with the making the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy to begin about <hi>An. Per. Jul.</hi> 2480? Lastly, in this account the duration of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy is made to have been but 520 years and 800 years or three or four years more, in all about 1320 years: but in the former Catalogue the duration of it from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to the death of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> is 1460 years, in the later 1484 years; and from <hi>Ninus</hi> to the death of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> according to both Catalogues, above 1400 years. It seems then that the Doctor hath not brought the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to an exact account. Add that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43633:50"/>
to the Doctor the <hi>Medes</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the time of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> whereas <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Sic. l.</hi> 2. plainly testifies that they were then under the Empire or Dominion of the <hi>Assyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore upon second thoughts in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chapter <hi>s.</hi> 13. the Doctor could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to wave this answer, and pitch upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for which he is beholden to his friend <hi>Vossius, viz.</hi> that <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with, and that he wrote 1500, not 520, as our copies have it. And I coufess that this is a very easie way of answering. If we may at pleasure, without the warrant of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther copy, change 520 into 1500, and 5 generations into 50, and 30 or 35 into 40 (all which the Doctor doth in this Chapter) we need not fear any objection from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any Writer whatsoever. I think that the Doctor had done much better, if he had wav'd both these answers, and either turn'd off <hi>Herodotus</hi> as he doth <hi>Appian,</hi> or rested in that which he says before that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> was <hi>fabellarum pater,</hi> and not to be regarded.</p>

Hereupon <hi>Vossius in Castigat. ad. c. 8.</hi> inveighs against the Arch-Bishop for cutting off at least 8 ages from the time that was from <hi>Ninus</hi> to <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> (making the whole time between them to have been only 496 years) and for omitting all the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Kings from <hi>Ninyas</hi> to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus,</hi> and this without reason or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. To <hi>Herodotus,</hi> whom the Arch-Bishop alledgeth, and who saith that first the <hi>Medes</hi> begun to revolt from the <hi>Assyrians</hi> when they had enjoy'd the Empire of the upper <hi>Asia</hi> 520 years, <hi>Vossius Castigat. ad c. 10.</hi> answers, that he is to be understood thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the Empire of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd 520 years, the <hi>Medes</hi> begun to revolt from them by little and little, and to become
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43633:51"/>
a Nation <hi>sui juris,</hi> yet without Kings; and that <hi>Deioces</hi> was the first that invaded the Tyranny. Also to <hi>Herodotus</hi> he opposes <hi>Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> who begins the Kingdom of the <hi>Medes</hi> not with <hi>Deioces</hi> but <hi>Arbaces,</hi> whom he makes to have possess'd the city <hi>Ninus</hi> and part of <hi>Assyria,</hi> whereas <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> did this a long time after. Thus <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius. Hornius</hi> in his <hi>Defensio c. 31.</hi> asks <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> where he had his <hi>Paulatim,</hi> that the <hi>Medes</hi> did revolt by little and little. Then he alledges <hi>Dionysius Harlicarn. l. 1.</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Empire of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> to the fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times, and says that the <hi>Assyrians</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd a small part of <hi>Asia,</hi> therefore (says <hi>Hornius</hi>) it is false which others write of the vast dominion of <hi>Ninus, Semiramis</hi> and their successors. Also he alledges <hi>Strabo l. 11.</hi> who says that the Antiquities of the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Syrians</hi> do not obtain much credit, because of the fabulousness of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them. <hi>Vossius in Castiga.

Now (says <hi>Vossius</hi>) this is as if any one should say, The <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd all the time before the Olympiads fabulous, therefore the things that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43633:51"/>
are written of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Sampson</hi> are fables. He observes also that <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> relating the opinion of <hi>Herodotus</hi> sets down 500 years (not 520) and adds that he approves of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Marsham's</hi> conjecture that in <hi>Herodotus</hi> we are to read 1500 years instead of 520, as he will have us to read in <hi>Diodor.

Sic.</hi> would not have pass'd over that place in <hi>Herodotus</hi> without a reprehension. <hi>Hornius in Defensionis Auctario Def. 31.</hi> only remarks how prudent <hi>Vossius</hi> was in taking no notice of the place in <hi>Strabo,</hi> and how liberal in add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1000 years to the Annals of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Sic.,</hi> as well as bold in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting two Authors at once. I shall not take upon me to determine whether <hi>Vossius</hi> or <hi>Hornius</hi> have the better in this scuffle; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I observe 1. That <hi>Vossius</hi> not only takes no notice of the place in <hi>Strabo,</hi> but also he takes no notice of <hi>Hornius's</hi> argument from <hi>Dionysius Hal. viz.</hi> this, <hi>Dionysius Hal.</hi> says, that the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had the dominion of a certain small part of <hi>Asia,</hi> and this (as <hi>Hornius</hi> thought) doth not very well agree with that which others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late concerning the vast dominion of <hi>Ninus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> and their successors. And so from <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's</hi> words we may well gather, that no great credit is to be given to the long series or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Assyrian</hi> Kings which some give us. For by <hi>Syrians, Strabo</hi> meant <hi>Assyrians;</hi> so
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43633:52"/>
                  <hi>Herodotus l. 7. c.</hi> 63. tells us that they are by the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd <hi>Syrians,</hi> whom the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> call'd <hi>Assyrians;</hi> and so <hi>Cicero Tuscul. qu. l.</hi> 5. calls <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> whom <hi>De finib. bon. &amp; mal. l.</hi> 2. he calls King of <hi>Assyria;</hi> and so <hi>Justin l. 1. c.</hi> 2. <hi>Assyrii qui postea Syri dicti sunt.</hi> 2. That <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doth not argue in such manner as <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> would persuade us, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Assyrian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was in a fabulous age, therefore it was fabulous, but the argument should have been form'd thus, <hi>Dionysius Hal.</hi> refers the time of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy, or part of it, to the age which is accounted fabulous, tis probable therefore that many things which Heathen Writers say of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Kings, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are fabulous. So that it is an odious comparison which <hi>Vossius</hi> makes, when he speaks of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Sampson;</hi> as if because we are not oblig'd to believe every thing that is deliver'd in profane History, the like may be infer'd concerning the Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. 3. I think that <hi>Hornius</hi> had very good reason to ask <hi>Vossius</hi> where he had his <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latim;</hi> for <hi>Herodotus</hi> only says that the <hi>Medes</hi> begun to revolt, he doth not say that they begun to revolt by little and little (as <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> doth) nor is there any thing in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> which intimates this. There is that which plainly intimates the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that they revolted together; for it follows in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43633:52"/>
                  <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that they gave the <hi>Assyrians</hi> bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and worsted them, which they could not have done, if they had not all joyn'd their force together. 4. When <hi>Vossius in Castigat. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctario ad Effug.</hi> 31. says that the Arch-Bishop relies solely on <hi>Herodotus,</hi> I am tempted to question whether <hi>Vossius</hi> consulted the Arch-Bishop, thô he pretends to confute him; for it is apparent that the Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 2737. alledges <hi>Appian</hi> as well a <hi>Herodotus.</hi> 5. But that which is most strange is still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that any man should have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make such an alteration in the Text of both <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> as <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> doth. He is displeased with the Arch-Bishop for shortning the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy without any Authority (for so he pretends) that he then should take upon him in such sort to correct two Authors at once without the Authority of any Copy either Manuscript or Printed, yea without any Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, is the strangest thing imaginable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this that the 1000 years which <hi>Vossius</hi> adds are not found in <hi>Diodor. Sic.</hi> where he transcribes <hi>Herodotus,</hi> is a stronger argument that they were not in the copies of <hi>Herodotus</hi> which he had, and so not in the ancient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, then any that can be brought to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>It will be said perhaps, that it was not without either reason or authority that <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:43633:53"/>
made this Emendation. As to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Marsham</hi> in his <hi>Diatriba p.</hi> 35. had declar'd his opinion, that in <hi>Herodotus</hi> we are to read 1500 instead of 520. And then for reasons 1. It is plain that there is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the copies either of <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Sic.,</hi> for when the one hath 520 years, the other hath only 500. 2. If <hi>Diodor. Sic.</hi> had found 520 in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> he would not have pass'd it over without a reprehension: thus <hi>Vossius in Castigat. Auctar. ad Effug.</hi> 31. But his principal argument is in his Answer to <hi>Christianus Schotanus,</hi> and it is this; If we read 1500 in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> then he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not with <hi>Ctesias</hi> only, but also with <hi>Dinon, Polybius, Thallus, Alexander Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>histor, Castor, Diodorus Sic., Africanus</hi> and innumerable others.</p>
               <p>To all this I return answer, 1. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> did long since in his <hi>Chronicus Canon p.</hi> 489. in express words retract that which he had written in his <hi>Diatriba</hi> concerning the substituting of 1500 instead of 520, for (says he) it doth not agree with the mind of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus.</hi> 2. As to the first reason, Suppose that there is an errour either in <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Diodor. Sic.,</hi> it doth not follow that there is an errour in both, as <hi>Vossius</hi> will have it. And if a careless <hi>Amanuensis</hi> left out 20 years in transcribing <hi>Diodor. Sic.,</hi> we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thence that several <hi>Amanuenses</hi> should
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43633:53"/>
be so wretchedly careless as to leave out 1000 years, both in <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodor. Sic.</hi> I add that perhaps there is no errour at all, but <hi>Diodor. Sic.</hi> thought it enough to set down the round number 500 years. To the second reason from <hi>Diodor. Sic.</hi> his not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending <hi>Herodotus,</hi> I answer, that it was his business only to report what <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Ctesias</hi> had writ, not to reprehend either of them. In answer to his third and principal reason I only say, that when we have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted 1500 instead of 520 in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> he will not agree so well with the Authors mention'd by <hi>Vossius</hi> as he pretends. <hi>Ctesias ap. Diodor. Sic. l. 2.</hi> will have the duration of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy to have been 1360 years. <hi>Castor ap. Syncell. p. 168.</hi> allots to it <hi>An. 1280. Thallus ap. Theophilum ad Autol. l. 3, &amp; Lactantium l. 1. c.</hi> 23. affirms <hi>Belus</hi> to have been 322 years before the <hi>Trojan</hi> war. <hi>Agathias de Imper. &amp; reb. gest. Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani l.</hi> 2. seems to say that <hi>Alexander Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>histor</hi> writ, that from the beginning of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi> reign that Empire continu'd 1306 years. The same <hi>Agathias</hi> makes <hi>Diodor. Sic.</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with <hi>Ctesias,</hi> thô in our copies of <hi>Diod. Sic.</hi> he differs from him, saying that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd more then 1400 years. <hi>Afrioanus</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Helvicus</hi> and <hi>Ricciolius</hi> allows 1484 years to the duration of it, but according to <hi>Syncellus</hi> only 1460. Now suppose that we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43633:54"/>
ought to substitute 1500 instead of 520, how would <hi>Herodotus</hi> still agree with these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who do not agree among themselves, and who do not (any of them) come up to 1500 years? As to <hi>Dinon</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> I know not where it is that they speak of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empires duration, and as for <hi>Vossius's innumerable others,</hi> I do not know who they are. I conclude then, that there is neither reason nor Authority to warrant such an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must not forget to take notice, that <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> opposes <hi>Ctesias</hi> to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and yet at the same time, wholly destroys <hi>Ctesias's</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in that which he writes concerning the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy, for (says <hi>Vossius Castigat. in c. 10.</hi>) thô very much is attributed to his authority in the <hi>Persian</hi> affairs, yet he is a most lying Writer in other things. Besides, the instances which <hi>Vossius</hi> gives of <hi>Ctesias's</hi> dissenting from <hi>Herodotus</hi> do concern the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Medes,</hi> not the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire of which we speak.</p>
               <p>I shall only add, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Gregory</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us of a Chronological Abstract in <hi>MS,</hi> which makes <hi>Thourias</hi> (who was also call'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>) to have succeeded <hi>Ninus,</hi> and after that <hi>Thourias</hi> he placeth <hi>Lames,</hi> and then <hi>Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus.</hi> This <hi>Thourias</hi> or <hi>Ares</hi> (as the said M <hi>Gregory</hi> acquaints us) is suppos'd to be the same with him whom <hi>Africanus</hi> calls <hi>Arius.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the study of Astronomy, whether it be as ancient as <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Observations sent into <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Aristotle's</hi> procurement.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>VOssius Castigat. ad c.</hi> 10. says, that it is very absurd to think that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Stars is as ancient as <hi>Nimrod.</hi> For (says he) <hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were the first that were skill'd in that science. Of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Berosus</hi> testifies that he was expert in it, and <hi>Eupolemus</hi> that he was, the Inventer of it. And <hi>Philo L. de Nobilitate</hi> witnesses ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clearly concerning both. The Arch-Bishop <hi>A. M.</hi> 1771. gathers from <hi>Porphyry ap. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicium l. 2. de caelo,</hi> that this science is as ancient as <hi>Nimrod. Porphyry</hi> says that when <hi>Alexander</hi> had taken <hi>Babylon, Calisthenes</hi> sent from thence into <hi>Greece</hi> Astronomical obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of 1903 years. Now (says the Arch-Bishop) from the time of <hi>Nimrod</hi> (which was 115 years after the Floud) to <hi>Alexanders</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:43633:55"/>
taking <hi>Babylon,</hi> were 1903 years, and so the <hi>Babylonians</hi> begun to make their Astronomical observations in the time of <hi>Nimrod.</hi> To this what says <hi>Vossius?</hi> He denies that <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> could begin to reign so soon as in the 115 year after the Floud. He says that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of those 1903 years was almost 1000 years later then the Floud, in the 124 year of <hi>Terah,</hi> Thus <hi>Vossius. Hornius in Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione, Disserta. Def.</hi> 24. answers, that <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> only saith that <hi>Abraham</hi> was skill'd in the knowledge of the heavenly bodies, and that it doth not follow from thence that he was the Inventer of it, since he might learn his skill from the <hi>Chaldeans. Eupolemus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, says, that he was the Inventer of it, but (says <hi>Hornius</hi>) he brings no Authority for the confirming his assertion. As to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Hornius</hi> says that he favour'd his cause and Nation. He adds that the knowledge of Astronomy was before the Floud, and was deliver'd by <hi>Ham</hi> to <hi>Chus</hi> and <hi>Nimrod.</hi> And in his <hi>Dissertation de AEtate Mundi c.</hi> 10. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> to shew that <hi>Nimrod</hi> might begin his reign <hi>An.</hi> 115. after the Floud, supposes that <hi>Chus</hi> was born in the first or second year after it, and that at the age of 35 he might beget <hi>Nimrod. Vossius in Castigat. Auctor. Effug.</hi> 24. replies that <hi>Abraham</hi> could not learn Astronomy of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> for there were no <hi>Chaldeans</hi> at that time. And he tells <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43633:55"/>
that he is very absurd in making <hi>Ham, Chus</hi> and <hi>Nimrod</hi> to have been Astronomers, when he will not allow that <hi>Abraham</hi> was skill'd in that science. As to <hi>Eupolemus, Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> says that he did not ascribe the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Astronomy to <hi>Abraham</hi> without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for <hi>Berosus</hi> and the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> had said almost the same before him, adding that <hi>Philo, Josephus,</hi> and many of the Fathers do also confirm it. Finally <hi>Hornius in Auctario Defens.</hi> brings the Testimony of <hi>Alexander Polyhistor ap. Euseb. de Praeparat. l. 9.</hi> who ascribes the invention of Astronomy to <hi>Enoch,</hi> as also of <hi>Josephus,</hi> saying that Astronomy and Geometry were invented before the Floud. And he tells <hi>Vossius,</hi> that <hi>Kircher</hi> had prov'd that <hi>Ham, Chus</hi> and <hi>Nimrod</hi> were skill'd in Astronomy by as good Testimonies, as he had produc'd to prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Inventer of it. Thus far <hi>Vossius</hi> and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall only observe a few particulars, as 1. <hi>Vossius</hi> says that it could not be that <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> should begin his reign <hi>An.</hi> 115. after the Floud, but offers no reason why it could not be; nor yet doth he give any answer to that which <hi>Hornius</hi> had said to make out the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of it. 2. When <hi>Vossius</hi> says that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> could not learn Astronomy of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> for there were no <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in his time, he meerly trifles; for <hi>Hornius in Dissertat.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43633:56"/>
de aetate Mundi c.</hi> 10. had plainly declar'd, that by <hi>Chaldeans</hi> he meant <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and would not contend about Names. 3. When <hi>Vossius</hi> says that the beginning of the 1903 years was almost 1000 years after the Floud, in the 124 year of <hi>Terah;</hi> he insinuates that the 124 of <hi>Terah</hi> was also almost 1000 years after the Floud. Now this will in no wise agree with his <hi>Chronologia sacra,</hi> for according to that neither the beginning of the 1903 years, nor the 124 year of <hi>Terah</hi> can be said to have been almost 1000 after the Floud, for both of them were above 1000 years after it. The 124 of <hi>Terah</hi> in that Chronology is made to have been 1186 years after the Floud, and the beginning of the 1903 years (counting backward from <hi>Alexanders</hi> taking <hi>Babylon</hi>) must be according to that Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy about 1259 years later then the Floud. So that thô <hi>Vossius</hi> disputing against the Arch-Bishop, will have the beginning of the 1903 years to have been in the 124 year of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> yet in his Chronology he makes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of those years about 73 years later then that year of <hi>Terah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is most necessary is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Authorities produc'd by <hi>Vossius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Arch-Bishop, which I shall do brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The first is <hi>Berosus,</hi> who says, that in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> generation after the Floud, there was among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> a just and great man,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43633:56"/>
that was expert in the knowledge of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies; thus <hi>Josephus</hi> alledges him <hi>Ant. l. 1. c.</hi> 8. believing that the just and great man, of whom <hi>Berosus</hi> speaks, was <hi>Abraham.</hi> Another of <hi>Vossius's</hi> witnesses is <hi>Philo de Nobilitate,</hi> who says, that the Father of the <hi>Jews</hi> was a <hi>Chaldean</hi> by Nation, born of a Father that was skill'd in Astronomy; so that <hi>Philo</hi> testifies of <hi>Terah Abrahams</hi> Father, that he was skill'd in that Science; but that he doth there witness the same of <hi>Abraham</hi> (as <hi>Vossius</hi> pretends) I do not find: yet <hi>Vossius</hi> might have cited other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which he doth, as <hi>l. de Gigantibus</hi> and <hi>l. de Abrahamo. Josephus</hi> is alledg'd also, who <hi>l. 1. c. 9.</hi> says, that <hi>Abraham</hi> taught the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> Astronomy. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and many of the Fathers, are also call'd in as witnesses, <hi>Vossius</hi> says that the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> confess, that they learn'd Astronomy of the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> but as to the Fathers, he tells us not either what Fathers should testifie any thing, or where they should do it. Yet I freely grant, that some of the Fathers say as much as some of his witnesses do, as S. <hi>Basil in Isa. 13.</hi> who ascribes the invention of this science to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and S. <hi>Greg. Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen Orat. 3.</hi> who attributes it to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians.</hi> But now what do all these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies make to <hi>Vossius's</hi> purpose, who should prove that <hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were the first
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43633:57"/>
Inventers of Astronomy, or the first that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and taught it? Some say that <hi>Abraham</hi> had the knowledge of Astronomy, and one adds that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> learn'd it of him; as another saith, that <hi>Terah</hi> was skill'd in this science; but none of them say that <hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were the first Inventers of it. Indeed <hi>Eupolemus ap. Euseb. de Praeparat. l. 9. c. 17</hi> very plainly testifies that <hi>Abraham</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Astronomy, and instructed the <hi>Phani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> in that Science; but as he is but a single witness, so he withal affirms that <hi>Enoch</hi> was the first Inventer of it, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Greeks</hi> attribute the invention of it to <hi>Atlas, Eupolemus</hi> informs us that <hi>Atlas</hi> was <hi>Enoch.</hi> This concerning <hi>Enoch</hi> is confirm'd by the Testimony of <hi>Alexander Polyhistor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovemention'd, and of <hi>Josephus l. 1. c. 3.</hi>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43633:57"/>
is false. For (says he) according to the Arch-Bishops computation, the beginning of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Empire was <hi>A.

He adds that this <hi>Constantinus Manasses</hi> makes that <hi>Abimelech,</hi> which fell in love with <hi>Sarah Abrahams</hi> wife, to have been the first King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> how then (says he) can the Arch-Bishop prove from him that the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> begun almost two Ages before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi> Further, whereas that <hi>Constantine</hi> writes that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Empire continu'd 1663 years, the Arch-Bishop errs in referring the end of that Empire to the reign of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Kings did reign after <hi>Cambyses</hi> to the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. Now let the time from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> be computed, and the number of the years, according to the computation of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> will be found to agree with that which <hi>Constantine</hi> mentions. <hi>Eusebius</hi> makes the destruction of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Empire to have happened 1666 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Abraham. Hornius in Defensio. 30.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, that the Arch-Bishops computation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43633:58"/>
doth not rely solely upon the Authority of that <hi>Constantine,</hi> but also upon this, that <hi>Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim</hi> lead Colonies into <hi>Egypt</hi> about the time, when according to the Arch-Bishops calculation, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Empire did begin. He asks why <hi>Egypt</hi> is call'd the land of <hi>Mizraim,</hi> if the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Empire was not founded by him. He tells <hi>Vossius</hi> that his Father did not judge <hi>Constantinus Manasses</hi> to be a despicable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that in <hi>Janus Douza</hi> his account his <hi>Chronica</hi> are <hi>accuratissima</hi> (not <hi>putidissima.</hi>) He adds that the end of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is by the Arch-Bishop rightly refer'd to <hi>Cambyses,</hi> for thô the <hi>Egyptians</hi> rebell'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they were presently subdu'd together with their Kings. And whereas <hi>Vossius</hi> speaks of the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, he says that <hi>Ochus</hi> recover'd <hi>Egypt</hi> 13 years before that <hi>Alexander</hi> was King of <hi>Macedonia. Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius in Castigat. Auctar. ad Effug. 30.</hi> says that Eight <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings reign'd successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the time of <hi>Cambyses</hi> (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> and others testifie) and that <hi>Alexander</hi> was Seven years old when <hi>Ochus</hi> recover'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that <hi>Eusebius An. 1666</hi> hath these words <hi>AEgyptiorum regnum destructum. Hornius in Defens. Auctar. Def. 30.</hi> says, that when we speak of the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, we understand the time of his reign, or after that he came to be King. When he was a boy of the age of Seven years, he was not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43633:58"/>
the Great. Thus this matter was debated betwixt <hi>Vossius</hi> and <hi>Hornius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall only remark 1. That <hi>Hornius</hi> hath rightly observ'd, that the Arch-Bishop was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to refer the beginning of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Empire to the time of <hi>Mizraim,</hi> not only by the Authority of <hi>Constant. Manasses,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by that (which <hi>Vossius</hi> says that he never deni'd) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Mizraim</hi> was the Founder of that Empire. 2. That I do not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a necessary consequence, because <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> reckons 1666 years from <hi>Abraham</hi> to the end of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Empire, and <hi>Constant. Manasses</hi> reckons 1663 years from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Empire to the end of it, that therefore <hi>Constant. Manasses</hi> makes it to have begun in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to have ended at the time when <hi>Eusebius</hi> says that it was destroy'd. 3. It is manifest that <hi>Constant. Manasses</hi> makes the Kingdom of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to have begun before <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, for he says that it begun when there were only Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven generations after the Floud, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him it begun before the time of <hi>Serug,</hi> for he says that <hi>Serug</hi> was the Eight after the Floud. In like manner he says that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Belus</hi> were not many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after the beginning of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and doth not this plainly imply that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was some generations after it: 4. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43633:59"/>
sufficiently admire that <hi>Vossius</hi> should make <hi>Constant. Manasses</hi> to say, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> who fell in love with <hi>Sarah,</hi> was the first King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereas he only saith that he was King at the time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there. It is true, that he hath these words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: but 1. it is 9 or 10 verses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his mentioning <hi>Abimelech</hi> that he hath these words, 2. His meaning in them is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that a King was first in <hi>Egypt.</hi> That this is the sense of the words is manifest, for they are a repetition of that which he had said plainly before, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the first that were governed by Kings, and paid tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. And as some proof of this, he tells us that <hi>Abraham</hi> found a King in <hi>Egypt</hi> when he came thither, whereas the foundation of the Kingdom of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> was first laid in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> time by <hi>Belus,</hi> so that there were Kings in <hi>Egypt</hi> before the Founding the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Empire. <hi>Vossius</hi> therefore did strangely mistake the meaning of <hi>Constant. Manasses.</hi> 5. If according to <hi>Constant. Manasses</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> begun some generations before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and continued only 1663 years, then (whether we follow <hi>Eusebius's</hi> account, or <hi>Vossius's</hi> own in his <hi>Chronologia sacra</hi>) according to him the end of it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the birth of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the time that <hi>Vossius's</hi> Eight <hi>Egyptian</hi>

Kings after <hi>Cambyses</hi> reign'd, is computed to have been not much above 60 years, so that <hi>Hornius</hi> did not erre very much in saying, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were presently subdued with their Kings.</p>

                  <hi>VOssius</hi> in his Epistle Dedicatory to <hi>Slinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landius</hi> prefix'd to his Castigations of <hi>Hornius,</hi> says, that the Arch-Bishop in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise concerning the Version of the LXX doth endeavour to shew, that the true Translation of the LXX lay hid in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, not read and transcrib'd by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and at last perish'd in the fire which consum'd the Library it self. Thus <hi>Vossius.</hi> Now it is not doubted (as I suppose) but that the Original copy was laid up in the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> Library, and was consum'd there toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Library it self: so that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing in Question is, whether <hi>Vossius</hi> doth affirm truly that the Arch-Bishop endeavours to shew that it so lay hid in that Library, as that it was not read or transcrib'd by any person. To which I say that the Arch-Bishop is so far from endeavouring to shew this, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43633:60"/>
contrariwise he says plainly, that some Copies of that Translation were extant in the hands of private persons after that <hi>Philadelphus's</hi> Library was burnt, in the former <hi>Alexandrian</hi> War; which could not be, if that Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had lain hid so as that it was not seen or transcrib'd by any. I shall produce the Arch-Bishops own words <hi>Licet in privatorum manibus (post incensam priori bello</hi> Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Philadelphi <hi>Bibliothecam) veteris illius</hi> LXX <hi>Seniorum Versionis adhuc exempla extarent;</hi> so the Arch-Bishop <hi>De Editione</hi> LXX <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> c. 3.

                  </gap>, it may as well be rendred the 14 of the Moon, as the 14 of the Month. Thus far the Doctors own words. Now what shall we say to all this? 1. The Doctor affirms that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Moon, and would have it Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so; and yet in his Quotations there is not one word to prove that it hath this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and I believe that if he consult all the <hi>Lexicons</hi> that are extant, he will not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43633:61"/>
find one that saith that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth signifie the Moon in all the Old Testament. I grant that in one place of the <hi>Talmud Buxtorf</hi> makes it to have this signification, as also our most diligent D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Castell</hi> transcribing it out of him; but I do not find the words alledg'd by <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> in the place that he directs us to, and perhaps it is not necessary to translate those words so as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath translated them: however the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath not this signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication any where in Sacred Writ. 2. It may also be question'd whether it signifie the New Moon, thô most Expositors do give it this signification. I readily subscribe to the two significations which <hi>Kimchi</hi> mentions in his <hi>Radices</hi> and in his <hi>Comment.</hi> upon <hi>Psal. 81. 3. viz.</hi> that it signifies sometimes the first day of the Month, sometimes the whole Month; but when he gives this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the first day of the Month is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because the Moon is renew'd in it, I cannot so easily assent to him, but should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say because the Month is renew'd then. The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Kimchi's</hi> time and long before used Lunar Months, and so with them the Moon was renew'd constantly on the first day of the Month, and this gave the <hi>Jewish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and particularly <hi>Kimchi</hi> occasion to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the first day of the Month is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because the Moon is renew'd then; and this induced others to translate it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43633:62"/>
the New Moon. But there is no necessity of translating it so, and I humbly conceive that it was much better, if in all the places where our Translators have the New Moon, we instead thereof read The first day of the Month, or The beginning of the Month, or the New Month. The <hi>Syriac</hi> hath rendred it The beginning of the Month in most of those places, as the <hi>Arabick</hi> also doth in some of them, and the <hi>Targum</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 31. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8. 13. 31. 3. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 23. <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> also in his <hi>Radices</hi> directs us to render it The first day of the Month 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 5, 18. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 3. But the Doctor insists upon the Authority of the LXX who translate it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and he supposes that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> always signifies the New Moon. But why may we not translate <gap reason="foreign">

And there seems to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good reason, why we should admit it and prefer it before the other, and believe that God would not once name the New Moon, and then surely he would not enjoyn it to be observ'd as a day of gladness and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day, and that peculiar Sacrifices should be offered upon it, least occasion should be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43633:63"/>
given to a people prone to Idolatry to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Moon as other Nations did. There is a remarkable passage in <hi>Origen. Homil. 23. in Numer. Quid religioni conducit novae Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> i. e. <hi>cum conjungitur Soli &amp; adhaeret ei, observare festivitatem? Haec, si secundum lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram considerentur, non tam religiosa quam su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitioja videbuntur. Origen</hi> could not be lieve that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were commanded to observe the New Moons according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it approach'd too near the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition or Idolatry of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moon; and therefore he interpreted the command in a Spiritual sense: But if we read (not The New Moons but) The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Months, there will be nothing to induce any man to believe that God enjoyn'd the observation of the New Moon. Besides it seems very reasonable that all the Texts, in which according to our Translations there is mention of the New Moon, should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by that Primitive Original Ordinance or Statute, which is recorded <hi>Numb. 10. 10.</hi> and 28. 11. Here they are enjoyn'd to blow the Trumpet over their burnt-offerings, and the Sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and to offer two <hi>Bullocks,</hi> one <hi>Ram,</hi> and seven <hi>Lambs</hi> in the beginnings of their Months; there is not a word of the New Moons: and thus I humbly conceive it ought to be in all those other places.</p>

               <p>THE Doctor <hi>Part 2. l. 2. s. 1. c. 7.</hi> speaks of an Assembly of Holy and Wise men, which had the name of the Great Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, which did immediately come after the times of the Prophets, as is testifi'd in <hi>Pirke Aboth.</hi> S. <hi>Jerom</hi> stiles them the 24 El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43633:64"/>
24 Senes, <hi>in praefat. ad Esran. Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> might be one of the times perhaps, one of the Society; but for the saying of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were of this number, and <hi>Ezra</hi> the head of this Assembly, I count it a very fable. These are the Doctors words in the forequo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chapter <hi>s.</hi> 2. And in the same section he saith, that the compiling or digesting or (as he expresseth it <hi>s.</hi> 1.) the bringing the whole body of Scripture and parts of it into a congruous disposition or frame, so to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same more intelligible and plain, was the work of this Assembly of Holy and Wise men. He adds <hi>s.</hi> 3. that he believes that this work was directed and assisted by the Spirit of God, and <hi>s.</hi> 4. that this work was perfected about the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Now if we would know what it is that the Doctor aims at in all this, he himself tells us in the following sections. In short he would have the Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> 6 Chapters in <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and a great part of two Chapters in <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to have been written by these Holy and Wise men of the Great Synagogue. As to the Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> he is very positive, I do account (says he) that from <hi>Neh.</hi> 11. 3. to <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 27. all is of this kind <hi>s. 5. i. e.</hi> inserted by the men of the Great Synagogue. He is no less positive <hi>s.</hi> 7. as to the second of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> To me (says he) it appears,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43633:64"/>
that the Writer or Digester of this Book liv'd after <hi>Ezra's</hi> time. If he had said only The Digester of it, we should have taken the less notice of it; but when he saith The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Digester, we see plainly what he would be at. It is true, he is not positive as to the Six Chapters in <hi>Ezra;</hi> but <hi>s.</hi> 7. he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions whether they were the writing of <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> or no (thô he grants, that it is evident that all the Chapters after the Sixth were his writing) and signifies plainly enough, that his own opinion was that they were not.</p>
               <p>Now this seems to be a very bold stroke, and of dangerous consequence, that any man should go about to persuade the world, that the Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and also a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> were not writ till after their death. If I may use the Doctors own words, What would <hi>Scaliger</hi> have said to this? How would he have stood amaz'd! He that was so much displeased with the <hi>German</hi> Divines, who would make only some part of one Chapter in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> not to have been his writing, but the insertion of a later hand, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have much more dislik'd such a bold attempt as this is. But he would have been more highly inrag'd, when he had found, that nothing is offer'd which looks like an argument to make it probable, that the Writers of the foresaid Books or parts of Scripture liv'd later then <hi>Ezra</hi> or <hi>Nehemiahs</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43633:65"/>
               <p>The Doctor saith that it is evident, that the two first verses of the Book of <hi>Ezra</hi> are the very same word for word, with the two last of the second Book of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> But every one sees, what a strange or rather wild consequence this is, Because the two first ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Book of <hi>Ezra</hi> are the same with the two last of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> therefore Six whole Chapters in <hi>Ezra</hi> were the writing of one that liv'd later then <hi>Ezra.</hi> Withal how appears it, that the Writer or Digester of the second Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> liv'd after <hi>Ezra?</hi> That (says the Doctor) may be gathered from <hi>1 Chron. 3. 17.</hi> to the end of the Chapter. But surely it cannot be gather'd from <hi>1 Chron. 3. 17, &amp;c.</hi> that the Writer or Digester of the second Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> liv'd after <hi>Ezra,</hi> unless it can be gather'd thence, that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Digester of the first Book of <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> liv'd later then he. It must then be the Doctors meaning, that the Writer or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gester of both the Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> liv'd after <hi>Ezra's</hi> time. It remains then that we examine what force there is in <hi>1 Chron. 3. 17, &amp;c.</hi> to evince this.</p>
               <p>The Doctor saith that <hi>1 Cbron, 3. 17.</hi> to the end of the Chapter, mention is made of Eight generations in descent from <hi>Salathiel,</hi> that must needs imply an extension of time beyond that of <hi>Ezra.</hi> He brings also a Note of the Assembly of Divines to confirm this.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43633:65"/>
As to which Note it will suffice to observe 1. That whereas the Doctor saith Eight ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, they in that Note express themselves more cautiously, saying only Many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for it is not clear how many they were. 2. In it they take for granted that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations mention'd <hi>1 Chron. 3.</hi> extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the days of <hi>Ezra,</hi> when as they should have prov'd it. 3. In that very Note they are manifestly against the Doctor, shewing plainly that it cannot be gather'd from the mention of some generations, which (as they suppose) were after <hi>Ezra,</hi> that the Writer or Digester of the Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> liv'd after his time; for (say they) <hi>Ezra</hi> might by a Prophetical Spirit set them down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand. Besides it appears from those words, that they inclin'd to think that <hi>Ezra</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was the Writer of these Books. But it may be said, that the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing do make altogether for the Doctor; for they say that some other Prophet after <hi>Ezra's</hi> death might add them. To which I reply, that there is no agreement at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Doctor, for 1. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor says positively, that it appears to him that the Writer or Digester of these Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> liv'd after <hi>Ezra's</hi> time; they say only, that some Prophet after <hi>Ezra's</hi> death might add some generations at the end of the third Chapter of the first Book. 2. They
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43633:66"/>
say, that some Prophet after <hi>Ezra's</hi> death might add them, as the death and burial of <hi>Moses</hi> is added to his last Book, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. Thus they. As then it cannot be concluded from the addition of the death and burial of <hi>Moses Deut.</hi> 34, that the rest of the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> was not written by <hi>Moses:</hi> so it cannot be gathered from the addition of a generation or, two 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3, that the rest of the Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> was not writ by <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3. The mention of adding them after <hi>Ezra's</hi> death implies, that the Books to which they were added were writ before his death. This Note then clearly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws that for which it is alledg'd by the Doctor.</p>
               <p>As to the Book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Doctor further hints that in the Preface of the Seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Compilers mark is visible. Thus the Doctor <hi>s.</hi> 8. As if it was visible and apparent from these words <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 1. <hi>After these things,</hi> that we owe all the Six Chapters foregoing, not to <hi>Ezra</hi> himself, but the Compiler. Or as if <hi>Ezra</hi> having in the Six former Chapters dispatched the History of <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> &amp;c. and now passing to that of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> from whom he receiv'd his Commission, might not use this note of connexion <hi>Now after these things.</hi> How frequently do these words occur, as in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43633:66"/>
the History of the Old and New Testament, so in all other Histories whatsoever?</p>
               <p>As to the Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Doctor offers nothing at all that can tend to prove, that so great a part of it, as from <hi>Neh.</hi> 11. 3. to <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 27. is not his own hand-writing, but the adjection of another hand.</p>
               <p>Now to return to the men of the Great Synagogue. The Doctor says <hi>s.</hi> 2. that S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> calls them the 24 Elders. But thô the Doctor is guilty of several very great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy mistakes, yet I think there is scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in which he hath erred more strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then in this. For there is not the least mention of the Great Synagogue in all that Preface of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to the Book of <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> which the Doctor alledgeth. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is speaking of Canonical and Apocryphal Books, and by his 24 Elders we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the 24 Canonical Books of the Old Testament. This will be made clear, if we compare the words in that Preface to <hi>Ezra,</hi> with a passage in his <hi>Prologo Galeato</hi> or <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. in librum Regum,</hi> as also in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. In his <hi>Prolog. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat.</hi> having spoken of the 24 Books of the Old Testament, he immediately adds <hi>Quos sub numero 24 Seniorum Apocalypsis Joannis indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, adorantes agnum, &amp; coronas suas prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43633:67"/>
vultibus offerentes,</hi> &amp;c. In his <hi>Comment.</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. he hath these words, <hi>Vel 24 libri veteris Instrumenti debent accipi, qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebant citharas in Apocalypsi Joannis, &amp; coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas in capitibus suis.</hi> Now please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with these the words in <hi>Praefat. in Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</hi> which the Doctor refers to. I shall transcribe them at large. <hi>Nec quenquam mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat</hi> (says he) <hi>quod unus à nobis liber editus est, nec Apocryphorum tertii &amp; quarti libri somniis delectetur, quia apud Hebraeos Esdrae Neemiaeque sermones in unum volumen coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantur, &amp; quae non habentur apud illos, nec de 24 Senibus sunt, procul abjicienda.</hi> I hope it is now plain, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath no respect to the men of the Great Synagogue, but to the 24 Elders in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> whom he interprets to be the 24 Canonical Books of the Old Testament. And his meaning in those words, <hi>Nec de. 24. Senibus sunt, procul abjicienda</hi> is, that they which are not of those 24 Books are to be rejected as Apocryphal. Add hereto, that they reckon 12 as the heads and chief of the men of that Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, but I do not find that any of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Writers reduce the whole number of them to 24. They usually make them to have been 120, but in <hi>Cozri Part</hi> 3. it is said, that they were not numbred, or could not be numbred for multitude.</p>
               <p>The Doctor further saith <hi>s.</hi> 2. that for the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43633:67"/>
saying of the later <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> were of this number, and <hi>Ezra</hi> the Head of this Assembly, he accounts it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fable. To which I shall only say, 1. He may account so of it if he pleases, for there want not those who account the whole story concerning the Great Synagogue to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they think that the <hi>Jews</hi> feign'd that there was such an Assembly, that they might father their Traditions upon it. But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will not allow of this, for it overthrows a great part of that which he saith in this and some other Chapters. 2. No man (as far as I know) requires it to be believ'd as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth. For though some eminent <hi>Jewish</hi> Writers (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> in his Preface to his Book <hi>Iad,</hi> and in his Preface to <hi>Seder Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim</hi> set forth by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Pocock,</hi> with others) do affirm, that <hi>Haggai, Zachary</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe were of this number, yet there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some that make no mention of them, but name others in their stead (see <hi>R. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ben David</hi> in his <hi>Cabala</hi>) yea in <hi>Cozri Part 3. Haggai, Zachary</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainly to be distinguish'd from the men of the Great Synagogue. 3. The Doctor gives no reason why he doth account it a very Fable; perhaps then the great reason is, because it will not suit with his Hypothesis. And this may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for answer to that which the Doctor saith concerning the men of the Great Synagogue.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:43633:68"/>
               <p>To conclude, This Defence of Arch-Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> is a further confirmation of the truth of that which I asserted in the Introduction, <hi>viz.</hi> The uncertainty of the greatest part of Chronology: When these two great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in Chronology D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Is. Vossius</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who express so great assurance in their Writings, and insult so much over the Arch-Bishop and others, are upon examination found to be guilty of very great mistakes, and to have proceeded upon as uncertain grounds as others had done before them. And yet D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hath entertain'd so high an opinion of his own performance, that in his Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, he told King <hi>Charles</hi> the second, that his Chronology speaks the truth (haply) better then any whatsoever of late days, and in our Climate, hath been found to do. A little before he had said that his Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is a kind of Clock, and so though seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of late days and in our Climate too have pretended to the Art of Clockmaking or Clockmending, the Doctor hath outdone them all, his Clock <hi>speaks the truth (haply) better then any of theirs whatsoever.</hi> So that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there will be no need of a <hi>Scaliger de Emendatione Temporum,</hi> or a <hi>Lydiats Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio Temporum.</hi> In the same Epistle he also told King <hi>Charles</hi> that it had been under the Hammer and the File for many years; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he spake the truth in it, and am
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43633:68"/>
sorry that he laid out so much time as well as pains in an unprofitable Study, neglecting that to which his Function did oblige him, <hi>viz.</hi> the fitting himself rightly to understand and interpret the Scriptures. That he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this, is too apparent from the strange interpretations that he gives of sundry passages in Sacred Writ. I wish that all may be warn'd by his example, that so much pains and so many precious hours may not be thrown away hereafter upon Chronological Niceties.</p>
