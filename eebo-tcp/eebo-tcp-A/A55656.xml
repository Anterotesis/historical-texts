            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To be Humbly Repreſented to the Right Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> the Lords Spiritual &amp; Temporal in <hi>Parliament</hi> Aſſembled, For their Lordſhips Ordering, the Hearing and Determining of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Appeals after the Receſs of this Parliament, as are now Depending before their Lordſhips, and cannot be Determin'd this preſent Seſsion, ſubject to a review in Parliament if Cauſe.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>Parliament</hi> held in the <hi>3d.</hi> year of <hi>Henry,</hi> V. a Complaint againſt the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> for Claiming Free Warren in other Mens Grounds; was Repreſented by the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords;</hi> whereunto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>That the</hi> Chancellour <hi>and</hi> Juſtices <hi>of both Benches, ſhould have full Power to do therein, as to Them ſhould ſeem Juſt,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Roll of that year, Number 28.</p>
            <p>Upon the like Complaint, of one <hi>John Bramton,</hi> againſt a Fraudulent Recovery of Two Manors; It was pray'd that the <hi>King</hi> would Grant that the <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the time being, might by the Authority of <hi>Parliament,</hi> have power to Hear and Determin the Matter; Whereto, the Anſwer was, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> John Bramton <hi>ſhould have</hi> a Commiſſion to that purpoſe, as appears by the <hi>Parliament</hi> Roll of the ſaid <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> V. Number 45.</p>
            <p>The like was done, upon the Complaint of <hi>Tutbury</hi> and <hi>Sharp,</hi> touching a Ship that was loſt; the Anſwer was, <hi>That the</hi> Chancellour, <hi>with the Advice of Three of the</hi> Juſtices, <hi>ſhould have power to take Order therein;</hi> as appears by the Roll of the ſame <hi>Parliament,</hi> Number 49.</p>
            <p>Upon the like Complaint of one <hi>Whittington</hi> and his Son, againſt a Releaſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Dureſs; <hi>It was referred to be Determin'd by the</hi> King's <hi>Privy-Council;</hi> as appears by the <hi>Parliament</hi> Roll of the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> V. Number 15.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. It was Enacted, <hi>That all ſuch Petitions, as ſhould not be ended in that Parliment, ſhould be committed to the Council to be Determined;</hi> as appears by the Roll of that year, Number 15.</p>
            <p>The like was done, in the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. as appears by that <hi>Parliament</hi> Roll, Number 45. And in the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. as alſo appears by the <hi>Parliament</hi> Roll of that year, Number 69.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Journals</hi> of the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> of the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1624, which was in the <hi>22d.</hi> year of King <hi>James</hi> I. It appears, that upon the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>William Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews,</hi> againſt a Decree in <hi>Chancery,</hi> obtained by <hi>George Mathews;</hi> The <hi>Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> appointed to examin the Cauſe, being of Opinion the Decree was to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, made Their Report; <hi>That there was due to the ſaid</hi> William, <hi>from the ſaid</hi> George, <hi>the Sum of</hi> 5260<hi>l.</hi> Whereupon, in the Afternoon of the ſame day, <hi>George Mathews</hi> Petitioned the <hi>Lords</hi> againſt the Reverſing the Decree upon <hi>Petition</hi> only, Alledging, that it had been the courſe of that <hi>Houſe,</hi> not to Reverſe Decrees, but by Bill Legally Exhibited.</p>
            <p>Upon Reading of which <hi>Petition,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Lords</hi> were appointed to frame an Order in that Cauſe, the <hi>Parliament</hi> being then drawing near to an end: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon They made an Order, and Reported it to the <hi>Houſe</hi> the next day, that the ſaid Cauſe ſhould be Review'd in <hi>Chancery</hi> by the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> aſſiſted by ſuch of the <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> as ſhould be nominated by the <hi>Houſe;</hi> And by any two of the <hi>Judges,</hi> that the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> ſhould name; And that the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> ſhould be an humble Suiter to the <hi>King</hi> from the <hi>Houſe,</hi> for a Commiſſion to himſelf, and the <hi>Lords</hi> that ſhould be nam'd by the <hi>Houſe</hi> for the ſaid Review, and final Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Cauſe, as to Them ſhould ſeem Juſt and Equal; Which Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Read, the <hi>Houſe</hi> approved thereof, and named two <hi>Earls,</hi> two <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and two <hi>Barons,</hi> to be joyned in Commiſſion with the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> for the purpoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And by Virtue of which Order, the Cauſe was Heard and Determined, and the firſt Decree Revers'd; As appear'd by the <hi>Regiſter's</hi> Book of Orders in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term following.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons for Imitation of theſe <hi>Preſidents</hi> at this time amongſt many more, that might be ſhew'd, are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> For that there are ſeveral <hi>Appeals</hi> in Cauſes of conſiderable value, that are not likely to be Determined this Seſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that the ſhorteſt delay of Juſtice is grievous to thoſe that want it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If any Man hath gotten any Money, or meſne profits of any Eſtate, by means of a miſtaken Decree; He that hath ſo got it, may be dead, without aſſets, or become inſolvent before the next Seſſion, or meeting of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> And if ſo, no Reſtitution can ever be made.</p>
