         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

place, I ſhall then, inſtead of farther aſſerting it, adde one other
to it which ſeemes to beyond all exception to demonſtrate the
word to be uſed in a good ſence, it is in <hi>Diodorus Siculus bibl.
l. 5. p.</hi> 305. Where ſpeaking of the ancient ſoules he taketh
notice of one ſpeciall thing in them in their behaviour toward
the temples of the Gods, Their lies (ſaith he in their Temples)
a great deale of gold conſecrated to the Gods, which yet no
one of the natives toucheth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

good quality, and abſteining from that a vice or ſcrupuloſity.
The onely thing I can foreſee poſſible to be objected to it is,
that the not touching of the gold may be ſuch a ſcrupuloſity, but
that will be ſoone anſwered by puting the reader in minde that

            <p>All which being thus premiſed,<note place="margin">§ 27.</note> three things there are in
our moderne cuſtomary uſe of this word among men, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49480:7"/>
will appeare very inconſequent and improper at leaſt. Firſt
that <hi>Superſtition</hi> ſimply and abſtractly taken ſhould be reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all Authors to ſignifie ſomewhat which is <hi>evill;</hi> That
ſinne particularly of <hi>Falſe-worſhip.</hi> Whereas firſt thoſe that
uſe the word to expreſſe their owne worſhip either of <hi>God</hi> or
<hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> conceive that to be a creditable word, or
elſe would not call it by that name, and the <hi>Etymologiſts</hi> even
now affirmed that among the heathen <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>'Tis tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
for a good thing,</hi> and for religion in generall. And ſecondly
When Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Religion, or Chriſtianity it ſelfe is called by
that name by <hi>Feſtus</hi> an heathen <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 19. it appeares not
that he did uſe that word as an accuſation, or in an ill ſence, but
only in generall to ſignifie <hi>Pauls Religion,</hi> or ſomewhat in that
different from the Religion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and no whit leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by him then the <hi>Jewes</hi> Religion. For he that reades
the ſtory, ſhall ſee that he rather favoured Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or at moſt doubted whoſe ſide to judge on,
ſo farre is he from prejudgeing Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> cauſe, or his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in compariſon of theirs, or expreſſing that by this word.
Thirdly Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 23. ſaith, they do
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> worſhip the true God, though ignorantly, taking him
for a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the reſt of their many Gods were) whom he had
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Fourthly he calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>more
religious</hi> then other men, not in relation to any vitious rite or
performance, where in they exceeded others, but in relation to
their worſhiping the <hi>unknowne God,</hi> which others worſhipt
not, which ſaith he was the true God of heaven whom he
preached,<note place="margin">§ 28.</note> though the truth is they knew him not.</p>
            <p>A ſecond inconſequence is, that the uſe of Ceremonies or
Rites in the worſhip of the true God, if they be not diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſcribed either by the example or precept of Chriſt, ſhould
1 be called ſuperſtition, then without farther matter of accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be condemned only for deſerving that Title. Whereas
firſt there is no example in the Scripture, nor ancient Authour
nor ground in the nature of either Greeke or Latine word to
affix that Title to that matter <hi>(Superſtition to unpreſcribed
Rites)</hi> or if there were, yet ſecondly no Authority to defame
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49480:8"/>
that Title, being ſo applyed; or to conclude every thing evill
that were called by it, unleſſe it might appeare to be in it ſelfe
evill, <hi>abſtracted</hi> from the <hi>Odium</hi> of that Title.</p>
            <p>The Third Inconſequent thing is,<note place="margin">§ 29.</note> that men on pretence &amp; in
the name of Piety ſhould abſtaine from ſome obſervances (in
themſelves and their owne nature acknowledged to be <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent)</hi>
as <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> either becauſe they are commanded by
lawfull authority, or at moſt, becauſe they are or have been <hi>uſed</hi>
by <hi>Papiſts;</hi> And yet themſelves not expect to be accompted
<hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> in hating and deteſting and not daring to practice
any one of them (and that ſometimes for no other crime but
becauſe they are by lawfull <hi>authority commanded</hi> to practice
them) but as ſtrictly obligeing themſelves to do the contrary
ſometimes that which <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other Perſons (1 not
in authority, ſecondly as much or as well condemned by our
Church both for doctrine and manner of worſhip as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts)
are wont to doe; Whereas in things indifferent, firſt
it is certainely as criminons, and <hi>Superſtitious</hi> to place piety
in the <hi>Negative,</hi> as the <hi>affirmative,</hi> in <hi>not</hi> kneeling, as in <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
in <hi>abſteining</hi> ſcrupulouſly from Ceremonies, as in <hi>uſing</hi>
them as ſcrupulouſly, And ſecondly 'tis as dangerous a kinde
of <hi>dogmatizing</hi> to teach the neceſſity of abſtinence from law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unprohibited <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as from lawfull unprohibited
<hi>meates, Col.</hi> 2. And thirdly it is not imaginable that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening
of a command on one ſide and not on the other, ſhould
leave the <hi>Superſtition</hi> only on that ſide, where the command
lies, for then the <hi>Superſtition</hi> muſt conſiſt in obeying lawfull
magiſtrates, or elſe the magiſtrates themſelves be the only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Perſons in commanding. Either of which acts (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of giving or obeying commands in things indifferent) if it
were acknowledged a fault, might ſure be <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi>
as well as <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If to all which hath beene ſaid in this matter,<note place="margin">§ 30.</note> it be ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> may and doth in ſome authenticke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
either ſacred or profane ſignifie a <hi>nimiety or exceſſe in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
I ſhall breifely make this returne.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">§ 31.</note> That the word <hi>Superſtitious</hi> may indeed denote ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49480:8"/>
from the force of the termination <hi>[oſus]</hi> and ſo alſo (ſaith
<hi>Agellius</hi> out of <hi>Nigidius Figulus)</hi> the word <hi>Religioſus</hi> denotes;
but then, firſt, by that Grammaticall obſervation I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that <hi>Superſtitio</hi> denotes this no more then <hi>Religio</hi> doth;
Nay ſecondly, that 'tis <hi>Agellius</hi> his animadverſion upon <hi>Nigidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Figulus,</hi> that all ſuch exceſſes are not culpable, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all words of that termination to be taken in ill ſences.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly,<note place="margin">§ 32.</note> granting the word to be thus uſed by ſome
Authors, I muſt firſt ſay, That ſome, and thoſe not of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
of the ancient Heathens (as appeares by what we produced
out of <hi>Cicero)</hi> did it on that ground of Epicurean Divinity,
Gods no providence, no puniſhments in another life, to which
it was but conſonant to condemn all ſuperſtition (becauſe all
feare of God) for a Nimiety in opinion firſt, and then in practice.
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. that for other later chriſtian writers the uſe of a word in this
or that ſence in ſome Authors, is ſo ſlight and caſuall a thing, that
it muſt not be thought ſufficient to faſten an ill character on any
thing, to which thoſe Authors have applyed it, unleſſe that thing
be firſt proved to be ill by ſome other Topick. Thirdly, that
thoſe Authors which come home to the point in hand, are ſo few
or ſo moderne &amp; of ſo ſmall authority, that they would ſcarce be
worth producing. Fourthly, that this ſuppoſed Nimiety, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in matters of Religion may be reduced to theſe two ſorts,
as conſiſting either in the <hi>degree,</hi> or in the number of Actions; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>quantity:</hi> in the <hi>intenſion</hi> or <hi>extenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſuppoſed in the firſt kinde onely,<note place="margin">§ 33.</note> then I ſhall without
ſcruple deny, that there is any ſuch thing as Nimiety or exceſſe
in Religion. There is no poſſibility of being Religious in too
high a <hi>Degree,</hi> of praying <hi>too fervently,</hi> or <hi>too often.</hi> For
though the <hi>Meſſalians</hi> or <hi>Euchitae</hi> were condemn'd in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet 'tis cleare, that that which was their crime, was not
that exceſſive <hi>practice,</hi> but the <hi>laying</hi> that <hi>obligation</hi> upon
themſelves and all others, to be allwayes a praying, upon autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that Text <hi>[Pray continually]</hi> which being by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
delivered in reference and in analogie to the <hi>continuall i. e.</hi>
dayly <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> was by them miſinterpreted and applyed to
<hi>uninterrupted, inceſſant</hi> powring out of Prayers. And againe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49480:9"/>
though 'tis poſſible alſo, that in too frequent or intenſe a practice
of holy Duties ſome incident fault there may be, as for example,
if by ſo doing a man neglect the Duties of <hi>Charity</hi> or of his owne
<hi>particular calling,</hi> yet then alſo 'tis cleare that this fault is the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
of thoſe <hi>Duties,</hi> and not the <hi>Exceſſe</hi> of Devotion (to
which this neglect is but extrinſecall and accidentall, and ſo not
fit to deprave the nature of that devotion it ſelfe) which you
will diſcerne by this, that if that ſuppoſed exceſſe might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from thoſe adherent <hi>Neglects</hi> or <hi>Omiſſions,</hi> it would then
never be accounted criminous, no man that diſcharges all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Duties will ever be ſaid to be <hi>too</hi> zealous, or to pray <hi>too</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and that he doth not diſcharge thoſe Duties, though a fault
it is, and an argument of partiall hypocriticall obedience in him
that is wilfully guilty of it, yet ſure not properly the ſinne of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.
For 'tis Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s argument againſt <hi>Cicero</hi> (who
thought that the praying day and night, <hi>ut filii eſſent Superſtites,</hi>
was ſuperſtition) <hi>de Civi. l. 4. c. 30. Si Superſtites dicti, qui dies
totas precabantur &amp; immolabant, nunquid non &amp; illi qui inſtitue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
deoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimulachra? If 'twere Superſtition to pray and ſacrifice
whole daies together, then ſure they were ſuperſtitious alſo that ſet
up thoſe Images of the Gods to which they ſo Prayed and Sacrificed,</hi>
intimating his opinion that the frequency of Prayer could not be
Superſtitious, unleſſe the worſhip and inſtitution it ſelfe were Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious:
that is the Gods or Images to whom they thus pray'd,
falſe Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§ 34.</note> But if this exceſſe be ſuppoſed to be in the <hi>extenſion, i. e.</hi> the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in <hi>too</hi> many <hi>things,</hi> to wit too many <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,
&amp;c.</hi> into the ſervice of God, I ſhall then ſay. Firſt, that by this it
ſeemes to be granted, that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> themſelves
are not <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> but only the <hi>multitude</hi> of them. I make ſuch
haſt to aſſume this as granted, becauſe I conceive it ſuch a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
poſtulation, that I would perſwade my ſelfe no pretender
to rationall diſcourſe would deny it me; it being demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
as impoſſible to deveſt Religion of all Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
wholly, as to performe the duty of Prayer in a humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and yet to doe it at no time, in no place, with no geſture.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§ 35.</note> Or if our oppoſite Brethren will diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
and <hi>ſignificant Ceremonies,</hi> and onely diſclaime the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49480:9"/>
latter; Then firſt they muſt fall out with their freinds who
generally uſe <hi>elevation</hi> of the <hi>hand</hi> in taking of Oathes, and
that is a <hi>ſignificant Ceremony.</hi> And ſome of them aſſert the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſitting at the Sacrament as <hi>ſignificative</hi> of their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Familiarity with Chriſt on Earth at his ſecond
comming. And ſecondly, they muſt affirme it to be a fault too
in a Ceremony, that it is <hi>ſignificative,</hi> which ſeemes very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
alſo.</p>
            <p>For the ſignificancy of a Ceremonie may be of three ſorts.<note place="margin">§ 36.</note>
               <hi>Firſt, when it naturally ſignifies the thing which I am about, and
properly floweth from it;</hi> as the lifting up the eyes to Heaven
<hi>floweth</hi> from zeale in Prayer, and ſignifies or expreſſeth it; and
no ſober man would ever thinke fit to quarrell with that for
being <hi>ſignificative,</hi> or to preſcribe limits to the uſe of ſuch kind
of Ceremonies. Secondly, <hi>When by the cuſtome of the place it
becomes in like manner alſo ſignificative of the Action in hand.</hi>
As, among us, <hi>kneeling</hi> ſignifies humility, &amp;c. and to blame
ſuch a ſignificancie againe, or ſuch a Ceremonie, becauſe it is
<hi>ſignificative,</hi> were as irrationall, 'Twill not be fault in any thus
to uſe it privately himſelfe, or being a Magiſtrate to preſcribe
others (for decency and uniformity) the uſe of it. Thirdly,
when it is ſet to ſignifie ſomething elſe, whether that which it
ſignifies be matter of Chriſtian Doctrine; as in the Antient
Church, the cuſtome of <hi>ſtanding</hi> in the Church betweene Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and Whitſuntide, was deſign'd to ſignifie the <hi>Reſurrection</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or whether it be matter of promiſe, as the Types in
the <hi>old law</hi> were of Chriſt to come; or whether matter <hi>of
fact</hi> &amp; Story, &amp;c. and then alſo to quarrell with the <hi>ſignificancy</hi>
of them, and diſlike them more then if they were empty and
<hi>unſignificant,</hi> is Firſt, very irrationall againe (for it will not
bee more fault to have ſome profit in them, then to have
none.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, it will lay a cenſure upon the Types of the Law
appointed by God himſelfe,<note place="margin">§ 37.</note> for they were ſuch; And though
thoſe particulars are now out-dated by the comming of Chriſt
whom they ſignified, yet ſince others that are now ſtill ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
by ſignifying and commemorating ſomewhat <hi>paſt,</hi> or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49480:10"/>
prefiguring ſomwhat yet future, will by that Analogie and
proportion which they hold with thoſe which were then law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
be evidenced to be lawfull too.</p>
            <p>The not obſerving of which matter,<note place="margin">§ 38.</note> and of the ſole reaſon
why the old <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies, Circumciſion, &amp;c.</hi> are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
us Chriſtians (not becauſe ſignificative Ceremonies are
<hi>toto genere</hi> unlawfull, but becauſe the obſerving of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
which foreſhewed Chriſt, and teaching the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of
obſerving them, would bee <hi>interpretative</hi> the denying of
Chriſt; or that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was come) is conceive, that
which hath given occaſion of the miſtakes of thinking ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
Ceremonies to be now unlawfull; which errour if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this advertiſement it may now be reformed, and this ſo
reaſonable a <hi>poſtulation</hi> for the lawfulneſſe of Ceremonies <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative</hi>
be thus granted, the greater part of this preſent
Controverſie will be at an end; for I ſhall not then bee Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
for the multitude or aboundance of that laſt ſort of <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative</hi>
Ceremonies, but rather give my full vote to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the old rule concerning them, that they bee <hi>paucae &amp;
ſalubres, few, &amp; wholſome;</hi> and particularly <hi>few</hi> for theſe
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">§ 39.</note> becauſe there are really not many ſuch wholſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
to be found; Secondly, becauſe thoſe that by Lawe
are received into the Church, are but very moderate for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
which with me hath no ſmall Authority. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis not impoſſible that the number may encumber the
Soule, by buſying it about many things, and ſo diverting it
from the <hi>One great Neceſſary.</hi> Fourthly, becauſe the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of ſuch was counted a Burden to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Fifthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeemes ſometimes to bee an ill ſymptome of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
neglect, to ſpend overmuch Care and Time in the Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-waſhings;
as in the Phariſees it is noted to have beene;
And as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves of the inſectile Animalls, that the
want of blood was the cauſe that they ran out into ſo many
leggs.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly,<note place="margin">§ 40.</note> I muſt add by way of caution, that in
this matter men are ſometimes miſtaken (as Miſers are in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49480:10"/>
judging of exceſſive expenſes, or ſluggards of exceſſive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
thinke, they or others exceede, when they doe not.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe you may pleaſe firſt to take this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">§ 41.</note>
that though the premiſed caution concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in a Church be very good, that they be <hi>paucae &amp; ſalubres,
few and wholſome,</hi> yet if they be <hi>wholſome,</hi> not only negatively,
but poſitively, not only harmleſſe but tending to edification
(for ſo <hi>ſalubrity,</hi> or wholſomneſſe imports) then there will be
little reaſon to accuſe them of <hi>exceſſe;</hi> for if they be <hi>ſalubrious,</hi>
they will then more probably <hi>helpe</hi> the inner devotion, then
<hi>encumber it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, you muſt diſtinguiſh of ſuch Acts,<note place="margin">§ 42.</note> wherein that
exceſſe is ſuppoſed to be, that they either are <hi>ordinable, fit, &amp;c.
proper</hi> to that end, the ſervice of God, to which they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex't;
and then againe being uſed in their kinde, they are <hi>ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious,</hi>
and no danger of <hi>exceſſe;</hi> or Secondly, they are inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
unfit, improper, of which nature there are great ſtore
noted in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in this caſe though any one
may be a nimiety, and that nimiety a fault, yet ſtill this not the
fault of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> but rather of <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> or what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
other <hi>guilt,</hi> the uſing things in the worſhip of God, which
doe no whit tend to that end (but are aliene from it) may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to. And theſe <hi>vanities,</hi> or this fault, I deſire to alow no
favour or patronage or countenance to, but have as full diſlikes
to them as any charitable man hath, though as yet I am not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that they are to be called <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet concerning a word I ſhall not conend neither,<note place="margin">§ 43.</note>
but rather grant them lyable to that title alſo, on condition
that I may but evince and be granted this one thing, that it is a
circle of injuſtice, and a noxious fallacy, firſt to apply the title
of Superſtition to ſuch trifles or faults as theſe, then to extend
it farther to thoſe things which have no ſuch fault to bee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on them, and then to condemne thoſe alſo, as faults and
crimes, becauſe they are <hi>Superſtitious;</hi> juſt like the old hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Tyrants dealing with the primitive Chriſtians, firſt to
entertain themſelves with the bloody ſpectacles of bayting of
wilde-beaſts, then to take off thoſe wilde-beaſts skins, and put
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49480:11"/>
them upon Chriſtians, then to bring forth thoſe Chriſtians to
be baited and devoured in thoſe ſhapes, The injuſtice of which
is the <gap reason="foreign">

in this place, that that maine proofe and common way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing

or the <hi>particular Church</hi> (and rulers thereof) wherein
we live; or if by none of theſe, then (being left free and at our

with a reſolution, or vow perhaps in ſome caſes. Now if
theſe or any of theſe be the authors of the <hi>ſeparating</hi> any thing,
then to diſcerne whether we exceede in any of theſe, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we place more <hi>holyneſſe</hi> then is due to them; it will not be
very difficult: For, if that; which is thus ſeparated by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
I ſhall count <hi>holy</hi> in that degree, and conceive my ſelfe obliged
to it <hi>virtute praecepti divini, by virtue of divine praecept,</hi> I ſurely
offend not. And ſo in the ſecond, If I count my ſelfe obliged
by the <hi>Apoſtolick pracept,</hi> or in the third by the example or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49480:13"/>
               <hi>praecept of the primitive univerſall,</hi> or in the fourth, <hi>of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

not, becauſe the <hi>holineſſe</hi> which I place in them is ſtill
proportioned to the ground of it, the authority of him that
thus <hi>ſeparated them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo againe,<note place="margin">§ 52.</note> if my <hi>voluntary oblation</hi> I performe as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary

fault perhaps capable of the title of <hi>Superſtition:</hi> which yet
muſt not be extended thus farre, that the giving of the like <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi>

due to both Divine and Humane lawes (keeping their termes

I muſt not make any difference in that Obedience, but do both
<hi>for Conſcience ſake)</hi> but that the <hi>confounding</hi> the <hi>grounds</hi> or

competition with (and ſo thwart) one another; in which caſe
the inferiour ought <hi>to give place</hi> to the ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>If to this it be replyed,<note place="margin">§ 54.</note> that though I doe not elevate this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
its pitch, do not thus attribute more <hi>holyneſſe</hi> to this or
that then it deſerves, yet <hi>Papiſts</hi> or other <hi>Superſtitious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have done ſo, and therefore the thing is become <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,</hi>
and conſequently muſt be forborne by me alſo. To this
I anſwere Firſt, That the ill uſe of any will not, corrupt a thing
in it ſelfe either commanded, or but laudable, or only inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

yet will not every thing from them be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            <p>This inconſequence being acknowledged,<note place="margin">§ 55.</note> I ad, Secondly, that
there is nothing which can obliege me to abſtein fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which
they have uſed ſuperſtitiouſly, unleſſe either the danger that I
be thought to doe ſo too, to be as <hi>Superſtitious</hi> as they, or the
poſſibility that others following me in doing it, may follow
them in doing it <hi>ſuperſtitiouſly,</hi> and either of theſe dangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuppoſed, will not yet come home to prove it <hi>Superſtitious,</hi>
(which is the only thing we have now to conſider) the moſt
that they can doe, is to make it <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and (beſide that
this belongs to another matter and is abundantly handled in <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Diſcourſe on that Subject)</hi> I ſhall add one thing more
that this conſideration of the danger or poſſibility, is not ſo
much a <hi>religious</hi> as a <hi>prudentiall</hi> one (for an act of <hi>prudence</hi> it is
to weigh and ponder whether this be a probable danger or no)
and ſo belongs to the higher powers to conſider of (not to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
private man) who if they thinke fit by lawe to forbid it, I
muſt not then venter on it; if <hi>(non obſtante</hi> this appearance of
danger) to command it, though 'tis poſſible they may doe amiſſe
in ſo doing, yet I (having nothing to doe in that act of theirs,
unleſſe I am of Counſell adviſed with in it) may be innocent
enough in ſo obeying, and if they have thought fit neither to
command nor forbid, then am I left free in my owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and may doe either, ſo I doe it with thoſe cautions, that
in the <hi>tract of Scandall</hi> are ſet downe.</p>
            <p>To which if it be replyed, that though this bee true in <hi>theſi,</hi>

yet in <hi>hypotheſi</hi> 'twill not be pertinent in this kingdome. The

of them, unleſſe of thoſe which eyther our Church or
ſome higher principle hath pronounced unlawfull; my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that whatſoever laudable performance was taken up
by the Papiſts, and by them commanded, now though that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49480:14"/>
command be taken away, and ſo we free from the oblieging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or burthen of it, yet 'tis not therfore made unlawfull or
prohibited to us (for that were to reſtraine our liberty alſo,
and only to exchange one burthen for another) or if it were, I
ſhould then thinke my ſelfe oblieged to abſteine alſo.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion from all this diſcourſe will be,<note place="margin">§ 57.</note> that if ſome

commands for, and conſequently if they would not judge or
damn their brethren, when neither <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his writ, nor the

the particular within which they live, nor the <hi>indecency</hi> of the
