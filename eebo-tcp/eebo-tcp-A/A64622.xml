         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, I doe here present and commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee a booke of great worth and singular use,
which was written and finished about twenty years
since: the Author whereof is well knowne to
bee so universally eminent in all Learning, and
of that deepe knowledge, and judgement in sacred Divinity, that
he transcendeth all elogies and praises which I can give him. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it unto the (Christian Reader) under a two-fold notion; the first
respecteth the subject matter of this whole Work, which is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
excellency, ad being The summe and substance of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
upon which as a most sure foundation we build our faith, ground
all our hopes, and from which we reap, and retain all our joy and
comfort in the assurance of our salvation; which as at all times it is
most profitable to be read, studied and known, so now (if ever) most
necessary in these our days, wherein men never more neglected these
fundamentall principles, as being but common and ordinary truths, and
spend their whole time, study, and discourse about Discipline, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and circumstantiall points; and herein also not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with those common rules, and that clear light which shineth in
the Word; they are onely led by their own phantasies, daily creating
unto themselves diversity of new opinions: and so falling into sects
and schismes they break the bond of love, and fall off from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, as though it were no Article of their Creed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in love with their own new Tenets, as being the conception and birth
of their own brains, they contend for them more then for any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
truths; and not onely so, but also hate, maligne, and most
bitterly, and uncharitably censure all those that differ from them in
their opinions, though never so conscientious and religious, as though
they professed not the same faith, yea, served not the same God, nor
beleeved in the same Christ; but remain still Aliens from the Common-wealth
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and in comparison of themselves no better then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
or at the best but carnall Gospellers. The second notion under
which I commend it respecteth the Work it self, or the manner of
the Authors handling it, which is done so soundly and solidly, so
judiciously and exactly, so methodically and orderly, and with that
familiar plainnesse, perspicuity and clearnesse, that it giveth place to no
<pb facs="tcp:55421:3"/>
other in this kind either ancient or modern, either in our own, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Language which ever yet came to my view; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
I may say of it, as it is said of the vertuous woman; Many
have done excellently, but this our Author exceedeth them all. I will
adde no more in the deserved praises of this Worke, but leave it
(Christian Reader) to thy self to peruse and judge of it, commending
thee to the Word of Gods grace and the good guidance of his holy
Spirit, who is able to build thee up in fruitfull knowledge, to lead
thee into all truth, to direct and support thee in the wayes of godliness,
and to give thee an everlasting inheritance amongst the blessed.</p>

                  <p>Yes; for the very heathens condemned them to death that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

have some forme of Religion, to acknowledge a God; as all India, East

by the Minister.</p>
                  <p>Why at home?</p>
                  <p>Because houses are the Nurseries of the Church.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, God accounteth of <hi>Abraham</hi> for his care in this duty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Hee commandeth all parents to perform this duty to
their children, <hi>Deut. 6. 6, 7. Ephes.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, all children are made blinde in the knowledge of God
and of Religion by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and consequently they must bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
and informed by teaching, if they will not dye, which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
therefore commandeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 6. and our Saviour Christ bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
children bee respected, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 14, 15, 16.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the examples of the godly for this duty, in bringing their
children with themselves to holy exercises: So <hi>Hannah</hi> brought up
<hi>Samuel</hi> to the Tabernacle, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 24. and <hi>Mary Jesus</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when hee was twelve yeeres old, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 42. by which wee
perform the effect of consecrating our children to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, common equity should move Parents to this duty, for as
their children receive from them originall sin, by which they are
made so blinde in Gods matters, it is equity they should labour to
remove that blindnesse by teaching them after Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, God promiseth as the greatest blessing to men, that their
children should speak of him under the Gospel, <hi>Joel 2. 28. Act.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>But is it not some disgrace and basenesse that men of yeers and place
should bee Catechised?</p>
                  <p>If men will bee Christians, which is their greatest honour, they
must hold it no disgrace to learn Christ: Noble <hi>Theophilus</hi> held it
none, who was thus catechised, as <hi>Luke</hi> sheweth <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 4. likewise
<hi>Apollos, Act.</hi> 18. 28.</p>
                  <p>To come then to the declaration of Christian Religion; tell mee
wherein doth the happinesse of man consist?</p>
                  <p>Not<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 1. 2. True happines consisteth in God. How we come to injoy God.</note> in himself, nor in any other created thing, but only in God
his Creator, who alone being infinite, is able to fill the heart of man.</p>
                  <p>How may wee come to injoy God?</p>
                  <p>By being joyned unto him, and so partaking of his goodnesse; for
happinesse is to bee found by<note n="b" place="margin">Job 22. 21.</note> acquaintance and fellowship vvith him
vvho is the foundation of blessednesse, man so<note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 17. 3. Gal. 4. 9.</note> knowing him, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>By what means come wee to the knowledge of God?</p>
                  <p>By such means as hee hath revealed in himself;<note place="margin">Means to know God.</note> for God dwelleth
in the light that no man can come unto, vvhom no man hath seen,
nor can see, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. except hee shew himself unto us: not that
hee is hidden in the darknesse, for hee dwelleth in the light, but
that the dulnesse of sight, and blindnesse of our hearts cannot
reach unto that light, except hee declare himself unto us; like as the
Sunne is not seen, but by his own light, so God is not known but by
such means as hee hath manifested himself.</p>
                  <p>By what means hath God revealed himselfe?</p>
                  <p>By his Divine works and by his holy Word,<note place="margin">By his Divine Works, and holy Word.</note> as the Prophet
<hi>David</hi> plentifully and distinctly expressed in the nineteenth <hi>Psalm,
The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job. 22. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>and the firmament shewth his
handy work,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 68.</note> and so continuing unto the seventh verse touching his
Works, and from thence to the end of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> touching his Word;
<hi>The law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soule, the testimony of the
Lord is sure making wise the simple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That all curious searching to know more of God then hee hath
shewed of himself is both vain and hurtfull to the searchers, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seeing by his Works and Word hee hath declared as much
as is profitable for men to know, for his glory and their eternall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. The secret things belong
unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed, belong
unto us, and to our children for ever.</p>
                  <p>What bee the Divine works whereby God hath shewed himself?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Creation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Divine Works of God.</note> 
                     <hi>and preservation of the world, and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
so the Apostle to the</hi> Romans <hi>saith,</hi> That all men are inexcusable,
seeing that which may bee known of God, is made manifest within them;
for God hath made it manifest unto them. For the invisible things of God
while they are understood in his works by the Creation of the world, are
seen, even his eternall power and Godhead, <hi>Rom. 1. 19, 20. Also preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongst the grosse Idolatrous Lystrians,</hi> Act. 14. 17. <hi>hee saith,
that God</hi> hath not left himself without Testimony, bestowing his benefits,
giving rain and fruitfull seasons from heaven, filling our hearts with food
and gladnesse.</p>
                  <p>And preaching among the learned, and yet no lesse superstitious
<hi>Athenians,</hi> hee citeth and canonizeth the Testimony of the Poets,<note place="margin">Plato.</note>
to shew that God is not farre from every one of us,<note place="margin">Galen.</note> for in him wee
live,<note place="margin">Homer.</note> move, and have our beeing, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27, 28. For whosoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Heathen Poets,<note place="margin">Virgil.</note> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> which professed wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Ovid.</note>
hath not been wilfully blinde, have learned by contemplation
of the Creatures of the world, that God is the Maker and preserver
of the same.</p>
                  <p>What use is there of the knowledge obtained by the Works of God?</p>
                  <p>There is a double use,<note place="margin">The uses of knowing God by his Works.</note> the one, to make all men void of excuse, as the
Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and so it is sufficient unto condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The other is to further unto salvation, and that by preparing and
inciting men to seek God, <hi>If happily by groping they may finde him,</hi>
as the Apostle sheweth, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27. whereby they are made more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55421:9"/>
apt to acknowledge him when he is perfectly revealed in his Word,
or after they have known God out of his Word, by contemplation
of his infinite power, wisdome, and goodnesse, most gloriously shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in his Works, to stirre them up continually, to reverence his
Majesty, to honour and obey him, to repose their trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him; and so the Children of God doe use this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, gathered out of his Divine Works, as appeareth in
many places of the Scriptures, and especially of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which
are appointed for the exercise of the whole Church, <hi>Psal. 8. Psal. 19.
Psal. 95. Psal. 104. &amp; 136. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not the Works of God sufficient to give knowledge of the onely
true God, and the way unto everlasting happinesse?</p>
                  <p>They may leave us to bee without excuse, and so are sufficient
unto condemnation, but are not able to make us wise unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because of things which are necessary unto Salvation, some
they teach but imperfectly, others, not at all, as the distinction of
the Persons in the Godhead, the fall of man from God, and the way
to repaire the same.</p>
                  <p>Where then is the saving knowledge of God to bee had perfectly?</p>
                  <p>In his holy Word,<note place="margin">Of Gods holy Word the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> for God according to the riches of his Grace,
hath been abundant towards us in all wisdome and understanding,
and hath opened unto us the Mystery of his will, according to his
good pleasure, which hee hath purposed in himself, as the Apostle
teacheth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>What course did God hold in the delivery of his Word unto men?</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the world hee delivered his Word by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</note>
and continued the knowledge thereof by <hi>Tradition,</hi> while
the number of his true worshippers were small, but after hee chose
a great and populous Nation, in which hee would bee honoured
and served, hee caused the same to bee committed to writing for all
ages to the end of the world: for about the space of two thousand
five hundred yeeres from the Creation, the people of God had no
writen Word to direct them; Thence for the space of three thousand
one hundred yeers, unto this present time, the Word of God was
committed unto them in writing, yet so that in half that time Gods
will was also revealed without writing extraordinarily, and the
holy books indited one after another, according to the necessity of
the times, but in this last half, the whole Canon of the Scriptures
being fully finished, wee and all men, unto the worlds end, are left
to have our full instruction from the same without expecting extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
revelations, as in times past.</p>
                  <p>Were these Revelations in times past delivered all in the same manner?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revelations.</note> 
                     <hi>for (as the Apostle noteth,</hi> Heb. 1. 1.) at sundry times, and in
divers manners God spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets.
<hi>The diverse kindes are set down in</hi> Numb. 12. 6. <hi>and</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 6. <hi>and
may bee reduced to these two generall heads, Oracles, and Visions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What call you Oracles?</p>
                  <p>Those Revelations that God,<note place="margin">Oracles.</note> as it were, by his own mouth delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his servants, and that ordinarily by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> or
by Prophets extraordinarily called.</p>
                  <p>What doe you understand by Visions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55421:9"/>
Those Revelations whereby God signified his will by certain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and representations of things offered unto men,<note place="margin">Visions.</note> as may bee seen in
the Visions of <hi>Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremie, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How were these Visions presented unto men?</p>
                  <p>Sometime to men waking, sometime to men sleeping, sometime to
the mind, sometime by the eyes, to the imagination of men sleeping were
offered divine dreams, in expounding whereof we read that <hi>Joseph</hi> and
<hi>Daniel</hi> excelled; but now they together with all other extraordinary
Revelations are ceased.</p>
                  <p>Where then is the Word of God now certainely to be learned?</p>
                  <p>Onely out of the Book of God contained in the holy Scriptures, which
are the onely certain testimonies unto the Church of the Word of God,
1 <hi>John 5. 9. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>Why may not men want the Scriptures now as they did at the first, from
the Creation untill the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the space of 2513. years?</p>
                  <p>First, because then God immediately by his voice and Prophets sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
from him, taught the Church his truth, which now are ceased, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, traditions might then be of sufficient certainty by reason of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the long life of Gods faithfull witnesses; for <hi>Methusalem</hi> lived with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
the first man 243. years, and continued unto the Flood: <hi>Shem</hi> lived at
once with <hi>Methusalem</hi> 98. years, and flourished above 500. yeares after
the Flood: <hi>Isaac</hi> lived 50. years with <hi>Shem,</hi> and died about 10. years
before the descent of <hi>Israel</hi> into <hi>Aegypt:</hi> So that from <hi>Adams</hi> death unto
that time, three men might by tradition preserve the purity of Religion;
but after the comming of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> mans age was so shorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that in the dayes of <hi>Moses</hi> (the first Penman of the Scriptures) it was
brought to 70. or 80. years, as appeareth by the <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God saw his true religion greatly forgotten in <hi>Aegypt; (Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
then falling unto Idolatry, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 20. 8.) and having brought <hi>Israel</hi>
then his people from thence, did not onely restore, but also encreased
the same, adding thereunto many more particulars concerning his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which were needfull for mens memories to be written.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God having gathered his Church to a more solemn company <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
then before, it was his pleasure then to begin the writings of his will,
and therefore first with his own finger he wrote the ten Commandements
in two Tables of stone, and then commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to write the other
words which he had heard from him in the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, thus God provided that the Churches of all ages and times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
might have a certain rule to know whether they embraced sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or no; and that none should be so bold as to coin any new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to serve him with, but that which he had delivered in writing.</p>
                  <p>What is Scripture then?<note place="margin">What Scripture is.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word of God written by men inspired by the holy Ghost for
the perfect building and salvation of the Church: or holy Books written
by the inspiration of God to make us wise unto salvation, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15,
16. 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Pet. 20. 21. Joh.</hi> 20. 31.</p>
                  <p>If that the Scriptures be written by men which are subject unto infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
how can it be accounted the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>Because it proceeds not from the wit or mind of men, but holy men set
apart by God for the work of God spake and writ as they were moved
by the holy Ghost; therfore God alone is to be counted the Author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55421:10"/>
who inspired the hearts of those holy men whom he chose to be his
Secretaries, who are to be held only the Instrumentall cause thereof.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Jeremy</hi> brought the Word of God to the Jews they said it was not the
Word of the Lord, but he spake as <hi>Baruc</hi> the son of <hi>Neriah</hi> provoked him,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 43. 2. and so some perhaps in these days are so ungodly as to take the
Jews part against <hi>Jeremy</hi> and all his fellowes: How may it appeare
therefore that this Book which you call the Book of God, and the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
is the Word of God indeed, and not mens policy?</p>
                  <p>By the consonant testimony of men in all ages from them that first
knew these Penmen of the holy Ghost with their writings untill our
time;<note place="margin">That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Word of God.</note> and reasons taken out of the Word themselves, agreeable to the
quality of the writers; both which kind of arguments the holy Scriptures
have as much and far more then any other writings; wherefore as it were
extream impudency to deny the works of <hi>Homer,</hi> of <hi>Plato, Virgil, Tully,
Livy, Galen, &amp;c.</hi> when as consent of al ages have reached &amp; delivered them
unto us, which also by the tongue, phrase, matter, and all other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
agreeable are confirmed to be the works of the same Authors whose
they are testified to be; so it were more then brutish madnesse to doubt of
the certain truth and authority of the holy Scriptures, which no lesse, but
much more then any other writings for their Authors are testified and
confirmed to be the sacred Word of the ever-living God; not onely testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
I say by the uniform witnesses of men in all ages, but also confirmed
by such reasons taken out of the writings themselves, as doe sufficiently
argue the Spirit of God to be the Author of them; for we may learn out
of the testimonies themselves as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psa.</hi> 119. 125. That God hath
established them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Let me hear some of those reasons which prove that God is the Author of
the holy Scriptures?<note place="margin">Reasons to prove God to be the Author of the holy Scriptures.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the true godlinesse and holinesse wherewith the writers of the
Scriptures shined as Lamps in their times, and far surpassed all men of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
religions,<note place="margin">1 Efficient.</note> which sheweth the work of Gods Spirit in them,<note place="margin">Instrumentall.</note> and how
unlikely it is that such men should obtrude into the Church their own
inventions in stead of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 The simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> the simplicity, integrity, and sincerity of these Writers in
matters that concern themselves &amp; those that belong unto them, doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by partiality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. neither sparing their friends nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
so <hi>Moses,</hi> for example, in his writing spared not to report the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of his own Tribe, <hi>Gen. 34. 30. &amp;</hi> 49. 5. 7. nor the incest of his
parents of which he himself was conceived, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 20. nor the Idolatry
of his brother <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 32. nor the wicked murmuring of his sister
<hi>Miriam, Numb.</hi> 12. nor his own declining of his vocation by God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, Exo.</hi> 4. 13, 14. nor his own murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
against God in his impatiency, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 11, 12, 13, 14. nor his want
of faith after so many wonderfull confirmations, <hi>Num. 20. 12. &amp; 27. 14.
Deut.</hi> 32. 51. And though he were in highest authority, and having a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the people to beleeve whatsoever he said, <hi>Exod. 19. 8. &amp; 20. 19.
&amp;</hi> 24. 3. he assigneth no place for his own sons to aspire either to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or to the high Priesthood; but leaveth them in the mean degree of
common Levites: all which things declare most manifestly that he was
void of all earthly and carnall affections in his writings, as was meet for
the Penman and Scribe of God; hereunto also may be added that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55421:10"/>
of himself, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 3. that he was the meekest of all the men that
were upon the face of the whole earth, which no wise man would in such
sort report of himself; if he were left to his own discretion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 The quality and condition of the Penmen of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> the quality and condition of the Penmen of these holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
some of whom were never trained up in the school of man, and yet

could not attain unto. Some also were before professed enemies

fasting, but it is also from sin; they command circumcision, but it

Gods glory, and the salvation of mans soule; for they intreat either of
the noble acts of God and of Christ, or the salvation of mankind, and
therefore by comparing this with the former reason we may frame this
argument; If the Author of the Scripture were not God, it must be some
creature; if he were a creature, he were either good or bad; if a bad crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
why forbiddeth he evill so rigorously, and commands good so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,

good? if he were a good creature, why doth he challenge to himself that
which is proper to God onely, as to make Laws for the heart, to punish

                  <p>Shew now how the holy Scriptures have the consonant testimony of all men
at all times since they were writen,<note place="margin">16 The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant testimony of all men at all times.</note> that they are the most holy word of God.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Joshua</hi> the servant of <hi>Moses,</hi> the first Scribe of God, to whom God
spake in the presence and hearing of six hundred thousand men, besides
women and children, who was an eye-witnesse of many wonders, by which
the Ministery of <hi>Moses</hi> was confirmed, testifieth his writings to bee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Word of God; the same doe the Prophets which continued the
History of the Church in the time of the Judges, both of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Joshua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise all the Prophets which successively recorded the holy Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Prophesies, by divine Revelation, from <hi>Samuel</hi> unto the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and from the Captivity to the building again of the Temple, and of
the City, and sometimes after, receiving the same book of heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from the former age, delivered them to their posterity: And <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
the last of the Prophets, closeth up the Old Testament with a charge
and an Exhortation from the Lord to remember the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and to use the same as a Schoole-master to direct them
unto Christ, untill hee came in person himself, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>Finally, from that time the Church of the Jews, untill the comming of
Christ in the flesh, imbraced all the former writings of the Prophets as
the book of God; &amp; Christ himself appealeth unto them as a sufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. The Apostles and the Evangelists prove the
writings of the New Testament by them, and the Catholike Church of
Christ, from the Apostles time untill this day, hath acknowledged all the
same writings both of the Old and New Testament, to bee the undoubted
Word of God. Thus have wee the testimony both of the Old Church
of the Jews, Gods peculiar people and first-born, to whom the Oracles
of God were committed, <hi>Act. 7. 38. Hos. 8. 12. Rom. 3. 2. &amp;</hi> 9. 4. and the
view of Christians, together with the generall account which all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have made at all times of the Scriptures, when they have crossed
their natures and courses, as accounting it in their soules to bee of God,
and the speciall testimony of Martyrs, who have sealed the certainty of
the same, by shedding their blood for them: Thereunto also may bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the testimony of those which are out of the Church, Heathens, (out
of whom many ancient testimonies are cited to this purpose, by <hi>Josephus
contra Appion.</hi>) Turks, and Jews (who to this day acknowledge all the
books of the Old Testament) and Hereticks, who labour to shroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Are there not some divine testimonies which may likewise bee added to this?</p>
                  <p>Yes;<note place="margin">17 The known miracles done by the Writers of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> first, the known Miracles (which the devill was never able to
doe) that did so often follow the writers and teachers of the Scriptures.

reviled and persecuted the same.</p>
                  <p>Are these motives of themselves sufficient to work saving faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us fully to rest on Gods Word?</p>
                  <p>No;<note place="margin">18 The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit in the hearts of men.</note> besides all this, it is required, that wee have the Spirit of
God, as well to open our eyes to see the light, as to seale up fully
into our hearts that truth which wee see with our eyes: for the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit that inspired the Scripture (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. &amp; 14. 37. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13.)
inclineth the hearts of Gods children to beleeve what is revealed in them,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55421:12"/>
and inwardly assureth them above all reasons and arguments, that these
are the Scriptures of God; therefore the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
promiseth to joyn his Spirit with his Word, and that it shall remain with
his children for ever: <hi>Esa.</hi> 59. 21. The same promiseth our Saviour Christ
unto his Disciples, concerning the Comforter, which hee would send, to
leade them into all truth, and teach them all things, and to put them in
minde of all things which hee had said unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. &amp; 15. 26.</p>
                  <p>The Lord by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> also promiseth to give his Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their mindes, and to write them in the hearts of his children, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33.
And S. <hi>John</hi> saith to the faithfull, that by the anointing of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which is on them, they know all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>This testimony of Gods Spirit in the hearts of his faithfull, as it is
proper to the Word of God, so it is greater then any humane perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
grounded upon reason or witnesses of men, unto which it is unmeet
that the Word of God should bee subject as Papists hold, when they
teach that the Scriptures receive their authority from the Church; for by
thus hanging the credit and authority of the Scriptures on the Churches
sentence, they make the Churches work of greater credit then the Word
of God, whereas the Scriptures of God cannot bee judged or sentenced
by any; and God onely is a worthy witnesse himself in his Word, and
by his Spirit, which give mutuall testimony one of the other, and work
that assurance of Faith in the Elect, that no humane demonstrations can
make, nor any perswasions or inforcements of the world can remove.</p>
                  <p>Shew some further reasons that the authority of the Scriptures doth not
depend upon the Church.<note place="margin">That the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures doth not depend on the Church.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because wee beleeve the Scriptures is a work of Faith, but the
Church cannot infuse Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Secondly, any authority that the Church hath, it must prove it by the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Scriptures, therefore the Scripture dependeth not upon the Church.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if an Infidell should ask the Church how they are sure that
Christ dyed for them, if they should answer because themselves say so, it
would be ridiculous; when they should say, because the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
so, &amp;c.</p>

speech, in comparison of which, all other languages may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of barbarous confusion, but chosen especially because it was the
language of that time, best known unto the Church, teaching that all

Prophets were left writen in the Chaldean tongue, (understood by
Gods people after their carrying away into <hi>Babylon</hi>) namely, the 11 <hi>verse</hi>
of the 10 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Jer.</hi> six <hi>chapters</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> (from the 4 <hi>ver.</hi> of the 2 <hi>chap.</hi>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55421:12"/>
Had the Hebrew Text vowels, or points from the beginning as

Law shall perish, whereby it should appeare that the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
(for of both hee speaketh immediately before) had vowels
and pricks: God also by <hi>Moses</hi> commanded the Law to bee writen
upon two great stones at the entrance of the people into the Land of

bee performed, except it were writen with the vowelling points,

of the cleernesse, and certainty of the Scripture, which could not at

                  <p>What are the books of the Old Testament?</p>
                  <p>The books of <hi>Moses</hi> (otherwise called the Law) and the Prophets;

that the Law is taken for the vvhole Doctrine of God, delivered by

                  <p>The first book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> writing an History of things said, and
done, doth not much interlace his own judgement: and therefore
doth erre the lesse, yet in his Narration, contrary to the second book
of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> in many places, and to <hi>Josephus</hi> in somethings: For
example, The first book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> saith, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> dyed at
<hi>Babylon</hi> in his bed, beeing grieved in minde for tidings brought to
him out of <hi>Persia, 1 Mac. 6. ver. 8. &amp;</hi> 16. But in the first chapter of
the second book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> it is said, that hee was cut in peeces
in the Temple of <hi>Nanea,</hi> and in the ninth chapter of the same book,
that hee dyed of a grievous disease of his bowels, in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
in the Mountaines, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 9. 28.</p>
                  <p>The second book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> is farre worse, for the abridger of
<hi>Jasons</hi> Chronicle, which did set it forth, doth not onely confound
and falsifie many stories, (as it is easie to bee proved out of the first
book of <hi>Maccabees, Josephus,</hi> and others) but also whilst he giveth
his sentence of divers facts, doth more bewray the weaknesse of his
judgement: as hee commendeth <hi>Razis</hi> for killing himself, 2 <hi>Mac. 14.
42.</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> for offering sacrifice for the dead, that were polluted
with Idolatry, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 12. 45. whereas it is to bee thought rather,
that the sacrifice was offered to pacifie the wrath of God for them
that were alive, that they should not bee wrapped in the curse of

the wicked, as in the story of <hi>Achan, Josh.</hi> 7. yet hee is the more to
bee born withall, because hee confesseth his insufficiency (2 <hi>Mac. 15.
38.</hi>) which agreeth not with the Spirit of God. The additions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ester</hi> are fabulous, convinced of many untruthes by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
book; as namely, first, in the Apocryphall <hi>Ester. Mordecai</hi> is
said to dream in the second yeer of <hi>Ahashueros, (chap.</hi> 11. 2.) but in the
Canonicall, the seventh yeer (<hi>Ester</hi> 2. 16.) And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> making the
dream in the seventh yeer, and the conspiracy in the second, maketh
five yeers difference, and is contrary to <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 2. The true saith that
<hi>Mordecai</hi> had no reward, (<hi>Ester</hi> 6. 3.) the false saith hee had, (<hi>Chap.
12.</hi> 5.) Thirdly, and the false also, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 6. The true calleth, and the

false calleth him a <hi>Macedonian, Chap.</hi> 16. 10. Also the authour of those
additions, describeth the countenance of the King to bee full of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and wrath, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 7.) yet hee maketh <hi>Ester</hi> to say it was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
like an Angel of God, and full of grace, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 14.) either
lying himself, or charging <hi>Ester</hi> with impudent lying and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The Book of <hi>Wisdome</hi> is so farre off from being any book of the

Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Highest in authority.</note> the authority of these holy writings, inspired of God,
is highest in the Church, as the authority of God, whereunto no

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Sufficient in themselves.</note> the bookes of holy Scripture are so sufficient for the
knowledge of Christian Religion, that they doe most plentifully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all Doctrine necessary to salvation, they being perfectly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to instruct to salvation in themselves, and all other imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

it followeth, that wee need no unwriten verities, no traditions or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of men, no Canon of Councels, no sentences of Fathers,
much lesse Decrees of Popes, for to supply any supposed defect of
the writen Word, or for to give us more perfect directions in the
worship of God, and the way of life, then is already expressed in
the Canonicall Scriptures, <hi>Mat. 23. 8. Joh. 5. 39. Mat.</hi> 15. 9. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
these holy Scriptures are the rule, the line, the square, and light,
whereby to examine and try all judgements and sayings of men and
Angels, <hi>Joh. 12. 48. Gal.</hi> 1. 9. All traditions, revelations, decrees of
Councels, opinions of Doctors, &amp;c. are to bee imbraced so farre
forth as they may bee proved out of the Divine Scriptures, and not
otherwise, so that from them onely all Doctrine concerning our
salvation must bee drawn and derived, that onely is to bee taken for
truth in matters appertaining to Christian Religion, which is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

16.</hi> 29. 31. Insomuch that all Prophesies, Revelations, and Miracles,
are to bee judged by their consent with the Law of God writen by
<hi>Moses,</hi> to which nothing is to bee added, nor any thing to bee taken

the triall of those things which <hi>Moses</hi> did write of him (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 46.)
being none other in any respect, but even the same whom <hi>Moses</hi> in
the Law and the Prophets (which were the interpreters, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
upon the Law writen by <hi>Moses</hi>) did write of, <hi>John</hi> 1. 45.
and his Apostles preaching the Gospel among all Nations, taught
nothing beside that which <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets had spoken to bee
fulfilled in Christ, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> testifieth, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 22. saying, as he taught,
all the rest of the Apostles did teach.</p>
                  <p>Where doe you finde that the Scriptures are able to instruct us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to salvation?</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. doth expressely affirm it; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which may bee gathered out of the two Verses following, doe

1. God being author of these books, they must needs be perfect, as
he himself is, who being for his wisdome able, and for his love to his
Church willing to set down such a rule as may guide them to eternall
life, hath not failed herein.</p>
                  <p>2. They are profitable to teach all true doctrine, and to confute the
false; to correct all disorder private and publique, and to inform
men in the way of righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>3. The man of God, that is, the Preacher and Minister of the Word,
is thereby made compleat and perfect, sufficiently furnished unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
good work or duty of the Ministery.</p>
                  <p>How doth this last reason hold?</p>
                  <p>Most strongly, for the people being to learn of the Minister, what
to beleeve and what to doe, and more being required of him that must
be the eye and mouth of all the rest, if he may be perfectly instructed
by the Scriptures, they are much more able to give every common
man sufficient instruction. Again, seeing the Minister is bound to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
the whole counsell of God to his people, (<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27.) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto fully furnished out of the treasury of the Word of
God; it followeth that by him out of the Scriptures they may also
be abundantly taught to salvation.</p>
                  <p>What further proof have you of the sufficiency of the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>The five Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was the first holy Scripture delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Church, was sufficient for the instruction of the people of
that time, in all that God required at their hands, as appeareth by that
they were forbidden to adde any thing unto it, or to take any thing
from it, but to doe that onely which was prescribed by the Law,
(<hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32.) The Prince and the people are commanded to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thereby altogether, and not to depart from it, either to the right
hand or to the left, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.) How much more the Law and the
Prophets (which did more at large set forth the Doctrine delivered
by <hi>Moses</hi> both in precepts and promises, in practice and example)
was sufficient for the time that succeeded untill <hi>John</hi> the Baptist?
<hi>Mat. 11. 12. Luk.</hi> 16. 16.</p>

                  <p>Why must the interpretation of words be had out of the originall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages?</p>
                  <p>Because in them onely the Scriptures are for the letter to be held
authenticall; and as the water is most pure in the Fountain by the
springing thereof, so the right understanding of the words of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures is most certain in the originall tongues of Hebrew and
Greek, in which they were first written, and delivered to the Church,
out of the which Languages they must be truly translated for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55421:18"/>
of them that have not the knowledge of those tongues.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That all Translations are to be judged, examined, and reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Text of the ancient Hebrew and originall Chaldee, in
which the old Testament was printed, and the Greek Text, in which
the new Testament was written; and consequently that the vulgar
Latin Translation approved by the Tridentine Councell for the onely
authenticall Text, is no further to be received of true Christians then
it agreeth with the originall of the Hebrew and Greek Text.</p>
                  <p>But what say you of the Greeke Translation of the old Testament,
commonly called the Septuagint, approved by the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
                  <p>The same as we say of other Translations; for although the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
used that Translation which was commonly received and read
among the Gentiles and Jews that dwelt amongst them, where it
differed not in sense from the true Hebrew, yet where it differed from
it they left it, as by many examples may be confirmed, (<hi>vide Hieron.

words and phrases, upon which the best Translators cannot agree?</p>
                  <p>Although in the Hebrew Copy there hath been observed by the
<hi>Nazarites</hi> some very few differences of words by similitude of letters
and points; and by the Learned in the Greek tongue there are like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of reading noted in the Greek Text of the new Testament,
which came by fault of writers; yet in most by circumstance of the
place and conference of other places, the true reading may be discerned;
and albeit in all it cannot, nor the Translator in all places determine
the true interpretation, yet this diversity or difficulty can make no
difference or uncertainty in the sum and substance of Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
because the Ten Commandements and the principall Texts of
Scripture on which the Articles of our faith are grounded, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
instituted, the form of prayer taught, (which contain the sum
or substance of Christian religion) are without all such diversity of
reading or difficulty of translating, so plainly set down, and so precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
translated by consent of all men learned in the tongues, that no man
can make any doubt of them, or pick any quarrell against them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Because the Spirit of God alone is the certain interpreter of his Word
written by his Spirit; for no man knoweth the things pertaining to
God, but the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. and no prophesie of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is of any mans own interpretation; for prophesie was not brought
by the will of man, but the holy men of God spake as they were led
by the holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. The interpretation therefore must be
by the same Spirit by which the Scripture was written, of which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  <p>That no interpretation of holy Fathers, Popes, Councels, Customs,

there were many beleevers amongst the Gentiles in the time of

kept in Jury) as <hi>Job</hi> and his friends.</p>
                  <p>Those (if any such were after the Law (for <hi>Job</hi> was before) were
bound to have the Scripture when it was delivered by God, and the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The book of the Law was lost for many yeers, as appeareth
by 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 8. and yet the Church was then; therefore it may
want it.</p>
                  <p>The losse of that book doth argue rather the carelesnesse of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The Church of Christians many yeers after Christ, wanted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55421:19"/>
the Scriptures of the New Testament, and contented themselves
with bare teaching.</p>
                  <p>First, though the Church for certain yeers then had not the New,
yet they had the Old.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there passed not many yeers, before the Gospels, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
of the Apostles were writen, and in the mean time, their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. There bee many poore Country-men, as Plough-men, and
Shepherds, which never learned to read, which yet are saved,

howsoever they may read Translations.</p>
                  <p>Will it not follow hereof, that preaching and expounding of the
Scriptures, may bee neglected as unnecessary?</p>
                  <p>No, for God hath appointed not onely reading, but also preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Word, especially to apply it to the use of all sorts of men
to their eternall salvation, <hi>Rom. 10. 13, &amp;c.</hi> So were the Prophets,
Interpreters of the Law, (as is before shewed) the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
taught in the Chaire of <hi>Moses, Matth.</hi> 23. 2. The Eunuch could
not understand the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> without an interpreter, <hi>Act. 8.

means unto salvation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. and the people by reading
and hearing of the Scriptures are better prepared to receive profit
by preaching, not discharged from hearing the Preacher.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of all that hath been delivered hitherto?</p>
                  <p>That wee should labour for a due knowledge of the true God,
that wee may know what wee worship, and worship what wee know,
1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. Joh.</hi> 4. 22. &amp; 17. 3. That this knowledge of God is
to bee had partly by his Works, namely, so much as may serve to
convince man, and make him unexcusable, <hi>Rom. 1. 19, 20. Act.</hi> 14. 15.
but most sufficiently by his Word contained in the holy Scriptures,
which therefore are called his Testimonies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 14. because
they testifie of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. what hee is, and how hee will bee
served of us.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that forasmuch as all that is writen in the Word of God,
is writen for our instruction, and learning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. therefore we
being prepared by true Prayer, sanctified by Faith, and seasoned
with the Spirit of sobriety and humility, may safely learn so much as
is revealed in the Scripture for our profiting in the knowledge of
God.</p>

                  <p>Yea, so saith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> but hee sheweth also that it was

                  <p>But how come you to perswade your selfe that there is such a God?</p>
                  <p>Beside infinite testimonies of the Scriptures, as <hi>Gen. 1. 1. Psal.</hi> 19.
<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the common consent of all Nations approveth this Truth, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worship any God, or gods, then none at all; and though man by
nature doth desire to bee exalted, and in respect of himself despiseth
all other creatures, as Wood and Stone, yet when a peece of wood is
framed out like a man, and set in the Temple, and man conceiveth an
opinion, that it is a God, hee falleth down and worshippeth it, (<hi>Esa.
44.</hi> 15. 17.)</p>
                  <p>How then commeth it to passe that the wicked say there is no
God? (Psal. 14. 1.)</p>
                  <p>First, though upon a sudden passion they may seem to say so, as
the Devill laboureth to tempt them, yet their very Conscience after
doth check them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they deny rather Gods providence, then his beeing, as

the very flashing of hell fire; which is a strong reason, to shew that
there is a God, before whose Judgement seat he must answer for his

                  <p>There is a devill that suggesteth a temptation against God, into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>

                  <p>Why is not all nature able to teach us what God is?</p>
                  <p>Because no work is able perfectly to expresse the worker thereof,

                     <hi>Exod. 3. 13. Moses</hi> asketh this question of God, Behold, when I shall

                  <p>What learn you out of <hi>Moses</hi> his question?</p>
                  <p>First, that we be carefull to be instructed in all things concerning
our calling, therby to be able to answer all doubts that may be moved;
Secondly, that asking any thing concerning God, as of his name or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55421:21"/>
nature, we must ask it of himself, who because now he speaketh not
but by his Ministers, Interpreters of the Scriptures, (2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20.
Hosea</hi> 12. 10.) we must have our recourse unto them.</p>
                  <p>What learn you out of Gods answer?</p>
                  <p>That the proper name of God is I am that I am, or (as the Hebrew
soundeth) I will be what I will be; the Hebrews using the future
time for the present as that which noteth a continuance.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by these words?</p>
                  <p>Hereby is set forth the manner of the beeing and essence of God,
far otherwise then the proper names of men, which declare either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their nature and beeing, or else not the whole and full
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Is there nothing of God to be known besides his name?</p>
                  <p>Nothing as touching his beeing, falling under our weak and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
capacity.</p>
                  <p>What names of God in the Scripture are derived from these words?</p>
                  <p>Two, the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the name <hi>Jah,</hi> both which being
drawn from this description of God, doth set forth his essence and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
teaching us, that his eternall and almighty beeing (whom no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is able to conceive) dependeth of no other cause, but standeth of
himself.</p>
                  <p>How is God onely said to be, seeing the creatures have their beeing
also?</p>
                  <p>God is said onely to be, because he onely is of himself, and all other
things have their beeing from him, so that in comparison nothing hath
a beeing but God. Therefore the Prophet saith, <hi>Esa.</hi> 40. 17. that all
nations before him are nothing, yea to him lesse then nothing; and if
men be nothing, for whom the world vvas made, hovv much more
are all creatures in heaven and earth nothing before him, and to him
lesse then nothing?</p>
                  <p>Can you from hence define what God is?</p>
                  <p>He must have the art and logick of God himself, that must give a
perfect distinction of God, but he may in such sort be described as
he may be discerned from all false gods, and all creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                  <p>Why can there no perfect definition of God be given?</p>
                  <p>Forasmuch as God is in himself eternall, infinite, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
the first cause of all causes and effects, there can no definition be
given of him; seeing every definition is an explication of the nature
of the thing defined by words expressing the materiall and formall
cause thereof, but of the first cause there can be no causes, therefore
no words to expresse them; for these over-reaching tearms of thing,
beeing, somewhat, nature, &amp;c. which seem to contain the Word of
God as well as all other things created by him, doe not expresse any
materiall cause of God, neither doe they contain these words God and
creature, as the generall doth his specials or kinds, but are spoken of
them equivocally, so that the tearm onely, and not the definition
of the tearm doth agree to them; for in the kinds or specials of one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
there is no priority of nature, as is between the cause and effect,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55421:22"/>
neither is this word Cause affirmed of God, but as a tearm of the art
of Logick; and if substance be that which upholdeth accidents, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
teacheth, neither may God be called a substance, for that in him
are no accidents, but if substance be taken generally for a beeing, it
may be said that God is a substance, yet none otherwise then as he is a
beeing, thing, nature, &amp;c. And if there be no materiall cause, there can
be no formall cause of God; for although we reade in the Scripture
the form of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. yet the form is not there taken for any
cause of God: but either for that which God indeed is, or for that
glory which of right belongeth unto him; for in speaking of God,
whom no words of man are able to expresse, the holy Ghost often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
condescending to the weaknesse of our understanding, useth such
tearms, as being known to men, doe signifie something that is like to
that, which God indeed is of himself, that we may understand so much
as is expedient for us to know of him.</p>
                  <p>Whence may the description of God be taken?</p>
                  <p>From the things whereby he doth manifest himself, called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
his name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 1, 2, 3. among which the chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
are his Attributes or Properties.</p>
                  <p>What are the Properties or Attributes of God?<note place="margin">Of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are essentiall faculties of God according to the diverse manner
of his working, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 16. Psal.</hi> 145.</p>
                  <p>Are they communicable with the creatures?</p>
                  <p>No; yet of some of them there are some shadows and glimpses in
Men and Angels; (as Wisdome, Holinesse, Justice, Mercy, &amp;c.) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some are so peculiar to the divine Essence, that the like of them
are not to be found in the creatures, (as simplenesse, infinitenesse, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
&amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>How may these Properties be considered?</p>
                  <p>They may be considered either in themselves, as they are essentiall,
or in their works, or effects, which are all perfect either as they be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
or as they be actuall; absolute in himself, by which he is able to
shew them more then ever he will; (as he is able to doe more then ever
he will doe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 9. God is able of stones to raise children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>)
actuall, is that which he sheweth in the Creation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the vvorld (as <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 7. All things that he will he doth,
&amp;c.) Again, something we may conceive of his Essence affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
knowing that all perfections which vve apprehend must be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto God, and that after a more excellent manner then can be
apprehended; as that he is in himself, by himself, and of himselfe,
that he is one true God and holy; but much more by deniall or
by removing all imperfections whatsoever, as of composition by the
titles of simple, spirituall and incorporeall; of all circumscription of
time, by the title of eternall; of all bounds of place, by that of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
of all possibility of motion, by those titles of unchangeable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
and such like.</p>
                  <p>What description can you make of God by these Properties?</p>
                  <p>God is a Spirit eternall;<note place="margin">A description of God.</note> or more fully, God is a spirituall substance,
having his beeing of himself, infinitely great, and good, <hi>Joh. 4. 24. &amp;
8. 58. Exod. 3. 14. &amp; 34. 6, 7. Ps.</hi> 145. 3. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55421:22"/>
What learn you hence?</p>
                  <p>To acknowledge both my beeing and wel-beeing from him, and
for him alone, <hi>Acts 17. 28. 1 Cor. 10. 30. Eph.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say that God is a substance?</p>
                  <p>God is such a thing as hath a beeing in himself, of himself, and
which giveth a beeing to all other things.</p>
                  <p>What mean you by that addition Of himself?</p>
                  <p>It hath a secret opposition to all creatures, which have a beeing, but
not of themselves, whereas God alone is he in whom we live, and
move, and have our beeing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. which proveth that he alone
hath his beeing of himself.</p>
                  <p>How many things conceive you of God,<note place="margin">God a Spirit.</note> when you say that he is a
Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Sixe things.</p>
                  <p>First, that he is a living substance.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he is incorruptible.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he is incorporeall, without body, flesh, bloud, or bones,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
for a spirit hath no such matter, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that he is invisible, (<hi>i.</hi>) he cannot be seen with any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
eye, neither can any man possibly see him.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that he is intangible, not felt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that he is indivisible, (<hi>i.</hi>) he cannot be divided.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>How prove you that God is invisible, and not to be seen with carnall
eyes?</p>
                  <p>That no man hath seen God, is plainly set down, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 12. that
no man can see God, is as plainly proved, <hi>Exod. 33. 20. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 16. and
besides Scripture, the same is also manifest by reason, for we cannot see
our own souls which are ten thousand times a more grosse substance
then God, much lesse can we see God which is a most pure and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
substance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. We read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1. that God appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 24. that he shewed himself to the Israelites.</p>
                  <p>God gave them indeed some outward sights whereby they might be
certain of his presence, and therefore it is said, that the Lord appeared
unto them, but his substance or essence they saw not; for to know
God perfectly, is proper to God onely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 46.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. We read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. that man was made according to the image
of God: It would seem therefore that God is corporeall and visible as
man is.</p>
                  <p>The image of God consisteth not in the shape and figure of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but in the mind, and integrity of nature, or (as the Scripture saith)
in wisdome, righteousnesse, and holinesse, <hi>Col. 3. 10. Eph.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Why then doth the Scripture attribute unto him hands, feet,
&amp;c?</p>
                  <p>The Scripture so speaketh of him as we are able to conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and therefore in these and such like speeches humbleth it self to
our capacity, attributing members unto God to signifie the like acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in him.</p>
                  <p>To what use serveth this doctrine, that God is a Spirit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:55421:23"/>
It teacheth us, first, to worship him in spirit and in truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23, 24.
Secondly, to drive away all fond imaginations and grosse conceipts of
God out of our hearts, and all pictures &amp; similitudes of God out of our
sights: that we frame not any image of him in our minds, as ignorant
folks doe, who think him to be an old man sitting in heaven, &amp;c. For
seeing that God was never seen, wherunto shall he be resembled? <hi>Moses</hi>
urgeth this point hard and often to the Israelites, saying, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 12.
they heard a voice but saw no similitude; and addeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Take ye
therefore good heed unto your selves; he saith not only take heed, but
take good heed, and therefore take good heed; for (saith he again) ye
saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you
in <hi>Horeb</hi> out of the midst of the fire; then he commeth in the next
four verses to the thing that they must therefore take heed of, that ye
corrupt not your selves and make you a graven Image, the similitude
of any figure, the likenesse of male or female, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>How may the Attributes or Properties of God be distinguished?</p>
                  <p>Some doe concern the perfection of his essence, some his life, which
in God be one and the same thing, distinguished onely for our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>His absolute constitution by which he is wholly compleat within

sufficeth himself, having all things from himself, and in himself; Or

is in God is perfect, <hi>Gen. 17. 1. Psa. 16. 2. &amp; 50. 12. Rom. 11.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the property of God, whereby he hath all fulnesse of delight
and contentment in himself.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from the perfection of God?</p>
                  <p>That he is to seek his own glory, and not the glory of any in all that

                  <p>They are confuted that think God is moved to will or nill things in
respect of the creatures, as men that seeing a miserable man are moved
to pity; whereas God of himself, and in himself is moved to save or
reject, (we speak here of reprobation, not of condemnation) to receive
some, and to cast away others.</p>
                  <p>What else?</p>
                  <p>That all which he doth is perfect, howsoever he deals with us.</p>

                  <p>Why be these two counted the principall properties of God?</p>
                  <p>Because they are not onely incommunicable themselves, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
those which concern the life of God have some resemblance in
the creature) but also make all other properties of God incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable.</p>

What is simplenesse or singlenesse in God?<note place="margin">Of the simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property in God, whereby every thing that is in
God is God himself; therefore without parts, mixture, or compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
invisible, impassible, all essence, whence he is not called onely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but holinesse, not onely just, but justice, &amp;c. <hi>Exod. 33. 19, 20</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What gather you from hence?</p>
                  <p>First, that God hath no qualities nor adjuncts in him as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
have, but such as are attributed unto him for our capacity,
when it is his nature this is such, 1 <hi>John 1. 5. 7. John 5. 26. John
14.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Gods essence or substance cannot be augmented or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
diminished, that his nature and will cannot be changed; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
constant without shadow of change, and will be always
such as he hath been from all eternity, <hi>Numb. 23. 19. James 1. 17.
Psal. 33. 11. Esa.</hi> 46. 10.</p>
                  <p>By what light of reason may it be proved that God is thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable?</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever is changed, must needs be changed either to the
worse, or to the better, or in a state equall to the former: but
God cannot be changed from the better to the worse, for so hee
should become of perfect, imperfect; and to exchange from the worse
to the better, it is impossible also, for then he should have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
before. Lastly, if he should alter from an equall condition
to an equall, so that he should forgoe some good which before he
had, and assume some other which before he had not, both before
and after this change he should be imperfect, being destitute of
some part of that good which appertained to him, which to affirm
is high blasphemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But divers things are objected against that immutability of
Gods nature and will: as first, that in the mystery of incarnation,
God was made man, which before he was not.</p>
                  <p>That was done not by any conversion or change of the divinity, but
by the assumption of the humanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If God cannot change his mind, why is it said, that he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that he made man?</p>
                  <p>The repentance attributed so often to God in the Scriptures, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
no mutation in Gods nature, but in his actions, mutably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
from all eternity; and the Scripture in this speaketh after
our manner, that we may better understand what is the nature of
God against sin.</p>
                  <p>Declare how that is.</p>
                  <p>When we are grieved with any thing, we doe then repent us
that ever we did that thing for which we are grieved; and so is
God said to repent him that ever he made man, with whom he was
angry, to shew that he was unfainedly and highly displeased with the
evill ways of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Did not God then change his mind when he drowned the world?</p>
                  <p>No; but then he did execute that which from everlasting he had
decreed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55421:24"/>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. It is said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 14. The Lord changed his mind from the
evill which he threatned to his people.</p>
                  <p>That is still after the manner of men; for man, because he is but man,
cannot speak unto God but as a man: and therefore Gods speaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
unto man like a man, because else man should not understand
what God is, nor what his will is.</p>
                  <p>Shew me one example hereof in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> prayed for the Israelites he used many reasons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Lord, (but especially to confirm his own hope) at the last he
said thus, Turn from thy fierce wrath, and change thy mind from this
evill towards thy people; thus did <hi>Moses</hi> speak to God, and if he had
spoken to a mortall man he could have said no more nor no lesse,
for mans speech is according to his capacity, and both are limited,
and beyond himself he cannot goe: therefore when he shews what
the Lord did, he saith, he changed his mind, which was as much
as he could conceive of God concerning that matter. Thus we speak
as well as we can, yet in a broken and imperfect manner to God, as
little children speak to their nurses; and Almighty God speaks in a
broken and imperfect language to us again, for our weaknesse and
understandings sake, as the nurse doth to the child: for if the nurse
should speak so perfectly to the child, as she could to one of greater
capacity, the child would not understand her: so if God should speak
unto us as he could, and according to his own nature, we were never
able to understand him, nor conceive his meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. The promises and threatnings of God are not always fulfilled;
therefore it seemeth that sometimes he changeth his mind.</p>
                  <p>His promises are made with condition of faith and obedience,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 13. and his threatnings with an exception of conversion
and repentance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
                  <p>What use may we make of this doctrine, of the simplenesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse
of Gods nature?</p>
                  <p>First, it ministreth comfort unto the faithfull for strength of their
weak faith, whilest they consider that the mercy and clemency of
God is in all perfection, and without change unto them; for this is
the foundation of our hope and comfort in this life, that he doth
not now love, and now hate, but whom he loveth, to the end he
loveth them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it giveth matter of terror unto the wicked, whilest they
consider his wrath and severity against them to be in most ful measure,
the one and the other being God himself. It may also make us fear to
offend him, because all his threatnings are unchangeable except we
repent.</p>

of place, being present every where, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, and filling all places wholly at all times with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
for he is in all places, in heaven and in earth, and the sea and hell,
&amp; all at one time; neither can he be contained in any compasse of place,
(as is a man or Angel or any other creature) but he is in all places, and
filleth all places at once, and is beyond all compasse of place that we

                  <p>Is God every where in speculation only?</p>
                  <p>No, for he worketh in every thing which he beholdeth.</p>
                  <p>How then is he every where?</p>
                  <p>He is every where essentially, for his essence is not contained in any

                  <p>Doth he not remove himselfe from place to place?</p>
                  <p>He filleth heaven and earth and all places, therefore he can neither
depart from any place, nor be absent from any place.</p>
                  <p>Is he not half in one half of the world, &amp; half in the other half of the world?</p>
                  <p>No, but as the whole soul is in the whole body and every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

                  <p>To what purpose and use serveth this doctrine of the immensity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
greatnesse of God?</p>
                  <p>The consideration thereof should put us in mind, that nothing
which is vile and base should be offered unto God in the worship of
him. Secondly, it serveth to drive all grosse and idolatrous conceits
of God out of our minds, and to detect and bewray the impiety and
blasphemy of those persons, who either by making of pictures (as they
thought) of God, or by maintaining of them, being made; or by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them to stand still without defacing, (especially if it be known)
have thereby denied God to be incomprehensible. For those pictures
and resemblances of God which ignorant men have forged in their
own brain doe tell us, and say, that God may be comprehended and
contained within a place, yea, in a small place, or in any place, as a man
or other creature, which is most high blasphemy against the Majesty
of Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>What is his eternity?</p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property of God whereby his essence is exempted
from all measure of time,<note place="margin">Gods eternity.</note> and therefore is the first and the last, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Psal. 90. 2. Rev.</hi> 1. 8. 11.</p>
                  <p>In what respect is God called eternall in the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That he hath been from all eternity without beginning, is now, and

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That all times are present with him continually, and so nothing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That he is the Author of everlastingnesse unto others, because he
hath promised to give his children of his eternall goodnesse, and to
have a continuall care of them through all eternity, and will have a

                  <p>Is it necessary that we should know this?</p>
                  <p>Yea, that we may here stay our selves with the certain hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life grounded upon his eternity.</p>
                  <p>How may that hope be grounded upon his eternity?</p>
                  <p>Very well; for God being eternall, he can for ever preserve us, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he hath promised, he will for ever preserve us, <hi>Ps.</hi> 48. 14. &amp; 103. 17.
Hereby likewise are we strengthned not only in the immortality of our
soule, but also in the immortality of our bodies after the resurrection,
considering that by his everlastingnesse he giveth continuall beeing to
such of his creatures, as he is pleased to give a perpetuall continuance
unto.</p>

Why else is God said to be eternall?</p>
                  <p>That so he might be discerned from all other things created; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is like unto God, as the Scriptures testifie: <hi>Esa. 40. 18. Psalm.
113.</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p>How is God said to be alone everlasting, seeing Angels and soules of
men shall be also everlasting?</p>
                  <p>In regard of the time to come they are everlasting, but not in regard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of the time past; for though they shall continue alwayes, yet they had
their beginning, which cannot be said of God; who therefore is called
<hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> Rev. 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>Their continuance is such as it is not absolute and by it selfe, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
proceeding from the power of God who is able if so he pleased to give
unto them an end as well as a beginning, in which respect God is said
onely to have immortality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>Is it necessary we hold God to be eternall, that so he may be discerned
from all things created?</p>
                  <p>Yea, we hold it in that respect for two causes.</p>
                  <p>First, because certain hereticks have thought either all the creatures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or some of the creatures at least, to be derived from the very nature
and essence of God by propagation, as children from their mothers
womb.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that all idolatrous cogitations of God may be excluded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
out of our minds.</p>
                  <p>What is the life of God?<note place="margin">The life of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property of God, whereby the divine nature is in
perpetuall action, living and moving in it selfe; hereof is that speech
in the Scripture so often used, The Lord liveth: hereof likewise is that
form of asseveration or oath used so often both by God, <hi>Num. 14. 21.
Rom.</hi> 14. 11. and by man, 1 <hi>Sam. 19. 6. Jer.</hi> 4. 2. As the Lord liveth; and

of the living God, <hi>Psal. 42. 2. Jer. 10. 10. Heb.</hi> 3. 12. &amp; 10. 31.</p>
                  <p>Why is God called a living God?</p>
                  <p>For four causes; first, because he only hath life in himselfe and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
himselfe, and all other creatures have life from him; <hi>Psalm. 35.
10.</hi> &amp; 36. 9. 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 16. John</hi> 5. 26.</p>
                  <p>Because he is the onely giver of life unto man, <hi>Genes. 2. 7. Acts</hi>

                     <hi>17.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>Because he is the God especially (not of the dead, but) of the living; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 32. for all live unto him.</p>

which have no life in them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>What may be known as touching the life of God?</p>
                  <p>As all life is active in it self, so the chief life (such as is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

What is the knowledge or wisdome of God?<note place="margin">Of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property of God whereby hee doth distinctly
and perfectly know himselfe, and of and by himselfe all other things
that are, were, or shall be, or can be; understanding all things aright,
together with the reason of them: <hi>Mat. 11. 27. Heb. 4. 13. Job 12. 13.
Psal. 139. 11. John 21. 17. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>How many things doe you conceive of God by his attributes?</p>
                  <p>Four things. 1. That he knoweth all things. 2. That he can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in nothing. 3. That he most wisely hath disposed and ordered
all things, insomuch that he cannot justly be reproved in any of them.
4. That he keepeth not his wisdom to himselfe, but bestoweth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his creatures, so that whatsoever wisdom they have, they have it
from God.</p>
                  <p>After what sort doth God understand and things?</p>
                  <p>Not by certain notions abstracted from the things themselves, but
by his own essence; nor successively (remembring one thing after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
or by discourse of reason, but by one and the same eternall and
immutable act of understanding, he conceives at once all things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have been or not.</p>
                  <p>How great is this wisdom of God?</p>
                  <p>It is infinite even as God is infinite <hi>Psal. 147. 5. Esa.</hi> 40. 28.</p>

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.</p>
                  <p>What is the fore-knowledge of God?</p>
                  <p>That by vvhich he most assuredly foreseeth all things that are to
come, <hi>Acts 2. 23. 1 Pet.</hi> 1, 2. Though this be not properly spoken of
God, but by reason of men to vvhom things are past, or to come.</p>
                  <p>Is this fore-knowledge of God the cause why things are done?</p>
                  <p>No, but his vvill.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That by vvhich he doth most rightly perceive the best reason of all
things that are or can be, <hi>Job 12. 12, 13. Prov. 8. 14. Eph.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>For the clearer knowledge of this wisdom of God, what is there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be considered?</p>
                  <p>For the better understanding of this attribute,<note place="margin">Gods absolute wisdome and knowledge.</note> vve must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the vvisdom of God is tvvo-fold. First, it is absolute, and
vve doe so tearm it, because by it God can, and doth simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
knovv all things from all eternity: <hi>Heb. 4. 13. Psalm.</hi> 94. 11.
Secondly, it is speciall, vvhereby he doth not only knovv his elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as he knovveth all things else, but also he doth acknovvledge
them for his ovvn, and doth discern them from others, and love them
before others; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which doe the Scriptures properly speak, when they attribute wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to God?</p>
                  <p>They speak then of his absolute knovvledge, vvhereby he doth not
only knovv alvvayes, and most perfectly himselfe and the vvhole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his mind, but also understandeth and knovveth all his vvorks,
and the vvorks of all his creatures, past, present, and to come; vvith all
the causes and circumstances of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55421:26"/>
How doe the Scriptures speak of this absolute knowledge?</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures speak of it two wayes, either of the knowledge it
self, or else of the things known, and so they shew first, what and what
manner of thing it is, and secondly, what things are known of God.</p>
                  <p>Now tell me what knowledge is in God, and what wisdom doth best
agree to his divine nature.</p>
                  <p>The best way to find out that, is first to consider what wisdom and
knowledge doth not agree with his nature and essence: for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and wisdom are infinitely greater than any we can affirm to be in
God.</p>
                  <p>How shall we find what knowledge is not agreeing with his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>This is the best way; we must consider and set before us all the
kinds of knowledge, and all the wayes and means whereby any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is to be attained unto amongst men and Angels, then shall we
see that the wisdome and knowledge of God are farre more excellent
every way, then the most excellent that can be found or thought upon
amongst men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>Declare then by what wayes and means we know a thing.</p>
                  <p>By two wayes or means we doe know all that we doe know; one
way is by our senses, <hi>viz.</hi> by hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;
another way is by our understanding.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God know any thing by senses or no?</p>
                  <p>He cannot, because he is not as man, but is a Spirit, and bodilesse;
and therefore hath no senses.</p>
                  <p>Why then doe the Scriptures speak of the eyes, eares, &amp;c. of God?</p>
                  <p>Although the Scriptures doe attribute eyes to God whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
all things, and eares whereby he heareth all things, &amp;c. yet
indeed he hath none of all these, but these be figurative speeches used
for our capacity and understanding, signifying that nothing is hidden
from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Whether then doth God know things by understanding, or no?</p>
                  <p>Yea, but not as we doe.</p>
                  <p>Why, what manner of knowledge is that which we have by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding?</p>
                  <p>It is either an opinion, or a beleefe, or a skill and learning.</p>
                  <p>What is an opinion?</p>
                  <p>An opinion is no certain and evident knowledge of a thing, but is
still doubtfull what to affirm or deny; and therefore such a knowledge
is not in God, for he knoweth certainly.</p>
                  <p>What manner of thing is beleefe or faith?</p>
                  <p>It is a certain, but not an evident knowledge; for look what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
onely, that we doe not see nor know by the light of naturall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
therefore it is no evident knowledge; but it is a certain and
true knowledge, because he is most true which revealed it unto us; for
faith or beleefe is a most certain knowledge grounded upon the report
of another.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth this kind of knowing things agree with the nature of
God or no?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55421:27"/>
No, for God knoweth all things in himselfe and of himselfe; but
not by the report of another.</p>
                  <p>What say you to skill and learning, that is both a certain and evident
knowledge of things; doth not that agree with the nature of God?</p>
                  <p>Such knowledge doth not agree with his nature.</p>
                  <p>Why so?</p>
                  <p>Because it cometh by knowledge that went before, and it is gotten
by reasoning and debating of things, by defining and dividing, and
by searching out the causes of things; but in God is neither before,
nor after; first, nor last; and God hath no knowledge after such a sort.
Again, our knowledge which way soever it be considered, whether it
be a habit in us, or an action in us, is imperfect; for we know not all
things, and those things which we doe know we know not all at once,
but one thing after another, and yet still but in part.</p>
                  <p>Declare then in a word, how God doth know all things.</p>
                  <p>God doth most perfectly know and understand all things at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;
without any conceipt of mind, altering this way or that way.</p>
                  <p>All our knowledge is a thing distinguished from our mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
is it so in God?</p>
                  <p>No, for the knowledge or wisdom of God is a most simple and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
essence, yea, it is his very essence and substance, and God is all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
all wisdom, and all understanding, infinitely more then all men
and Angels can conceive.</p>
                  <p>Doth God know and understand every thing particularly?</p>
                  <p>Yea, he knoweth the natures and properties of every particular
thing.</p>
                  <p>How prove you that?</p>
                  <p>By the Scripture, and by reason, for the Scripture saith, that God
saw every thing that he made that it was good; this is not spoken ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
of all, but especially of every one creature. Again, reason makes
it manifest by three examples in the Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. First, <hi>Adam</hi>
gave to every living thing a proper name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 20. according to its
proper nature; whereby it appeareth that <hi>Adam</hi> had a distinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
knowledge of every thing: how much more then had God this
especiall knowledge of every particular thing, who gave to <hi>Adam</hi>
whatsoever wisdom and knowledge he had?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">1 King. 4. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdom and knowledge was so great that he was
able to dispute, and did thereby dispute of the nature of all trees, plants,
fishes, fowl, worms, beasts, and all naturall things; as one that was
most skilfull in them: how much more then doth God know all things
and their natures particularly, who gave such wisdom to <hi>Solomon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 29, 30.</note> our Saviour Christ saith of the Father, that all our haires
be numbred by him, and that a Sparrow falleth not to the ground
without the will of our heavenly Father; if not without his will, then
not without his knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God know all the motions of our wills and our thoughts?</p>
                  <p>Yea, God doth certainly know the motions of the will, and
the thoughts of the heart in all men, and the issue of them all,
which is manifest by these places of Scripture following; <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55421:27"/>
                     <hi>Psa. 94. 11. Pro. 21. 1. Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. Hereof it is that we cite him to be
the witnesse of our hearts when we swear by him.</p>
                  <p>Whether hath God the knowledge of all evils or no?</p>
                  <p>God knoweth all evils and sins which lie lurking in all mens hearts,
and this is manifest by these places of Scripture following, <hi>Gen. 6. 5.
Psal. 69. 6. Job 11. 11. Psal.</hi> 90. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>What if he did not know all these evils?</p>
                  <p>It is impossible but he must know them for two causes: First, if he
did not, his knowledge would be imperfect. Secondly, if he did not
know them, he could not be a just Judge, neither could he reward eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one according to his works and thoughts, which to affirm were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
and blasphemous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> That which is nothing cannot be known, but sinne and evill is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
(for it is nothing else but a taking away, or failing of good,
and it is a meer corruption) and therefore sin and evill cannot
be known of God.</p>
                  <p>We know vvhat is evill, and vve know evill things, and vve doe
discern them from good things, but we know evill onely by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that is good; as vve know nothing by something, darknesse by
light, death by life, sicknesse by health, vice by vertue; thus by the
knowledge of good evill is known unto us, and therefore seeing as
God (vvho is the chiefe good) he doth by himself know all good
things, he must of necessity also know and understand all the evill that
is in all good things.</p>
                  <p>Whether may God know those things which are not?</p>
                  <p>God knoweth the things vvhich are not, and he doth also truly
know the things which shall never come to passe.</p>
                  <p>What reason can you yeeld for this?</p>
                  <p>The reason is, because he knoweth all things by his essence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he knoweth all things which are subject to his divine essence and
power, and therefore also are possible, but shall never come to passe.</p>
                  <p>But doth he know them eternally, or in time?</p>
                  <p>He knoweth them all eternally; that is, for ever and ever, he knew,
&amp; doth know them, as the Scripture doth testifie, <hi>Eph. 1. 4. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>Can you make this manifest by any earthly comparison?</p>
                  <p>Yea; a builder by vertue of his art doth conceive in his mind the
form of a house, which house he will never build; how much more
can God doe the same, for God can make more worlds, and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he can, and yet he doth it not.</p>
                  <p>Again, although there were never an Eagle in the City, yet we can
conceive in our minds what an Eagle is: much more doth God know
all things vvhich are not in act, and vvhich never shall be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> This is something which you say, but your last similitude of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
doth not hold; for therefore we keep the knowledge of an Eagle
in our minds, though all be gone, because the similitude of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
which was sometimes in the City doth stil remain in our minds
and understandings: But what similitude can there be in the mind
of God, of those things which are not, which never were, and
which never shall be?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55421:28"/>
Yes; the very essence and similitude of God is a similitude of all
those things that may be if he will, which he must needs know,
for he doth most perfectly know himself. And thus if we consider his
power or almighty essence, all things should be done which he can doe
and doth know.</p>
                  <p>Then whether is his knowledge &amp; power the cause of all things, which
are, which have been, and which shall be?</p>
                  <p>The onely fore-knowledge of God alone which the Grecians call
<hi>Theoreticascientia,</hi> that is, a knowledge beholding all things, is not the
cause of things, but his fore-knowledge with his will which the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
call <hi>Practicascientia,</hi> that is, a working knowledge, that is the
cause of things.</p>
                  <p>Whether may the knowledge or wisdome of God faile or be deceived at
any time, or no?</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of God is most certain, and cannot any way be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
for all things are known of God as they are; and all things are,
as they are known of God, and therefore his knowledge cannot any
way be deceived, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But things doe often change and alter, and therefore they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as they are known?</p>
                  <p>Although things be changed and altered, yet God doth know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and although they change and alter, yet his knowledge doth never
alter, nor change, neither is it uncertain.</p>
                  <p>Whether may the knowledge which God hath, be encreased, diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or altered?</p>
                  <p>No, it cannot, it is always the same, firm and constant, and can by
no means be encreased, diminished, nor altered; for he neither forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
any thing, nor is ignorant of any thing, neither is any thing new
unto him, for the Scripture saith, all things are always manifest in his
sight; S. <hi>James</hi> saith (1. 17.) with God is no change nor shadow of
change, therefore his knowledge is always one and the same. <hi>Solomon</hi>
saith, Many devices are in a mans heart, but the Lords counsell shall
stand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 21.</p>
                  <p>But if his knowledge be always one and the same, why doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
say that the Lord will forget our sins, and blot them out of his
remembrance, and remember them no more.</p>
                  <p>These and such like phrases of speech are not to be understood of
the simple knowledge of God, as though he should know them
no more, but of his judiciall knowledge unto punishment; for
although hee doth know and remember our sinnes always most
perfectly, yet he will not know them nor remember them to bring
them into Judgement, and so to punish us for them when we doe
truly repent; that is, they shall be no more judged or punished, or
laid to our charge if we be in Christ, then if he had quite and
clean forgotten them, and never did remember them; and these
speeches serve to arm us against the despair and doubting of our
salvation being truly in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Where is the wisedome of God specially of us to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55421:28"/>
The wisdome of God shineth unto us most cleerly in his works
of Creation and preservation in the vvorld; and not onely in his
vvorks, but also in his Gospel, vvhereby he calleth and gathereth
his Church out of the vvorld to be saved by his Son our Mediator
Jesus Christ, <hi>Eccl. 3. 11. Psal. 104. 24. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>Was this saving wisdome of God known to the Philosophers and

                  <p>No; neither is it communicated to any creature, neither can be,
for it is unconceiveable, as the very essence of God himself is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable

                  <p>What use may we make of this doctrine?<note place="margin">The uses.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, by this doctrine of Gods unspeakable knowledge and vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the true God is discerned from all false gods, and from all
things made; for that is no God vvhich hath not this divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and wisdome which the Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oe attribute to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing our God is such a God as knovveth all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that are done, said, or thought, and seeth into the most hidden
corners and thoughts of our hearts, we must study and learn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to drive all hypocrisie and dissembling from us, and to open our
hearts to God of our own accord, and to beseech him in his own Sons
name to cleanse us from our secret faults.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it must make us to vvalk always before the Lord accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

as men always in his sight and knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it serveth to confirm our faith and trust in the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of God, for although vve know not vvhat to doe, nor hovv
to doe, nor what shift to make in dangers and necessities; yet God

and should uphold in us the certainty of our salvation, because

<hi>Acts 17. 28. Esa.</hi> 40. 29. so that there is no power but is from God.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say, all power is in God? It should seeme by
that speech that there are more powers in God then one?</p>
                  <p>That we may rightly understand what power is in God, it were very
requisite that we did first consider hovv many vvays this vvord Povver
is taken in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Declare then how or in what sense it is taken in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>In the Scripture this vvord Povver is taken tvvo vvays, or in two
senses, sometimes for authority which is grounded upon law, by which
authority one may doe this or that if he be able to doe it; sometimes
it is taken for might and strength, or ability to doe a thing if one hath
authority to doe it: and these are distinguished by two vvords amongst
the Grecians and the Latins. For vvhen the Grecians speak of power
that signifieth authority and right, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. then it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
when they take povver for strength, then it is termed by them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
amongst the Latines being taken the first vvay, it is called <hi>potestas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken the second vvay, that is, for might or strength, it is called
<hi>potentia,</hi> and in English vve call them both povver.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth by your speech that they are not onely distinguished, but that
they may also be separated the one from the other.</p>
                  <p>It is true, for so they are; as for example, a King may have great
force and strength, and by his great povver he may be able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
and destroy a vvhole Country or Kingdome over vvhich
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55421:29"/>
he hath no authority. Again, some King hath power, that is, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over his rebels, and yet hath not power, that is, strength enough to
subdue them; so some perhaps have might and strength enough to
govern and rule another mans wife, another mans children, or another
mans servant, over which he hath no power, that is, authority. And
again, fathers have authority over their own children; all husbands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their own wives; and all masters over their own servants; and yet
all have not power, that is, strength and ability to rule them.</p>
                  <p>I perceive by this which you have said, that in creatures these two
may be separated one from the other, and many times are, but what
are they in God?</p>
                  <p>In God they are not divided, but distinguished; for he hath all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that is, all authority over all things; and he hath all power, that
is, all strength, force, might, and ability to doe all things with all things
at his good pleasure; and this power is not given him, but he hath it
in himself, and of himself, most perfectly, absolutely, and eternally.</p>
                  <p>But of what power doe we speak when we say that God is almighty?
whether doe you mean his right and authority, or his strength and
ability, or both?</p>
                  <p>Both are in God essentially, but when the Scripture speaketh of
Gods omnipotency it meaneth (and so doe we) his strength and ability,
whereby he is able to doe whatsoever he will, not excluding his right.</p>
                  <p>If all power or might be in God, tell me how manifold is this power
which is attributed to God in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>To speak simply, the power of God is but onely one, and a most
simple and single thing, which is his essence and substance, yet for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
respects it is said to be manifold; and it may be considered tvvo
wayes.</p>
                  <p>As it worketh always, and can work in God himself; for God in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
himself doth always understand, will, love, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As it worketh out of God himself in the creatures, as when he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
all things, and doth now work in governing all things, and can
work, if it please him, infinite things; and of this vvorking of Gods
power, do the Scriptures properly speak when they call God almighty.</p>
                  <p>How many ways may Gods power be considered, as it worketh in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?</p>
                  <p>Two ways: First, as it is common to all the three Persons in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Trinity, that is, a power whereby God the Father, the Son, and the
holy Ghost doth understand himself, love himself, and work in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and these actions doe not differ from the essence of God, for that
in God there is nothing which is not his substance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the other working in God himself, is that by which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Father doth beget eternally a Son of his own nature and substance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to himself: and this power of begetting the Son of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
onely to the Father, and not to the Son and holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>How many ways do you consider the power of God working out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?</p>
                  <p>That power which hath relation or respect to things created is
twofold;<note place="margin">Gods absolute power.</note> the first is a power absolute, whereby he is able to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55421:30"/>
he will, the other is a power actuall, whereby he doth indeed
whatsoever he will.</p>
                  <p>Where doth the Scripture speak of the absolute power of God, by which
he can doe more then he doth if he would?</p>
                  <p>Yea, of such a power speaketh our Saviour Christ, I could pray to
my Father, and he could give me more then twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
but he would not ask it, and his Father would not give it: see
<hi>Mat. 26. 53. Phil.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>How doth the Scripture speak of Gods actuall power?</p>
                  <p>Of this power the Prophets and Apostles make mention,<note place="margin">Gods actuall power.</note> when they
join his power and his promises together, that is, when they say he is
not onely able to perform, but doth and will perform indeed whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he hath promised: and of this power <hi>Paul</hi> doth speak when he saith,
That God will have mercy upon whom he will; and every where in
the Scriptures we read, that God hath done what he would, given to
whom he would; whereby we see that God could and can doe more
then he would or will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 6.</p>
                  <p>How great is this working, or mighty power of God?</p>
                  <p>It must needs be high and very great,<note place="margin">Gods power Infinite.</note> for it is infinite &amp; hath no end.</p>
                  <p>Declare how it is infinite.</p>
                  <p>It is infinite two ways, or in two respects: First, in it self, and of
it self it is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it is extended to the creatures, which may be called
the object of Gods power, it is also infinite.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you say it is infinite in it self or of the own nature?</p>
                  <p>Because the power of God is nothing else but his divine essence, and
the essence of God is of his own nature, by it self, and of it self infinite.</p>
                  <p>Shew how Gods power is infinite as it is extended to the creatures.</p>
                  <p>Because the power of God doth extend it self to infinite things,
therefore we say that it infinite.</p>
                  <p>Declare how that is.</p>
                  <p>I mean the things which God can perform or bring to passe by his
power are infinite, and therefore his power is infinite; for God never
made so many, nor so great things, but he could have made more, and
greater if he would: as for example, he adorned the Firmament with
an innumerable company of Stars, and yet he could have decked it
with more; and to speak in a word, God can always perform infinite
things more then he doth, if he will, and therefore both in it self, and
out of it self, it is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Whether can this Omnipotency of God be communicated to any creature?</p>
                  <p>No, it cannot; for to be truly and essentially omnipotent, is proper
to God onely, and omnipotency is Gods essence, and therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is God is omnipotent, and whosoever is omnipotent must needs
be God, whose power is a chief power and infinite; and the power of
any creature is not infinite, but finite, and so consequently no creature
can be omnipotent, except vve vvould say that a creature or a thing
created can be both a creature and a God, or a Creator too; which is
both absurd and blasphemous.</p>
                  <p>If God can doe all things, whether can hee sinne or no; as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55421:30"/>
to lye and to be unfaithfull in his promises, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>God cannot sin, and yet for all that he is still omnipotent, for to sin
is no part or point of omnipotency, but of impotencie: to sin is nothing
else but to leave the right and perfect vvay, or to fall from a right and
perfect action, vvhich shevveth vvant of povver to uphold himselfe
that doth so; vvhich power is not wanting in God, for he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and being omnipotent, he cannot goe from strength to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and from perfection to imperfection, &amp;c. and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sinne.</p>
                  <p>By what Scripture can you prove this that you say?</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is of that mind that God cannot doe all things:
his words be these, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13.) If we beleeve not, yet abideth he
faithfull, he cannot deny himselfe; he doth not say he will not deny
himselfe, but he cannot deny himselfe; and his reason is, because (as
he saith himselfe) God is faithfull not onely in his will, but also by
his nature; and therefore sith God is faithfull, by nature he cannot
but stand to his promises which he made according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his will, and by nature he is omnipotent, therefore he cannot
be impotent: by nature he is good and the chiefe good, therefore he
cannot become evill, nor doe evill.</p>
                  <p>But whether can God be moved, or be subject to passions or sufferings
or no?</p>
                  <p>He cannot, for the power whereof we speak, when we say that God
is omnipotent, is altogether active and not passive; neither can any
passive power be in God: and to this effect speaketh Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi>
when he saith, <hi>Discitur Deus omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non patiendo
quod non vult;</hi> that is, God is called omnipotent in doing what he will,
not in suffering what he will not.</p>
                  <p>Some say that God can sinne, but he will not, and that he can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to passions, but he will not, and that he can doe whatsoever can
be imagined or thought, but he will not; what say you to those?</p>
                  <p>Of them I say nothing, but their opinion is both foolish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly;
for God cannot doe any thing which disagreeth from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore he cannot sin, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 19. 15. not because his will
is against it, but because it is against his nature and naturall goodnesse;
1 <hi>John 1. 5. Deut. 32. 4. Heb.</hi> 1. 13. therefore doe the Scriptures deny
any iniquity to be in God, and Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith to that effect, <hi>Deus
injusta facere non potest, quia ipse est summa justitia;</hi> that is, God cannot
be unjust, because he is most just and righteous it selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet for all this, God doth in some sort will sinnes, for he doth
not permit it against his will; and besides that, he commanded some
things which were sinnes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his innocent sonne,
and <hi>Shimei</hi> to curse <hi>David;</hi> did he not?</p>
                  <p>So far forth as God doth command, or will, or work any thing, that
thing is not sin in God, for he both willeth and worketh in great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and according to his most holy will; and therefore no action can
be sin in God, but every action of God is most holy and good, and so
saith the Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 17.</p>
                  <p>To what use serveth the doctrine of Gods omnipotencie?</p>

                  <p>Is not the secret will of God contrary to his revealed will?</p>
                  <p>No, in no wise; It differeth in some respects, but it is not another
will, much lesse contrary.</p>
                  <p>How differeth it?</p>
                  <p>The secret will of God considereth especially the end, the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
will the things that are referred to the end; and the secret will
of God is the event of all things, where the revealed will is of those
things only which are propounded in the word, as to beleeve in Christ,
and to be sanctified, &amp;c. <hi>John 14. 1. 1 Thess.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                  <p>It may seem that the revealed will of God is sometimes contrary to
it selfe, as when God forbiddeth murder and theft, yet God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his Sonne, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> to take the
goods of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is no contrariety; because God in giving a Lavv to man gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
none to himself, but that he may command otherwise: therefore
the Lavv hath this exception, that it is alwayes just, unlesse God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
otherwise.</p>
                  <p>But it seemeth that the secret will of God is often contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will, seeing by the former many evill things are committed,
and by the other all evill is forbidden.</p>
                  <p>In as much as by the providence of God evill things come to passe,
it is for some good, as Gods glory, or good of the Church, or both; in
vvhich only respect they by the providence of God are done, or suffered
to be done.</p>
                  <p>How then doth God will that which is good, and that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill?</p>
                  <p>He vvilleth all good so far as it is good, either by his effectuall good
pleasure, or by his revealed approbation; and that which is evill, in as
much as it is evill, by disallowing and forsaking it: and yet he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
doth permit evill, because it is good, that there should be evill;
<hi>Acts 14. 16. Psal.</hi> 81. 12.</p>
                  <p>Is there any profit of this knowledge of Gods will?</p>
                  <p>Yea, great profit for us to knovv what God will have us to doe,
and what he will doe with us, and for us, is a thing wherein standeth
our salvation, therefore vve are vvilled by the Apostle to enquire dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
after the same, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55421:32"/>
But the same Apostle in the eleventh Chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 34. before saith,
Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who was his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour?
that is to say, none: therefore it seemeth that the will of
God cannot be known; and consequently, that it may not be sought
after.</p>
                  <p>Indeed by that we learn not to search into the secret counsels of
God, which he never revealed in his word, neither hath promised
to reveale in this world; but after the revealed will of God, which he
hath vouchsafed to make known in his word, we may and ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of God; as for the wil and counsel which he hath kept to himself,
we may admire and adore it with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> but that we may not
search after it, is manifestly proved by these places following: <hi>Acts 1.
7. Exod. 33. 18, 19, 20. Job.</hi> 21. 23.</p>
                  <p>Whether can Gods secret will be known or no?</p>
                  <p>If he doth reveale it, it may.</p>
                  <p>How doth God reveale his secret will?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes. First, sometimes by his Spirit, as when he shewed his
Prophets many of his judgements that were to come. Secondly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
by the thing it self which he willeth, or by the effects of his will;
as when a thing doth fall out which was before unknown: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a man doth not know before it come, whether he shall be sick
or not, or of what disease, or when, or how long, but when all these
things are come to passe, then it is manifest what was Gods will before
concerning that matter.</p>
                  <p>Shew me what is our duty in respect of this secret will of God.</p>
                  <p>Our duty is two-fold: First, we must not curiously search after the
knowledge of it, but worship and reverence it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, before it be made manifest by the effects, we must gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
rest quietly in the same.</p>
                  <p>Shew me how, by an example.</p>
                  <p>Thus a Christian must resolve with himselfe, Whatsoever the Lord
vvill doe with me; whether I live or die, whether he make me rich or
poor, &amp;c. I rest content with his good will and pleasure.</p>
                  <p>What must we doe when his will is revealed unto us?</p>
                  <p>Then much more must we rest in it, and be thankfull for it, as <hi>Iob</hi>
was, who said, The Lord hath given and taken, even as it pleaseth the
Lord, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>What call you the revealed will of God?</p>
                  <p>The revealed will of God is two-fold: the one is that which
is properly revealed in the Law, that is, what God requireth to
be done of us; and therefore it is called the Law: and after this
we must enquire. The other is in the Gospell, which sheweth Gods
will towards us, and what hee hath decreed of us in his eternall
counsell as touching our salvation.</p>
                  <p>God indeed by his Law hath made it known what his will is, that
of us must be done and fulfilled; but hath he revealed in his word
what is his will and pleasure towards us?</p>
                  <p>Yea, he hath so, and that is proved by these places of Scripture
following, <hi>John 6. 40. Ephes. 1. 5. Matth. 3. 17. John</hi> 5. 39. and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55421:32"/>
after the knowledge of this will of God we must diligently enquire.</p>
                  <p>But whether may this will of God be known of us or no?</p>
                  <p>Yes, it may, for as it is revealed in the Scripture, so it is also confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and sealed before our eyes in the Sacraments, and the dayly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which we receive from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And is this sufficient to perswade us to beleeve his will?</p>
                  <p>No, for except the Lord doth perswade us by his holy Spirit we
shall neither beleeve it, nor know it, as appeareth by these places of
Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 16. Mat.</hi> 11. 25. but if we have the Spirit of God,
there is no need to goe up into heaven, or to goe beyond the Sea to
know it, because the word is near unto us, in our hearts; as <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. For touching the matter of our salvation, the will of
God is so clearly laid open in the preaching of the Gospell, that it
needs not to be more cleare.</p>
                  <p>If at any time we cannot know nor understand this will of God, as
touching our salvation, in whom is the fault?</p>
                  <p>The fault is in our selves, and the reason is because we are carnall
and naturall, and destitute of the Spirit of Christ; for <hi>Paul</hi> saith, The
carnall and naturall man cannot perceive the things of God; but if the
Spirit of Christ doth come and open our understanding, and correct
our affections, we can no longer doubt of his will; and therefore the
Apostle immediately after addeth, and saith, but we have the mind of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>Whether is this will of God made known to every one of Gods children
particularly or no?</p>
                  <p>Yes, it is, for <hi>Paul</hi> having the Spirit of Christ saith, that this will
of God was manifested unto him, when he saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Christ lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me, and gave himselfe for me; and to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> he saith, but
God hath revealed them: that is, the joyes of heaven to us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>How doth this prove that we can have this knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Very well, for if all the Elect are led by the same Spirit that <hi>Paul</hi>
had, it will also perswade them of this will of God as well as <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how prove you that they have the same Spirit?</p>
                  <p>That the same Spirit is given to all the elect, I prove it out of the
Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> who saith thus; My word and my Spirit shall not depart
from thy mouth, nor from thy seed for ever: <hi>Esa.</hi> 59. 21. which is
such a blessing, as no blessing can be desired in this world greater,
more excellent or more heavenly: for when we are once armed with
the knowledge of this will of God, we shall passe through fire and
water without any danger, <hi>Esa.</hi> 43. 2. we shall overcome the world
and death, and triumph over our enemies, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom. 8.
38,</hi> 39.</p>
                  <p>Whether are there more wills in God then one, or no?</p>
                  <p>The will of God, in some respects is but one, and in some respects
it is manifold.</p>
                  <p>How is it but one?</p>
                  <p>For the better determining of this point, we must first consider how
many significations there be of this word, Will, in God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55421:33"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It signifieth the faculty or ability of willing in God, and so it
is God himself, and the very essence of God, and so his will is but
one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It signifieth the act it self of willing, and if it be so taken it is all
but one, for God doth that in one and that eternall act, will whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It signifieth the free decree of his will, concerning either the doing
or the suffering of any thing to be done; if we take it in this sense the
will of God is still but one, and that eternall and immutable.</p>
                  <p>May we call the decree of Gods will, the will of God?</p>
                  <p>Yea, very well; as the Testament of one that is deceased is called the
last will of the Testator, because it is the firm and last decree of the
Testators will, and mind, concerning the disposing of his goods; and
the Scriptures doe make the will of God and the counsell or decree of
his will to be all one, as appeareth in these places following, <hi>Esa. 46. 10.
Acts 4. 27, 28. Joh.</hi> 6. 40.</p>
                  <p>How is the will of God manifold?</p>
                  <p>There be two respects chiefly for which the will of God is said to
be manifold, or more then one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, for the divers kinds of things which God doth will; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is, that it is called sometime the will of God concerning us, and
sometime the will of God done by us; The first is his favour and love
towards us in Christ Jesus, in which he willeth and decreeth that we
shall be saved through his Son: of this Christ speaketh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40.</p>
                  <p>The other which he will have done of us, is that which is expressed
in his Word, and that is to beleeve in Christ, and to walk in his laws,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 10. of which <hi>David</hi> saith thus, <hi>Teach me to doe thy will, because
thou art my God,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 2. 18. Thou knowest his will,</hi> that
is, his law.</p>
                  <p>Which is the other respect for which God is said to have many wils?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The will of God is said to be manifold and divers, for that those
things which he doth seem to will them after divers sorts, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one and the same manner; first, after one manner he doth will good
things, and after another manner he doth will evill things.</p>
                  <p>Shew how that is.</p>
                  <p>He willeth good things properly and absolutely by themselves and
for themselves; he willeth evill things for another end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.
and that is for good too: and the first is called the good will of God,
and acceptable to himself; the latter is called the permissive will of
God, or a voluntary permission in God, because he is not compelled or
constrained against his will, to will them. Again, sometime he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
simply and absolutely, sometimes he seemeth to will conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and some things he revealeth at one time, some at another, and
some things he doth for which he giveth a reason, and the reasons of
some things are secret to himself only and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Why then belike you grant that in God there be many wils?</p>
                  <p>No, I deny that; for although in those aforesaid respects the will of
God is said to be manifold for our understanding, yet for all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and in truth the will of God is but one onely, and that most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55421:33"/>
eternall, and perpetuall: as for example, he willed some things
in the old Testament, he hath willed other things in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet one and the same will in God decreed both. Again, his will
was that some things in the old Testament should last for a time, that
is, to the comming of Christ; or, as the Apostle saith, to the time of
reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. But he willeth that the things of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
shall last to the end of the world, and yet one will in God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
both these from everlasting. Again, although God seemeth to us
to will some things absolutely and simply, &amp; some things conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet in truth to speak properly, all things whatsoever God willeth,
he willeth absolutely and simply; and whereas he is said to will some
things conditionally, that is to be referred to the manifestation of his
will, for there is not in God any conditionall will, but only that which
openeth his will in this or that, or on this or that condition; for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in God is against the nature of his eternall kingdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> God commandeth many things to be done which are not done, so that
there is a will declared in his word, and there is another in him
forbidding or hindering that which he commandeth in his Law,
and therefore there are in God many wils.</p>
                  <p>The things which God commandeth are of two sorts: some are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
commanded, without any condition expressed or concealed; as
that <hi>Moses</hi> should cause all things about the Tabernacle to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pattern given him in the Mount; other some things are
commanded and set down with condition, as when Christ said, <hi>Marke
10.</hi> 17. 19. If thou wilt inherit eternall life keep the Commandements,
and the Law saith, Doe this and this, if thou wilt live; and these are
propounded conditionally to all, as well the elect as the reprobate;
God his absolute will is always one and the same.</p>
                  <p>And are they propounded to both after one sort?</p>
                  <p>No, not so; for although they be given to the elect with condition,
yet the will of God to them is absolute; for Gods will simply is, that
all his elect shall be saved, if not always, yet at the last; and because of
their own strength they cannot doe the Commandements of God,
therefore God doth give them strength by his Spirit; and because by
this strength they cannot doe Gods will perfectly, therefore it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
for them by Christ, which is made theirs by faith, and in whom
God doth accept their broken and imperfect obedience, as if it were
whole and perfect.</p>
                  <p>But as for the wicked and reprobates it is not so with them, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God doth give them a law to obey, and doth promise them life
if they doe obey it, yet his will to them is not so absolute, that they
shall keep it, neither shall they obtain the promises either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or in Christ.</p>
                  <p>But doth not God mock and delude the Reprobate, when he willeth
them in his law to doe this and that which yet is not his will to be
done?</p>
                  <p>No, he doth not delude them; for although he doth not shew
what he will absolutely have done of them, which is properly his will<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55421:34"/>
indeed, yet by his law he doth teach what is their duty, and the duty of
all men, adding moreover that whosoever shall neglect and fail in this
their duty, he sinneth grievously against God, and is guilty of death.</p>
                  <p>Can you make this plain by some instance, or example, or any Parable
in the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>Yea, it is manifest in the Parable of the Kings supper, and the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
guests; they which were first bidden and came not, were not delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the King, because he signified unto them what he liked, and
what was their duty, but yet he did not command that they should be
compelled to come in, as the two sorts which were bidden afterwards:
where we see that the Kings will was not alike in bidding the first as
it was in the second, for in calling the latter sort his will was absolute
that they should come indeed, and so caused, that they did come; but
to the first he onely signified what he liked if they had done it.</p>
                  <p>How doe you apply this to the matter in question?</p>
                  <p>I apply it thus, as it cannot be said that the first bidden guests were
mocked by the King, although his will was not so absolute for their
comming, as it was in calling and commanding the second sort of
guests; so it cannot be said that God doth delude and mock the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
in giving them a law to obey, although it be not his absolute
will that they should come and obey the law; for it is sufficient to leave
them without excuse, that they know what is acceptable to God, and
what is their duty to God, who hath absolute authority and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them and over all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> God commandeth <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let Israel goe, and yet his will was to
the contrary, therefore there were two contrary wils in God, one
revealed, the other concealed.</p>
                  <p>It followeth not, for the will of God was one onely, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and that was that Israel should not be sent away by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
so that was fulfilled; as for the Commandement given to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it
was a doctrine to teach <hi>Pharaoh</hi> what he must have done if he would
avoid so many plagues, and yet shewed him his duty, and what was
just and right to be done, but it was no testimony of the absolute will
of God.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God will evill or sin,<note place="margin">Whether God doth will evil.</note> or no?</p>
                  <p>Before we can answer to this question, we must consider of three
things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> How many ways sin may be considered.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> How many ways one may be said to will a thing.</p>
                  <p>Go to then, shew first how many ways sin is to be considered?</p>
                  <p>Sin is to be considered three ways.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As it is of it self sin, and striving against the law of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As it is a punishment of sin that went before, for God doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
punish one sin with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As it is the cause of more sin following, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26. for one sin doth
beget another, as one Devil calleth seven Devils, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>Now declare how many things you doe consider in sin.</p>
                  <p>In every sin there be three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55421:34"/>
The action, and that is either inward, or outward: the action which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
we call inward is threefold; either of the mind, as evill thoughts; or of
the heart, as evil affections and desires; or of the will, as an evill choice,
or consent to sin: The actions which we call outward, are the actions
or work of the senses fighting against the law of God.</p>
                  <p>The second thing in every sin, is the deformity or corruption of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
action; that is, when the action doth decline from the rule of Gods
law, and this properly is sin, or the form of sin.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in every sinne, is the offence or guiltinesse thereof,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
whereby the party offending is bound to undergoe punishment; this
guiltinesse and obligation whereby we are bound to undergoe the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of sin, hath its foundation in sin it self, but it ariseth from the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. who in his justice rewardeth sin with death, as
justice indeed giveth to every one his due.</p>
                  <p>Now come you to your third point, and shew how many ways one is
said to will a thing.</p>
                  <p>We are said to will a thing two ways; either properly, for it self; or
improperly, for another end.</p>
                  <p>What mean you by a proper willing of a thing?</p>
                  <p>We doe will a thing properly for it self, or for it own sake, when the
thing which we will or desire is of its own nature to be wished and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired;
as for the body, health, food, apparell, and such like; or for the
soul, faith, repentance, patience, &amp;c. We doe will a thing improperly,
when the thing which we will is not of it self to be wished; but yet
we will have it for some good that may come thereof: as for example,
we will the cutting off some member of the body, not because of it
self it is to be wished, but for the health of the body which doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that cutting.</p>
                  <p>What difference is there between these two wils?</p>
                  <p>There is great difference; for those things which we will properly,
we love &amp; approve them, we encline unto them, &amp; we delight in them;
but that which is known of it self to be evill, our will is not caried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that with love and liking, but doth decline from it; and whereas a
man willeth a member of his body to be cut off, we may rather call it
a permission then a willing, and yet a vvilling permission.</p>
                  <p>You have shewed how many ways sin is to be considered; how many things
are to be considered in every sin, and how we are said to will a thing:
Now let me hear what you say to the matter in question; that is,
whether God doth will sin or no?</p>
                  <p>Before I answer directly to your question, I think it is not amisse to
shew what every one must carefully take heed of in answering to this
question, for in answering there is danger.</p>
                  <p>Let me hear what dangers must be avoided in answering?</p>
                  <p>There are two; and every one must avoid them, and sail between
them as between two dangerous rocks.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, we must take heed lest we make God the author of
sin by affirming that he willeth sin, as the <hi>Libertines</hi> do, &amp; as <hi>Adam</hi> did,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12. for that were the next vvay not only to put off our sins from
our selves, and lay them upon God, but also to cast off all conscience of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55421:35"/>
sin, and all fear of God, then the which nothing can be more blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
against God and pernicious to our selves.</p>
                  <p>What is the second thing to be avoided?</p>
                  <p>The other is this, we must take heed that we affirm not any evill to
be in the world which God knoweth not of, or whether God vvill or
no, for that vvere to deny Gods omnipotency, and al-knowledge.</p>
                  <p>These are two dangerous rocks and heresies indeed, but now I expect
a direct answer to the question.</p>
                  <p>That cannot be at once, but by going from point to point according
to our former distinction of sin, and vvilling.</p>
                  <p>Very well then; declare first of all, what things God doth properly will
which of themselves are to be willed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God doth first and chiefly vvill himself; that is, his own glory and
Majesty, as the end for vvhich all things are; and this he is said to vvill
properly; that is, he loveth it, advanceth it, and delighteth in it: and to
this purpose serve all those Scriptures vvhich command us to sanctifie
his name,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> and to adore his glory, as in <hi>Esa. 48. 11. Pro. 16. 4. Rom.</hi> 11. 36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Besides himselfe he doth properly vvill all other things vvhich he
made, and vvhich he doth himself, insomuch as he doth approve them,
and love them, as appeareth by these places following, God saw all
that he made, and it was good, and therefore gave a Commandement
that one should preserve another, by multiplying and encreasing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
it is said, whatsoever the Lord will that he doth, therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he doth that he wils, and although he hateth evill, yet he doth
properly will and love that good which commeth of evill; that is,
his own glory, and the salvation of his people.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God will punishments or no?</p>
                  <p>Yea, his will is the first and efficient cause of all punishment: which
is proved by this reason and argument; every good thing is of God,
every punishment being a work of justice is a good thing, therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
punishment is of God, and he doth will it.</p>
                  <p>What say you to the words in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18. 23. 32. I will not the death
of a sinner?</p>
                  <p>That place is to be understood onely of the elect, for properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
God doth not will their death, and therefore to keep them from
death, meaning eternall death, he giveth them repentance.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God will sin as it is a punishment of sin that went before?</p>
                  <p>Yes, he doth, and it usuall with God to punish one sin with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as for example, the hardning of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was a sin in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
and God brought it upon him not as a sin, but as a punishment of
his former sins.</p>
                  <p>You say that in every sin is an action or deed, which is either inward
or outward; whether doth God will that or no?</p>
                  <p>So far forth as it is an action only God doth will it, but not the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
&amp; deformity of the action, for in him we live, move, and have
our beeing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28.</p>
                  <p>But whether doth God will sin properly, as it is a transgression of the
law, and a corruption in the action or no?</p>
                  <p>No, he doth not, neither can be, for it is against his nature, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55421:35"/>
to this effect serve these places of Scripture following, <hi>Psal. 5. 5. Heb.
1. 15. 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 4. and reason doth confirm it many vvayes; for looke
vvhat God doth vvill properly, he loveth and alloweth it, but God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and damneth sin as the Scriptures vvitnesse, and therefore he doth
not vvill it properly, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 17. Again, he hath sent his Son to take
away the sins of the vvorld, and to destroy the vvorks of the Devill,
therefore he doth not vvill them.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if God should properly vvill sin, then he must be the author
of sin, but he is not the author of sin, for the Scriptures doe never attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
sin unto God, but unto the devil &amp; unto men, <hi>Ro. 9. 14. 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>But although God doth not properly will sin, yet he doth willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sin; doth he not?</p>
                  <p>Yes; but for the better understanding how God doth permit sin vve
must consider hovv many vvays, or in hovv many senses one is said to
permit a thing, and that is three vvays.</p>
                  <p>To permit is sometime of two good things, to grant that vvhich is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
lesse good, although it vvere against our vvill: as for example, a man
vvould bring up his son in learning, rather then in vvarfare or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occupation; but because his son hath more mind to an occupation
then to learning, and doth crave of his father to go to some occupation,
or to be a Soldier rather then a Doctor, his father doth grant him his
desire, but he had rather have him to be a Scholar: And this is a kind of
permission and suffering, but this permission ought rather to be called
a will indeed, for that which is lesse good, (yet because it is good) he
doth will it, and approve it, and it is a true object of his will, and it
may be called a permission in respect of that will which had rather
have had the greater good.</p>
                  <p>And is thus God said to permit sin in this sense?</p>
                  <p>No, by no means; for sin (as it is sin) hath no shew of good in it
which may be compared with a greater good.</p>
                  <p>Which is your second way of permitting?</p>
                  <p>Sometimes to permit is to grant one evill to goe unpunished, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
many &amp; more grievous evils thereby may be prevented; as many times
Princes &amp; Magistrates are wont to doe: and so some do think that God
hath granted some sin to be done without danger or threatning of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
lest more and more hainous mischiefs should ensue.</p>
                  <p>And are not you of that mind?</p>
                  <p>No, God forbid I should; for the Apostles rule is both generall and
true, we must not doe evill that good may come thereof, lest we be
damned justly, therefore no man may by the law of God admit any sin
to avoid another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>What is your third way of permitting?</p>
                  <p>To permit, doth sometime signifie not to hinder and stop evil when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
we may and so God is said to permit sin, because he could by his grace
hinder and prevent sins that none should be committed; and yet he doth
willingly permit us in our nature to sin: That God doth thus permit
sin, it is evident by these places of Scripture, <hi>Psalm. 81. 11, 12. Acts
14.</hi> 16. That he doth permit them willingly and not constrained
thereunto, these places doe shew, <hi>Rom. 9. 19. Esa.</hi> 46. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:55421:36"/>
For what cause doth not God hinder sin, but permit it?</p>
                  <p>Not without cause, but that he may use our sins (which is his infinite
goodnesse and wisdome) to his own glory: for hereby his justice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of sin, and his mercy in pardoning of sin is made manifest and
known, to the great glory of God and praise of his Name.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God alter his will at any time or no?</p>
                  <p>For the better understanding of this question, we must consider two
things. First, how many ways our will is changeable. Secondly, the
causes that move us to change our wils.</p>
                  <p>Very well; declare the first, how many ways our wils are changeable?</p>
                  <p>The will of a man is changeable two ways: First, when we begin
to will a thing which we did not will before. Secondly, when wee
leave to will that vvhich vve vvilled before.</p>
                  <p>Now shew what be the causes thereof; and first why a man doth will
that which he willed not before.</p>
                  <p>The causes of these be two; first our ignorance, because we do know
that to be good afterward vvhich vve knew not before to be good, and
then we vvill that vvhich we could not before; for <hi>ignoti nulla cupido,</hi>
for of that vvhich is unknown there is no desire. The second cause ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from the alteration of nature, as if that vvhich vvas hurtfull to us
at one time became profitable to us at another time, then we will
have that at one time, which we would not another: as for example,
in summer our will is inclined to cold places, but in winter our will is
altered, and doth affect and desire the warm.</p>
                  <p>Whether is there any such cause in God to make him change his will,
or not?</p>
                  <p>No, neither of these causes can be in God; not the first, for he doth most
perfectly know all things from all eternity; not the second, for there is
nothing in God for which any thing may be found to be profitable or
hurtful, he is always the same, having need of nothing, and therefore
he cannot will any thing that is new to him, and consequently his will
is not changeable.</p>
                  <p>But what say you to the second way of changing our wils; that is, of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to wil that which before we had determined, wherof cometh that?</p>
                  <p>For this there may be yeelded two reasons. 1. We do change our wils
of our own accord, because the latter thing doth seem to us to be better
then the former. 2. Being constrained or against our minds we doe
oftentimes change our wils, because our first counsell was hindred by
some crosse event, that it could not have his due effect.</p>
                  <p>Whether are any of these two causes in God, that for those he should
change his will?</p>
                  <p>No, God doth neither of his owne accord, nor yet by constraint
change his will, but his decrees are, and ever have been, and always
shall be fulfilled, and none shall hinder the will of God, for it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remain one and the same; and this doctrine is most strong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and fenced with these places of Scripture, <hi>Num. 23. 19. 1 Sam.
15. 19. Mal. 3. 6. Esa. 46. 10. Rom.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
                  <p>Paul saith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. It is the will of God that all men should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and come to the knowledge of the truth, and yet all are not saved;
therefore Gods will is mutable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55421:36"/>
If this place be under stood of Gods revealed will, then the sense is
this, that God doth call all men by the preaching of his word to the
knowledge of his truth, and to eternall salvation, if they will beleeve in
Christ: but if it be understood of the secret will of God, the sense may
be three-fold; First, all men, that is, of all sorts and degrees, he will have
some. Secondly, so many as are saved, all are saved by the will of God.
Thirdly, God willeth that all shall be saved; that is, all the Elect: for in
the Scriptures, this word <hi>all,</hi> is put sometimes for the Elect, without
the Reprobate; as <hi>Rom. 5. 18. Cor.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
                  <p>What is there comprehended under the holinesse of Gods will?<note place="margin">The holinesse of Gods will.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Holinesse is a generall attribute of God,<note place="margin">Esa. 6. 3.</note> in respect of all the speciall
properties of his nature,<note place="margin">Psal. 145. 17.</note> in respect whereof hee most justly loveth,
liketh, and preferreth himselfe above all: unto which most holy will
must be referred both affections, (to speak according unto man) as
love and hatred; with their attendants, goodnesse, bounty, grace and
mercy on the one side; displeasure, anger, grief and fury on the other:
and also the ordering of those affections, by justice, patience, long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
equity, gentlenesse, and readinesse to forgive.</p>
                  <p>What instructions doe you draw from the holinesse of God?</p>
                  <p>That as every one cometh nearer unto him in holinesse, so they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
best liked and loved of him, and consequently it should breed a love in
our hearts of holinesse and hatred of the contrary.</p>
                  <p>That this ought to kill in us all evill thoughts and opinions which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
can rise of God in our hearts, seeing that in him that is holinesse it self,
there can be no iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth the holinesse of God especially appeare?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In his Goodnesse and Justice,</hi> Exod. 20. 5. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. 6, 7. Nahum 1. 2, 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property in God, whereby he is infinitely good in
and of himselfe, and likewise beneficiall to all his creatures; <hi>Ps. 145. 7.
Mark. 10. 18. James 1. 17. Mat. 5. 45. Psal.</hi> 34. 9.</p>
                  <p>How many wayes then is the goodnesse of God to be considered?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes: either as he is in his own nature of himself simply good
and goodnesse it selfe, (<hi>i.</hi> so perfect, and every way so absolute, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be added unto him) or else as he is good to others: both waies
God is in himself a good God, but especially for his goodnes towards
us, he is called a good God, as a Prince is called a good Prince.</p>
                  <p>Shew how that is.</p>
                  <p>A Prince may be a good man if he hurt no man, and liveth honestly,
&amp;c. but he is not called a good Prince except he be good to his subjects,
that is, if he be not milde, gentle, liberall, just, a defender of the godly,
a punisher of the wicked; so that the good may live a quiet and a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life in all honesty and goodnesse:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> so the Scriptures call God a good
God, because he is not only good in himself, yea and goodnesse it self,
but also because he is good to others; that is, milde, gracious, mercifull,
his nature is not cruell, savage, nor bloody towards us, but most mild,
pleasant, sweet, and such as may allure all men to trust in him, to love
him, to call upon him, and to worship him. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 16. 11. 34. 9.</p>
                  <p>Is nothing good but God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:55421:37"/>
Nothing of it selfe, and perfectly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 17. howbeit, by him,
and from him, doe come good things. <hi>Gen. 1. ult.</hi> which have not their
goodnesse of themselves; for whatsoever goodnesse is in the creatures,
it is of God the Creatour; and they are so farre forth good, as they are
made good by God, and are made partakers of his goodnesse. 1 <hi>Cor. 4.
7. James</hi> 1. 17. Again, that goodnesse which is in the things created,
whether it be naturall or supernaturall, is imperfect and finite, but the
goodnesse of God is most perfect and infinite; and therefore onely
God is truly good, and goodnesse it selfe: yea, he is <hi>Summum bonum,</hi>
that chief good of all to be desired.</p>
                  <p>Is the goodnesse of God extended unto all creatures?</p>
                  <p>Yea, it is so; and as this is known by dayly experience, so it is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by the Scriptures following, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 64. &amp; 145. 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45.</p>
                  <p>Hath God shewed his goodnesse to all alike?</p>
                  <p>No, for the things created are of two sorts; either invisible, or visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
invisible as Angels, unto whom the Lord hath given more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
gifts then to the other.</p>
                  <p>And was his goodnesse parted equally among them?</p>
                  <p>No, for some he suffered to fall into sin, for which they were thrust
down from heaven to hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. others he hath preserved by his
grace, that they should not fall away from him.</p>
                  <p>Is his goodnesse alike to his visible creatures?</p>
                  <p>No, for of them some are endued with reason, as mankind, some are
void of reason, and therefore is man called a Lord over the rest of the
creatures.</p>
                  <p>Is the goodnesse of God alike to reasonable creatures?</p>
                  <p>No, for of them God in his mercy hath chosen some to eternall life,
whom he hath purposed to call effectually in his time, that they may
be justified and glorified by Christ; others he hath in his justice left to
their sins without any effectuall calling, to perish for ever.</p>
                  <p>What testimony of Scripture have you that Gods goodnesse is farre
greater to the Elect, then to the Reprobate?</p>
                  <p>It appeareth by the words of our Saviour Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11. and of
the Prophet <hi>Asaph, Ps.</hi> 73. 1. yet God is good, that is, singularly good,
to <hi>Israel,</hi> even to the pure in heart, but God makes his Elect onely to be
pure in heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10.</p>
                  <p>Doth the goodnesse of God towards all men turn to the good of all men?</p>
                  <p>No, for in the Reprobate Gods goodnesse is turned into evill, and
serveth to their destruction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. and that is through their own
fault, for they doe contemne and altogether abuse the goodnesse of
God, and for all his goodnesse bestowed upon them continually, they
never trust him, nor trust in him. <hi>Rom. 2. 4. Psal.</hi> 106. 13.</p>
                  <p>How may we use the goodness of God to our good, and to our salvation?</p>
                  <p>If we have the goodnesse of God in a true and worthy estimation,
if we use it with feare and reverence, and thereby learn to repent us of

It teacheth us that we have and doe serve a true God, for he is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  <p>We learn hereby, that by this goodnesse of his, he useth all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
well.</p>
                  <p>If our God be so good, we should be ashamed to offend him, as it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
intolerable to hurt an infant that is innocent and harmlesse, so it is
most intolerable to requite the Lords goodnesse with evill.</p>
                  <p>If God be so good, and goodnesse it selfe, we must trust him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
trust in him; for we will repose trust in good men, and shall we not
much more in our good God?</p>
                  <p>It teacheth us never to lay the fault upon God for any thing, nor to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
complain of Gods dealing, for he is alwayes perfectly good; and all
that he doth is perfectly good, whatsoever men judge of it.</p>

                  <p>To what end is it, that the goodnesse of God is not to all alike?
1 Tim. 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>It serveth to the adoring and beautifying of Gods Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  <p>It serveth to the maintenance of mutuall love, and society amongst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
men; for if the goodnesse of God were to all alike, then one could not
help another, and to this end serves the variety of gifts, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 20.

                  <p>It maketh to the greater manifesting of the glory of the goodnesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
God; for if all had alike, we would contemn this goodnesse, thinking
that he were bound to be good to us of necessity.</p>
                  <p>From the consideration of Gods speciall goodnesse towards us his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

                  <p>What is the graciousnesse of God?<note place="margin">The gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property whereby he is of himselfe most gracious
and amiable, and freely declareth his favour unto his creatures above
their desert, <hi>Psal. 145. 8. 15, 16. Rom. 11. 6. Tit.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>Is he only gracious?</p>
                  <p>Only in and of himselfe, for that whatsoever is gracious and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it is from him.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from this?</p>
                  <p>That we ought to love and reverence God above all; for seeing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and amiable men doe winne love and reverence from others, in
whose eyes they appear gracious and amiable, who is able more to
winne this at our hands, then God who is the fountain of all gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and amiablenesse?</p>
                  <p>For the better understanding of this attribute, shew how this word
Grace is used in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>It is used in three severall significations, sometimes it is put
for comelinesse, stature, meeknesse, or mildnesse; <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 25. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
for free favour whereby one embraceth another, pardoning
former injuries, and receiving the partie offending into favour again.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55421:38"/>
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 8. Thirdly, it is taken for all kind of gifts and graces, which of
his free favour are bestowed; whether temporall or eternall: <hi>Acts 2.
23. Eph.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>Whether is there grace in God according to the first signification of
grace or no?</p>
                  <p>Yea, for God is of his own nature most gracious, and grace it selfe,
which grace was in Christ Jesus from his infancie, (as he was man)
and did every day more and more increase, <hi>Luke 2. 52. Psal.</hi> 45. 9. And
amongst all things that were created, there was nothing indued
with such grace, as was the humane nature of Christ, and that
was by the fulnesse of the Godhead which dwelt bodily in him,
<hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>Whether is grace properly attributed to God in the second sense
or no?</p>
                  <p>Yea, most properly; for God doth justifie us: that is, he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
us for just through his Sonne Jesus Christ, and that of his free
grace and favour, without any desert of our parts or any thing in us,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. 24. &amp; 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>What be the causes of this grace or favour of God?</p>
                  <p>The efficient cause is his goodnesse and free will; the finall cause
cause thereof is the salvation of his chosen children, and the glory of
himselfe, and of his Son Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p>What be the effects of Gods grace to us wards?</p>
                  <p>In generall, the grace of God (whereof there is no cause in us but
onely his own goodnesse and will) is the first cause, the middle cause,
and the the last cause, and the onely cause of all that belongs to our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. And particularly, it is the cause of our Election, of
our Redemption, of the sending of Christ into the world, of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
of the preaching of the Gospell; <hi>Eph. 1. 4. John 3. 11. 34. Rom. 5.
8.</hi> It was the cause why the Apostles were called to the preaching of
the Gospell, <hi>Gal. 1. 15, 16. Eph.</hi> 3. 8. 9. It is the cause of our Faith, of
the forgivenesse of our sinnes, of our whole justification, of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
of our renovation, of our love to God and our neighbour,
of the Holy Ghost in us, of our good works, of our obedience, of our
perseverance, of the feare of God, of eternall life, and of life it selfe.

the continuance, and the accomplishment of our whole salvation,
doth depend wholly upon the grace and favour of God; and what good
thing soever we have, or have had, or may have, belonging either to
this life or to the life to come, is to be attributed wholly to the grace
and favour of God.</p>
                  <p>What is the love of God?</p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property in God whereby he loves himselfe above
all,<note place="margin">Of the love of God.</note> and others for himselfe, 1 <hi>John 4. 16. Rom. 5. 8. John 3. 16. Tit.
3. 4. Mal.</hi> 1. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That wee should love him dearely, and other things for him.</p>
                  <p>That we may the better know what the love of God is, declare first
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55421:38"/>
what love is in our selves.</p>
                  <p>It is a passion of the mind whereby we are so affected towards the
party whom we love, that we are rather his then our own, forgetting
our selves to doe him good whom we so love.</p>
                  <p>And is love such a thing in God?</p>
                  <p>No, the true love of God is not such as our love is.</p>
                  <p>What difference is there?</p>
                  <p>There is great difference two wayes; First, in time, for love was in
God before it was in us, or in any thing created; for he loved himselfe
and us also before the world was. <hi>John</hi> 17. 23. Secondly, they differ
in nature and quality, for that love which is in God is most perfect and
pure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. without passion; but in us it is imperfect, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with passions, with impure affections and grief of the mind.</p>
                  <p>After what manner doth the Scripture expresse the love of God?</p>
                  <p>In the Scriptures God doth compare himselfe to a father and to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loving their children, to a hen gathering her chickens together
under her wings, to a good shepherd seeking up his sheep, and to divers
other things.</p>
                  <p>And wherefore serve these comparisons?</p>
                  <p>They are for our profit two wayes. First, to shew us that Gods love
towards us is most vehement and sincere. Secondly, to make us bold
in coming to him, and calling upon him; so for this love Christ Jesus
calleth us by all the names of love, as his servants, his kinsmen, his
friends, his spouse, his brethren; and by many names moe: to shew, that
he loveth us with all loves, the fathers love, the mothers love, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
love, the husbands love, the brothers love, &amp;c. and if all loves were
put together, yet his love exceedeth them all, for all could not doe so
much for us, as he alone hath done.</p>
                  <p>If love doth not signifie any affection or passion in God, as it doth in
us, what then doth it signifie?</p>
                  <p>In God it signifieth three things most perfect; first, the eternall good
will of God towards some body; for the love of God, (supposed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Elect) is his everlasting good will, or his purpose and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to shew them mercy, to doe them good, and to save them;
as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. 13. Secondly, the effects themselves of his love or
good will, whether they be temporall, concerning this life, or eternall,
concerning the life to come; as in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1. Thirdly, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight which he taketh in that which he loveth, and so it is
taken in <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. 23.</p>
                  <p>What things doth God love besides himselfe?</p>
                  <p>Besides himselfe God loveth all things else, whatsoever he made,
but he loveth not sinne and iniquity, for he never made it, as Saint
<hi>John</hi> saith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 16. Again he loveth his Son being manifested in
the flesh, and he loveth his chosen children for his Sons sake, with
whom he is well pleased; <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. last verse.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 1. The Scripture saith that God doth hate all that work iniquity,
how then can God both hate and love one and the same man?</p>
                  <p>In every wicked man we must consider two things: First, His na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Secondly, his sinne. His nature is the work of God, and that he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55421:39"/>
loveth, but his iniquity is not of God, and that he hateth.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 2. God doth afflict his children, therefore he doth not love them.</p>
                  <p>Whom he loveth he correcteth, and therefore he correcteth them
because he loveth them, even as a gold-smith tryeth his gold in the fire,
because he loveth it.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth God love all alike or no?</p>
                  <p>No, he preferreth mankind before all his other creatures, for which
cause God is called <hi>Philanthropos,</hi> that is, a lover of men; and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by three effects of his love.</p>
                  <p>First, he made him according to his own Image, that is, in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and true holinesse. <hi>Gen. 1. 26. Eph.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he made him Lord over all his creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he gave his own Son to death for his ransom.</p>
                  <p>Doth God love all men alike?</p>
                  <p>No, for he loveth his Elect better then the Reprobate; for the Elect he
calleth effectually by his Spirit in their hearts, when he calleth others
but by the outward voyce of the Gospell, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Again, amongst the Elect themselves, some are actually wicked,
and not yet reconciled nor called, as was <hi>Paul</hi> before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but the rest are called and already made holy by Faith in Christ,
as <hi>Paul</hi> was after his conversion; and of these, he loveth the latter sort
with a greater measure of love then the former; as the Scripture testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
                  <p>What manner of love doth God beare to his elect?</p>
                  <p>It hath three adjuncts or properties; First, it is free without desert.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is great without comparison.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is constant without any end.</p>
                  <p>How is the love of God said to be free?</p>
                  <p>It is free two wayes: first, because nothing caused God to love us,
but his own goodnesse and grace, and therefore Saint <hi>John</hi> saith that
his love was before ours, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is free, because God in loving us, did not regard any
thing that belonged to his own commodity; for as <hi>David</hi> saith, he hath
no need of our goods, but onely to our owne salvation he loved
us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 162.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth the greatnesse of Gods love appear to his Elect?</p>
                  <p>It appeareth two wayes: First, by the meanes which God useth to
save us by, that is, the death of his Son, and so <hi>John</hi> setteth forth his
love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. when he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, as if he should say, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently,
so ardently, so earnestly, so wonderfully did he love us, that
for our salvation he spared not his own only begotten Son, but gave
him to the death of the Crosse for our salvation.</p>
                  <p>What else doth set forth the greatnesse of Gods love towards us?</p>
                  <p>The consideration of our own selves, for he did not only give his
only Son to death for us, but it was for us being his enemies; and this
circumstance is used by the Apostle to expresse the same, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Where find you it written that Gods love is constant and perpetuall?</p>
                  <p>That is manifestly shewed in these Scriptures following, <hi>Hos. 11. 9.
John 13. 1. Rom.</hi> 11. 29. for God is unchangeable in his love which is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55421:39"/>
his essence and nature, and therefore is God called love in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>What use must we make of Gods love?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Uses of Gods love.</note> it filleth our hearts with gladness, when we understand that our
God is so loving, and love it self, and what is this but the beginning
of eternall life, if eternall life consist in the true knowledge of God as
our Saviour Christ saith, <hi>John 17. 3?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, out of the knowledge of this love, as out of a fountain
springeth the love of God and our neighbour; for S. <hi>John</hi> saith, he
that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when we consider that God loveth all his creatures which
he made, it should teach us not to abuse any of the creatures to serve
our lusts and beastly affections, for God will punish them which abuse
his beloved, as he punished the rich glutton which abused the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are taught to love all the creatures, even the basest of
all, seeing that God loveth them, and for the love he beareth to us, he
made them, and we must (if we love them for Gods sake) use them
sparingly, moderately, and equally or justly; to this end we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to let our cattell rest upon the Sabbath day as well as our
selves; to this end we are forbidden to kill the damme upon her nest,
and to this end we are forbidden to musle the mouth of the Oxe which
treadeth out the Corn, <hi>Deut. 25. 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, we are taught from hence to love mankind better then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, because God doth so; and therefore we must not spare
any thing that we have that may make for the safety of his body, and
the salvation of his soul. And for this cause we are commanded to
love our enemies, and to do them good, because our good God doth so.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, from Gods love we learn to preferre the godly brethren
and those that professe sincerely the same religion that we professe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other men, because Gods love is greater to his elect then to the
reprobate, and this doth the Apostle teach us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, whereas Gods love is freely bestowed upon us, this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us to be humble, and to attribute no part of our salvation to
our selves, but only to the free love of God.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, from hence ariseth the certainty of our salvation; for if
Gods love was so free &amp; great when we were his enemies, much more
will it be so and constant also to us being reconciled to God by Jesus
Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>What is the mercy of God?<note place="margin">Of the mercy of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is his mind and will always most ready to succour him that is in
misery; or an essentiall property in God, whereby he is meerly ready
of himself to help his creatures in their miseries, <hi>Esa. 30. 18. Lam. 3. 22.
Exod.</hi> 33. 19.</p>
                  <p>Why adde you this word meerly?</p>
                  <p>To put a difference between the mercy of God and the mercy that
is in men, for their mercy is not without some passion, compassion, or
fellow-feeling of the miseries of others, but the mercy of God is most
perfect and effectuall, ready to help at all needs of himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:55421:40"/>
But seeing mercy is grief and sorrow of mind conceived at anothers
miseries, how can it be properly attributed to God in whom are no
passions nor griefs?</p>
                  <p>Indeed in us mercy may be such a thing, but not in God; mercy was
first in God, and from him was derived to us, and so he is called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mercies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. and when it came to us, it was matched
with many infirmities and passions, but it is improperly attributed to
God from our selves as though it were first in us.</p>
                  <p>Declare then briefly what things of perfection are signified by this
word [mercy] in God?</p>
                  <p>By the name of [mercy] two things are signified in God properly.
First, the mind and will ready to help and succour. Secondly, the help
it self, and succour or pity that is then shewed.</p>
                  <p>Where in the Scripture is mercy taken the first way?</p>
                  <p>Those places of Scripture are so to be understood wherein God
doth call himself mercifull; and saith, that he is of much mercy; that
is, he is of such a nature as is most ready to free us from our evils.</p>
                  <p>Where is it taken in the other sense for the effects of mercy?</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15. where it is said, God will have mercy on whom
hee will have mercy; that is, he will call whom he will call; hee
will justifie whom hee will; hee will pardon whom he will; and
will deliver and save from all their miseries and evils whom he will;
and these be the effects of Gods mercies. Again, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6. it is
so taken.</p>
                  <p>From whence springeth this mercy of God?</p>
                  <p>The essence and beeing of God is most simple without any mixture
or composition; and therefore in him there are not divers qualities and
vertues as there be in us, whereof one dependeth upon another, or one
differs from another, but for our capacity and understanding, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaketh of God as though it were so, that so we may the better
perceive what manner of God, and how good our God is.</p>
                  <p>Well then, seeing the Scriptures doe speak so for our understanding, let
us hear whereof this mercy commeth.</p>
                  <p>The cause is not in us, but only in God himself, and mercy in God
doth spring out of his free love towards us.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you say out of the free love of God? are there more loves in
God then one?</p>
                  <p>There are two kinds of love in God: one is wherewith the Father
loveth the Son, and the Son the Father, and which the holy Ghost
beareth towards both the Father and the Son; and this love I call the
naturall love of God, so that the one cannot but love the other; but
the love wherewith he loveth us is voluntary, not being constrained
thereunto, and therefore is called the free love of God, and thereof it
commeth to passe that mercy is also wholly free, that is, without
reward or hope of recompence, and excludeth all merit.</p>
                  <p>How prove you that the mercy of God ariseth out of his love?</p>
                  <p>That the love of God is the cause of his mercy, it is manifest in the
Scriptures, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 2. Paul</hi> saluteth <hi>Timothy</hi> in this order, Grace,
mercy and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55421:40"/>
Christ, to shew that that peace which the world cannot give, the
mercy of God is the cause of it, and the cause of his mercy is his grace,
and his grace is nothing else but his free favour and love towards us.
The same order doth <hi>Paul</hi> observe in <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 4, 5. where he saith, when
the goodnesse and love of God our Saviour appeareth not by the works
of righteousnesse, which we had done, but according to his mercy he
saved us. First, he sets down the goodnesse of God as the cause of his
love. Secondly, his love as the cause of his mercy. And thirdly, his
mercy as the cause of our salvation; and our salvation as the effect of
all: and therefore there is nothing in us which may move the Lord to
shew mercy upon us, but only because he is goodnesse it self by nature;
and to this doth the Psalmist bear witnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 100. 5. saying, that
the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting, and his truth is from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to generation.</p>
                  <p>Towards whom is the mercy of God extended or shewed?</p>
                  <p>For the opening of this point we are to consider that the mercy of
God is twofold: First, generall; Secondly, speciall. God as a God
doth shew mercy generally upon all his creatures being in misery, and
chiefly to men, whether they be just or unjust, <hi>Psal. 140. &amp;</hi> 147. and so
doth succour them, either immediately by himself, or else mediately
by creatures: as by Angels or Men, by the Heavens, by the Elements,
and by other living creatures, and this generall mercy of God is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the eternall salvation of all, but is only temporary and for a
while. Of this read <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 36.</p>
                  <p>What say you to the speciall mercy of God?</p>
                  <p>That I call the speciall mercy of God, which God as a most free
God hath shewed to whom he would, and denyed to whom he would:
and this pertaineth only to the elect, and those which fear him, <hi>Psal.
103.</hi> 11. for he sheweth mercy upon them to their eternall salvation,
and that most constantly, while he doth effectually call them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
while he doth freely and truly pardon their sins, and justifie them
in the bloud of the Lamb Jesus Christ; while he doth sanctifie them
with his grace, and doth glorifie them in eternall life: and of this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
mercy we may read in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>How great is the mercy of God?</p>
                  <p>It is so great that it cannot be expressed nor conceived of us: and that
is proved by these Scriptures following, <hi>Ps. 145. 9. James 2. 13. 1 Cor.
11. 32. Psal. 57</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>How long doth the mercy of God continue towards us?</p>
                  <p>Although the mercy of God be great and infinite in Christ, yet
for that mercy which pardoneth our sins and calleth us to faith and
repentance by the Gospel, there is no place after death, but onely
while we live in this world, which is warranted by these places ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. Let us doe good whilest we have time; to shew, that
a time will come when we shall not be able to doe good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. 17. Be faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee a
Crown of life, to shew, that the time which is given unto death is a
time of repentance, and of exercising of faith and of works, but after
death there is no time but to receive either an immortall Crown if we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55421:41"/>
have been faithfull, or everlasting shame if we have been unfaithfull:
Besides these, see <hi>Apoc. 14. 13. Mark. 9. 45. Esa. ult. 24. Luk. 16. 24,
25, 26. Mat. 15. 11, 12. John</hi> 9. 4.</p>

                  <p>First, it serveth to humble us; for the greater mercy is in God, the
greater misery is in us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must attribute our whole salvation unto his mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must flee to God in all our troubles with most sure
confidence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we must not abuse it to the liberty of the flesh to sin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

                  <p>What is the justice of God?<note place="margin">Of the Justice of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an essentiall property in God, whereby he is infinitely just in
himself, of himself, for, from, by himself alone, and none other, <hi>Psalm.
11.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>What is the rule of this justice?</p>
                  <p>His own free will, and nothing else, for whatsoever he willeth is just,
and because he willeth it, therefore it is just, not because it is just, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he willeth it, <hi>Eph. 1. 11. Psal. 115. 3. Mat.</hi> 20. 15. which also may
be applied to the other properties of God.</p>
                  <p>Explain this more particularly?</p>
                  <p>I say, that God doth not always a thing because it is just, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any thing is just, that is just, because God will have it so; and yet
his will is joyned with his wisdome: as for example, <hi>Abraham</hi> did
judge it a most just, and righteous thing to kill his innocent son, not by
the law, for that did forbid him, but only because he did understand
it was the speciall will of God, and he knew that the will of God
was not only just, but also the rule of all righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>That wee may the better understand this attribute, declare unto
mee how many manner of wayes one may be just or righteous.</p>
                  <p>Three manner of ways; either by nature, or by grace, or by perfect
obedience.</p>
                  <p>How many ways may one be just by nature?</p>
                  <p>Two ways: First, by himself, and of himself, in his own essence
and beeing; thus we say, that in respect of this essentiall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
there is none just but God onely, as Christ saith, none is
good but God only.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, derivatively by the benefit of another, to be either
made righteous, or born just; and in respect of this naturall gift of
righteousnesse we say, that in the beginning <hi>Adam</hi> was made just,
because he was created just, and in his whole nature was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and good, but this righteousnesse was derived from God.</p>
                  <p>Whom doe you call just by grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55421:41"/>
All the elect which are redeemed by the death of Christ, and that in
two respects.</p>
                  <p>First, because the righteousnesse of Christ is imputed unto them, &amp;
so by grace and favour in Christ their head they are just before God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because of grace and favour they are regenerated by
the holy Ghost, by the vertue of whose inherent righteousnesse
and holinesse they are made holy and just, and whatsoever they doe by
it is accepted for just for Christs sake.</p>
                  <p>Whom doe you call just and righteous by yeelding perfect and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
obedience to God and his law?</p>
                  <p>No man in this world after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> (Christ only excepted)
ever was, or can be just after that manner.</p>
                  <p>What say you of Christ? how was he just?</p>
                  <p>Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is most perfectly just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
every manner of way.</p>
                  <p>First, as he is God he is in his own essence, of himself, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
himself most just, even as the Father is eternall righteousnesse it self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as he was Man he was just by nature, because he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
conceived without sinne, and so was borne just and righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by vertue of his union with his divine nature, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
righteousnesse it self, he is most just.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by receiving the gifts of the holy Ghost without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
he is most just, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, he did most perfectly obey the law of God, and kept it most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
absolutely, therefore that way also he is most just and righteous.</p>
                  <p>What conclude you upon all this?</p>
                  <p>That forasmuch as God onely is in his own essence and nature by
himself, and of himself, eternall justice and righteousnesse, therefore
this attribute of justice or righteousnesse doth most properly agree to
God.</p>
                  <p>In how many things is God just?</p>
                  <p>In three things:</p>
                  <p>First, in his Will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in his Word.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his Works.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say that God is just in his Will?</p>
                  <p>That whatsoever he willeth is just, his will (as hath been declared)
being the rule of justice.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say that God is just in his Word?</p>
                  <p>That whatsoever he speaketh is just.</p>
                  <p>What are the parts of Gods Word?</p>
                  <p>Four: First, the History, which is all true.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Precepts and the Laws, which are perfect.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Promises and Threatnings, which are accomplished.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hymnes and Songs, which are pure, and holy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In what respect is God just in his Word?</p>
                  <p>First, he speaketh as he thinketh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth both as he speaketh and thinketh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:55421:42"/>
Thirdly, there is no part of his Word contrary to another.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he loveth those that speak the truth, and hateth those
that are liers.</p>
                  <p>What are the Works of God?</p>
                  <p>1. His eternall decree whereby he hath most justly decreed all
things, and the circumstances of all things from all eternity. 2. The
just execution thereof in time.</p>
                  <p>What justice doth God shew herein?</p>
                  <p>Both his disposing and his rewarding justice.</p>
                  <p>What is Gods disposing justice?</p>
                  <p>That by which he as a most free Lord ordereth all things in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
rightly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 17.</p>
                  <p>In what actions doth that appear?</p>
                  <p>First, he hath most justly and perfectly created all things of nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he hath most wisely, justly, and righteously disposed all
things being created.</p>
                  <p>What is Gods rewarding justice?</p>
                  <p>That whereby he rendreth to his creatures according to their
works.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth that appear?</p>
                  <p>First, he doth behold, and approve, and reward all good in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth behold, detest, and punish all evill in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
to which justice both his anger and his hatred are to be
referred.</p>
                  <p>What must we understand by anger in God?</p>
                  <p>Not any passion, perturbation, or trouble of the mind as it is in us,
but this word Anger when it is attributed to God in the Scriptures sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, a most certain and just decree in God to punish and avenge
such injuries as are offered to himself, and to his Church; and so it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<hi>Joh. 3. 36. Rom.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the threatning these punishments and revenges, as in <hi>Psal.
6. 1. Hos. 11. 9. Jonah</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the punishments themselves, which God doth execute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ungodly men, and these are the effects of his anger, or of his decree
to punish them; so it is taken in <hi>Rom. 2. 5. Mat. 3. 7. Eph.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>What use may we make of this Attribute?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The uses of Gods Justice.</note> it teacheth us that anger of it self is not simply evill, but then
it is good, when it is such as the Scripture attributeth to God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
to men; when it saith, Be angry and sin not, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods anger seemeth to raise us up from security.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must not be slothfull when we see the signs of Gods
wrath comming, but use ordinary means to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>What is that hatred that is attributed to God?</p>
                  <p>Not any passion, or grief of the mind as it is in us, but in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
these three things are signified thereby.</p>
                  <p>First, his deniall of good will and mercy to eternall salvation, as
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. I have hated <hi>Esau;</hi> that is, rejected him, and have not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55421:42"/>
him that favour and grace which I have shewed upon <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi>
and we also are said to hate those things which we neglect, and
upon which we will bestow no benefit nor credit, but doe put them
behind other things, and therefore it is said, If any man come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, &amp;c.
he cannot be my Disciple; that is, he that doth not put all these things
behind me, and neglect them for me, so that the love which he beareth
to them, must seem to be hatred in comparison of the love which he
must bear to me; and in this sense it is properly attributed to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the decree of Gods just will to punish sin, and the just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
it selfe which he hath decreed, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 6. &amp; <hi>Job</hi> 30. 21.
Thou turnest thy selfe meerly against me, and art an enemy unto me
with the strength of thine hand; that is, thou dost so sore chasten me,
as if thou didst hate me; and in this sense also it is properly attributed
to God, for it is a part of his Justice to take punishment of sinners.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods displeasure, for those things which we hate doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
us, and in this sense it is also properly attributed to God, for it
is the part of a most just Judge, to disallow and detest evill, as well as
to allow and like that which is good.</p>
                  <p>By what reason may this be confirmed?</p>
                  <p>It is the property of him that loveth, to hate and detest that which
is contrary to himselfe, and that which he loveth. For love cannot be
without his contrary of hatred; and as therefore the love of good
things doth properly agree to God; so doth also the hatred of evill
things, as they are evill things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is manifest by <hi>David,</hi> that it is no lesse vertue to hate
the evill, then it is to love the good; and this hatred of sinne as it
is a vertue, and perfect hatred cannot be in us but by the grace of God;
for every good gift is from above, &amp;c. and there can be no good thing
in us, but it is first in God after a more perfect manner then it is
in us.</p>
                  <p>What are we to learn thereby?</p>
                  <p>First, that it is a great vertue, and acceptable to God to hate
wickednesse, and wicked men themselves, not as they are men, but as
they are wicked; and as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 21, 22. And we are no
lesse bound to hate the enemies of God, as they are his enemies, then
to love God, and those that love him. And if we doe so, then we must
also flee their company, and have no friendship or fellowship with
them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we must distinguish betwixt mens persons and their
sins, and not to hate the persons of men, because they are the good
creatures of God, but their sinnes we must hate every day more and
more, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken of the essence and the essentiall proprieties of God, tell
me now how many Gods are there?</p>
                  <p>There is onely one God, and no more.</p>
                  <p>How may this unity of the Godhead be proved?</p>
                  <p>By expresse testimonies of Gods word; by reasons grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by nature it selfe guiding all things to one principle.</p>

8. 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>What reasons have you to prove that there is but one God?</p>
                  <p>First, we are charged to give unto God all our heart, and all our
strength, and all our soule. <hi>Deut. 6. 4, 5. Mark.</hi> 12. 29, 30. If one must
have all, there is none left for any other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is the chiefest good, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 15. the first cause, and
the high governour of all things, <hi>Acts 17. 28. Psal.</hi> 19. 1. but there can
be but one such.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the light of reason sheweth that there can be no more but
one that is infinite, independent and Almighty: if God be infinite and
omnipotent that doth all things, there can be but one, for all the rest
must be idle.</p>
                  <p>How doth nature guide all things to one principle?</p>
                  <p>The whole course of the world tendeth to one end, and to one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is God.</p>
                  <p>How can that be, when there be so many sundry things of divers
kinds and conditions, and one contrary to another?</p>
                  <p>That is true indeed, but yet they all together serve one God.</p>
                  <p>Is that possible, can you give an instance thereof, in some familiar
resemblance?</p>
                  <p>Yea, very well; in a field there are divers battells, divers standards,
sundry liveries, and yet all turn head with one sway at once, by which
we know that there is one Generall of the field which commands
them all.</p>
                  <p>What makes this to confirm your assertion that there is but one God
over so many divers and contrary things in the world?</p>
                  <p>Yes, for even so in the world we see divers things not one like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for some are noble, some are base, some hot, some cold, some well,
some lame, yet all serve to the glory of God their maker, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of man, and the accomplishment of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>And what gather you from all this?</p>
                  <p>That there is but one God which commandeth them all, like the
Generall of a field.</p>
                  <p>If one God be the Authour of all, why are there so many poysons and
noysome beasts?</p>
                  <p>They were not created noysome and hurtfull at the first, but
the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> brought the curse upon the creatures, <hi>Genes. 3.
17.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, although God hath cursed the creatures for mans
sinne, yet in his mercy hee doth so dispose and order them that
they are profitable for us, for poysons wee use them for Physick,
and the skins of wild beasts serve against the cold, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the most hurtfull things that are might benefit us if we
knew how to use them; and whereas they annoy us, it is not of their
own nature so much as of our ignorance.</p>
                  <p>And what doe you conclude by all this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55421:43"/>
That they have not two beginnings, one good and another bad, as
some would imagine, but one Authour thereof, which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
alwayes most good and gracious.</p>
                  <p>If there be but one onely God, how is it in the Scripture that many are
called Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. as <hi>Moses</hi> is called <hi>Pharaohs</hi> God, <hi>Exod.
7.</hi> 1. and Magistrates are called Gods, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 6. as Idols, and
the belly, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. yea, and the Devill himselfe is called God
of this world, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name <hi>Elohim</hi> or God, is sometimes improperly given to other
things, either as they participate of God his communicable attributes,
as in the two first instances; or as they are abusively set up by man in
the place of God (as in the other;) but properly it signifieth him, who
is by nature God, and hath his beeing not from any thing but himself,
and all other things are from him, and in this sense unto us there is but
one God and Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. unto whom therefore, the name <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>
is in Scripture incommunicably appropriated.</p>
                  <p>Why then are Magistrates called Gods?</p>
                  <p>For foure causes: first, to teach us that such must be chosen to beare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
rule, which excell others in godlinesse, like Gods among men.</p>
                  <p>To encourage them in their offices, and to teach them that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
should not feare the faces of men; like Gods, which feare nothing.</p>
                  <p>To shew how God doth honour them, and how they must honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
God again, for when they remember how God hath invested them
with his own name, it should make them ashamed to serve the Devill
or the world, or their own affections; and move them to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
justly, as if God himselfe were there.</p>
                  <p>To teach us to obey them as we would obey God himselfe, for he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
which contemneth them, contemneth God himselfe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. and
we must not dishonour those, whom God doth honour.</p>
                  <p>Why are Idols called Gods?</p>
                  <p>Not because they are so indeed, but because Idolaters have such an
opinion of them.</p>
                  <p>Why is the belly called a God?</p>
                  <p>Because some make more thereof then of God and his worship, for
all that they can doe and get is little enough for their bellies, and
when they should serve God, they serve their bellies and beastly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</p>
                  <p>And why is the Devill called the God of this world.</p>
                  <p>Because of the great power and Soveraignty which is given him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the wicked, whom God hath not chosen out of this world.</p>
                  <p>There being but one simple and individed Godhead, to whom doth
this divine nature belong? is it to be attributed to one, or to many
persons?</p>
                  <p>We must acknowledge and adore three distinct persons subsisting
in the unity of the Godhead.<note place="margin">Of the Trinity</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But doe you not beleeve the Godhead is to be divided, whilst you beleeve
that in one God are three persons?</p>
                  <p>No, not divided into divers essences, but distinguished unto divers
persons, for God cannot be divided into severall natures, nor into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55421:44"/>
parts; and therefore must the persons which subsist in that one
essence be onely distinct and not separate one from another, as in the
example of the Sun, the beames and the heat.</p>
                  <p>What be those resemblances that are commonly brought to shadow out
unto us the mystery of the Trinity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the Sun begetteth his own beams, and from thence proceeds
light and heat, and yet is none of them before another, otherwise then
in consideration of order and relation, that is to say, that the beams are
begotten of the body of the Sun, and the light and heat proceed from
both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, from one flame of fire proceed both light and heat, and
yet but one fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in waters there is the well-head and the spring boyling out
of it, and the stream flowing from them both, and all these are but one
water; and so there are there persons in one Godhead, yet but one God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, in man the understanding cometh from the soul, and the
will from both.</p>
                  <p>May it be collected by naturall reason, that there is a Trinity of Persons
in the Vnity of the God-head?</p>
                  <p>No, for it is the highest mystery of Divinity, and the knowledge
thereof is most proper to Christians, for the Turkes and Jewes doe
confesse one God-head, but no distinction of persons in the same.</p>
                  <p>How come we then by the knowledge of this mystery?</p>
                  <p>God hath revealed it in the holy Scriptures unto the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>What have we to learn of this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That those are deceived who think this mystery is not sufficiently
delivered in the Scripture, but dependeth upon the tradition of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That sith this is a wonderfull mystery which the Angels doe adore,
we should not dare to speak any thing in it farther then we have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
out of the word of God, yea, we must tye our selves almost to the
very words of the Scripture, lest in searching we exceed and goe too
farre, and so be overwhelmed with the glory.</p>
                  <p>How doth it appear in the holy Scripture, that the three Persons are of
that divine nature?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Declare then the order of the persons of the blessed Trinity.</p>
                  <p>The first in order is the Father, then those that come from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Sonne who is the second, and the holy Ghost who is the third
person in Trinity.</p>
                  <p>How are these three distinguished by order and relation?</p>
                  <p>The Father is of himself alone and of no other, the Son is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alone begotten, the holy Ghost is of the Father and the Son pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
and the Father is called a Father in respect of the Son, the Son
in respect of the Father, the holy Ghost in respect that he proceedeth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55421:45"/>
from the Father and the Son; but the one is not the other, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is not the stream, nor the stream the fountain, but are so called one
in respect of another, and yet all but one water.</p>

                  <p>How is it proved that the Father is God?</p>
                  <p>By expresse testimonies of the Scriptures, and by reason drawn from
the same.</p>
                  <p>What are those expresse testimonies?</p>

                  <p>What are the reasons drawn from the word of God?</p>
                  <p>That we are bidden to pray to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6. 9. that he revealeth
the mysteries, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. 27. suffereth his Son to shine, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45.</p>
                  <p>How is it shewed that he begat his Son of himself?</p>
                  <p>In that he is called the brightnesse of his glory, and the engraven
form of his person, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and in that his generation being from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
there was no creature who might beget him.</p>
                  <p>In what respects is he called the Father?</p>

or originally, and from none other; the Son and the holy Ghost
have the self-same uncreated and unbegotten essence in themselves as

but not from themselves. <hi>Essentia Filii est à seipso, &amp; hac ratione dici potest

cause he may be said to be God of himself; notwithstanding the person
of the Son is not of himself, and therefore for this cause he cannot be
said to be God of himself; for his person is begotten of the Father by
receiving from him an unbegotten essence.</p>
                  <p>If these Persons that come from the Father have a beginning, how
can they be eternall?</p>
                  <p>They have no beginning of time or continuance, but of order, of
subsistence and off-spring, and that from all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Are you able to set down the manner of this eternall off-spring?</p>
                  <p>We find it not revealed touching the manner; and therefore our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
herein is better then all their curiosity, that have enterprized
arrogantly the search hereof; for if our own generation and frame in
our mothers womb be above our capacity, <hi>Ps.</hi> 139. 14, 15. it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell

                  <p>Thus much in generall touching the Persons which come from the
Father:<note place="margin">Of the second Person in the Trinity.</note> Now in speciall what is the Son?</p>
                  <p>The second Person of the Trinity, having the foundation of perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
subsistence from the Father alone, of whom by communication
of his essence he is begotten from all eternity, <hi>Joh. 5. 26. Psalm. 2. 7.
Prov. 8. 22, &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 30. 4.</p>
                  <p>What names are given unto him in this respect?</p>
                  <p>First, the only begotten Son of God, <hi>Joh. 1. 14. &amp;</hi> 3. 18. because
he is only begotten of the nature and substance of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, first-begotten, <hi>Heb. 1. 6. Rom.</hi> 8. 29. not as though the
Father begat any after, but because he begat none before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Image and brightnesse of his Fathers glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.
because the glory of the Father is expressed in the Son.</p>
                  <p>But why is he called the Word? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>He is called the Word, or speech, for so doth <hi>Logos</hi> more properly
signifie.</p>
                  <p>First, because as speech is the birth of the mind, so is the Son of his
Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as a man revealeth the meaning of the heart by the
words of his mouth, so God revealeth his word by his Son, <hi>Joh. 1. 18.
Heb.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is so often spoken of, and promised in the Scriptures, and
is in a manner the whole subject of the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 45.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:55421:46"/>
How prove you that the Son is God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is in the Scriptures expresly called God, and Jehovah, and
likewise the essentiall properties, the works &amp; actions of God are given
to him,</hi> Esa. 9. 6. &amp; 25. 9. Zach. 2. 10, 11. Prov. 1. 22. Joh. 1. 1. &amp;
20. 28. Rom. 9. 5. Phil. 1. 6. Heb. 1. 8. 10. 1 John 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>How doe you prove it by his Works?</p>
                  <p>His works were such as none could doe but God; for,</p>
                  <p>he made the world, which none could doe but God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  </p>

God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Can you prove the Son to be God by comparing the old Testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the New together?</p>
                  <p>Yes; for what the old Testament speaks of Jehovah, which is God,
that the new Testament applieth to Christ; as,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>David</hi> saith, Jehovah went up on high, and led Captivity
captive, <hi>Psal. 68. 16. Paul</hi> applieth it to Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Psalmist saith, Jehovah was tempted, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 95. 9.
which <hi>Paul</hi> applieth to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Esay</hi> saith, Jehovah is the first and the last, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. 4. this
is also applied to Christ, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 6.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Esay</hi> saith, Jehovah will not give his glory to any other
then to himself, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42. 8. but it is given to Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ is Jehovah.</p>
                  <p>For the understanding of the generation of the Son, shew me the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
manners of begetting.</p>
                  <p>There is two manners of begetting: the one is carnall and outward;
and this is subject to corruption, alteration and time; the other is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
and inward, as was the begetting of the Son of God, in whose
generation there is neither corruption, alteration, nor time.</p>
                  <p>Declare then after what manner this spirituall generation of the Son
of God was, and yet in sobriety, according to the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>For the better finding out of this mystery, we must consider in God
two things: First, that in God there is an understanding, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 2.
Secondly, we must consider how this understanding is occupied in
God.</p>
                  <p>Declare after what manner it is in God.</p>
                  <p>This understanding is his very beeing, and is everlastingly, and most
perfectly occupied in God.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon doth Gods understanding work?</p>
                  <p>Upon nothing but it self, and that I prove by reason, for God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infinite and all in all, it cannot meet with any thing but himself.</p>
                  <p>What work doth this understanding in God effect?</p>
                  <p>It doth understand and conceive it self: for as in a glasse a man doth
conceive and beget a perfect image of his own face, so God in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and minding of himself, doth in himself beget a most perfect and
most lively image of himself, which is that in the Trinity which we
call the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55421:47"/>
Where doe you finde that the Sonne is called the perfect Image
of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. He is called the brightnesse of his glory, and the engraven
form of his Person, which is all one.</p>
                  <p>What mean you by engraven Image?</p>
                  <p>That as wax upon a seal hath the engraven forme of the seal, so the
Sonne of God which his Father hath begotten of his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
is the very form of his Fathers understanding, so that
when the one is seen, the other is seen also.</p>
                  <p>Why then he is Vnderstanding it self, for so is his Father?</p>
                  <p>Yea, he is so, and he saith so of himself; I have Counsell and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
I am Understanding, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
                  <p>But where finde you that he was begotten?</p>
                  <p>He saith so himself, in the name of Wisdome, in these words, When
there was no depths then was I begotten, before the Mountains and
Hils were setled was I begotten, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Yea, he was made the Son of God when he was born of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
was he not?</p>
                  <p>He was indeed then the Son of God, but he was not then made the
Son of God.</p>
                  <p>When then was he made the Son of God?</p>
                  <p>He was never made in time, for he was begotten of the substance of
his Father from all eternity without beginning or ending.</p>
                  <p>How prove you that the Son of God was not made, but begotten eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
of the substance of his Father?</p>
                  <p>I prove it, first, by scripture, for he saith no lesse himself; I was set
up from everlasting, from the beginning and before the earth, <hi>Prov.
8.</hi> 23. and therefore he prayed that he might be glorified of his
Father with the glory which he had with his Father before the
world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I prove it by reason, for Gods understanding is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting,
therefore the second Person which it begetteth, is so
too; for the Father in his understanding did not conceive any
thing lesse then himself, nor greater then himself, but equall to
himself.</p>
                  <p>Although the Sonne of God be from everlasting, yet he is not all one
with the Father, is he?</p>
                  <p>Yes that he is, and yet not joyned with his Father in heaven as two
Judges that sit together on a Bench, or as the seal and the wax,
as some doe grosly imagine, but they are both one without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
(<hi>John</hi> 10. 30.) or mingling, whereupon I conclude, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Father is, the Son is the same, and so consequently that
they be co-eternall, co-equall, and co-essentiall.</p>
                  <p>Men by reason doe conceive, and beget reason, what difference is
there between the conceiving of understanding in men, and
the conceiving of understanding in God?</p>
                  <p>There is great difference; for, first, this conceiving in men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of sense or outward imagination, which is an outward
thing for reason to work upon, as wood is to fire, but God the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55421:47"/>
Father of himself, begetteth and conceiveth himself, and still in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as <hi>John</hi> saith, the only begotten Son which is in the bosome of
the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in men, the thing which is understood, and the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it self is not all one, but in God it is all one.</p>
                  <p>What reason have you for this?</p>
                  <p>The reason is, because only God is altogether life, and his life is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
understanding, and his understanding is the highest degree of
life, and therefore he hath his conceiving and begetting most inward
of all.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say most inward of all?</p>
                  <p>I mean that the Father conceiveth of himself, and in himself, and
his conceiving is a begetting, and his begetting abideth still in himself,
because his understanding can no where meet with any thing, but that
which he himself is, and that is the second subsistence in the Trinity
which we call Everlasting Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Now let me hear what the holy Ghost is,<note place="margin">Of the third Person in the Trinity.</note> and how he proceedeth from
the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>For the understanding of this matter wee must consider two
things.</p>
                  <p>First, that in the essence of God besides his understanding there
is a will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what be the properties of this will in God, <hi>Esa.</hi> 46. 10.</p>
                  <p>What are the properties of Gods will?</p>
                  <p>First, it applieth his power when, where, and how he thinks good,
according to his own mind.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it worketh everlastingly upon it self as his understanding
doth.</p>
                  <p>What doe you gather by this?</p>
                  <p>That because it hath no other thing to work upon but it self,
it doth delight it self in the infinite good which it knoweth in it self,
for the action of the will is delight and liking.</p>
                  <p>And what of that?</p>
                  <p>That delight which God or his will hath in his own infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
doth bring forth a third Person or subsistence in God, which we
call The holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>What is that same third subsistence in God?</p>
                  <p>The mutuall kindnesse and lovingnesse of the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>What mean you by this mutuall lovingnesse and kindnesse?</p>
                  <p>The Father taketh joy and delight in the Son or his own Image
conceived by his understanding, and the Son likewise rejoyceth in his
Father as he saith himself;<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 3.</note> and the reason thereof is this, the action of
the will when it is fulfilled is love and liking.</p>
                  <p>What resemblance can you shew thereof in some thing that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used amongst us?</p>
                  <p>When a man looketh in a glasse, if he smile, his image smileth too,
and if he taketh delight in it, it taketh the same delight in him, for they
are both one.</p>
                  <p>If they be all one then there are not three beeings?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55421:48"/>
The face is one beeing, the image of the face in a glasse is another
beeing, and the smiling of them both together is a third beeing; and
yet all are in one face, and all are of one face, and all are but one face.</p>
                  <p>And is it so in God?</p>
                  <p>Yea, for even so the understanding which is in God is one beeing,
the reflection or image of his understanding which he beholdeth in
himself as in a glasse is a second beeing, and the love and liking of them
both together by reason of the will fulfilled is a third beeing in God,
and yet all are but of one God, all are in one God, and all are but
one God.</p>
                  <p>Which of these three is first?</p>
                  <p>There is neither first nor last, going afore or comming after, in the
essence of God, but all these as they are everlasting, so they are all at
once and at one instant, even as in a glasse the face and the image of
the face, when they smile, they smile together, and not one before,
not after another.</p>
                  <p>What is the conclusion of all?</p>
                  <p>As we have the Son of the Father by his everlasting will in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by his understanding; so also we have the holy Ghost of the love
of them both by the joint working of the understanding and will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
whereupon we conclude three distinct Persons or in-beeings
(which we call the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost) in one spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
yet unspeakable substance, which is very God himself.</p>
                  <p>But what if some will be yet more curious to know how the Son of
God should be begotten, and how the holy Ghost should proceed from
the Father and the Son, how may we satisfie them?</p>
                  <p>Well enough; for if any will be too curious about this point, we
may answer them thus, Let them shew us how themselves are bred and
begotten, and then let them aske us how the Son of God is begotten;
and let them tell us the nature of the spirit, that beateth in their pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and then let them be inquisitive at our hands for the proceeding of
the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>And what if they cannot give us a reason for the manner of their own
beeing, may they not be inquisitive for the manner of Gods beeing?</p>
                  <p>No; for if they must be constrained to be ignorant in so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
matters which they daily see and feel in themselves, let them
give us leave to be ignorant not only in this, but in many things moe
which are such as no eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor wit of man
can conceive.</p>
                  <p>Let us now hear out of the Scriptures what the holy Ghost is?</p>
                  <p>He is the third Person of the Trinity by communication of essence,
eternally proceeding from the Father and from the Son.</p>
                  <p>Are you able to prove out of the Scripture that the holy Ghost is God?</p>
                  <p>Yes; because the many properties and actions of God are therein gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him as to the Father and to the Son.</p>
                  <p>Let us hear some of those proofs.</p>
                  <p>1<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. the work of Creation is attributed to the Spirit of God.
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. <hi>Esa.</hi> 61. 1. the Spirit of the Lord God is said to be upon Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord anointed him, &amp;c. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55421:48"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> calleth us Gods Temples, because the Holy Ghost dwelleth in us,
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 66. Epistle to <hi>Maximinus</hi> saith it is a cleare argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his God-head, if we were commanded to make him a Temple
but of timber and stone, because that worship is due to God only, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now we must much more think that he is God, because we are not
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to make him a temple, but to be a temple for him our selves.</p>
                  <p>What other reason have you out of the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> reproving <hi>Ananias</hi> for lying to the Holy Ghost, said, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
lyed not to men, but to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Have you any more reasons from the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>Yea, two more, one from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and another from Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Esay</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>What is your reason from <hi>Saint</hi> Paul?</p>
                  <p>When he sheweth how many sundry gifts are given to men, he saith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that one and the selfe-same Spirit is the distributer of them all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is God, for none can distribute those gifts which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of
but God, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. ver.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>What is your reason from <hi>Esay and Saint</hi> Paul together?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Esay</hi> saith in the Chapter 6. 9. I heard the Lord speaking, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
place <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 25.</p>
                  <p>But how can you prove out of the Scriptures that the Holy Ghost is
God proceeding from the Father and the Sonne?</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>John 15. 26. When the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you
from the Father, even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he shall testifie of me:</hi> That he proceedeth from the Father is here
expresly affirmed, that hee proceedeth from the Sonne is by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
consequence implyed, because the Sonne is said to send him, as
<hi>John</hi> 14. 26. The Father is said to send him in the Sonnes name, by
which sending the order of the persons of the Trinity is evidently
designed, because the Sonne is of the Father, and the Father is not of
the Sonne; therefore we find in Scripture that the Father sendeth his
Sonne, but never that the Sonne sendeth his Father. In like manner
because the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and from the Son,
we find that both the Father and the Son doe send the Holy Ghost,
but never that the Holy Ghost doth send either Father or Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>John</hi> 16. 15. the Sonne saith of the Holy Ghost, <hi>all things
that the Father hath are mine, therefore said I that he shall take of mine, and
shall shew it unto you.</hi> All things that the Father hath, the Sonne recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
from him as coming from him, and so whatsoever the Holy Ghost
hath, he hath it not of himselfe <hi>vers.</hi> 13. but from the Sonne, and so
from the Father, as a person proceeding as well from the one as from
the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your
hearts:</hi> As the Holy Ghost is called the Spirit of the Father, <hi>Esa.
48. 16. The Lord and his Spirit hath sent me;</hi> so is he here also called
the Spirit of the Son, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. the Spirit of God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ. Now, if the spirit of man in whom there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
be all one with man, much more the Spirit of the Father
is all one with the Father, and the Spirit of the Sonne is all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55421:49"/>
one with the Sonne, and so the Holy Ghost with the Father and the
Sonne is the same in deity, dignity, eternity, operation, and will.</p>
                  <p>Why is the third Person called the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Not onely because he is a spirituall (that is) an immateriall and pure
essence, (for so likewise is the Father a Spirit, and the Sonne as well as
he) but first in regard of his person, because he is spired, and as it
were, breathed both from the Father and the Sonne, that is to say, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from them both. Secondly, in regard of the creatures, because
the Father and the Sonne doe work by the Spirit, who is, as it were,
the breath of grace which the Father and the Sonne breatheth out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Saints, blowing freely where it listeth; and working spiritually
for manner, means, and matter, where it pleaseth, <hi>John 20. 22. Psal.
33. 6. John 3. 8. Acts 2. 2, 3, 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Why is he called the Holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>Not onely because of his essentiall holinesse as God, (for so the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Sonne also are infinitely holy as he) but because he is the
authour and worker of all holinesse in men, and the sanctifier of Gods
children.</p>
                  <p>Why doth not the Father and the Sonne sanctifie also?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, but they doe it by him, and because he doth immediately
sanctify, therefore he hath the title of Holy.</p>
                  <p>What other titles are given unto him in the word of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Holy Ghost (who is the Spirit of the Father) speaking in the
old Testament, hath these names and properties. First, the good
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Spirit, because he is the fountain of goodnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Secondly, the Spirit of God, because he is God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the finger of God, because God worketh by him as a man
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by his hand, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Comforter, because he strengthneth the weak hearts of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> his Saints, <hi>John</hi> 20. 26.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the spirit of Adoption, because he assureth our hearts, that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> we be the adopted Saints of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the spirit of love, power, sobriety, wisdome, &amp;c. because
it worketh all these things in us, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 6, 7. Esa.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall comforts which the children of God receive
from the holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>He is in their hearts the pledge of Christs presence, <hi>Ioh. 14. 16, 17, 18.
26.</hi> The witnesse of their Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. The guide of their

                  </p>

                  <p>By nourishing the good motions and means of it, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 17,

                  <p>Thus much of the three Persons severally, what now remaineth more
to be spoken of the mystery of the Trinity?</p>
                  <p>To set down briefly what be the things common wherein the three
Persons agree,<note place="margin">Things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the three persons.</note> and what be the things proper to each of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are distinguished one from another.</p>
                  <p>What are the things wherein the three Persons doe communicate?</p>
                  <p>They are considered in regard either of themselves, or of the creatures.<note place="margin">In what they all agree.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What are they in regard of themselves?</p>
                  <p>They agree one with another in nature, beeing, life, time, dignity, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or any thing pertaining to the divine Essence; for in all these they
are one and the same, and consequently, Co-essentiall, Co-equall, and
Co-eternall.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say they be Co-essentiall?<note place="margin">1. Coc-essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they be all the self-same substance or beeing, having one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
essence or deity common to them all, and the self-same in them all.</p>
                  <p>VVhat mean you when you say they be Co-equall.<note place="margin">2. Co-equall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That as they agree in deity, so they agree in dignity, being of one
state, condition, and degree; and the one having as great excellency
and Majesty every way as the other: therefore their honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is equall and alike; and one of them is not greater nor more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then another, <hi>John 5. 18. 23. Apoc.</hi> 5. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>What mean you when you say that they be Co-eternall?<note place="margin">3. Co-eternall,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That one was not before another in time, but that one hath been of
as long continuance as another, and all of them have been and shall be
forever (as being all of one self-same everlasting continuance.)</p>
                  <p>How prove you this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. In the beginning was the word, &amp;c. and at that time the
three Persons spake, <hi>Gen. 1. 26</hi> Let us make man, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. Jesus
Christ yesterday, to day, and the same for ever.</p>
                  <p>How can there be this equality betwixt the three Persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
seeing the Father is the first, the Sonne the second, the Holy
Ghost the third?</p>
                  <p>Because every one of them is perfect God, who is infinite, eternall,
and incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>Have they all three one will likewise?</p>
                  <p>They have, and therefore they will all one and the same thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any crossing, contradiction or varying in themselves, as the Sonne
himselfe said, <hi>John</hi> 8. 29. I doe alwayes those things that please him,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Father.</p>
                  <p>Is there nothing else to be said of the Communion of the three Persons
betwixt themselves?</p>
                  <p>Yes, that first one is in another and possesseth one another; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
remaineth with the Sonne, the Sonne with the Father, the Holy
Ghost in and with them both. <hi>Prov. 8. 22. John</hi> 1. 1. &amp; 14. 10. 14. 20.</p>
                  <p>They have glory one of another from all eternity. <hi>John</hi> 17. 5.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                  <p>They delight one in another, and infinitely rejoyce in one anothers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55421:50"/>
fellowship, the Sonne being the delight of his Father, the Father of
the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost of both. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30.</p>
                  <p>What things have they common in regard of the creatures?</p>
                  <p>All outward actions, as to decree, to create, to order, govern, and
direct, to redeem, to sanctifie, are equally common to the three Persons
of the Trinity; for as they are all one in nature and will, so must they
be also one in operation, all of them working one and the same thing
together, <hi>Gen. 1. 26. John</hi> 5. 17. 19.</p>
                  <p>What are the things proper to each of them?<note place="margin">Things proper to each of the Persons.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They likewise are partly in regard of themselves, and partly of
the creatures, whereby the distinction of them is conceived; partly
in relation and order of subsistence betwixt themselves, and partly in
order and manner of working in the creatures.</p>
                  <p>What things are proper to each of them in regard of themselves?</p>
                  <p>First, in manner and order of beeing, the Father is the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
having his beeing from himself alone, and is the fountaine of bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the other Persons; the Sonne is the second, having his beeing
from the Father alone, and in that respect is called the Light, the
Wisdom, the Word, and the Image of the Father. The Holy Ghost is
the third, having his beeing from them both; and in that respect is
called the Spirit of God, of the Father, and of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in their inward actions and properties, the Father alone
begetteth; and so in relation to the second Person is called the Father;
the Sonne is of the Father alone begotten; the Holy Ghost doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
both from the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>What is proper to each of them in regard of the creatures?</p>
                  <p>First, the originall of the action is ascribed to the Father, <hi>John
5.</hi> 17. 19. the wisdome and manner of working to the Sonne, <hi>John
1. 3. Heb.</hi> 1. 2. the efficacy of operation to the Holy Ghost, <hi>Gen. 1. 2.
1 Cor.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Father worketh all things of himselfe in the Sonne
by the Holy Ghost, the Sonne worketh from the Father by the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Ghost worketh from the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken of the first part of Divinity, which is of the nature of

the Prophet speaketh in this manner;</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Lord reigneth,</hi> which teacheth us that God alone hath, and
exerciseth soveraign and absolute Empire over all; and that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
no fellow-governour with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the people tremble,</hi> shewing that all nations and sorts of people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
should tremble, forasmuch as he alone is able to save and to destroy; for
if men tremble under the Regiment and Kingly rule of men, how
much more ought they to tremble under the powerfull Kingdome of
God, which hath more power over them then they have over their
Subjects?</p>
                  <p>This trembling, doth it stand onely in feare?</p>
                  <p>No, but in reverence also, that that which we comprehend not in
this Kingdome with our reason, we reverence and adore.</p>
                  <p>What learn you thereby?</p>
                  <p>That we submit our selves to his Kingdome erected amongst us.</p>
                  <p>That we presume to know nothing but that he teacheth us; to will
nothing but what he biddeth us; to love, hate, feare, and affect nothing
but what he requireth.</p>
                  <p>What doth follow in this 99. Psalme?</p>
                  <p>Vers. 1, 2. <hi>He sitteth between the Cherubims, let the earth be moved; the
Lord is great in</hi> Sion, <hi>and he is high above all the people.</hi> Whence we
learn, that although all the world roare and fret, yet we should not
feare, because the Lord is greater; (<hi>Ps.</hi> 39. 1. 4. &amp; 97. 1.) Vers. 3. <hi>They
shall praise thy great and fearfull name, for it is holy:</hi> which sheweth that
God ought to be magnified because he is great and fearfull, and yet
holy, and holinesse it selfe. Ver. 4. <hi>The Kings strength also loveth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Thou dost establish Equity, Thou executest Judgement, and
Righteousnesse in Jacob:</hi> whereby we learn this comfort from Gods
reigning, that when we are wronged and oppressed by tyranny of men,
we may have our recourse to the just and righteous Judgment of God
which is the righteous Judge of the world. (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 7, 8.) Vers. 5. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
ye the Lord our God &amp;c.</hi> out of the might, and Majesty, and holinesse
of the Lord, we should learn to extoll him with praises. <hi>Ps.</hi> 145. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Seeing God is without beginning, what did he in that infinite space,
which was ere the world was made; it being unbeseeming the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God to be idle and unoccupied all that time?</p>
                  <p>It behoveth us to think that he did things agreeable to his divine
nature, but we should be evill occupied in the search of them further
then himselfe hath made them known, which made an ancient Father
to give this answer to a curious inquirer of Gods doings before he
made the world, That he was making hell for those that should trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <p>First, that the things which he decreeth are most perfectly good.
Secondly, that we must not subject his decree to our shallow and base

                  <p>What note you in the former?</p>

every (both) thing and action, whether past, present, or to come;
and not onely the things and actions themselves, but also all their
circumstances of place and time, meanes, manner, and end; so that

them to the determined end, whereupon the effects and events

                  <p>What creatures come within this decree?</p>

                  <p>What is the cause of this decree?</p>
                  <p>Only the meer will and free pleasure of God to dispose of his own

                  <p>What manner of decree is this?</p>
                  <p>It is a deep and unsearchable, an eternall and immutable decree,
<hi>Rom. 11. 32. Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>Is this decree certain and unchangeable?</p>
                  <p>Yea, it must needs be so, because it is grounded on the eternall
and unchangeable will of God, and therefore there is a certain number
of the elect and reprobate known only to God which cannot possibly
be encreased or diminished, <hi>John 13. 18. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>How then doth <hi>Moses</hi> wish himselfe to be blotted out of the book of

                  <p>VVhat is Election?</p>
                  <p>It is the everlasting predestination or fore-appointing of certain
Angels and Men unto everlasting life and blessednesse for the praise
of his glorious grace, and goodnesse, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 21. Joh. 15. 16. Rom.
9. 22, 23. Eph.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>Is there no cause, reason, or inducement of election in the elected
themselves?</p>
                  <p>None at all; it is wholly of free-grace, without respect of any
goodnesse that God fore-saw in us, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Rom. 9. 16. Phil.
2. 13. Eph.</hi> 1. 9. for otherwise man should have whereof he might
glory in, and of himself, as having discerned himself from others,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55421:52"/>
and God should not be the cause of all good, nor should his counsell
be incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>Is not Christ the cause of our Election?</p>
                  <p>No; not of Gods decreeing of it, (for that he did of his own free-will)
but of the execution of it; that is, our salvation is for and
through Christ.</p>

                  <p>What use are we to make of our Election?</p>
                  <p>First, it is our great comfort, that our salvation standeth by Gods
eternall decree that cannot be changed, and not in our selves that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might lose it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it sheweth Gods infinite mercy, that before we were, or
had done good or evill, he elected us rather then others as good as
wee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it should make us love God all our life to our uttermost,
for his love to us.</p>

nature, and also against all afflictions and contempt of the world, <hi>Rom.

                  <p>Fiftly, it serveth to humble us, that we had nothing of our selves

                  <p>What is Reprobation?<note place="margin">Reprobation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the eternall predestination or fore-appointment of certain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and men unto everlasting dishonour and destruction; God of
his own free-will determining to passe them by, refuse or cast them
off, and for sin to condemn and punish them with eternall death, <hi>Prov.
16. 4. Exod. 9. 16. Rom. 9. 17. 22. 2 Tim. 2. 20. Mat.</hi> 25. 41.</p>
                  <p>Is not sin the cause of Reprobation?</p>
                  <p>No; for then all men should be reprobate, when God foresaw that
all would be sinners; but sin is the cause of the execution of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the damnation whereunto the wicked are adjudged being for
their own sin.</p>
                  <p>Is there no cause then of Reprobation in the Reprobate?</p>
                  <p>None at all, in that they rather then others are passed by of God;
that is wholly from the unsearchable depth of Gods own free-will
and good pleasure.</p>
                  <p>But is not God unjust in reprobating some men, and electing others,
when all were alike?</p>
                  <p>No; for he was bound to none, and to shew his freedome and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over his creatures he disposeth of them as he will for his glory; as
the Potter is not unjust in making of the same clay sundry vessels, some
to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
                  <p>Doth Predestination only come within the compasse of Gods decree,
and not the means also of accomplishing the same?</p>
                  <p>Yes; the means also comes within this decree, as the Creation and
the fall of the reasonable creatures.</p>
                  <p>If God hath decreed the works of the wicked, must not he of force be
the author of sin and evill?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:55421:52"/>
God is not the cause of sinne and evill which he forbiddeth and
condemneth, but Satan and man; yet God in his secret will hath
justly decreed the evill works of the wicked (for if it had not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, they had never been at all) for most holy ends, both of
his glory and their punishment, as may be seen in the Jews cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. and <hi>Josephs</hi> selling into Egypt, <hi>Gen.
45. 7. &amp;</hi> 50. 20. For the thing that in it self by reason of Gods prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
of it is sin; in respect of Gods decreeing of it for a holy end,
comes in the place of a good thing, as being some occasion or way
to manifest the glory of God in his justice and mercy; for there is
nothing sin as God decreeth it or commandeth it, neither is there
any thing of it selfe absolutely evill; (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17.) But because
God hath forbidden it, therefore it is evill, and only unto them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom God hath forbidden it: as <hi>Abraham</hi> killing of <hi>Isaac</hi> being
commanded of God was to be obeyed, and sin it were to have diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
it, which otherwise by reason of Gods commandment forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to kill was a sin; for God forbiddeth not things, because they
are of themselves, and first evill, but therefore are they to man evill,
because God hath forbidden them; for all sin is a transgression of a
law, and God doth in heaven and in earth whatsoever pleaseth him,
neither is there any greater then he to command him.</p>

                  <p>Who is the Authour of this wonderfull work?</p>
                  <p>God alone.</p>
                  <p>How doth that appear?</p>
                  <p>Not only by the plain and manifold testimonies of holy Scripture,
but also by light of reason well directed; for reason teacheth, that
there must needs be a first cause of all things, from whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
not only as they are this or that, but simply as they are; that
all perfections which are in other things by participation should be
in it essentially, and that the same must be of infinite wisdome in that
all things are made and ordered unto so good purposes as they are, none
of which things can agree to any but to God alone, whence it is that
the Apostle <hi>Paul, Acts 14. 15. &amp;</hi> 17. 24. doth point out God to the
Heathen by his work above other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55421:53"/>
Is not Creation then an article of faith above reason?</p>
                  <p>Yes; in regard of the time and manner of it, as likewise in respect of
a full and saving assent unto it with comfort.</p>
                  <p>Is the Father alone to be held the Creator of all things?</p>
                  <p>No; but together with him the Son also, and the holy Ghost, for so
S. <hi>John</hi> testifieth, that by Christ the eternall Word and Wisdome of
God al things were made, &amp; without him was made nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3.
In like manner S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that by him all things were created in
heaven and in earth, both things visible and invisible, whether they
be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, by him, and
for him they were all created, <hi>Col. 1. 16. Moses</hi> also declareth, that
the Spirit of the Lord moved upon the waters, sustaining and holding
up, and as it were brooding (for that metaphor he useth) the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
matter to bring forth the most comely and beautifull forms of
all things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>Did not the Angels create some creatures at the beginning? or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Man or the Devils now create creatures?</p>
                  <p>No; Creation is a work of God which only he is able to doe, and
therefore whatsoever the Devill or Judges like the Sorcerers of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
seem to doe, it is nothing but a delusion of the senses, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
himself confesseth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and the Sorcerers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>What, was there not something before the Creation, as the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all things, or space, or the time, in which this world was
made?</p>
                  <p>No; for then there should be something eternall as well as God.</p>
                  <p>Whereof then were all things made?</p>
                  <p>Of nothing, that is, of no matter which was before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>How doth that appear?</p>
                  <p>Because they are said to have been made in the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1.
that is, when before there was not any thing but God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and before which there was no measure of time by men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p>How and in what manner did God create all things?</p>
                  <p>By no means or instruments, (which he needeth not as man doth)
but by his powerful word, that is, by his only will, calling those things
that are not as though they were, <hi>Heb. 11. 3. Rom. 4. 17. Ps.</hi> 148. 5.</p>
                  <p>Was that Word by which he made all things, Christ his Son?</p>
                  <p>All things indeed that were made were made by the Son, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Person of the Trinity, <hi>Joh. 1. 3. Col. 1. 16. Heb.</hi> 1. 2. yet that
word mentioned in the 1. <hi>Gen.</hi> where it is written, that the Lord said,
Let there be light, &amp;c. was Gods command, which then had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
whereas the Son was from all eternity.</p>
                  <p>To what end were all things created?</p>
                  <p>For Gods glory, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
                  <p>How doth the glory of God appear in them?</p>
                  <p>First, his eternall power and Godhead is seen in raising all things
out of nothing by his word alone, <hi>Esay 40. 12. Rom. 1. 20. Jer.
10. 12. &amp;</hi> 51. 15.</p>

Secondly, his infinite wisdome is made known by them, <hi>Psal.
104. 24. Jer. 10. 12. &amp;</hi> 51. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his goodnesse unto all his creatures is hereby manifested,
which is very excellently set out by the Prophet in the 104. <hi>Psalm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, his infinite authority doth appear by them.</p>
                  <p>What uses then are we to make of the Creation?<note place="margin">Uses of the Creation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, we are thereby taught to discern the true God from all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and Idoll gods in the world, <hi>Esay 45. 6, 7. Jer.</hi> 10. 11, 12. for
nothing in heaven and earth can give a beeing to a creature but God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to weigh them and learn their properties, <hi>Eccles.
7.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we should learn to give God glory for them, <hi>Rev. 4. 11.
Psal.</hi> 92. 5. where it is made one end of the Sabbath, <hi>Ps.</hi> 104. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are to gather comfort to our selves from hence, That
resting upon this faithfull Creator our hope needs not fail us so long as
either heaven or earth have any help for us, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 19. Esa.</hi> 37. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>What doth the Scriptures teach us concerning the goodnesse of the
creatures?</p>
                  <p>That God made all them in such excellency of perfection for their
beeing, working, order and use, that himself did fully approve of
them, and so establish them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. which established order is that
which is called Nature.</p>
                  <p>In how many things doth the goodnesse of the creatures consist?</p>
                  <p>In three: First, in perfection of their nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in their properties and qualities, whereby they are able
to doe those things for which they were created.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in their uses unto man.</p>
                  <p>How manifold is that good which men receive by them?</p>
                  <p>Threefold: First, profitable good. Secondly, pleasant good.
Thirdly, honest and Christian good.</p>
                  <p>How were all things made good when we see there be divers kinds of
Serpents, and noysome and hurtfull beasts?</p>
                  <p>That they are hurtfull, it commeth not by the nature of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in regard whereof they at the first should only have served for the
good of man.</p>
                  <p>What doe you note in the time of their Creation?</p>
                  <p>The beginning and the continuance thereof.</p>
                  <p>Might not the world have been before all time even from eternity?</p>
                  <p>No, for absolute eternity belongeth only to God, neither could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that is subject to time be after an infinite succession of other
things.</p>
                  <p>What say you then to <hi>Aristotle</hi> accounted of so many the Prince of
Philosophers, who laboureth to prove that the world is eternall?</p>
                  <p>Wherein he laboureth to finde out a point of wisdome which he
had learned of none other that was before him, he therein bewrayeth
his greatest folly; for his chiefest reason being grounded upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of the first mover, is of no force to prove his most absurd posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seeing God as he is Almighty, and always able to doe what he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55421:54"/>
will, so is he most free, and not bound to doe all that he can, but what,
when, and how it pleaseth him. But seeing <hi>Aristotle</hi> was enforced by
reason to acknowledge God to be the first mover, even against his will,
(for it seemed that he endevoured as much as he could to quench the
light of divine knowledge shining in his face, or obstinately to close
his eyes against the same) and yet not onely spoiled God of the
glory of his Creation, but also assigneth him to no higher office then
is the moving of the sphears, whereunto he bindeth him more like to a
servant then a Lord, the Judgement of God uttered by S. <hi>Paul, Rom.
1.</hi> 21. is most notoriously shewed upon him, in that he knowing God,
did not glorifie him, nor give him thanks, but became vain in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
and his foolish heart was darkned; while he professed wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
he was made a fool, approving Idolatry, and that wickednesse
which the Apostle there sheweth to be a just punishment of Idolatry,
and nature it self abhorreth; <hi>Arist. Polit. lib. 7. cap. 6. &amp; lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>How long is it since God did create the world?</p>
                  <p>Four thousand years before the birth of our Saviour Christ, and so
about 5614 years before this time.</p>
                  <p>Why is the order of the years of the world so carefully set down in the

                  <p>How long was God creating the world?</p>
                  <p>Six days and six nights.</p>
                  <p>Why was he creating so long, seeing he could have perfected all the
creatures at once and in a moment?</p>
                  <p>First, to shew the variety, distinction and excellency of his severall
creatures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to teach us the better to understand their workmanship,
even as a man which will teach a child in the frame of a letter, will first
teach him one line of the letter, and not the whole letter together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to admonish us, that we are bound to bestow more time in
discerning and knowing them then we doe.</p>

days.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that we might observe, that many of the creatures were
made before those which are ordinarily their causes, and thereby
learn, that the Lord is not bound to any creature, or to any means:
thus the sunne was not created before the fourth day, and yet
dayes which now are caused by the rising of the sunne were
before that; so trees and plants were created the third day, but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55421:54"/>
the Sun, Moon, and Stars, by which they are now nourished and made
to grow, were not created till after the third day.</p>

                  <p>The second is the sky, wherein the Sun, the Moon, and the Starres

                  <p>The third, wherein the Angles, and the soules of the Saints from

also minerals and other things inclosed in the bowels of the earth.</p>
                  <p>2. Some respect also might be had of the weaknesse and infancie of
the Church at that time; God did first teach them more plain and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

                  <p>In what order did God create them?</p>
                  <p>First, the dwelling places were first framed, then the creatures to
dwell in them, and provision was made for the inhabitants of the
earth before they were made, as grasse for the beasts, and light for
all living and moving creatures, and all for man. Secondly, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the things that are more imperfect, to those that are
perfecter, untill he come to the perfectest; as from the trees, corne,
herbes, &amp;c. which have but one life, that is, whereby they increase
and are vegetative, unto the beasts which have both an increasing
and feeling, or sensitive life; as fishes, fowles, beasts, &amp;c. and from
them to man which hath besides them a reasonable soule.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from the first?</p>
                  <p>Not to be carking for the world and things of this life, nor to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
with the cares thereof, seeing God provided for the necessity
and comfort of the very beasts, ere he would bring them into the
world.</p>
                  <p>What from the second?</p>
                  <p>That we should therein follow the example of the Lord, to goe from
good to better, untill we come to be perfect.</p>

Heaven and earth (for so the matter whereof all the bodily creatures

draught thereof.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth that the rudenesse was in the earth onely, containing the

                  <p>Why was man last made of all the creatures?</p>
                  <p>1. Because he was the most excellent of all the works of God in this
inferiour world. 2. Because he was the end of all unreasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and therefore that he might glorifie God for all the creatures
that he saw the world was furnished with for his sake. 3. Because God
would have him first provided for, ere he brought him into the world;
that so he might have this world, for which God had made him
Prince, as it were, his Palace, furnished with all things convenient:
and if he had care of him before he was, how much more now he is?</p>
                  <p>What note you thereof?</p>
                  <p>That man hath not to boast of his antiquity, all the creatures being
made before him even to the vilest worm.</p>
                  <p>What is to be observed in his creation?</p>
                  <p>That here for the excellency of the work, God is brought in, as it
were, deliberating with himselfe, the Father with the Sonne and the
Holy Ghost, and they with him; the whole Trinity entring into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
counsell to make man after their Image, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26.) which is
not said of any other creature; for whereas the other creatures were
made suddenly, man was (as we shall see) not so, but with some space
of time: hitherto also belongeth, that the Holy Ghost standeth longer
upon his creation then upon the rest.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That we should mark so much the more the wisdome and power of
God in the creation of him, thereby to imitate God in using most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

                  <p>Whereof was his body made?</p>
                  <p>Of the very dust of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. in which respect the work
of God in making him is set forth by a similitude of the potter which
of his clay maketh his pots; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21. and the name of <hi>Adam</hi> is from
hence in the Hebrew given unto man, to put him in mind not to bee
proud, nor to desire to be like God; which God foresaw he would
doe, through Satans temptations.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That seeing it pleased God to make mans body more principally
of the basest Element, that thereby he would give man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of what base matter his body was framed, that so hee might
have occasion of being lowly and humble in his owne sight;

according as the Scripture it self directeth us to this instruction, <hi>Gen.
18. 27. Jer.</hi> 2. 2. 29.</p>
                  <p>What else learn you?</p>
                  <p>The absolute authority that God hath over man, as the Potter hath
over his pots and much more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
                  <p>How was the soul made?</p>
                  <p>His soul was made a spirituall substance,<note place="margin">Of the soul of Man.</note> which God breathed into
that frame of the earth to give it a life, whereby man became a living
soul, (<hi>Gen. 2. 7. Mal.</hi> 2. 15.)</p>
                  <p>Why is it called the breath of God?</p>
                  <p>Because God made it immediately, not of any earthly matter (as
he did the body) nor of any of the elements, (as he did the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
but of a spirituall matter, whereby is signified the difference of
the soul of man which was made a spirituall and divine, or everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
substance, from the soul or life of beasts, which commeth of the
same matter whereof their bodies are made, and therefore dieth with
them; whereas the soul of man commeth by Gods creation from
without, (in which respect God is said to be the Father of our spirits,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9.) and doth not rise as the soul of beasts doe, of the temper
of the elements, but is created of God, free from composition, that it
might be immortall and free from the corruption, decay, and death
that all other creatures are subject unto; and therefore as it had life in
it self when it was joyned to the body, so it retaineth life when it is

knowledge, to discern when, where, and how every thing should be

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. The lots are cast in the bosome, yet the issue of them,
and their event hang upon the Lord. <hi>Exod. 21. 13. Deut.</hi> 19. 13.</p>
                  <p>Is there not then any fortune or chance of things in the world?</p>
                  <p>Not in respect of God, by whose appointment the very haires of
our heads are governed and numbred, but in respect of man that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not future things, the Scripture useth such words, to shew the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennesse
and uncertainty of a thing, <hi>Exod. 21. 13. Eccl. 9. 11. Luk.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
                  <p>Doe the creatures ever since the first six dayes continue of themselves
being onely governed of God?</p>
                  <p>No, the creation still is after a manner continued, in that all things
are sustained by the same power whereby they were made: for God is
is not like a builder, that is the cause onely of the making, and not of
the being of his building; but he is such a cause of being to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as the Sunne is of light unto the day, so that without his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
working, all would return to nothing.</p>
                  <p>What proofe have you of this continuall working of God?</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour saith, <hi>John</hi> 5. 17. my Father worketh untill this time,
and I also work; meaning in continuance and preservation of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<hi>For in him we live, move, and have our being: Acts 17. 25, 26, 27,
28.</hi> And the Apostle testifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. That our Saviour Christ by
whom the world were made, beareth up all things, and upholdeth
them in their being with the word of his power, his mighty word.
Thus <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth how the Lord established the continuance and
preservation of all the creatures in the world both living and void of
life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. So doth the Prophet also in the 104. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 91.</p>
                  <p>How doth God sustain all creatures?</p>
                  <p>Partly, by the continuation of particulars, either for the whole time
of this world, as heaven and heavenly bodies, earth and other Elements,
&amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. or for the time of life allotted, as all living creatures,
<hi>Psal. 36. 6. Psal.</hi> 104. 27, &amp;c. Partly, by propagation of kind, whereby
creatures even of shortest continuance, doe successively abide unto the
end of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 3. 8. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Thus God sustaineth and preserveth all that he hath made: how doth
he govern and dispose of them?</p>
                  <p>God ordereth all his creatures according to his pleasure, guiding
and imploying them and their natures to those severall ends and uses
whereby they may best serve unto his glory, <hi>Ps. 119. 91. Dan.</hi> 4. 34, 35.
and the good of themselves and of their fellow creatures, especially of
man; <hi>Ps.</hi> 8. but he hath one generall manner of government belonging
to all; and another speciall, which is proper to the principall creatures.</p>
                  <p>How doth God work in all the creatures generally?</p>
                  <p>First, he doth move and stirre up that power which he hath given
the creatures unto working.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth assist, direct, and help it in working of that
which is good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he doth work together, and give being unto that which
is wrought.</p>

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55421:61"/>
What are the principall creatures you speak of?</p>
                  <p>The reasonable creatures, Angels, and Men, which were created
like unto God in a high estate of holinesse and happinesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 4, 5.
&amp; 103. 20. &amp; 104. 4. <hi>Luke 2. 13. Mat.</hi> 25. 31.</p>
                  <p>How commeth it to passe that there is a particular kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the reasonable creatures above others?</p>
                  <p>Because that they are creatures of another nature then the rest, being
not only acted and moved in one course as the other are, but having a
power of understanding what doth concern them, and of moving
themselves accordingly.</p>
                  <p>What government doth follow hereupon?</p>
                  <p>That which is by teaching, and answerable fulfilling of that which
is taught.</p>
                  <p>How by teaching?</p>
                  <p>By instructing, commanding, praising, forbidding, promising,
threatning, and permitting.</p>
                  <p>How by fulfilling?</p>
                  <p>Especially, by blessing and cursing.</p>
                  <p>What is the manner of Gods working in his providence?</p>
                  <p>It is sometimes ordinary, other times extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>What is the ordinary course of Gods providence?</p>
                  <p>When he bringeth things to passe by ordinary meanes, and that
course which he hath setled in nature. <hi>Esa.</hi> 55. 10.</p>
                  <p>What is the extraordinary?</p>
                  <p>When he bringeth things to passe either without meanes, or by
means of themselves too weak, or beside the course of such means, and
course of nature; which works are usually called Miracles.</p>
                  <p>May we indifferently expect Gods extraordinary working, as we may
his ordinary?</p>
                  <p>No, where ordinary means be had, we cannot look for an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
work.</p>
                  <p>What doe they that run unto the immediate and extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, without necessary occasions?</p>
                  <p>They doe tempt God.</p>
                  <p>How many wayes is God tempted?</p>
                  <p>First, by distrust: Secondly, by presumption.</p>
                  <p>When is God tempted by Distrust?</p>
                  <p>When men think that God either cannot, or will not fulfill his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
                  <p>When is God tempted with Presumption?</p>
                  <p>When men depend upon the immediate providence of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any warrant of the word so to doe.</p>
                  <p>How many sorts of men doe thus tempt God?</p>
                  <p>First, they that doe wastfully mis-spend their goods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they that having received gifts of mind and strength of
body, doe not use them in some lawfull calling for the maintenance of
them, but doe live idlely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they that make an occupation of dicing and carding, and
such like.</p>

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55421:62"/>
Fourthly, they that thrust themselves upon unnecessary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they which take pains for the maintenance of their bodies
in this life, but have no care of those things which belong to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their soules in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>What are the means by which God doth use to exercise his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
                  <p>Two, the first passive, the second active.</p>
                  <p>What call you passive means?</p>
                  <p>Those which although the Lord doth use them, yet have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
nor understanding to move or direct themselves, but are wholly
moved and directed by God.</p>
                  <p>What call you active meanes?</p>
                  <p>Those which although God useth, yet have reason, knowledge,
and understanding in themselves how to move or direct themselves,
such are men and Angels, whether they be good or evill.</p>
                  <p>Doth God work after the same manner by the wicked, that he doth by
the godly?</p>
                  <p>No, for God worketh by the wicked, but not in them; as for the
godly, he worketh not only by them, but also in them: wherby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to passe, that the work of the godly is acceptable unto God, but the
work of the wicked is not acceptable unto God, although they doe the
same thing, which the godly doth.</p>
                  <p>How can it be shewed out of the Scriptures, that God hath a hand

consider how the most vile and horrible act that ever was done, upon
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55421:62"/>
the face of the earth, the Lord God is said to have wrought most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily:
for as <hi>Judas,</hi> the Jewes and <hi>Pilate</hi> are all said to have given Christ
to death; so the Father and Christ are said to have done the same, and
that in the same words, though the manner and purpose are diverse,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. &amp; 4. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>Doth not God then suffer such things to be done?</p>
                  <p>He suffereth indeed, yet this is not an idle permission, as some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
but joyned with a very and active doing or work of God, as in the
crucifying of Christ, it is said that they did nothing but that which the
hand of God had determined before; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. &amp; 3. 18. &amp; 4. 28. for
God is not only a bare permitter of the evil works, but a powerfull go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of them to his glory, and an effecter also of it so far as it hath
any good in it.</p>
                  <p>But doth not this draw God to some stain of sin from which he is most
free, as being that which he punisheth?</p>
                  <p>In no wise, for that which is evill, hath some respect of goodnesse
with God. First, as it is a meer action, God being the Authour of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
action; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. but the Devill and our concupiscence, of the
evill in it: as he that rideth upon a lame horse causeth him to stirre,
but is not the cause of his halting.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it is the punishment of sin, for punishment is counted
a morall good, in that it is the part of a just Judge to punish sinne; and
thus God willeth the sin of the wicked, for their punishment, without
sin in himselfe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26. &amp; 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as it is a chastisement, a triall of our faith, as martyrdome;
or propitiation for sin, as the death and passion of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. &amp;
4. 27, 28. where although the giving of Christ to the death of the
Crosse be attributed in the same words to God and Christ, to <hi>Judas,
Pilate,</hi> and the Jewes; yet diversly, and in severall respects, they are
declared to meet in one and the same action, whereby there appeareth
no lesse difference between God and Christs purpose, and theirs, then
between light and darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Declare how God can have a hand in these things, and yet be free
from sin.</p>
                  <p>He is a cunning workman which with an ill toole will work cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
and as a most excellent Apothecary maketh a medicine of the
mixture of poyson in it, which is not yet poysenous, but rather medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall;
so the Lord in guiding and managing the poyson of sin, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
treacle from the sins of men, as it were the poyson, in such sort as
they turn to his glory, and good of his Church; and cannot be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with sin no more then the Apothecary with poysoning, in so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the poyson, as it doth the contrary, by his skill, unto that which
by nature it would doe: and as in painting, the black colour giveth
grace to other beautifull colours in making them shew better; so it is
in this work of God, in which the sin and untruth of men (as by a black
and dark colour) causeth the truth and righteousnesse of God (as the
white) to be more commended and to appeare better.</p>
                  <p>But how are these actions of the wicked discerned from the work of
God in them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55421:63"/>
First, by the cause from whence the action commeth: for <hi>Josephs</hi>
brethren of envie sent him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but God in mercy. <hi>Shimei</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>David</hi> of malice, but God of justice against <hi>Davids</hi> murther and
adulterie. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> out of the unadvisednesse of his heart refused the
request of his people; but God by his wise Counsell did so dispose of
it. The Devill from hate to <hi>Ahab</hi> was a laying spirit in the mouth of all
his Prophets, but God in justice against his idolatrie. <hi>Pilate</hi> of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and feare, the Jewes of malitious envie, and ignorance, <hi>Judas</hi> of
covetousnesse, but God of love gave Christ; and Christ himselfe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to his Father; and therefore that action as it was from God
and Christ was most just and righteous, as from the other, most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and abominable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the end whither they tend: for <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren sent
him to the end he should not come to the honour foretold out of his
dreame, but God sent him to provide for his Church, and to fulfill
that that was foretold. <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed to drive <hi>David</hi> to despaire,
but God directed him for exercise of <hi>Davids</hi> patience. The Devill
lied in the false Prophets to ruine <hi>Ahab,</hi> but God justly to punish him
for his idolatry. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to satisfie the desire of his young beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Counsellours, but God to perform the word that he had spoken
by his Prophets. <hi>Pilate</hi> to please the people, and to keep his credit with
<hi>Caesar, Judas</hi> for obtaining of the mony he desired, and the Jewes that
our Saviour Christ should not reigne over them: but God and Christ
to save his people.</p>
                  <p>But were it not better to say that these things were done by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
rather then by his providence and government, thereby to
avoid an absurdity in Divinity, that God is the Authour of evill?</p>
                  <p>It is most truly said, that God is not the Authour of sin, whereof
he is the revenger; and also that it is done by Gods permission: but
it is not an idle permission separated from the providence and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and therefore a distinction of Gods permission separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his government of sin is not good; especially considering that
the distinction of such a permission doth not defend the justice of God,
for the which it is devised.</p>
                  <p>How may that appeare?</p>
                  <p>It he permit sin, he doth it against or with his will; if he doe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will, then is he not Almighty; as one that cannot let that he
would not have done; if with his will, how can his justice be defended,
if they were not some good things for which hee doth willingly
permit it? For if a Captain should willingly suffer his souldiers to be
murthered when he might hinder the slaughter of them, although he
put no hand to the murther, he is not therefore excusable, and free
from the blood of his souldiers.</p>
                  <p>What else can be alledged against the permission that is separated
from the government of the providence?</p>
                  <p>For that by this means God should bee spoyled of the greatest
part of the government of the world, seeing the greatest part and
most of the world are wicked, all whose actions are (as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are) wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:55421:63"/>
Is there yet any other matter against this distinction?</p>
                  <p>If in that God doth permit sin he should have no hand in gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and governing it, then he should have no hand in guiding and
governing of good things; for as it is said that he permitteth sin,
so it is also said that he permitteth the good,<note place="margin">The uses of the doctrine of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>What use is to be made of the doctrine of Gods Providence?</p>
                  <p>First, as in the Creation, so in the continuation, preservation and
government of all things, the power, wisdome, and goodnesse of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
only true God is set forth; and therefore in all things is he to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. yea even in the sins of men for the good things he
draweth forth from their evill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the consideration of this, that nothing can come to passe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
without the Providence of God, should move us to fear God, and
make us afraid to commit any sin; far otherwise then the wicked,
who upon that, that it is taught that all things come to passe by the
Providence of God according to that he hath decreed, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 11. 14.
would conclude that then a man may give himself liberty to doe any
thing, considering that it must needs be executed, that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must banish all slavish fear out of our hearts, knowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that nothing can come to passe without the Providence of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this should breed thankfulnesse to God in prosperity, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
in all things that come unto us according to our desire; whatsoever
blessing we receive, we must acknowledge it to come from God, and
give him the praise and glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. not sacrifice to our own

                  <p>Fiftly, this should cause humility under the hand of God when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
things come otherwise then we desired.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, in adversity we should patiently suffer whatsoever afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
the Lord layeth upon us: for this consideration hath wrought pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience

him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, we must mark and observe the providence of God in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
former times, that thereby vve may gather arguments of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
unto us in the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Having thus spoken generally of the Providence of God; we are now to
descend unto the speciall consideration of that which doth concern
the principall creatures, upon whom God hath declared the glory
of his mercy and justice:<note place="margin">Of Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence over Angels.</note> and first to begin with Angels: Shew
how they are upheld in their beeing.</p>
                  <p>They are all sustained by the power of God, so that they shall never
die, or return to nothing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 36.</p>
                  <p>How doth God dispose of them?</p>
                  <p>First, concerning their everlasting condition, they had a law given
them in their Creation, which the elect observe, and are established in
their perfection: but the reprobates sinning against it have lost their
first estate, and are reserved unto further Judgement: for all being by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55421:64"/>
God created good at the first, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. some continued in humility
and obedience according to that dignity in which they were created:
others continued not in the truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. and so kept not their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or excellency in which they were created of God, (by whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be made but good) but trangressed and fell from it by
their sin and wickednesse becomming Devils, <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for their employment God useth them all, both good and
evill Angels, as his servants and ministers for the accomplishment of
his will and work, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>How are the good Angels called in the Scripture?<note place="margin">Good Angels.</note>

                  <p>9. Cherubims from the form of young men, wherin they appeared.</p>
                  <p>Have they any proper names?</p>
                  <p>Some for our capacity have names given unto them, as <hi>Gabriel,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many are there of them?</p>
                  <p>They be innumerable, <hi>Mat. 22. 30. Heb. 12. 22. Dan. 7. 10. Psal.
61.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
                  <p>Are there divers degrees of Angels?</p>
                  <p>Yes; for some are Principalities, and Powers, and Dominions, and
Thrones, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. which sheweth not so much a difference in nature
as in diverse employment in office: But what those degrees are, it is
not observed out of Scripture, and therefore to us is unknown.</p>
                  <p>With what properties are these Angels specially endued?</p>
                  <p>They are endued with wisdome, holinesse, willingnesse to put in
execution the will of God; power, swiftnesse, industry, glory, &amp;c. far
above any man.</p>
                  <p>What measure of knowledge have they?</p>
                  <p>Very great in comparison of man, both by Creation and otherwise.</p>
                  <p>How many sorts be there of their knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Three: first, naturall, which God endued them with at ther Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
far above any man, as their nature is more heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, experimental, which they doe mark and observe farre
more carefully then man, in Gods government of the world, and out
of all creatures, <hi>Eph. 3. 10. Luk.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Divine, of which God informeth them according to the
severall matters that he sendeth them about, and hereby they know
things to come, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. the Angel telleth before to <hi>Daniel</hi> the time
of Christs death, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. God telleth the Angel <hi>Josephs</hi>
thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55421:64"/>
Doe not Angels of themselvess know the thoughts of men?</p>
                  <p>No; for that is Gods property only, 1 <hi>Kings 8. 39. 2 Chro.</hi> 6. 30.
But in some messages, as that in the first of <hi>Matthew,</hi> God is pleased to
manifest it unto them.</p>
                  <p>Have they not knowledge then of all things done here upon earth?</p>
                  <p>No; for all things are only known to God alone, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. yet
they know the matters of those men and places where God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them a message, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> his alms, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 4. and the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of women in the Congregation where they are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.</p>
                  <p>Can the good Angels fall at any time?</p>
                  <p>No; God hath confirmed them in their well beeing that they
might never fall by sin from their first blessed estate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18.</p>
                  <p>Whence commeth this?</p>
                  <p>Not from their own nature (which was subject to mutability) but
from Gods mercy: for seeing those Angels are elect of God, 1 <hi>Tim.
5.</hi> 21. it followe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h of necessity that they are kept and upholden only by
his grace and mercy, whereupon his election is grounded.</p>
                  <p>Now for the employment of these Angels, what are you to note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</p>
                  <p>Their apparitions, and the offices which they perform.</p>
                  <p>In how many sorts have Angels appeared?</p>
                  <p>In as divers as it pleased God to send them, but specially in two;
namely, in visions, and true bodies.</p>
                  <p>What mean you by Visions?</p>
                  <p>Their appearing in some extraordinary sort to the mind and inward
senses, either in the night by dreams, as to <hi>Joseph, Matth.</hi> 2. 13. or in
the day by some strange shows, as they did to the Prophets, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>How manifold was their apparition in body?</p>
                  <p>In the true bodies, either of men, or of other creatures.</p>
                  <p>What examples have you of their apparition in the bodies of
men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 2. two Angels (beside Christ) appeared to <hi>Abraham;</hi> so
did two likewise to the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10. and <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Virgin
<hi>Mary, Luk.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
                  <p>Were these bodies of living men, who had souls: or bodies created up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion?</p>
                  <p>They were bodies extraordinarily created upon that occasion by
God having no souls, but the Angels to give them motions; and after
were dissolved by God to nothing, having neither birth nor buriall.</p>
                  <p>Did they move from place to place in these bodies?</p>
                  <p>Yes; and did many other actions proper to man: the Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to <hi>Abraham</hi> did truly eat and drink, though without need; the
Angels did truly speak and touch <hi>Lot,</hi> pulling him: but these actions
were done by them in an extraordinary speedinesse and manner, more
then any man can doe.</p>
                  <p>Have Angels ever appeared in the bodies of other creatures?</p>
                  <p>Yes; for therefore are they called Cherubims of creatures that have
wings, Satan spoke in the body of a serpent to <hi>Evah,</hi> and so to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
in sundry other creatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55421:65"/>
With what feeling did the godly finde the apparition of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</p>
                  <p>Many times with great fear and terror (as may be seen in <hi>Daniel 7.
7,</hi> 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.) which was caused by the small glimpse of glory that
God vouchsafed to them, which man for his sin could not bear.</p>
                  <p>What learn we by that?</p>
                  <p>To know our misery and corruption, and that in comparison of
Gods appearing, we should be ready to turn to dust.</p>
                  <p>How many are the Offices the good Angels perform?</p>
                  <p>Twofold: First, in respect of God. Secondly, in respect of the
creatures.</p>
                  <p>How many are their duties concerning God?</p>
                  <p>Three: 1. They doe continually praise and glorifie God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>2. They do always wait upon the Lord their God in heaven, to
expect what he would have them doe.</p>
                  <p>3. They knowing his will doe put it in execution.</p>
                  <p>How manifold are their duties concerning the creatures?</p>
                  <p>Twofold: either generall, in respect of all the creatures; or speciall,
in respect of man.</p>
                  <p>What is the generall dutie?</p>
                  <p>That they are the Instruments and Ministers of God for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
and government of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>What are the Offices which they perform towards Man?</p>
                  <p>They are either in this life, or in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>How manifold are the Offices which they perform towards man in
this life?</p>
                  <p>Twofold: either such as respect the godly, the procuring of
whose good is their speciall calling, <hi>Heb. 1. 14. Mat. 4. 11. Ps.</hi> 104. 4.
or such as respect the wicked.</p>
                  <p>How many good Angels hath every one attending upon him in this
life? hath he one alone, or hath he many?</p>
                  <p>That is as the glory of God and the necessity of the Saints requireth;
sometimes there doe many attend upon one, sometimes one upon
many.</p>
                  <p>What are the good offices which the Angels perform towards the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this life?</p>
                  <p>They are used as Instruments, 1. To bestow good things upon
them. 2. To keep them from evill.</p>
                  <p>How manifold are those good things which by the ministery of the
Angels are bestowed upon the godly?</p>
                  <p>They partly concern the body, partly the soul.</p>
                  <p>What are the good things that concern the body?</p>
                  <p>1. They are used as Instruments to bestow things needfull for the
preservation of it, and to bring necessary helps to men in their distress,
as to <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Hagar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. They are appointed of God to be as a guard and garrison unto
his children to comfort and defend them walking in their lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<hi>Psal. 34. 7. &amp;</hi> 91. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55421:65"/>
3. They give an happy successe to them in the good things they go
about, <hi>Gen. 24. 7. 40. ver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. They are appointed as watchmen over the Saints, that by their
presence they might keep their bodies in shamefastnesse, holinesse and
purity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.</p>
                  <p>What are the good things of the soul which the Lord doth bestow upon
the Saints by the ministery of the good Angels?</p>
                  <p>1. To reveal the will of God to them, and to inform them in things
which he would have done, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
                  <p>2. To stir up good motions in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. To comfort them in sorrow, as Christ was comforted being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
in soul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 43, 44. and <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>4. To rejoyce at the conversion of the Saints, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
                  <p>How manifold are the evill things from which the good Angels doe
keep the godly?</p>
                  <p>They likewise doe partly concern the body, partly the soul.</p>
                  <p>What are the evils of the body?</p>
                  <p>They are either without, or within us.</p>
                  <p>From what evils without us are we preserved by the ministery of
the Angels?</p>
                  <p>1. From those dangers that one man bringeth upon another.</p>
                  <p>2. From those that they are subject unto by reason of wilde beasts.</p>
                  <p>3. From those evils whereunto we are subject by reason of other
creatures without life.</p>
                  <p>4. They doe not only preserve the bodies of the Saints, but also all
things that are theirs as their goods, wife, children and families.</p>
                  <p>What are the evils within us from which the Angels doe keep us?</p>
                  <p>First, sicknesse. Secondly, famine. Thirdly, death.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the evils of the soule from which the Angels doe keep
us?</p>
                  <p>From sin, and that two ways, 1. By their continual presence. 2. By
their power.</p>
                  <p>What are the actions which the good Angels perform towards wicked
men in this life?</p>
                  <p>1. They restrain and hinder them from many wicked things which
they would bring to passe.</p>
                  <p>2. They execute judgements upon the wicked, and punish them
for their sins committed, 2 <hi>Kings 19. 35. Gen.</hi> 19. 11.</p>
                  <p>What are the offices which the good Angels are to perform towards
man after this life?</p>
                  <p>First, they carry the souls of the godly, being separated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with comfort into heaven, (as <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16. 22.) and thrust the
wicked into hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they wait upon Christ at the day of Judgement, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the faithfull unto him, and to separate the wicked from
among them, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. &amp; 51.) and to rejoyce at the sentence
which he shall give.</p>
                  <p>Are we not to worship the blessed Angels for the good offices which
they perform towards man, and to unto them?</p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55421:66"/>
Not in any case; for,</p>

                  <p>2. They are but Gods messengers and our fellow brethren.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>God is only to be worshipped,</hi> Jud. 13. 16. Mat. 4. 10. Col. 2. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the good Angels;<note place="margin">Of the evill Angels.</note> what are you to know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the evil ones?</p>
                  <p>First, their sin or fall. Secondly, the evill offices they perform.</p>
                  <p>How many things are we to consider in their fall?</p>
                  <p>Two: 1. The manner. 2. The backsliding it self.</p>
                  <p>What must be considered in the manner?</p>
                  <p>Four things.</p>
                  <p>1. They were created, though good, yet mutable, so as they might
fall.</p>
                  <p>2. Being created mutable, they were tryed whether they would
fall or not.</p>
                  <p>3. Being tryed, they were forsaken of God, and left to themselves.</p>
                  <p>4. Being left to themselves, they committed all sin even with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse.</p>
                  <p>How many things must be considered in the fall it self?</p>
                  <p>Three: 1. From whence they fel. 2. Whereunto they fell. 3. The
punishment God laid upon them for their fall.</p>
                  <p>From whence fell they?</p>
                  <p>First, from their innocency and estate which God had set them in,
<hi>Job 4. 18. Joh. 8. 44. 2 Pet. 2. 4. Jude</hi> ver. 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from God, and thereby from fulnesse of joy and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto fell they?</p>
                  <p>God suffered them voluntarily and maliciously without any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
temptation to fall into that unpardonable sin of Apostasie, and
into the most grievous sins that could be committed.</p>
                  <p>What was the principall sin that the Angels committed?</p>
                  <p>Howsoever some think it was pride, abusing the place of <hi>Isaiah, 14.
13,</hi> 14. which is meant of the King of Babylon; others envy towards
man, as in the book of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> 2. 24. others lying, out of <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.
yet it comprehended all these and more too, being an utter falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God, and that holy standing God placed them in, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to minister for mans good.</p>
                  <p>How commeth it to passe that the fall of Angels is without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
since Man is recovered after his fall?</p>
                  <p>The Devill committed the sin against the holy Ghost, <hi>Matth. 12. 31.
1 John</hi> 5. 16. sinning wilfully and maliciously, which is proved by
his continuall dealing against God, and therefore he shall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.</p>
                  <p>Were there many Angels that did thus fall?</p>
                  <p>Yes, as appeareth by <hi>Rev. 12. 7. &amp; Mat.</hi> 8. 30, 31. where a legion

                  <p>What punishments were laid upon the Angels for their fall?</p>
                  <p>First, the fearful corruption of their nature from their first integrity,
and losse of Gods image, so that they can never repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55421:66"/>
Secondly, the casting of them out from the glory of heaven, and the
want of the comfortable presence of God for evermore, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a griefe and vexation at the prosperity of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a limitation of their power that they cannot doe what
hurt they would.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, horrour and feare of the judgement of the great day; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they are reserved in everlasting chaines under darknesse, 2 <hi>Pet. 2.
4. Jude, vers.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, a more heavy torment after the day of judgement in hell
fire, where they are to feel the infinite wrath of God world without
end. <hi>Mat. 8. 29. Luke 8. 31. Mat. 25. 41. Apoc.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
                  <p>Can the Devill work miracles, and tell things to come?</p>

                  <p>What power have they to hurt man?</p>
                  <p>They have no more power then is under nature, (for above nature
they cannot work) and yet they can doe nothing by that power,
but what God appointeth; not so much as the entring into <hi>hogges.
Matth.</hi> 8. 31.</p>
                  <p>How are they affected towards man?</p>
                  <p>Very maliciously, as their severall names given them doe declare.</p>
                  <p>What be those names?</p>
                  <p>First, Satan, because they mortally hate men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Devill, because they slanderously accuse them to God
and man, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11. &amp; 2. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the old Serpent, for their subtile temptation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the great Dragon, for their destroying of many, <hi>Rev. 12. 8, 9</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many of them doe attend upon every man?</p>
                  <p>Sometimes many upon one, and one upon many.</p>
                  <p>What be the evill offices they perform against man?</p>
                  <p>Some are common to the godly with the wicked, others are proper
to the wicked alone.</p>
                  <p>Have they a like power over the godly and the wicked?</p>
                  <p>No, for though God permitteth them often to try and exercise
the godly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. compared with 1 <hi>Chron. 1. Eph.</hi> 6. 12. both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and in mind, (as Satan afflicted <hi>Job</hi> both outwardly with grievous
sores, and inwardly with dreams and visions; and sometimes buffeted
<hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7. sometimes hindered him from his journey, 1 <hi>Thess.
2.</hi> 18.) yet he limiteth them, and turneth their malice to the good of
his children, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31.</p>
                  <p>How manifold are the evill offices which they perform in common
against the godly and the wicked?</p>
                  <p>Two-fold; either such as respect the body, and the things belonging
thereunto, or such as respect the soule.</p>
                  <p>How doe they hurt the body or the things belonging to the body?</p>
                  <p>They are permitted by God for mans sinne: First, to hurt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that should serve for our comfort, as the Ayre, Sea, Trees, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.
7.</hi> 2, 3. Secondly, to abuse the bodies both of men and beasts, for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of their wicked purposes. Thirdly, to delude the senses, making
men to beleeve things to be such as they are not, as the Devill did
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55421:67"/>
by <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by the witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> Fourthly,
to inflict sicknesse and evills upon the bodies of men, and to torment
and pain them, as in <hi>Job,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Fiftly, to strike some
dumb. Sixtly, to enter into, and really to possesse the bodies of men,
using them in most fearfull sort, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 16. &amp; 12. 28. Seventhly,
to inflict death upon the bodies both of men and beasts.</p>
                  <p>How doe they hurt the soule?</p>
                  <p>First, by depriving some of the use of their reason by frensie and
madnesse. Secondly, by troubling and tormenting some with griefe
and vexation of soule. Thirdly, by abusing some with passions and
melancholy fits, as <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 16. 14. Fourthly, by seducing others,
1 <hi>King. 22. 21, 22. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Fiftly, by manifold and fearfull tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to sin and wickednesse. Sixthly, by prevailing in such tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Seventhly, by accusing before God those with whom they
have so prevailed. Eightly, by hindring men from doing good things.</p>
                  <p>What are the offices of the evill Angels that respect the wicked alone?</p>
                  <p>First, to rule and reign in them without controlment, and to finish
his work in them. Secondly, to murther and destroy them in this
world, and in the world to come to torment soule and body in hell for
ever.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make of this doctrine,<note place="margin">Uses of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> concerning the evill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</p>
                  <p>First, to tremble at the Lords severity towards them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. and
to be thankfull for his bounty and mercies towards our selves, <hi>Psal. 8.
1. 4, 5. Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to remember that if God spared not those spirituall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
sinning against him, neither will he spare us rebelling against
his Majesty, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to feare to offend God, that hath such messengers to send
at his command.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to learn to arm our selves with the shield of faith and fear
of God, since we have such great enemies to fight against, <hi>Eph. 6. 11.
1 Pet.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, to be comforted, that though the Devill be powerfull and
most malicious against us, yet Christ hath broken his head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.
and at last will tread Satan under our feet, <hi>Rom. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Shew now how God doth deale with man.</p>
                  <p>As with that creature in whom above all other, he intendeth to set
forth the glory of his Wisdome, Power, Justice, and Mercy; <hi>Prov. 8.
31. Psal. 8. 3. &amp;c. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 10. and therefore the Scriptures doe
most plentifully declare the dealing of God with man, both in the
time of this world, and for ever hereafter.</p>
                  <p>How is man upheld in his being?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, as all other bodily creatures: partly by maintenance of every
mans life here on earth, for the time alotted by God himselfe. <hi>Acts 17.
28. Ps. 36. 6. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 10. Partly, by propagation of kind unto the end
of the world, through the blessing of procreation. <hi>Gen. 1. 28. Eccl.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:55421:67"/>
Secondly, as Angels after a sort; God so providing, that though
the body of man returneth to the earth from whence it was taken, yet
the soule perisheth not, but returneth to God that gave it; <hi>Eccl. 12.
7.</hi> yea, that the same body also and every part thereof is preserved in
the grave, and shall be joyned intire to the soule at the last day, so to
continue for ever. <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>How manifold is the state wherein man is to be considered?</p>
                  <p>Threefold: first, the state of innocencie, commonly had and lost of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
all mankind, both elect and reprobate, without difference, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the state of corruption and miserie seising on all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
but abiding without recoverie only in the Reprobate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the state of Redemption proper to the elect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 8. All which doe make way unto that finall and everlasting
estate of honour or dishonour fore-appointed unto all men, beginning
at the end of this life, perfected at the day of judgement, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ever in the world to come. And thus touching this part of
Gods providence the Scriptures doe teach us, both the benefits of God
bestowed upon man before his fall; and likewise his justice and mercy
towards him after his fall: his justice upon the Reprobate, who
are left without hope of restitution, and reserved together with the
Devills unto everlasting punishment, <hi>Matth. 25. 41. Rev.</hi> 20. 10. 15.
His mercy upon the elect who notwithstanding their fall, are restored
again by grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>Is it not likely that all the visible world together with man, is fallen
without hope of restitution by mercy?</p>
                  <p>Yes, for it standeth well with the justice of God, that seeing the
visible world was made for the use of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 9. that with the fall
of man it should be punished, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18. and with his raising up
be restored, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>What is that speciall order of government which God useth towards
mankind in this world,<note place="margin">Of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> and in the world to come?</p>
                  <p>In this world he ordereth them according to the tenor of a two-fold
Covenant, in the world to come according to the sentence of a two-fold
judgement.</p>
                  <p>What understand you by a Covenant?<note place="margin">Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and man.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>An agreement which it pleaseth Almighty God to enter into with
man concerning his everlasting condition.</p>
                  <p>What be the parts of this agreement?</p>
                  <p>Two: the one is the Covenant that God maketh with us; the other is
the Covenant that we make with God: the summ of the former is, that
he will be our God, of the latter, that we will be his people. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from the former?</p>
                  <p>The sir-name of God, as it is in divers places of Scripture, and
namely, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 15. where it is said, <hi>The Lord God of your Fathers, the
God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>hath sent me unto you;
this is my name for ever, and this is my memoriall unto all generations:</hi> from
whence we may observe the singular glory and priviledge of Gods
people, in that God is content to take his sir-name of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
                  <p>Why is this sir-name added?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55421:68"/>
For that it is a fearfull thing to think of the proper name of God
alone, unlesse this be added to it, whereby he declareth his love and
kindnesse to us.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from the latter?</p>
                  <p>That man standeth bound by these Covenants of agreement, to
perform that duty which God requireth at his hands.</p>
                  <p>How many such Covenants be there?<note place="margin">1. Covenant of works.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two: First, the Law and Covenant of works; Secondly, the free
promise or Covenant of grace, which from the comming of Christ is
called the Gospell. <hi>Rom. 10. 5, 6. Gal.</hi> 3. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Which of them was first?</p>
                  <p>The Law, for it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of grace was hidden in God.</p>
                  <p>How so, since it is said that the Law was first given to <hi>Moses?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is to be understood of the written Law, as it was written by
<hi>Moses,</hi> and ingraven in tables of stone by the finger of God, otherwise
the same was imprinted in the beginning in the hearts of our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and therefore it is called the Law of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>How was this Law given unto <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning?</p>
                  <p>It was chiefly written in his heart at his creation, and partly also
uttered in his eare in Paradise; for unto him was given a will both
to good and also to evill, and also to be inclined thereto with ability
to perform it. There was something likevvise outwardly revealed, as
his duty to God in the sanctification of the Sabbath, to his neighbour
in the institution of marriage, and to himselfe in his dayly working
about the garden.</p>
                  <p>How doth it appeare that the substance of the Morall Law was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the hearts of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, by the effect of it in them both, who immediately after their
fall were forced by the onely guilt of conscience (not yet otherwise
charged) to hide themselves from Gods presence. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the remainders thereof in all mankind, who even
without the Law, are by light of nature a Law unto themselves. <hi>Gen.
4. 6. Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>How hath the Morall Law been delivered since the fall?</p>
                  <p>The summe thereof was comprised in ten words, <hi>Exod. 34. 28.
Deut.</hi> 4. 13. commonly called the Decalogue or ten Commandements,
solemnly published and engraved in tables of stone by God himself,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 4. Afterwards the same was more fully delivered in the
books of holy Scripture, and so committed to the Church for all ages,
as the Royall Law for direction of obedience to God our King; <hi>Jam.
2.</hi> 8. and for the discovery of sin and punishment due thereto. <hi>Deut.
27. 26. Rom.</hi> 1. 31. &amp; 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>What then doth the Law now require of us?</p>
                  <p>All such duties as were required of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, <hi>Levit.
18.</hi> 5. and all such as are required since by reason of his fall; <hi>Deut. 27.
26.</hi> binding us to eternall death for our least defect therein.</p>
                  <p>Declare now out of that which hath been said what the Covenant of
works is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55421:68"/>
It is a conditionall Covenant between God and man, whereby on
the one side God commandeth the perfection of godlinesse and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and promiseth that he will be our God if we keep all his
Commandements: and on the other side man bindeth himselfe to
perform intire and perfect obedience to Gods Law, by that strength
wherewith God hath endued him by the nature of his first creation.</p>
                  <p>What was done in this Covenant on Gods part?</p>
                  <p>There was his Law backed with promises, and threatnings, and
unto them were added outward seales.</p>
                  <p>What was the summe of this Law?</p>
                  <p>Doe this, and thou shalt live; if thou dost it not, thou shalt dye the
death.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by Doe this?</p>
                  <p>Keep all my Commandements in thought, word, and deed.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by life promised to those that should keep all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?</p>
                  <p>The reward of blessednesse and everlasting life, <hi>Levit. 18. 5. Luke
10.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by death threatned to those that should transgresse?</p>
                  <p>In this world the curse of God and death with manifold miseries
both of body and soule, and (where this curse is not taken away) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
death both of body and soule in the world to come, <hi>Deut.
27.</hi> 26. &amp; 29. 19. 20. &amp; 32. 22. <hi>Levit. 26. Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>What were the outward seales added hereunto?</p>
                  <p>The two trees planted by God for that purpose in the midst of the
garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 9. 3. 3. that <hi>Adam</hi> before and in the sight of them
might resort to some speciall places to serve God in, and might by the
sight of them be put in mind of those things whereof they were signs
and seales.</p>
                  <p>What did the tree of life serve for?</p>
                  <p>It sealed up happinesse, life, and glory unto man, upon condition
of obedience; that by tasting thereof (which no doubt, according to
the manner of Sacramentall signes, was a tree of marvellous comfort
and restoring) he might be assured he should live in Paradise for ever,
if he stood obedient to Gods Commandements, <hi>Gen. 2. 9. Prov. 3. 18.
Revel.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p>Was this tree able to give everlasting life to man, or otherwise, why
did God after the fall shut man from it?</p>
                  <p>It was no more able to give everlasting life, then the bodily eating
of any other Sacrament; but <hi>Adam</hi> having by sin lost that which was
signified hereby, God would have him debarred from the use of the
Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>What did the tree of the knowledge of good and evill serve for?</p>
                  <p>Both for triall of obedience, and also for a warning of their mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and of what would follow upon sin; so sealing death and damnation
in case of disobedience, not as though the tree was able to give any
knowledge, but that by tasting of it contrary to Gods command they
should have experimentall knowledge of evill in themselves, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had of good only, and by wofull experience should learn what
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55421:69"/>
difference there was between knowing and serving God in their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and being ignorant of him by their sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>What was done in this Covenant on mans part?</p>
                  <p>Man did promise by that power which he had received, to keep
the whole law, binding himself over to punishment in case he did not
obey.</p>
                  <p>In what state is man to be considered under this Covenant?<note place="margin">The state of man in the time of his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note>

                  <p>What things are you to note in the innocent estate of man?</p>

                  <p>What doth the Scripture teach concerning it?</p>
                  <p>The place where it was; and the commodities thereof.</p>
                  <p>Where, and in what part of the world was it?</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Asia</hi> neer the meeting of <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tygris,</hi> those two famous
Rivers.</p>
                  <p>What commodities had it?</p>
                  <p>All the principall creatures of God did adorn it, and therefore it is
said to be more extraordinarily then the rest of the world planted by
God: There are set down also the precious stones thereof under the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donyx;
pure metals under the gold; precious woods under the Bdelium,
and so all other living things and growing creatures, that it might be
as it were a shop furnished for man to see in, and learn by it Gods Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Power and Majesty.</p>
                  <p>Doth this place now continue?</p>
                  <p>The place remaineth, but the beauty and commodities be partly by
the Floud, partly by mans sin (for which the whole earth is cursed) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
abolished, though (as may be observed out of good Authors) it is
a very fruitfull place still.</p>
                  <p>What happinesse did man enjoy, thus placed in Paradise?</p>
                  <p>It was partly inward, partly outward.</p>
                  <p>Wherein did the inward appear?</p>
                  <p>First, in his wonderfull knowledge, whereby he made use of all the
creatures of God, as the greatest Philosopher that ever was.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that holy and heavenly image of God, of which <hi>Adam</hi>
had the use and comfort before his fall, it shining in him without
tainture or blemish, and he thereby being without all sin or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the full fruition and assurance of the favourable and
blissefull presence of his Creator, <hi>Matth. 5. 8. Psal.</hi> 17. 15. and his
heavenly company and conference with God, without all fear, as a
subject with his Prince, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in his joyfull serving God, together with absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 25.</p>
                  <p>Wherein did the outward appear?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55421:69"/>
First, in having so comely, perfect and glorious a body, in
which there was no infirmity, pain nor shame, though naked, <hi>Gen.
2.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in his dominion over all the creatures, that submitted
themselves and did service unto him, to whom also as their Lord he
gave their originall names, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the comfortable state and sense, not of Paradise alone,
but of all the world round about him, having neither storm, winter,
nor extremity in any creature.</p>
                  <p>What employment had man in this estate?</p>
                  <p>A twofold employment; the first outward, to till and dresse the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. the other spirituall, to worship and serve God his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
and to procure his own everlasting blessednesse, whereto he was
fitted with freedome of will and ability for perfect obedience unto
God according to the tenor of the Covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make of the knowledge of mans happinesse before
his fall?</p>
                  <p>First, to admire and praise the great goodnesse and favour of God in
so dealing with man, a clod of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to bewail the losse of that happy estate, with blaming our
selves for our sin in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to learn how grievous a thing sinne is in Gods sight, that
procured man this dolefull change.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to labour and gasp to be heirs of the heavenly Paradise
purchased for the elect by Christ; by which we shall eat of the Tree
of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the state of innocency;<note place="margin">Of man in the state of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of his fall.</note> what is the state of corruption
and misery?</p>
                  <p>The fearfull condition whereinto in <hi>Adam</hi> all mankind fell, <hi>Eccles.
7.</hi> 29. by transgressing and violating that Covenant of works which
God made with him at the beginning: For man continued not in his
integrity, but presently transgressed that holy law which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto him, willingly revolting from Gods command through
Satans temptation into many sinnes by eating the forbidden fruit,
<hi>and so by the disobedience of one, sin reigned unto death, and death went
over all,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. 18.</p>
                  <p>What are we then to consider herein?</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Adams</hi> fall; Secondly, the wretched estate he threw all his
posterity into.</p>
                  <p>In what place of Scripture is the History of <hi>Adams</hi> fall hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</p>
                  <p>In the third Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> the six former verses whereof set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out the transgression of our first parents, (which was the original
of all other transgressions) the rest of the Chapter declareth at large
the things that followed immediately upon this transgression.</p>
                  <p>How was the way made unto this fall of man?</p>
                  <p>By Gods permission, Satans temptation, mans carelesnesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
in yeelding thereunto.</p>
                  <p>What action had God in this businesse?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55421:70"/>
He permitted the fall of man, not by instilling into him any
evill, <hi>Jam. 1. 13. 1 John</hi> 2. 16. or taking from him any ability un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
good; But first suffering Satan to assail him (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. with
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, leaving man to the liberty and mutability of his own
will, and not hindring his fall by supply of further grace, 2 <hi>Chro.
32.</hi> 31.</p>
                  <p>Was then God no cause of the fall of our first Parents?</p>
                  <p>None at all; but as hath been said, having created them holy he
left them to themselves to fall if they would, or stand if they would
in respect of their ability; as a staffe put on an end right, doth fall
without the furtherance of the man that setteth it right; yet came
it to passe not only by the permission of God, but also by his secret
Decree, thereby to make way for the manifestation of his Power,
Justice and Mercy: for being able to bring good out of evill, as
light out of darknesse, he ordereth in his great Wisdome the fall of
man to the setting out of the glory, both of his mercy in those that
shall be saved in Christ, and of his Justice in those that shall perish for
their sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32. yet without wrong to any, being not bound
to his creature to uphold him by his grace from falling, <hi>Rom.
11.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p>What hand had Satan in procuring the fall of man?</p>
                  <p>Being himself fallen, upon a proud, envious and murtherous mind,
he deceived our first parents by tempting them to sinne, to the end
he might bring them into the like estate with himself; and as in
this respect he is said to have been a murtherer from the beginning,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. so doth he ever since seek to do what hurt he can to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
moving them still to sin against God, and labouring to bring
them to damnation.</p>
                  <p>What doe you observe herein?</p>
                  <p>His envy of Gods glory and mans happinesse, together with his
hatred and malice against mankind, whom (as a murtherer doth his
enemy) he hateth and laboureth to destroy.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from this attempt of his against our first parents in
the state of Innocency?</p>
                  <p>That Satan is most busie to assail them in whom the image of God
in knowledge and holinesse doth appear; not labouring much about
those which either lie in ignorance, or have no conscience of walking
according to knowledge, as those that are his already.</p>
                  <p>What Instrument did Satan use in tempting man?</p>
                  <p>He used the Serpent as an Instrument to deceive the woman, and
the woman for an Instrument to tempt the man, <hi>Gen. 3. 1. 2 Cor. 11. 3.
1 Tim.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>Why did he use those outward Instruments, and not rather tempt their
fancy and affection inwardly?</p>
                  <p>It seemeth that in their integrity he could not have that advantage
against them in those things whereunto they were made subject by
their fall.</p>
                  <p>Why did he chuse rather to speak by a Serpent then by any other Beast?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:55421:70"/>
Because it was the fittest that God permitted him, and wisest of all
the beasts of the earth, especially possessed by him to deceive man,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. It was of all other beasts the subtillest and fittest to creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garden unseen of <hi>Adam,</hi> (who was to keep the beasts out of it)
and to remain there without being espyed of him, and creep out again
when he had done his feat.</p>
                  <p>If there were craft before the fall, then it seemeth there was
sinne?</p>
                  <p>Craft in beasts is not sin, although the word here used signifyeth a
nimblenesse and slinesse to turn and wind it self any way, in which
respect it seemeth the Devill chose this beast before any other.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That the Devill to work his mischief is exceedingly cunning to
make his choice of his Instruments, according to the kind of evill
he will solicite unto, <hi>Matth. 7. 15. 2 Cor. 11. 13, 14. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>But wee doe not see that hee commeth any more in the body of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents?</p>
                  <p>He may, and in the body of any other beast which the Lord will
permit him to come in: Howbeit our case in this is more dangerous
then that of our first parents; for now he useth commonly for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
men like unto us and familiar with us, which he could not
doe before the fall, <hi>Eph. 6. 12. Rev.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>Why did Satan assail the woman rather then the man?</p>
                  <p>Because she was the weaker vessel, which is his continuall practice,
where the hedge is low there to goe over, (<hi>Luk. 5. 30. Mar. 2. 16. Mat.
9. 11. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 6.) and might afterwards be a fitter means to deceive
and draw on her husband.</p>
                  <p>What are we to consider in his tempting of the woman?</p>
                  <p>First, the time which he chose to set upon her. Secondly, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the temptation.</p>
                  <p>What note you of the time?</p>
                  <p>First, that it was immediately, or not long after the placing of them
in that happy estate: which teacheth how malicious the wicked one is,
who if he could let, would not suffer us to enjoy any comfort either of
this life or of that to come, so much as one poor day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he came unto her when she was some space re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from her husband, that hee that should have helped her
from and against his wiles might not be present to heare their
conference: whence we learn, that the absence of wives from
their husbands, who should be a strength unto them, is dangerous,
especially that we absent not our selves from the means of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
strength, the hearing of the Word, the receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that shee was neere to the Tree of knowledge at the
time he set on her: which sheweth his watchfulnesse in taking
advantage of all opportunities that might further his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>VVhat was the manner of the temptation?</p>
                  <p>First, he subtilly addressed himself to the woman, and entred
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55421:71"/>
into conference with her. Secondly, he made her doubt whether the
Word of God was true or not. Thirdly, he offered her an object.
Fourthly, he used all the means he could to make her forsake God,
and yeeld unto him, pretending greater love and care of mans well
doing, then was in God, and bearing them in hand that they should
be like unto God himselfe if they did eat of the forbidden fruit,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>What was the Devils speech to the woman?</p>
                  <p>Is it even so, that God hath said, Yee shall not eat of all the fruit
in the Garden? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>What doe you note in this?</p>
                  <p>That it is likely there had been some communication before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Serpent and the woman, that Satan had asked why they
did not eat of the forbidden fruit, seeing it was so goodly and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to behold, and that the woman had answered that they were
forbidden, whereupon he inferreth this that <hi>Moses</hi> setteth downe,
wherein we may observe,</p>
                  <p>First, the Devils sophistry, who at first doth not flat contrary
Gods command, but to bring her to doubting and conference
with him asketh this question, whether God hath forbidden to
eat of all the trees in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the wicked spirits malicious and subtile suggestion,
in that passing by the great bountifulnesse of the Lord in the
grant of the free use of all the fruits in the Garden, he seeks to
quarrell with the Lords liberality.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we learn from hence to take heed lest for want of
some one thing which God withholdeth from us, which we gladly
would have, we be not unthankfull to the Lord for his great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and liberality, and enter further into a mislike of him for that
one want, then into the love and liking of him for his innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefits we enjoy, especially it being for our good that he
withholdeth it, and that being not good which we desire.</p>
                  <p>What did follow upon this question of Satan?</p>
                  <p>The woman answering thereunto, not as God had spoken, that
surely they should die if they did eat of the forbidden fruit, but
by a tearm of doubting, <hi>lest ye die;</hi> Satan by this conference and
doubting, taketh advantage and assureth them that they shall not
die, but have their eies open and receive knowledge.</p>
                  <p>What observe you in this reply of the Devill?</p>
                  <p>First, his craft in applying himself to the woman, whom he
seeing to be in doubt of the punishment, contents himself with
it, and abstaineth from a precise deniall, whither he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draw her, because he deemed that the woman would not come so
farre, and that in a flat deniall he should have been bewrayed,
which notwithstanding in the latter end of this sentence he doth
by implication flatly doe: whence we learn, that the Devill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
by degrees, and will not at the first move to the grossest:
as in Idolatry he laboureth to draw man first to be present, after
to kneel only with the knee, keeping his conscience to himselfe;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55421:71"/>
lastly, to the greatest worship: In whoredome, first to look, then to
dally, &amp;c. and therefore wee must resist the evill in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that hee is a calumniator or caviller, whereof he
hath his name <hi>Diabolus</hi> Devill, and an Interpreter of all things
to the worst; and it is no marvell though he deprave the best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of good men, seeing hee dealeth so with God, surmising
that God had forbidden to eat of the fruits, lest they should know
as much as he.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that knowing how desirous the nature of man (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they of best spirits) is of knowledge, he promiseth unto
them a great encrease thereof; whereas wee ought to remember
that which <hi>Moses</hi> saith, that the secrets of the Lord are to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and that the things that he hath revealed are to us and to our
children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of Satans temptation, the cause of the fall without man:
What were the causes arising from our first parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
                  <p>Not any of Gods creation, but their carelesnesse to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
intire to Gods command: for though they were created good,
yet being left by God to the mutability of their own will, they
voluntarily enclined and yeelded unto that evill, whereunto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
were tempted, and so from one degree unto another were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rought
unto plain rebellion, <hi>Gen. 3. 6. Eccl.</hi> 7. 29.</p>
                  <p>What was their first and main sin?</p>
                  <p>In generall it was disobedience, the degrees whereof were first
infidelity, then pride, and lastly, the dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vowing of subjection by
eating the forbidden fruit, which they imagined to be the means
whereby they should attain to an higher degree of blessednesse, but
proved to be the sin that procured their fall, <hi>Gen. 2. 16, 17. &amp; 3.
6,</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Did not <hi>Adam</hi> conferre with Satan, and take the fruit from the
tree?</p>
                  <p>No; he received it from his wife, and by her was deceived, and
she by Satan, <hi>Gen. 3. 4. 17. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>Satan indeed was the outward cause of <hi>Eves</hi> fall, but what are the
causes arising from her self?</p>
                  <p>They are either outward things of the body, or the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the mind moved by them.</p>
                  <p>What are the outward things of the body?</p>
                  <p>They are the abuse of the tongue, of the ears, of the eyes, and of the
tast: for in that she entertained conference with the Devill, the tongue
and ears; in that it is said that the fruit was delectable to look on, the
eyes: and in that it was said it was good to eat, the tast is made to be
an instrument of this sin.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That which the Apostle warneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13. that we beware that
we make not the parts of our bodies weapons of iniquitie: for if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a circumspect use of them they were instruments of evill before
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55421:72"/>
there was any corruption or any inclination at all to sin; how much
more dangerous will they be now after the corruption, unlesse they be
wel looked unto?</p>
                  <p>What doe you observe in <hi>Eves</hi> conference with the Devill?</p>
                  <p>First, her folly to enter into any conference with Satan, for shee
might have been amazed that a beast should speak unto her in a mans
voice, but her carelesnesse and curiosity moved her to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, her boldnesse in daring to venture on such an adversary
without her husbands help or advice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, her wretchednesse in daring once to call in question the
truth of Gods command, or to dispute thereof, or then to doubt of it.</p>
                  <p>What instruction gather you from her entertaining conference
with Satan?</p>
                  <p>That it is dangerous to talk with the Devill, so much as to bid him
to depart, if the Lord to try us, should suffer him to tempt us visibly
as he did <hi>Eve,</hi> unlesse we have a speciall calling of God thereunto.
1. Because he is too subtile for us, we being simple in regard of him.
2. Because he is so desperately malicious, that he will give place to
no good thing we can alledge to make him leave off his malicious
purpose.</p>
                  <p>What shall we then doe?</p>
                  <p>We must turn our selves unto God, and desire him to command
him away, at whose only Commandment he must depart.</p>
                  <p>Is there any thing blame-worthy in <hi>Eves</hi> answer to the question of
the Serpent?</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding that so far she answered truly, that God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
them to eat of the fruit of that tree, and telleth also the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
truly that would follow thereof, yet began she to slip in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
both of the charge and of the punishment: for where she saith
they were forbidden to touch it, it is more then the Lord made
mention of, and she thereby seemeth to insinuate some rigour of the
Lord forbidding even the touch of the fruit; and where the Lord had
most certainly pronounced, that they should die if they eat of the
forbidden fruit, she speaketh doubtfully of it, as if they should not
certainly die.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from this latter Observation?</p>
                  <p>That albeit men are oft perswaded they sin, yet that they are not
perswaded of the Justice of God against it, whereby the door is
opened to sin, which is to make God an Idoll, in spoiling him of his
Justice, as if he were so all mercy, as he had forgotten to be just, when
as he is as well justice as mercy, as infinite in the one as in the other,
which correcteth sharply the sins of such as he will save.</p>
                  <p>What learn you of the abuse of the tongue in this conference?</p>
                  <p>That as the tongue is a singular blessing of God, whereby man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth
all the creatures upon the earth, so the abuse of it is most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
because it <hi>setteth on fire the whole course of nature, and it is set on
fire of hell,</hi> Jam. 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>What observe you of that it is said, that <hi>Eve</hi> saw the fruit was dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
to look on?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:55421:72"/>
Her lustfull and wicked eye in suffering her mind to be allured to
look on the beauty of the fruit with a purpose to affect the eating
of it.</p>
                  <p>How is it said, that she saw it was good to eat, when shee had never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of it?</p>
                  <p>Shee knew by the beautifull colour it was so; for if we are able in
this darknesse (we are fallen into) to discerne commonly by the sight
of the fruit whether it be good, and the skilfull in Physick by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
onely of the hearb, to tell whether it be hot or cold, sweet or
sowre, how much more were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who had the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the knowledge of those things, more then ever <hi>Solomon</hi>
himselfe?</p>
                  <p>What learn you by the abuse of these outward senses?</p>
                  <p>That they are, as it were, windowes whereby sin entred into the
heart, when there was no sin, and therefore will much more now, the
heart being corrupted.</p>
                  <p>What instructions gather you from thence?</p>
                  <p>First, that we must shut them against all evill and unlawfull use of
their objects, and open them to the use of good things, make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with them as <hi>Job</hi> did with his eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. by a strong
and painfull resistance of the evill that commeth by the abuse of them,
as it were, and cut them off, and throw them away, as our Saviour
giveth counsell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that as the senses are more noble, as the hearing and
sight, called the senses of learning, so there should be a stronger watch
set upon them; those being the senses that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
so deceived by.</p>
                  <p>What observe you of that it is said, shee saw that it was desirable for
knowledge?</p>
                  <p>That was only her errour, which shee having begun to sip of by
communication with the Devill, did after drink a full draught of, by
beholding the beauty of the fruit, and receiving the delicate tast there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and withall observe how we can heap reasons true and false to move
us to follow our pleasures.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That the heart inclining to errour, doth draw the senses to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
use of them, and that the abuse of the senses doth strengthen
the heart in errour.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hereof?</p>
                  <p>That before the heart was corrupted, there was no abuse of these
outward senses. But that being corrupt, the abuse thereof doth settle
the heart deeper in errour.</p>
                  <p>What was the effect of all these outward and inward meanes?</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Eve</hi> yeelded to Satan, and put his will in execution in eating
of the fruit that was forbidden. Secondly, shee gave it also to <hi>Adam</hi>
to eat.</p>
                  <p>What force hath the word also here used by the holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>Thereby as by a speciall word of amplification the sin is aggravated
against her, to shew her naughtines; not only in committing the sin her
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55421:73"/>
selfe, but also in alluring the husband to doe as she had done.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>1. The nature of sinners to draw others to the condemnation they
are in, as Satan <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> her Husband, even those that are nearest
them; whose good they should procure.</p>
                  <p>2. That we should take heed of that the Apostle warneth us, <hi>not to
be partakers of other mens sins,</hi> as if we had not enough of our own to
answer for; which especially belongeth unto those in charge, 1 <hi>Tim.
5.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>3. How dangerous an instrument is an evill and deceived wife,
which the Lord commandeth men should beware to make choice of,
and if the man which is strong, much more the woman.</p>
                  <p>What learn you of that <hi>Adam</hi> eat forthwith?</p>
                  <p>First, that which hath been before noted, that the Devill by one of
us tempteth more dangerously then in his own person; so that Satan
knew he could not so easily have deceived <hi>Adam</hi> by himself, as by <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that in excesse of love he yeelded; it teacheth hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
to love their wives, but it must be in the Lord, as the wives
must doe their husbands.</p>
                  <p>How doth it agree with the goodnes, or with the very justice of God,
to punish mankind so fearfully for eating of a little fruit?</p>
                  <p>Very well, for first, the heynousnesse of an offence is not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the thing that is done, but by the worthinesse of the person
against whom it is committed. And how much more the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
our first parents brake was easie to be kept, (as to abstain from
one onely fruit in so great variety and plenty) so much more grievous
was their sin by breaking it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though God tryed their obedience in that fruit especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet were there many other most grievous sinnes, which in desiring
and doing of this they did commit: Insomuch that we may observe
therein, the grounds of the breach in a manner of every one of the ten
Commandements. For the transgression was horrible, and the breach
of the whole Law of God; yea, an Apostasie whereby they withdrew
themselves from under the power of God, nay, rejected and denied
him; and not so little an offence as most men think it to be.</p>
                  <p>What breaches of the first Commandement may be observed in this
transgression?<note place="margin">That the breach of all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams and Eves sin.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, infidelity, whereby they doubted of Gods love towards them,
and of the truth of his word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, contempt of God, in disregarding his threatnings, and
crediting the word of Satan, Gods enemy, and theirs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hainous ingratitude and unthankfulnesse against God for
all his benefits, in that they would not be beholding unto him for that
excellent condition of their creation (in respect whereof they ought
unto him all fealty) but would needs be his equall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, curiosity in affecting greater wisdome then God
had endued them withall by vertue of their creation, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure of knowledge then hee thought fit to reveale unto
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:55421:73"/>
Fiftly, intolerable pride and ambition, not onely desiring to
be better then God made them, but also to be equall in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to God himselfe, and aspiring to the highest estate due to
their Creatour.</p>
                  <p>How did our first parents break the second Commandement?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eve,</hi> by embracing the word of the Devill, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it before the word of God; <hi>Adam,</hi> by hearkning to the
voyce of his wife, rather then to the voyce of the Almighty. <hi>Gen.
3.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>What were the breach of the third?</p>
                  <p>First, presumption in venturing to dispute of Gods truth, and to
enter in communication with Gods enemy, or a beast who appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto them, touching the word of God, with whom no such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
ought to have been entertained.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, reproachfull blasphemy, by subscribing to the sayings of
the Devill, in which he charged God with lying, and envying their
good estate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, superstitious conceit of the fruit of the tree, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it to have that vertue which God never put into it, as if by the
eating thereof, such knowledge might be gotten as Satan perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, want of that zeale in <hi>Adam</hi> for the glory of God which
he ought to have shewed against his wife, when hee understood shee
had transgressed Gods Commandements.</p>
                  <p>How was the fourth Commandement broken?</p>
                  <p>In that the Sabbath was made a time to conferre with Satan in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
tending to the high dishonour of God. If it be true that on that
day man fell into this transgression, as some not improbably have
conjectured; for at the conclusion of the sixth day, all things remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
yet very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. and God blessed the seventh day,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>Now it is very likely Satan would take the first advantage that
possibly he could to entrap them, before they were strengthened by
longer experience, and by partaking of the Sacrament of the tree of
life, (whereof it appeareth by <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22. that they had not yet ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
and so from the very beginning of man, became a manslayer.
<hi>John</hi> 8. 44.</p>
                  <p>Shew briefly the grounds of the breach of the Commandements of the
second table in the transgression of our first parents.</p>
                  <p>The fifth was broken, <hi>Eve</hi> giving too little to her husband in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
a matter of so great weight without his privity, and <hi>Adam</hi>
giving too much to his wife in obeying her voyce rather then the
Commandement of God, and for pleasing of her, not caring to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>The sixth, by this act they threw themselves and all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
into condemnation and death, both of body and soule.</p>
                  <p>The seventh, though nothing direct against this Commandement,
yet herein appeared the root of those evill affections which are here
condemned, as not bridling the lust, and wandring desire of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55421:74"/>
the eyes, as also the inordinate appetite of the tast, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. in lusting
for and eating that onely fruit which God forbad, not being satisfied
with all the other fruits in the garden.</p>
                  <p>The eighth; first, laying hands upon that which was none of their
own, but by a speciall reservation kept from them. Secondly, discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with their present estate, and covetous desire of that which they
had not.</p>
                  <p>The ninth, judging otherwise then the truth was of the vertue of
the tree, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. and receiving a false accusation against God
himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The tenth, by entertaining in their minds Satans suggestions, and
evill concupiscence appearing in the first motions leading to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of our first parents sinne, and the causes thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the effects of the same; shew therefore what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in them immediately upon this transgression.</p>
                  <p>Three fruits were most manifest:<note place="margin">The effects of the fall.</note> namely, guiltinesse of conscience,
shame of face, and feare of Gods presence.</p>
                  <p>Did any punishment follow upon this sinne?</p>
                  <p>Sinne,<note place="margin">Sin, guiltinesse, punishment.</note> guiltinesse, and punishment doe naturally follow one upon
another; otherwise the threatning, that at what time soever they did
transgresse Gods Commandement, they should certainly dye, should
not have taken effect.</p>
                  <p>Declare how that threatning took effect.</p>
                  <p>They were dead in sinne, which is more fearfull then the death
of the body, as that which is a separation from the favour of God:
for there came upon them the decay of Gods glorious image in all the
faculties of their soule, and also a corruption of the powers of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
from being so fit instruments to serve the soule as God made them;
and this in them is signified by nakednes; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. And in their children
called originall sin. Then there issued from thence a streame of actuall
sinnes in the whole course of their life; which appeared in <hi>Adam</hi> even
upon his fall, by his flying from Gods presence, and affirming that it
was his nakednesse that made him flye, his excusing of his sin, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it on the woman, &amp;c. By sin an entrie being made for death, <hi>Rom.
5.</hi> 12. they became subject to the separating of the soul from the body,
which is bodily death; and of both from God, which is spirituall
death, signified by expelling them out of Paradise, and debarring
them of the sacramentall tree of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22. &amp;c. And thus by the
just sentence of God being for their sin delivered into the power both
of corporall and of eternall death; they were already entred upon death
and hell, to which they should have proceeded untill it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
both in body and soule in hell, with the Devill and his
Angels for ever, if the Lord had not looked upon them in the blessed
Seed.</p>
                  <p>For the fuller understanding of the things that immediatly followed the
transgression of our first parents; let us consider more particularly
what is recorded in the <hi>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. ch.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> And first shew what is meant by
that in <hi>v.</hi> 7. that their eyes were opened, &amp; they saw themselves naked.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55421:74"/>
were they not naked before, and having the eye sharper then after
the fall, must they not needs see they were naked?</p>
                  <p>It is true;<note place="margin">Of our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> howbeit their nakednesse before the fall was comely, yea
more comely then the comeliest apparell we can put on; being clad
with the robe of innocency, from the top of the head unto the sole of
the foot: wherefore by nakednesse he meaneth a shamefull naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
both of soule and body, as the Scripture speaketh elsewhere; <hi>Rev.
3. 17, 18. Exod.</hi> 32. 25.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That the loathsomenesse of sin is hidden from our eyes untill it be
committed, and then it flasheth in the faces of our conscience, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in its proper colours.</p>
                  <p>Was that well done that they sewed fig-tree leaves to hide their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse?</p>
                  <p>In some respect: forasmuch as they sought not remedy for the
nakednesse inward, it was not well; but that they were ashamed
to behold their own nakednesse of the body, it was well: for in this
corrupt and sinfull estate, there is left this honesty and shamefastnesse,
that neither we can abide to look on our own nakednesse, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
parts, much lesse upon the shamefull parts of others; although it
be of those that are nearest joyned unto us.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from thence?</p>
                  <p>First, that those that can delight in the beholding either of their
own nakednesse, or the nakednesse of any other, have lost even the
honesty that the sinfull nature of man naturally retaineth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that such as for customes sake have covered their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with clothes, doe notwithstanding with filthy words, as it were,
lay themselves naked, are yet more wretched, and deeplier poysoned
with the poyson of the unclean spirit, and have drunk more deeply of
his cup.</p>
                  <p>Seeing our nakednesse commeth by sin, and is a fruit thereof, it may
seem that little infants have no sinne, because they are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>So indeed doe the Pelagian hereticks reason; but they consider
not that the want of that feeling is for the want of the use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and because they doe not discerne between being naked and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed.</p>
                  <p>What followeth?</p>
                  <p>That at the noyse of the Lord in a wind,<note place="margin">Of their hiding themselves.</note> they fled from the
presence of God, and hid themselves where the trees were most
thick.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from thence?</p>
                  <p>First, that the guilt of an evill conscience striketh horrour into
a man; and therefore it is said, that terrours terrifie him round
about, and cast him down, following him at the heeles, and
leave him not till they have brought him before the terrible King:
<hi>Job</hi> 18. 11. 14. Thereof it is, that the feast of a good conscience
is so extolled, as to be a continuall feast. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the fruit of the sinne comming from the feare, which is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55421:75"/>
to flye from God as from an enemy, whereof it is that the Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
That having peace of conscience, we have accesse and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. Their blindnesse, which esteemed that
the shadow or thicknesse of trees would hide them from the face of
God, whereas if we goe up into heaven he is there; if into the deep, he
is there also, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 7. 13. he being not so hidden in the trees, but
that a man might find him out.</p>
                  <p>What followeth?</p>
                  <p>That God asketh where he is, which knew well where he was.</p>
                  <p>What learne you from hence?</p>
                  <p>First, that we would never leave off running from God, untill we
come to the depth of hell, if God did not seek us, and follow us,
to fetch us as the good shepheard the lost sheep. <hi>Esa. 65. 1. Luk.
15.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the means of calling us home, is by the word of his
mouth.</p>
                  <p>What followeth?</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Adam</hi> being asked, assigneth for causes things that were not
the causes, as namely, the voyce of the Lord, his feare, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
which were not the true causes, considering that he had
heard the voyce of God, and was naked when he fled not; dissembling
that which his heart knew to be the true cause. <hi>viz.</hi> his sin.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That it is the property of a man unregenerate to hide and cloake
sinne, and therefore, that the more we hide and cloak our sinnes, when
we are dealt with for them, the more we approve our selves the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the old man, the cursed <hi>Adam. Job</hi> 31. 33.</p>
                  <p>What followeth?</p>
                  <p>The Lord asketh how it should come that he felt his nakednesse
as a punishment, and whether he had eaten of the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>What note you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That before that our sinnes be knowne in such sort as the deniall
of them is in vaine and without colour, we will not confesse our
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>What learn you out of <hi>Adams</hi> second answer unto God?</p>
                  <p>That the man unregenerate dealt with for his sinnes, goeth from
evill to worse; for the sin that he did before, and now cannot hide, he
excuseth, and for excusing it, accuseth the Lord; as those doe which
when they heare the doctrine of predestination and providence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
would make God partie in their sins.</p>
                  <p>What learn you further?</p>
                  <p>That howsoever <hi>Adam</hi> alledgeth it for an excuse, because he did
it by perswasion of another, yet God holdeth him guilty, yea dealeth
vvith him as vvith the principall, because his gifts vvere greater then
his vvifes.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from the answer of <hi>Eve,</hi> to the Lords question; why
she did so?</p>
                  <p>The same vvhich before, that the unregenerate man doth goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to excuse the sinne he cannot deny; for shee casteth her sinne
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55421:75"/>
upon the Serpent, and said that which was true, but kept back the
confession of her Concupiscence, without which the Serpent could
not have hurt her.</p>
                  <p>How commeth it to passe that the old Serpent the Authour of all is not
called to be examined?</p>
                  <p>Because that the Lord would shew no mercy to him, wherefore he
only pronounceth Judgement against him.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That it is a mercy of God when we have sinned to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
and to be examined either by the Father of the houshold, or by
the Magistrate, or by the Governour of the Church; and a token of
Gods fearfull Judgment when we are suffered to rest in our sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being drawn to question for them.</p>
                  <p>What observe you in the sentence against the Serpent?</p>
                  <p>That the first part contained in the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> is against the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Devil; and that the other part contained in the 15 <hi>ver.</hi> is
against the Devil.</p>
                  <p>What learn you of this proceeding to sentence?</p>
                  <p>That after the cause well known, Judgement should not be slacked.</p>
                  <p>Why doth God use a speech to the Serpent that understandeth it not?</p>
                  <p>It is for mans sake, and not for the beasts sake.</p>
                  <p>Why for mans sake?</p>
                  <p>To shew his love to mankind by his displeasure against any thing
that shall give any help to doe hurt unto him; in which respect he
commandeth that the Oxe that killeth a man should be slain, and that
the flesh thereof should not be eaten; (<hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 28.) like a kind Father
that cannot abide the sight of the knife that hath maimed or killed his
child, but breaketh it in peeces.</p>
                  <p>What manner of curse is this, when there is nothing laid upon
the Serpent, but that he was appointed to at the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he became the Devils Instrument to tempt <hi>Eve?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that he crept upon his belly before, and eat dust before, as
appeareth in the Prophet, <hi>Esay</hi> 65. 25. but his meaning is, that he
shall creep with more pain, and lurk in his hole for fear, and eat the
dust with lesse delight and more necessity.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>Not to suffer our selves to be instruments of evill to any in the
least sort, if we will escape the curse of God; for if God did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
a poor worm, which had no reason or will to chuse or refuse
sin, how much lesse will he spare us which have both?</p>
                  <p>What is the sentence against the Devill?</p>
                  <p>The Ordinance of God, That there shall be always enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Devil and his seed on the one side, and the woman and
her seed on the other, together with the effect of this enmity.</p>
                  <p>VVhat doe you understand by the seed of the Devill, seeing there
is no generation of the Devils, for that there is no male
nor female among them, neither have they bodies to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</p>
                  <p>The seed of the Devill are all both wicked men and Angels, <hi>Joh.</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:55421:76"/>
8. 44. which are corrupt and carry his image, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. In which
respect the wicked are called the children of the Devil, and every
where the sons of <hi>Belial, Act.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That the war of mankind with the Devill is a lawfull war pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
of God, which is also perpetuall and without any truce, and
therefore that herein it is wherein we must shew our choler, our
hate, our valour, our strength, not faintly and in shew only, but
in truth, whereas we being continually assaulted with our enemy,
leave our fight with him to fight against our brethren, yea against
our own soules; he continually and without ceasing fighting with
us, and not against his own, as the blasphemous Pharisees said, <hi>Mat.
12.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the sentence against the Woman?</p>
                  <p>First, in the pain of conception and bearing child.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the pain of bringing forth; wherein is contained the
pain of nursing and bringing them up.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in a desire to her husband.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in her subjection to her husband.</p>
                  <p>Was she not before desirous and subject to her husband?</p>
                  <p>Yes; but her desire was not so great, through conscience of her
infirmity, nor her subjection so painfull, and the yoake thereof so
heavy.</p>
                  <p>What is the sentence against <hi>Adam?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, his sin is put in the sentence, and then his punishment.</p>
                  <p>What is his sin?</p>
                  <p>One, that he obeyed his wife whom he should have commanded;
then, that he disobeyed God, whom he ought to have obeyed; the
first being proper to him, the other common to his wife with him.</p>
                  <p>What was the punishment?</p>
                  <p>A punishment, which although it be more heavy upon <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it
is also common to the woman; namely, the curse of the earth for his
sake, from whence came barrennesse by Thistles and Thorns, &amp;c.
whereof, first, the effect should be sorrow and grief of mind. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
labour to the sweat of his brows, to draw necessary food from it,
and that as long as he lived. Lastly, the expulsion out of Paradise, to
live with the beasts of the earth, and to eat of the hearb which they
did eat of?</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That all men, from him that sitteth on the Throne, to him that
draweth water, are bound to painfull labour, either of the body, or of
the mind, what wealth or patrimony soever is left them, although they
had wherewith otherwise plentifully to live.</p>
                  <p>What observe you else?</p>
                  <p>I observe further out of this Verse and out of the two next, that in
the midst of Gods anger he remembreth mercy:<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 2.</note> for it is a benefit to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
that he may live of the sweat of his brows; to <hi>Eve,</hi> that she should
bring forth, and not be in continuall travell; unto them both, that he
taught them wisdome to make leather Coats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:55421:76"/>
What learn you from that it was said, God made them Coats?</p>
                  <p>That in every profitable invention for the life of man, God is to
be acknowledged the Authour of it, and have the honour of it, and
not the wit of man that invented it, as is the manner of men in such
cases to sacrifice to their nets, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>When there were better means of clothing, why did they weare
Leather?</p>
                  <p>It seemeth that thereby they should draw themselves the rather
to repentance and humiliation by that course clothing.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That howsoever our condition and state of calling afford us better
array; yet we learn even in the best of our clothes to be humbled by
them, as those that are given us to cover our shame, and carry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the mark and badge of our sinnes; especially when these which
were, even after the fall, the goodliest creatures that ever lived, learned
that lesson by them.</p>
                  <p>What followeth?</p>
                  <p>A sharp taunt that the Lord giveth <hi>Adam,</hi> ver. 22. further to
humble him, as if he should say, Now <hi>Adam</hi> dost thou not see
and feel how greatly thou art deceived in thinking to be like God
in eating of the forbidden fruit?</p>
                  <p>What learn you from it?</p>
                  <p>That by the things we think to be most esteemed contrary to the
will of God, we are most subject to derision; and that it must not
be a plain and common speech, but a laboured speech that must
bring us to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Why doth God banish him out of Paradise, lest he should live
if he should eat of the tree of Life, seeing there is no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
thing able to give life to any that sinne hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</p>
                  <p>It is true that the eating of the fruit of the Tree of life would
not have recovered him, but the Lord therefore would have him
banished from it, lest he should fall into a vain confidence thereof,
to the end to make him seek for grace.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore are the Angels set with a glittering sword to keep
them from the Tree of life?</p>
                  <p>To encrease their care to seek to Christ, being banished from it,
without hope of comming so much as to the sign of life.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>The necessary use of keeping obstinate sinners from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and other holy things in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the miserable and unhappy condition which our
first parents brought upon themselves.</p>
                  <p>Did this estate determine in their persons, or was it derived from
them to all their posterity?</p>
                  <p>It was;<note place="margin">Of sin.</note> for their sinne in eating the forbidden fruit was the sin
of all men, and we therein became sinners and guilty of eternall
Condemnation: So that they by this first transgression did not
onely lose for themselves the Image and favour of God, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55421:77"/>
all deprived their posterity of that blessed estate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. and
plunged them into the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. bringing damnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves and us all: wherefore this cursed estate of mankind
is called in the scriptures the image of <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 5. 3. the old
man, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22. the flesh, <hi>Gen. 6. 3. John 3. 6. &amp;c.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
teacheth expresly, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. That by one man sinne entred
into the world, and death by sinne: and so death went over all men, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as all men have sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How doth the Apostle here call this the sinne of one man, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> sinned which are two, and that <hi>Eve</hi>
sinned before <hi>Adam?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the name of <hi>Adam</hi> was comprehended the man and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for by mariage two are made one; and <hi>Moses</hi> calleth both the
man and the woman <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 5. 2. and last of all, the Apostle used
the word here signifying both man and woman.</p>
                  <p>What reason is there that all their posterity should take part with
them both in their fall and in the wofull effect thereof?<note place="margin">Why all <hi>Adams</hi> posterity are partakers of his sin and misery.</note> It
seemeth not to stand with the Justice of God to punish us for the
sin that we never did.</p>
                  <p>Our first parents by Gods appointment were to stand or fall in
that triall, not as singular persons only, but also as the head and root
of all mankind, representing the persons of all that should descend
from them by naturall generation; and therefore for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the ground of our participation with <hi>Adams</hi> fall, two
things must be considered.</p>
                  <p>First, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not a private man in this businesse, but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
the person of all mankind, as he who had received grace
and strength for himself and all his posterity, and so lost the same
for all: For <hi>Adam</hi> received the promise of life for himself and us
with this condition, if he had stood, but seeing he stood not, he lost
the promise of life both from himself and from us; and as his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
should have been ours if he had stood in it, so was his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
and misery ours: So that as in the second Covenant, the
righteousnesse of the second <hi>Adam</hi> (Christ Jesus the Mediatour)
is reckoned to those that are begotten of him by spirituall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
(even those that beleeve in his name) although they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did it: so in the first Covenant, the sinne of the first <hi>Adam</hi>
(who herein sustained a common person) is reckoned to all the
posterity that descend from him by carnall generation, because they
were in him, and of him, and one with him, <hi>Rom. 5. 15, 16, 17,
18,</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we all who are descended from <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall
generation, were in his loyns and a part of him when he fell, and
so by the law of propagation and generation sinned in him, and in
him deserved eternall condemnation; therefore as two Nations are
said to be in the womb of <hi>Rebekah, Gen.</hi> 25. 23. and <hi>Levi</hi> to have
paid tithes to <hi>Melchisedec</hi> in the loins of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10. who
was not born some hundred years after, so is it here. Thus we see that
as by the act of generation in leprous parents, the parents Leprosie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55421:77"/>
made the childrens, and the slavish and villanous estate of the parents
is communicated unto all the off-spring, (for a man being a slave, his
progeny unto the hundred generation, unlesse they be manumitted
shall be slaves) even so the naturall man howsoever he thinketh
himself free, yet in truth he is sold under sin, and is the very servant of
corruption, and in that state shall for ever remain, unlesse the Son doe
make him free, <hi>Joh. 8. 33, 34. 36. Rom. 6. 17. 19, 20. &amp; 7. 14. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 19.
We see also that great Parsonages rebelling against the King, do not only
thereby hurt and disgrace themselves, but also stain their whole bloud,
and lose their honour and Inheritance from themselves and from their
children; for by our Law a man being attainted of High treason, the
attaint of bloud reacheth to his posterity, and his children as well as
he lose the benefit of his Lands and Living for ever, unlesse the King
in favour restore them againe, as God in his mercy hath done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
                  <p>Then it appeareth, that by propagation from our last parents we are
become partakers of the sin of our first parents?</p>
                  <p>Even so, and for the same transgression of our first parents, by the
most righteous Judgement of God, we are conceived in sin, and born in
iniquity, and unto misery, <hi>Ps.</hi> 51. 5. for men are not now born as <hi>Adam</hi>
was created, but <hi>death doth reign over them also that sinned not after the
like manner of the transgression of Adam, Rom.</hi> 5. 14. that is, over infants,
who are born in sin, &amp; not by imitation, but by an inherent corruption
of sin, even as we see the young Serpents and Wolves that never stung
men or devoured sheep, are notwithstanding worthy to die, because
there are principles of hurtfulnesse and poysonsomnesse in them.</p>
                  <p>How is it shewn, that babes new born into the world have sin?</p>
                  <p>In that they are afflicted sundrily, which they bewray by their bitter
cries, and in that they comming out of the mothers womb goe straight
into the grave.</p>
                  <p>What is then the naturall estate of man?</p>
                  <p>Every man is by nature dead in sin as a loathsome carrion, or as a
dead corps, and lieth rotting and stinking in the grave, having in him
the seed of all sins, <hi>Eph. 2. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>For the fuller understanding of the state of sin and the consequents
thereof, declare first what sin is.</p>
                  <p>It is defined in one word,<note place="margin">What sin is.</note> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4. to be the transgression of the
law; namely, a swerving from the law of God, making the sinner
guilty before God, and liable to the curse of the law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>Seeing by the law sinne is, and the law was not before <hi>Moses,</hi> Rom.
5. 13. it seemeth there is no sin untill <hi>Moses?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it is said the law was not before <hi>Moses,</hi> it is to be understood
of the law written in the Tables of stone by the finger of God, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
laws Ceremoniall and Politicall written by <hi>Moses</hi> at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God: for otherwise the law (the Ceremoniall law excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
was written in the heart of man, and for the decay therof through
sin taught by those to whom that belonged from the fall unto
<hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:55421:78"/>
Is every breach of the Law of God sin?</p>
                  <p>Yea, if it be no more but the least want of that God requireth,
<hi>Rom. 7. 7. Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>And doth every sin, the very least, deserve the curse of God and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
death?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, because God is of infinite Majesty and dignity, and
therefore what so toucheth him deserveth endlesse wrath: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Purgatory, and our owne satisfaction for small sinnes is
vain.</p>
                  <p>How many sorts of sins are there?</p>
                  <p>Sin is either imputed, or inherent; the one without us, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within us.</p>
                  <p>What is the sin Imputed?</p>
                  <p>Our sin in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Imputed sin.</note> in whom as we lived, so also we sinned; for in our
first parents (as hath been shewed) every one of us did commit that
first sinne which was the cause of all other, and so we all are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
subject to the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, both for the trasgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and guiltinesse, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. 18. 19. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
                  <p>What sins are Inherent in us?</p>
                  <p>They doe either defile our nature,<note place="margin">Inherent sin.</note> or our actions, the one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Originall sin, the other Actuall, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 9. For every one natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
descending from <hi>Adam,</hi> beside the guilt of that first sin committed
in Paradise; first, is conceived and born in original corruption, <hi>Ps.</hi> 51. 5.
Secondly, living in this world sinneth also actually, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Esay
48.</hi> 8. yea, of himself he can doe nothing but sin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any thing pure unto him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p>What is Originall sin?</p>
                  <p>It is a sin wherewith all that naturally descend from <hi>Adam</hi> are
defiled even from their first conception,<note place="margin">Originall sin.</note> infecting all the powers of
their souls and bodies, and thereby making them drudges and slaves
of sin, for it is the immediate effect of <hi>Adams</hi> first sin, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
cause of all other sins.</p>
                  <p>How is this sin noted out unto us?</p>
                  <p>In that other sinnes have their speciall names, whereas this is
properly called sinne, because it is the puddle and sinke of other
sinnes, and for that also the more it is pressed, the more it bursteth
forth, as mighty streams are, that cannot be stopped, till God by
his holy Spirit restrain it.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth it specially consist?</p>
                  <p>Not only in the deprivation of justice, and absence of good, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in a continuall presence of an evill principle and wicked proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whereby we are naturally inclined to unrighteousnesse, and made
prone unto all evill, <hi>Jam. 1. 14. Rom.</hi> 7. 21. 23. For it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
of Gods Image consisting chiefly in wisdome and holiness,
whereof we are now deprived, and the impression of the contrary
image of Satan, <hi>John 8. 41, &amp;c.</hi> called Concupiscence, <hi>Rom. 7. 7.
Jam.</hi> 1. 14. consisting, first, in an utter disability and enmity
unto that which is good, <hi>Rom. 7. 18. &amp;</hi> 8. 7. Secondly, in pronenesse
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55421:78"/>
to all manner of evill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. which also every man hath at the
first minute and moment of his conception, contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Pelagians, who teach that sinne commeth by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Is the Image of God wholly defaced in man?</p>
                  <p>No, if we take it in a large acception: For man remaineth still a
reasonable creature, and capable of grace, having the same parts
and faculties he had before; and in them some reliques of Gods
Image, <hi>Gen. 9. 6. Jam.</hi> 3. 9. As in the understanding some light,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 9. in the conscience sometimes right judgement, <hi>Rom. 2.
15.</hi> in the will some liberty to good and evill in naturall and
civill actions: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. and freedome in all things from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Is there not a power left in man, whereby he may recover his former
happinesse?</p>
                  <p>Man hath still power to perform all outward actions, but not
to change himselfe, untill he be changed by the grace of God.</p>
                  <p>Is man then able to perform the Law of God perfectly?</p>
                  <p>They that are not born again of God,<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3. 22. Rom. 8. 3.</note> cannot keep it all,
<note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 3. 9. Tit. 3. 5.</note> nor in any one point as pleasing to God thereby, in respect
of themselves. For except a man bee borne of God, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the Kingdome of heaven, nor enter therein; neither can
he keep the Commandements of God. Moreover, all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being conceived and born in sinne, are not onely insufficient
to every good thing, but also disposed to all vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Can man in this estate doe no good thing to please God, to deserve at
least something of his favour?</p>
                  <p>We have lost by this sinne all the righteousnesse we had in our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
so as now if God should say to us, Think but a good thought
of thy selfe, and thou shalt be saved; we cannot: but our nature is
as a stinking puddle, which within it selfe is loathsome, and being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
is worse.</p>
                  <p>But doth not God wrong to man, to require of him that he is not able
to performe?</p>
                  <p>No; for God made man so, that he might have performed it, but he
by his sins spoiled himselfe, and his posterity of those good gifts.</p>
                  <p>Is this corruption of nature in all the children of <hi>Adam?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, in all and every one that are meer men, none excepted; <hi>Rom.</hi>
3. 10. &amp; 5. 15. All children since <hi>Adams</hi> fall being begotten in it, <hi>Ps.
51.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>How then doth the Apostle say, that holy parents beget holy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
                  <p>Parents beget children as they are by nature, not as they are by
grace.</p>
                  <p>How is originall sin propagated and derived from the Father to the
Sonne?<note place="margin">The propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of originall sin.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee are not to bee so curious in seeking the manner how, as
to marke the matter to bee in us: even as when a house is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55421:79"/>
on fire, men should not be so busie to enquire how it came, as seeing
it there, to quench it: But this we may safely say, that what effect the
committing of the first sinne wrought in the soule of <hi>Adam,</hi> the same
it doth by the imputation of it work in the soules of his posterity; as
therefore the committall of that sin left a staine behind it in his nature,
being like a drop of poyson that being once taken in, presently infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
the soundest parts; or like the dead flye that marreth the most
precious ointment of the Apothecary: so in the creation and infusion
of our soules into our bodies, God justly imputed the same transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto us, the same corruption of nature (as the just punishment of
that sin) must ensue in the like manner.</p>
                  <p>Hath this inbred sin, wherein every one is conceived, equally pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all men?</p>
                  <p>Yes, though not altogether alike for disposition and motion to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
for experience teacheth us that some are by nature more milde,
courteous, and gentle then others, which difference notwithstanding
is not so much in the natures of men, as in the Lord who represseth
these sins in some, which he suffereth to rise up in others.</p>
                  <p>In what part of our nature doth this our corruption abide?</p>
                  <p>In the whole man from the top to the toe, and every part both of
body and soule, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 23. Like unto a leprosie that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
from the crowne of the head to the sole of the foot: but chiefly it
is the corruption of the five faculties of the soule, which are thereby
deprived of that holinesse wherein God created them in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not the substance of the soule corrupted by this sinne?</p>
                  <p>No, but the faculties onely depraved and deprived of originall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
                  <p>For first, the soule should otherwise be mortall and corruptible. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
our Saviour took our nature upon him without this corruption.</p>
                  <p>To come then to the speciall corruptions of the five faculties of the
soul. Then first how this sin is discerned in the Vnderstanding.</p>
                  <p>The mind of man is become subject to blindnesse in heavenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<note place="margin">The mind cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> First, Darknesse and ignorance of God, of his will, and of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. Eph. 4. 17, 18, 19. Rom.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, uncapablenesse, unablenesse, and unwillingnesse to learn
though a man be taught, <hi>Rom. 8. 7. Luk.</hi> 24. 45.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, unbeleefe and doubting of the truth of God, taught and
conceived by us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, vanity, falshood and error; to the embracing whereof,
mans nature hath great pronenesse: <hi>Esa. 44. 20. Jer. 4. 22. Prov. 14.
12.</hi> &amp; 16. 25.</p>
                  <p>What use make you of this corruption of the understanding?</p>
                  <p>That the originall and seeds of all heresies and errors are in mans
heart naturally without a teacher, and therefore we should distrust our
own knowledge, to lead us in the matters of God and Religion; and
onely be directed by Gods holy word.</p>
                  <p>How is the Memory corrupted?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> with dulnesse and forgetfulnesse of all good things that we
should remember, notwithstanding we have learned them often.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55421:79"/>
Secondly, with readines to remember that we should not, and to retain
errors and vanities (as tales and playes) much more then godly matters.</p>
                  <p>What use make you hereof?</p>
                  <p>As, first, to bewaile the defects of our understanding, so to lament
our forgetfulnesse of good things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to distrust the faithfulnesse or strength of our memories in
hearing and learning good things, and to use all good helps we can,
as often repeating them, writing, and meditating on them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, not to clogge our memories with vanities, for which we
should rather desire the art of forgetfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>How is the Will corrupted?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will.</note> with a disablenesse and impotency to will any thing that is
good in it selfe, <hi>Rom. 5. 6. Phil.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, with slavery to sin and Satan, the will being so enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 20. &amp; 7. 23. and hardened, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. that it onely desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and lusteth after that which is evill, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Job</hi> 15. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, with rebellion against God and any thing that is good.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make hereof?</p>
                  <p>First, that we have no free will left in us since <hi>Adams</hi> fall for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
matters. Secondly, that for the conversion either of our selves
or any other, we must not look for it from man, but pray to God to
convert man, who worketh in us both the will and the deed, <hi>Phil. 2. 13.
Heb.</hi> 2. 5. as the Prophet saith, <hi>Convert thou me, and I shall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Lam.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>How are the affections corrupted?</p>
                  <p>The affections of the heart which are many,<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> as love and hatred, joy
and sorrow, hope and feare, anger, desire, &amp;c. are subject to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and disturbance. <hi>Gal. 5. 24. James 4. 15. Job</hi> 15. 16. First, by being
set upon unmeet objects, in affecting and being inclined to the things
they should not be, and not to those they should; thus we hate good
and love evill, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 8. And in a word, our affections naturally
are moved and stirred to that which is evill to embrace it, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stirred up to that which is good, unlesse it be to eschew it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by disorder and excesse, even when we doe affect naturally good
things; as for our own injuries, we are more angry then for Gods disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
when we are merrie, we are too merrie; when sad, too sad, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What use make you of the disorder of the affections?</p>
                  <p>First, to keep our selves from all occasions to incense them to sinne,
whereunto they are as prone as the tinder to the fire. Secondly, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to mortifie them in our selves, that we may be in regard thereof
pure Nazarites before God, <hi>Gal. 5. 24. Col.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>How is the conscience corrupted?<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is distempered and defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. both in giving direction in
things to be done, and in giving judgment upon things done.</p>
                  <p>How in the former?</p>
                  <p>It sometime giveth not direction at all, and thereupon maketh a man
to sin in doing of an action otherwise good and lawfull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23.
sometime it giveth direction, but a wrong one; and so becometh a blind
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55421:80"/>
guide, forbidding to doe a thing which God alloweth, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to doe things which God hateth. 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 7. Col. 2. 21. John</hi> 16. 2.</p>
                  <p>How in the latter?</p>
                  <p>When it either giveth no Judgement at all; being left without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
or when it hath an evill feeling and sense.</p>
                  <p>How is it left without feeling?</p>
                  <p>When it is so senselesse and benummed with sin, that it never check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man for any sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18, 19. called a cauterized conscience,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. which reseth from the custome of sinning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>How doth it faile, when it hath a feeling, but a naughty one?</p>
                  <p>Sometimes in excusing, sometimes in accusing.</p>
                  <p>How in excusing?</p>
                  <p>First, when it excuseth for things sinfull, making them no sinnes, or
small sins, and so feeding the mind with vain comforts. <hi>Mark. 10. 20.
Gen.</hi> 3. 10. 12. Secondly, when as it excuseth us for having a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
without any warrant of Gods word, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 9.</p>
                  <p>How in accusing?</p>
                  <p>First, when for want of time, direction, and lightening, it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
for doing good, (as a Papist for going to Sermons) condemning
where it should excuse, and so filling the mind with false feares.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when accusing for sin it doth it excessively, turmoyling
a man with inward accusations and terrors, <hi>Esa.</hi> 57. 20. and drawing
him to despair by such excessive terror, as may be seen in <hi>Cain</hi> and
<hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What use are we to make of this confusion of the conscience?</p>
                  <p>First, seeing it doth thus abuse us, we are never to make it a warrant
of our actions, unlesse it be directed by Gods word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to feare the terror of the great Judge of heaven
and earth, when we are so often, and so grievously terrified with our
little Judge that is in our soul.</p>
                  <p>What corruption hath the body received by originall sinne?</p>
                  <p>It is become a ready instrument to serve the sinfull soule,<note place="margin">Of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> having
both a pronenesse to any sin the soul affecteth, and likewise an eagernes
to commit it and continue in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. 19. whereby it is come to
passe, that the bodily senses and members are, 1. As Porters to let in
sin, <hi>Job 31. 1. Psal. 119. 37. Matth.</hi> 5. 29, 30. 2. The instruments and
tooles of the mind for the execution of sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15, &amp;
6. 13.</p>
                  <p>VVhat use are we to make of this doctrine of originall sinne?</p>
                  <p>First, the due knowledge thereof serveth to humble the pride of man
remembring that he is conceived in so sinfull a sort, that howsoever the
branches of his actions may seem green, yet is he rotten at the root.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it should move him with all speed to seek for regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Christ, seeing he hath so corrupt a generation by <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVhat is actuall sinne?</p>
                  <p>It is a violation of Gods Commandements done by us after the
manner of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression,<note place="margin">Actuall sin.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. to wit, a particular breach
of Gods Law in the course of our life, which proceedeth as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
fruit from our naturall corruption, and leaveth a stain in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55421:80"/>
soule behind it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. which polluteth the sinner, and disposeth
him to further evill.</p>
                  <p>How is such sin committed?</p>
                  <p>Either inwardly, or outwardly.</p>
                  <p>How inwardly?</p>
                  <p>First, by evill thoughts in the mind, which come either by a mans
own conceiving, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Matth.</hi> 15. 19. or by the suggestion of the
Devill. <hi>John 13. 2. Acts 5. 3. 1 Chron.</hi> 21. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by evill motions and lusts stirring in the heart against the
righteousnesse of the Law, which condemneth the very first motions
of evill that arise from our corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>How outwardly?</p>
                  <p>By evill words and deeds, <hi>Esa.</hi> 3. 8. which arise from the corrupt
thoughts and motions of the heart when any occasion is given, <hi>Matth.
15.</hi> 19. So that the imagination of mans heart, the words of his mouth,
and works of his hands, are all stained with sin.</p>
                  <p>Be not outward sins more grievous then inward?</p>
                  <p>Some be, and some be not; for if they be against the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and the same branch thereof, they are much more wicked
and evill; because, first, God is more dishonoured outwardly; Secondly,
other men are offended, if godly, or inticed by their example, if
wicked; Thirdly, a man doth more ingrosse himselfe in sin outward,
then in a bare thought, that he restraineth from outward action.</p>
                  <p>But how may some thoughts be more evill then actions?</p>
                  <p>If they be of more wicked matters: as the denying of God in heart,
is worse then an idle word.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make thereof?</p>
                  <p>It serveth, first, to condemn the common sort, that say, and hold that
thoughts are free, which are oft so sinfull; Secondly, to assure us that
many though they lead an outward civill life in actions, yet if their
hearts be not cleansed by faith, may be more odious in Gods sight that
knoweth their thoughts, then a godly person that may be left to some
outward weaknesses in his life.</p>
                  <p>What be the degrees by which men doe proceed in the committing of
actuall sin?</p>
                  <p>Out of <hi>James</hi> 1. 14, 15. these foure degrees may be observed.</p>
                  <p>First, temptation to sin, <hi>James 1. 14. 2 Sam.</hi> 11. 12. which then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is sin to us, when it either ariseth from our own corruption, or from
outward occasions to which we have offered our selves carelesly. For
if every temptation to sin offered unto us should be sin simply, then
our Saviour that was tempted should have sinned. Therefore the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or inward temptations that Satan may offer be not sins to us, till
they get some hold in us, which is, when we are the occasion of them
our selves, by inward corruption or outward carelesnesse in venturing
upon temptations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concupiscence bringing sinne to conception, <hi>James</hi> 1. 15.
which is done by these degrees: First, entertaining the sinne whereunto
we are tempted, and suffering it to have abode in the mind or thought.
Secondly, withdrawing the heart from God (whom we ought to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55421:81"/>
feare with all our hearts) and his Commandements, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
consulting whether that sinne which we ought to hate may be done
or no.</p>
                  <p>3. Consent of the mind to commit sinne, whereupon ensueth
the birth of sin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15. by which it is brought forth into act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God or man.</p>
                  <p>4. Often repetition of sin, by custom and continuance, wherein the
heart finally is hardened, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. and sinne is come to a perfection
or ripenesse, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15. which is the strength that sin getteth over
man, whom it ruleth, as a Master doth a slave; in which estate who so
continueth must look for eternall death, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15. for sin then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
which it never doth in the godly.</p>
                  <p>Are these actuall transgressions all of one sort?</p>
                  <p>No, for they are diversly considered, in respect of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
broken, the object offended, the disposition followed, and the
degrees attained.</p>
                  <p>How for the Commandement?</p>
                  <p>The breach of a Commandement that biddeth, is a sin of omission,
but of one that forbiddeth, is a sin of conversion; the one is an omission
of duty required, the other a Commission of evill forbidden; by the one
we offend in omitting those things which we should doe, by the
other in committing those things which we should not doe.</p>
                  <p>Which be the inward sins of omission?</p>
                  <p>The not thinking so often or religiously of heavenly things, (respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the first table) or of good duties to man as we should, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
our minds to be a through-fare for vaine or wicked thoughts to
passe through more then good: which sinne, if it were thought of well,
would make men more humble before God, and to make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their houres, dayes, and nights, to mark how their mind is
occupied.</p>
                  <p>What be inward sins of Commission?</p>
                  <p>All actuall sins of the mind and thoughts, whether we be awake
dealing with God or man, or asleep dreaming. Examples of the first
against God, are to think there is no God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 45. or to have vile
and base conceipts of him or his government, <hi>Psal. 10. 41. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14.
And towards man, every inward breach of the second table.</p>
                  <p>But doth man commit sin in the night when he dreameth?</p>
                  <p>Yes surely, the soule is never idle, but when it thinketh not of good,
it thinketh of evill: and the godly may mark that after they have
had any dreams of things unlawfull, their heart is in a measure woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
till they obtaine peace and pardon from God.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make thereof?</p>
                  <p>To pray earnestly that God would sanctifie our corrupt hearts, that
it may be a fountaine of holy and not sinfull thoughts; and in the
night, 1. To commit our selves specially to God, that because we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Senses and Judgement bound and silent, are lesse able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
and judge our sinfull thoughts, God would preserve us from them
by his grace; And, 2. That we avoid all occasions thereof in the

What be the outward sins of Commission?</p>
                  <p>Such as to the committing of them beside the thought of our mind
any part of our body doth concurre; as our tongue to words, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts to deeds.</p>
                  <p>How are sinnes distinguished in regard of the object offended?</p>
                  <p>Some sins are more directly against God, some against men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publique or private, and others against a mans self.</p>
                  <p>How in regard of the disposition followed?</p>
                  <p>Either as we partake with others sins, <hi>Esa.</hi> 6. 5. or as we commit
the sin in our own person.</p>
                  <p>What be the differences of partaking with others sins?</p>
                  <p>First, when we conceal and winke at other mens sins which we
ought to reveal and rebuke, as Magistrates and Ministers oft doe.
1 <hi>Sam. 3</hi> 13. Secondly, when we further it by our consent, presence,
or counsell, <hi>Act. 7. 58. &amp; 8. 1. &amp; 22. 20. &amp; 23. 14, 15. Rom.</hi> 1. 32.
Thirdly, when we provoke others to sin, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 25.</p>
                  <p>VVhat difference of disposition is there in those sins which a man doth
commit in his own person?</p>
                  <p>Some sins are committed of Ignorance, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13. Ps.</hi> 19. 12. or of
an erring conscience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. which a man doth either not know,
or not mark: others are done of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Doth not Ignorance excuse?</p>
                  <p>Affected Ignorance doth rather increase then diminish a fault.</p>
                  <p>VVhat be the differences of sins of knowledge?</p>
                  <p>1. Some are of infirmity and temptation, for feare of evill or
hope of good, <hi>Rom. 7. 19. Mat.</hi> 26. 69, 70. 2. Some of presumption, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy,
and stubbornesse in sinning, against which <hi>David</hi> earnestly
prayed, <hi>Ps. 19. 13. &amp; 50. 21. Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. and this may proceed (if men
have not the grace of God) to obstinate and wilfull malice against
God and his truth, and to the unpardonable sinne against the holy
Ghost, <hi>Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. &amp; 10. 29. Mark 3</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>What is the sin against the holy Ghost, the highest of all sins?</p>
                  <p>It is a wilfull and malicious falling from,<note place="margin">Of the sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy Ghost.</note> and resisting of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
after a man hath been enlightned with it, and felt a taste thereof;
manifested in outward action by some blasphemous oppugning the
truth of set hatred, because it is the truth.</p>
                  <p>What are you to consider in this sin?</p>
                  <p>The nature thereof, and the deadlinesse of the same.</p>
                  <p>What note you in the nature?</p>
                  <p>The reason why it is so called, and the quality thereof.</p>
                  <p>Why is it called the sin against the holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>Not because it is committed against the third Person only, (for it is
committed against all three) but because it is committed against the
light of knowledge with which the holy Ghost hath enlightned the
heart of him that committed it, and that of set malice: for every one
that sinneth against his knowledge may be said to sin against the holy
Ghost, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were said to doe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. But that
is not this great sin of malice, resisting the truth, because it is the truth,
but of infirmity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:55421:82"/>
What qualities and properties hath this great sin?</p>
                  <p>First, it must be in him that hath known the truth, and after falleth
away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5. therefore Infidels and Heathens doe not sin this sinne;
neither any that are ignorant, though maliciously they blaspheme the
truth. Secondly, it must be done of set malice, because it is the truth,
as the Pharises did, <hi>Mat. 12. 31. Heb.</hi> 6. 6. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> that cursed
himself, and denyed that he knew Christ, to save his life, did not sinne
this sin; nor <hi>Paul</hi> that did persecute him doing it of ignorance. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it must be against God himself directly &amp; his Son Christ Jesus, <hi>Mat.
12. 31. Heb.</hi> 6. 6. Therefore it is not any particular breach of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table, nor a slip against any speciall sin of the first.</p>
                  <p>Can these qualities at any time befall the elect or children of
God?</p>
                  <p>No: and therefore they that feel in themselves the testimony of
their election, need not fear their falling into this sin, nor despair.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the deadlinesse of this sin above other sins?</p>
                  <p>First, God hath pronounced it shall never be pardoned; not because
God is not able to pardon it, but because he hath said he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
it. Secondly, this sin is commanded not to be prayed for, when
persons are known to be guilty of it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. whereas we are
bound to pray for all other persons. Thirdly, this is the ordinary and
first sin of the Devill, and therefore is he never received into mercy, no
more then those that are guilty of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the sinne against the holy Ghost: Shew now the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of actuall sins in regard of the degrees attained.</p>
                  <p>Some are only sins,<note place="margin">Of the divers differences of actuall sins.</note> but others are wickednesses, and some beastli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
or devilishnesses; for though originall sin be equall in all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
children, yet actuall sins be not equall, but one much greater
then another.</p>
                  <p>Are not sins well divided into Veniall, and Mortall?</p>
                  <p>None are Veniall of their own nature, but only to the faithful they
are so made by the mercy of God in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Doe all naturall men alike commit all these kinds of sin?</p>
                  <p>No: for though all are alike disposed unto all manner of evill, <hi>Rom.
7.</hi> 14. having in their corrupt nature the seeds of every sin; yet doth
God for the good of humane society restrain many from notorious
crimes, by fear of shame and punishment, desire of honour and reward,
&amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>How doth God employ men in this state of sin?</p>
                  <p>First, he guideth them partly by the light of nature, <hi>Rom. 2. 14, 15.
Joh.</hi> 1. 9. and partly by common graces of the Spirit, <hi>Esa.</hi> 44. 28. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many actions profitable for humane society, and for the outward ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he over-ruleth their evill and sinful actions, so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they bring to passe nothing but what his hand and counsell had
before determined for his own glory, <hi>Act. 3. 16. &amp;</hi> 4. 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>What are the things that generally follow sin?</p>
                  <p>They are two: Guilt and punishment; both which doe most duly
wait upon sin to enter with it, and cannot by any force or cunning of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55421:82"/>
man or Angel be holden from entring upon the person that sin hath
already entred upon; both likewise doe increase as the sinne increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
                  <p>What is the guilt of sin?</p>
                  <p>It is the merit and desert of sin,<note place="margin">Guilt of sin.</note> which is as it were an obligation
to the punishment and wrath of God, whereby we become subject
to Gods debt or danger; that is, to condemnation, <hi>Rom. 2. 15. &amp; 3. 9.
&amp;</hi> 10. 19. For every man by reason of his sin is continually subject
to the curse of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. and is in as great danger of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
damnation, as the Traitour apprehended is in danger of hanging,
drawing and quartering.</p>
                  <p>Is there any evill in the guilt before the punishment be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
                  <p>Very much; for it worketh unquietnesse in the mind, as when a
man is bound in an obligation upon a great forfeiture, that very
obligation it self disquieteth him; especially if he be not able to pay
it (as we are not.) And yet more, because where other debts have a
day set for payment, we know not whether the Lord will demand by
punishment his debt this day before to morrow.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from this?</p>
                  <p>That sith men doe shun by all means to be in other mens debt or
danger (as also the Apostle exhorteth, <hi>Rom. 13. 8. Owe nothing to any
man;</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> also counselleth in the matter of suretiship, <hi>Prov.
6.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) we should more warily take heed that we plunge not
ourselves over head and ears in the Lords debt; for if it be a terrible
thing to be bound to any man in stature Staple, or Merchant, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance,
much more to God who will be paid to the uttermost
farthing.</p>
                  <p>How else may the hurt and evill of the guilt of sinne be set forth
unto us?</p>
                  <p>It is compared to a stroake that lighteth upon the heart and soul of
a man, where the wound is more dangerous then when it is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>Gen. 44. 16. 1 Sam.</hi> 24. 4, 5, 6. and so it is also a sting or a bite
worse then of a viper, as that which bringeth death.</p>
                  <p>Have you yet wherewith to set forth the evill of the guilt?</p>
                  <p>It seemeth when the Lord said to <hi>Cain,</hi> if he sin against his brother,
his sin lyeth at the door, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. that he compareth the guilt to a
dog that is always snarling and barking against us; which is confirmed
by the Apostle, who attributeth a mouth to his desert of sin to accuse
us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>What is the effect of this guilt of Conscience?</p>
                  <p>It causeth a man to flie when none pursueth, and to be afraid of the
fall of a leaf, <hi>Prov. 28. 1. Levit.</hi> 26. 36.</p>
                  <p>VVhen a man doth not know whether he doth sin or no, how can
he be smitten, or bitten, or barked at, or flie for feare? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
against all this evill ignorance seemeth to be a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</p>
                  <p>No verily; for whether we know it or no, his guilt remaineth:
as a debt is a debt, though a man knoweth it not; and it is by so much
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55421:83"/>
the more dangerous, as not knowing it, he will never be carefull to
discharge it, till the Lords arrest be upon his back, when his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
will doe him no good.</p>
                  <p>VVe may see many which heap sinne upon sinne, and know also
that they sinne, and yet for all that cease not to make good
cheer, and make their hearts merry.</p>
                  <p>The countenance doth not alwayes speake truth, so that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
under a countenance in shew merry there are stings and pricks
in the Conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. which yet is oftentimes benummed,
and sometimes through hypocrisie it is seared, as it were with a hot
iron, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. but the Lord will find a time to awaken and
revive it, by laying all his sinnes before his face, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21.</p>
                  <p>VVhen it is known what is the remedy of it?</p>
                  <p>It were wisdome not to suffer our guilt to run long on the score,
but reckon with our selves every night ere we lie down to sleep,
and look back to the doings of the day, that in those things which
are well done we may be thankefull and comfort our own hearts,
and in that which passeth otherwise from us, we may call for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and have the sweeter sleep; for if <hi>Solomon</hi> willeth us in that
case of debt by suretyship to humble our selves to our Creditor,
and not to take rest untill we have freed our selves, <hi>Prov. 6. 1, 2,
3,</hi> 4, 5, 6. much more ought we to haste the humbling our selves
unto God, sith the bloud of Christ is the onely sacrifice for
sinne.</p>
                  <p>Is the guilt of sin in all men alike?</p>
                  <p>No: for as the sin encreaseth, so doth the guilt, both in regard
of the greatnesse and of the number of our sins, as appears out of
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6. where as sin is said to be gone above their heads, so the
guilt to reach up to the heavens.</p>
                  <p>VVhen the sin is gone and past, is not the guilt also gone and
past?</p>
                  <p>Christ taketh away both the guilt and the sin of the godly, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
originall sin which continueth during life) but in the wicked
when the act of sin is gone, the guilt remaineth always; as the
strong savour of garlick, when the garlick is eaten, or as the scarre
of a wound, or the mark of a burning, when the wound or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is past.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is contrary to the guilt of sin?</p>
                  <p>The testimony of a good Conscience, which is a perpetuall joy
and comfort, yea and a heaven to him that hath walked carefully in
Gods obedience, as the other is a torment of hell.</p>
                  <p>So much of the guilt, what is the punishment?</p>
                  <p>It is the wages of sin sent for the guilt,<note place="margin">Punishment of sin.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. namely, the
wrath and curse of God, by whose just sentence man for his sinne
is delivered into the power both of bodily and spirituall death,
begun here, and to be accomplished in the life to come, <hi>Gen. 2. 17.
John 3. 18, 19. &amp; 5. 24. &amp; 28. 29. Lamen. 3. 36. Esa. 64. 5, 6.
Rom. 6. 12. Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>VVhat do you understand by bodily and spirituall death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:55421:83"/>
By the one I understand the separation of the soule from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with all personall miseries and evils that attend thereon, or
make way thereto; by the other the finall separation of both from
God, together with present spirituall bondage, and all forerunners
of damnation.</p>
                  <p>Are all the particular punishments expressed in the word which
shall come for sin?</p>
                  <p>They cannot wholly be laid down, they be so manifold and so
divers, and therefore it is said they shall come written and unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>Deut. 29. 20. &amp;</hi> 28. 61.</p>
                  <p>Against whom are these punishments addressed?</p>
                  <p>Against the whole estate of him that sinneth: For whereas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
upon obligations unto men are so directed as they can
charge either the person alone, or his goods and lands alone, so as
if the Creditor fall upon the one he freeth the other, as if he fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the person he cannot proceed further then unto his body: the
execution which goeth out from God for the obligation of sin is
extended to the whole estate of the sinner, both to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
unto him, and likewise to his own person.</p>
                  <p>VVhat be the punishments that extend to the things belonging
to him?</p>
                  <p>Calamities upon his family, wife, children, servants, friends,
goods and good name, the losse and curse of all these, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and miserable posterity, (<hi>Matth. 15. 22. Psalme</hi> 109. 12.) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances
in goods, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 28. in name, ignominy and reproach,
<hi>Matth. 7. 12. Job 18. 17. Prov.</hi> 10. 7. losse of friends, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What are the judgements executed upon his person?</p>
                  <p>They are executed either in this life, or in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>What punishments are inflicted in this life?</p>
                  <p>They be partly outward, partly inward.</p>
                  <p>What be the outward punishments?</p>
                  <p>1. His want of dominion over the creatures, and the enmity of
the creatures against him, calamities by fire, water, beasts, or other
means, disorder in the world, in summer, winter, heaven, earth, and
all creatures.</p>
                  <p>2. Shame for the nakednesse of body.</p>
                  <p>3. All hunger in extremity, thirst, nakednesse, penury, poverty of
estate, and want of bodily necessaries.</p>
                  <p>4. Wearinesse in following his calling with sweat of his browes,
with trouble and irksomnesse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>5. Outward shame and infamy.</p>
                  <p>6. Servitude.</p>
                  <p>7. Losse of limbs, or of the use of his senses, deformities in body.</p>
                  <p>8. Weaknesse of beeing, want of sleep, pains of body, aches, soars,
sicknesses and diseases of all sorts, <hi>Deut. 28. Mat.</hi> 9. 2. even to the itch,
which few make accompt of; therby to feel the anger of God and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment
of sin: hither is to be referred pain in Child-bearing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>What be the inward punishments in this life?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:55421:84"/>
1. Sorrow and anguish of soul for these plagues and the like.</p>
                  <p>2. Madnesse, frenzy, and foolishnesse.</p>
                  <p>3. Blindnesse and distemper of the soul, when God striketh it with
an ignorant spirit, with want of judgement to discern between good
and bad, with forgetfulnesse of holy things, or hardnesse of heart, <hi>Eph.
4.</hi> 17, 18, 19. which although for the time they be least felt, yet are
they more fearfull and dangerous, then those whereof the sense is
presently sharp.</p>
                  <p>4. Terrour and vexation of spirit, driving into hell, guiltinesse

                  <p>5. Strangenesse and alienation from God.</p>
                  <p>6. Spirituall bondage, whereby sinfull man is become subject to
the lust of the flesh, the curse of the Law, the rule of Satan, and
the custome of the world; yea, even blessings are cursed, <hi>Malac.</hi> 2. 2.

                  <p>In what sort is man in bondage unto Satan?</p>
                  <p>Both soul and body is under the power of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereby man becommeth the slave of the Devil, and hath
him to reign in his heart as his God, till Christ deliver him, <hi>Col.
1. 13. Ephes. 2. 2. 2 Tim. 2. 26. 2 Cor. 4. 4. Heb. 2. 14. Luke 11.
21,</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>How may a man know whether Satan be his God or no?</p>
                  <p>He may know it by this, if he give obedience to him in his heart,
and expresse it in his conversation.</p>
                  <p>And how shall a man perceive this obedience?</p>
                  <p>If he take delight in the evill motions that Satan puts into his

                  <p>What is that slavery whereby a man is in bondage to the flesh?</p>
                  <p>A necessity of sinning (but without constraint) untill he be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by the grace of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 33, 34, 35.</p>
                  <p>If we sin necessarily, and cannot but sin, then it seemeth we are not to

                  <p>Yes, the necessity of sin doth not exempt us from sin, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
                  <p>What punishments are inflicted upon sinfull man after this life?</p>
                  <p>A twofold death.</p>

                  <p>Bodily death in the severall kindes; namely, the separation of the
soul from the body, <hi>Gen. 3. 19. Eccl. 12. 7. Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
                  <p>Wherein consisteth the second death?</p>
                  <p>1. In an everlasting separation of the whole man from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
presence and comfortable fellowship of Gods most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Majesty, in whose countenance is fulnesse of joy.</p>
                  <p>2. Perpetuall imprisonment in the company of the Devill and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
damned in hell.</p>
                  <p>3. The most heavy wrath of God and unspeakable torments to be
endured in hell fire world without end, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:55421:84"/>
How doth this death seize upon man?</p>
                  <p>1. After this life is ended, the soule of the wicked immediately is
sent unto hell, there to be tormented unto the day of Judgement,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>2. At the day of Judgement the body being joyned to the soule
againe, both shall be tormented in hell everlastingly, <hi>Matth. 10.
28.</hi> so much also the more as they have had more freedome from
pain of body, and anguish of soule, and losse of outward things in
this life.</p>
                  <p>Is the punishment of all sins alike?</p>
                  <p>No; for as the guilt increaseth, so doth the punishment; and as the
smallest sin cannot escape Gods hand, so as we heap sins, he will heap
his judgements, <hi>John 19. 11. Mat.</hi> 11. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>But God is mercifull?</p>
                  <p>He is indeed full of mercy, but he is also full of righteousnesse,
which must fully be discharged, or else we cannot be partakers of his
mercy.</p>
                  <p>Cannot we by our own power make satisfaction for our sins, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our selves from the wrath of God?</p>
                  <p>We cannot by any meanes, but rather from day to day increase our
debt; for we are all by nature the sons of wrath, and not able so much as
to think a good thought; therefore unable to appease the infinite wrath
of God conceived against our sins.</p>
                  <p>Could any other creature in heaven or earth (which is onely a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
perform this for us?</p>
                  <p>No, none at all; for first God will not punish that in another crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is due to be paid by man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, none that is onely a creature can abide the wrath of God
against sinne, and deliver others from the same.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, none can be our Saviour but God.</p>
                  <p>Could man by his own wisdome devise any thing whereby he might be
saved?</p>
                  <p>No; for the wisdom of man can devise nothing but that which may
make a further separation betwixt God and him.</p>
                  <p>VVhat then shall become of man-kind? is there no hope of salvation,
shall all perish? then surely is a man of all creatures most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
when a dog or a toad die, all their misery is ended, but when a
man dieth, there is the beginning of his woe.</p>
                  <p>It were so indeed if there were no meanes of deliverance, but
God in his infinite wisdome and mercy hath found out that which
the wisdome of man could not, and provided a Saviour for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>How then is man delivered from this sinfull miserable estate?</p>
                  <p>Sinne is repressed,<note place="margin">Of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with man.</note> and misery asswaged, by many meanes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and civill, but they are not removed, nor man restored,
but onely by a new Covenant; the old being not now able to
give life unto any, by reason of the infirmity of our flesh.</p>
                  <p>VVhy is the former Covenant of works called the old?</p>
                  <p>Because we not onely cannot doe it, but through the perversenesse
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55421:85"/>
of our nature (and not by the fault of the Law) it maketh our old man
of sin elder, and we more hasting to destruction.</p>
                  <p>How are they convinced that seek righteousnesse by this Covenant?</p>
                  <p>Because thereby they make God unjust, and that he should thus
give the Kingdome of heaven to wicked men, as to those that cannot
fulfill the Law.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the nature of a Covenant is to reconcile and joyne those toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that are at variance (as we see in the example of <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Abimelech, Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) why is this called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that can make no reconciliation betwixt God and us?</p>
                  <p>Although it be not able to reconcile us, yet doth it make way for
reconciliation by another Covenant: neither is it meet strictly to
bind Gods Covenant with men to the same Lawes, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of one man with another are bound unto: For amongst men the
weaker seeketh reconciliation at the hand of the mightier, <hi>Luk. 14. 31,
32.</hi> But God neither able to be hurt, or benefitted by us, seeketh unto
us for peace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>VVhether of these two Covenants must be first in use?</p>
                  <p>The Law; to shew us, first, our duty what we should doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our sin, and the punishment due thereunto.</p>
                  <p>How is that other Covenant called whereby we are reconciled unto
God, and recovered out of the state of sin and death?</p>
                  <p>The new Covenant,<note place="margin">Of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</note> (so called, because by it we are renued) the
Covenant of grace, of promise, of life and salvation; the new Testament,
the Gospell, &amp;c. <hi>Ier. 31. 31, 32. Rom.</hi> 3. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>What is the Covenant of grace?</p>
                  <p>Gods second contract with man-kind after the fall, for restoring of
him into his favour, and to the estate of happinesse by the meanes of a
Mediatour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22. and it containeth the free promises of God
made unto us in Jesus Christ, without any respect of our deservings.</p>
                  <p>VVho made this Covenant?</p>
                  <p>God alone: for properly man hath no more power to make a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Covenant in his naturall estate, then before his creation he had to
promise obedience.</p>
                  <p>How are they convinced by the giving of this second Covenant, which
seek righteousnesse in the Law or old Covenant?</p>
                  <p>Because thereby they make God unwise that would enter into a
new and second Covenant, if the former had been sufficient. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>When was this Covenant of Grace first plighted between God and
man?</p>
                  <p>Immediately after his fall in Paradise, in that promise given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the womans seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. God in unspeakeable mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the remedy before he pronounced sentence of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Was it once only published?</p>
                  <p>It was sundry wayes declared in all ages, partly by ordinary means,
and partly by Prophets extraordinarily sent and directed by God.</p>
                  <p>What is the foundation of this Covenant?</p>
                  <p>The meer mercy of God in Christ, whereby grace reigneth unto
life through the obedience of one, which is Jesus Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:55421:85"/>
5. 21. For there being three persons of the Trinity, the Father sent his
Son to accomplish the work of our Redemption, and both of them send
the Holy Ghost to work saving grace in our hearts, and apply unto
our soules the holinesse purchased by the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>What is promised therein?</p>
                  <p>The favour of God and everlasting salvation, with the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as Christ, and in him Conversion, Justification and Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>What is the condition on mans part?</p>
                  <p>The gift being most free on Gods part, nothing is required on mans
part but the receiving of grace offered; which is done in those that are
of capacity by Faith in Christ: <hi>John 1. 12. 14, 15. Acts</hi> 16. 31. whence
followeth new obedience, whereby the faithfull walk worthy of the
grace received; and this also is by Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>What then is the summe of the Covenant of grace?</p>
                  <p>That God will be our God and give us life everlasting in Christ, if
we receive him; being freely by his Father offered unto us. <hi>Jer. 31.
33. Acts. 16. 30, 31. John</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>How doth this Covenant differ from that of works?</p>
                  <p>Much every way;<note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the Covenant of works, and and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</note> for, first, in many points the Law may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by reason; but the Gospell in all points is farre above the reach
of mans reason. Secondly, the Law commandeth to doe good, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
no strength, but the Gospell enableth us to doe good, the Holy
Ghost writing the Law in our hearts; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. and assuring us
of the promise that revealeth this gift. Thirdly, the Law promised
life onely; the Gospell righteousnesse also. Fourthly, the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
perfect obedience, the Gospell the righteousnesse of Faith. <hi>Rom. 3.
21.</hi> Fifthly, the Law revealeth sin, rebuketh us for it, and leaveth us
in it: but the Gospell doth reveale unto us the remission of sins, and
freeth us from the punishment belonging thereunto. Sixthly, the
Law is the ministery of wrath, condemnation, and death: the Gospell
is the ministery of grace, Justification and life. Seventhly, the Law
was grounded on mans own righteousnesse, requiring of every man
in his own person perfect obedience; <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. and in default for
satisfaction everlasting punishment, <hi>Ezek. 18. 14. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. 12. but
the Gospell is grounded on the righteousnesse of Christ, admitting
payment and performance by another in behalfe of so many as receive
it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. And thus this Covenant abolisheth not, but is the
accomplishment and establishment of the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. 10. 4.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doe they agree?</p>
                  <p>They agree in this,<note place="margin">Wherein they agree.</note> that they be both of God, and declare one kind
of righteousnesse, though they differ in offering it unto us.</p>
                  <p>What is that one kind of righteousnesse?</p>
                  <p>It is the perfect love of God, and of our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>What thing doth follow upon this?</p>
                  <p>That the severe Law pronounceth all the faithfull righteous, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they have in Christ all that the Law doth aske.</p>
                  <p>But yet those remaine transgressors of the Law?</p>
                  <p>They are transgressors in themselves, and yet righteous in Christ,
and in their inward man they love righteousnesse and hate sin.</p>

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:55421:86"/>
What are we to consider in the Covenant of Grace?</p>
                  <p>The condition,<note place="margin">Of Jesus the Mediatour of this Covenant. The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> 1. Of the Mediatour. 2. And then of the rest of
mankind. In the former consisteth the foundation of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
The performance whereof dependeth on Christ Jesus, <hi>Acts 10.
43.</hi> &amp; 3. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. 4. To the latter belongeth the application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
for salvation, unto all that will receive it, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. Mat.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
                  <p>When was the Mediatour given?</p>
                  <p>1. If we regard Gods decree, from all eternity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. If the vertue and efficacie of his Mediation, as soon as need was,
even from the beginning of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>3. If his manifestation in the flesh, in fulnesse of time, <hi>Gal. 4. 4.
1 Tim.</hi> 2. 6. from whence we reckon now, 1643. yeares.</p>
                  <p>Who is this Mediatour between God and man?</p>
                  <p>Jesus, <hi>Luk. 2. 11. Mat. 1. 21. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 5. the Son of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> or Christ, whom the Fathers expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
the Prophets foretold, <hi>John</hi> 1. 45. &amp; 8. 56. Whose life, death,
Resurrection, &amp; Ascension the Evangelists describe, <hi>Joh. 1. 1. Act.</hi> 1. 1.
Whose word preached unto this day subdueth the world, 1 <hi>Tim. 3.
16. 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 5. Finally, whom wee look for from heaven to bee
the Judge of quick and dead. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42.</p>
                  <p>What doe the Scriptures teach us touching Christ our Mediatour?</p>
                  <p>Two things, first his person, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. &amp; 3. 33. Secondly, his office.
<hi>Esa. 61. 1, 2. Luk.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>What is his Person?</p>
                  <p>The second Person in the Godhead,<note place="margin">Of the person of Christ.</note> made man. <hi>John</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p>What have we to consider herein?</p>
                  <p>First the distinction of the two natures.<note place="margin">The natures of Christ.</note> Secondly the hypostaticall
or personall union of both into one <hi>Immanuell.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Divine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What be those two natures thus wonderfully united in one person?<note place="margin">Humane.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, his divine nature or Godhead, which maketh the person.</p>
                  <p>Secondly his humane nature or Manhood, which subsisteth and
hath his existence in the person of the Godhead, and so we beleeve
our Saviour to be both the Son of God, and the son of man. <hi>Gal. 4. 4.
Luk. 1. 31, 32. Rom.</hi> 1. 3, 4. &amp; 9. 5. 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Mat.</hi> 26. 24.</p>
                  <p>What say you of him touching his Godhead?</p>
                  <p>I beleeve that he is the only begotten Son of the most high and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
God his Father:<note place="margin">Of the divine nature of Christ.</note> His Word, Wisdome, Character, and Image; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of his substance before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light,
very God of very God: begotten, not made: finally God, coessentiall,
coeternall, and coequall with the Father, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Why call you him the onely begotten Sonne of God?</p>
                  <p>Because he is the alone Son of God by nature, even the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Father full of grace and truth, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. &amp; 3. 18. For
though others be the Sons of God by Creation, as <hi>Adam</hi> was and the
Angels. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 6. Others by Adoption and Regeneration, as the
Saints, and the man Christ Jesus in another respect by hypostaticall
union; yet none is his Son by naturall generation, but the same Christ
Jesus; and that in regard of his Godhead, not of his Manhood; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Apostle, who saith, that he is without Father according to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55421:86"/>
his Manhood, and without Mother according to his Godhead.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3.</p>
                  <p>But it seemeth that he is called the Sonne of God in respect of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of his humane nature, wherein it is said that the Holy
Ghost did that which Fathers doe in the naturall generation; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing he is therefore said to be the Sonne of the Highest,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35.</p>
                  <p>He is the naturall Sonne of God onely in regard of the eternall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
otherwise there should be two Sonnes, one of the Father, and
another of the Holy Ghost; but he is therefore called the Sonne of the
Highest, for that none could be so conceived by the Holy Ghost, but
he that is the naturall Son of God.</p>
                  <p>How is he said to be conceived by the Holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>Because the holy Ghost by his incomprehensible power wrought
his conception supernaturally, which Fathers doe naturally in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
of their children; not that any of the substance of the Holy
Ghost, which is indivisible, came to his generation in the womb of the
Virgin.</p>
                  <p>Why is he called the Word? <hi>John</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>As for other reasons declared in the doctrine of the Trinity, so also
because he is he whom the Father promised to <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and all
the holy Patriarchs, to make his promises of salvation sure unto them,
as a man that hath ones word, thinketh himself sure of the matter that
is promised.</p>
                  <p>Why is the Word said to have been in the beginning? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>Not because he began then to be, but that then he was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is from all eternity.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this that he is the Wisdome of God?</p>
                  <p>That our Saviour is from everlasting as wel as his Father: for it were
an horrible thing to think that there were a time when God wanted
Wisdome.</p>
                  <p>Why is he called the Character or Image of his Father?</p>
                  <p>Because God by him hath made himselfe manifest to the world in
the Creation, and especially in the Redemption of it.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That whosoever seeketh to come to the knowledge of God, must
come to it by Christ.</p>
                  <p>How is the Godhead of Christ proved?</p>
                  <p>Not onely by abundant testimonies of Scripture, <hi>Esa.</hi> 7. 14. &amp; 9. 6.
&amp; 25. 9. <hi>John.</hi> 1. 1. &amp; 20. 28. <hi>Rom. 9. 5. 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 20. But also by his
miracles, especially in the raising of himselfe from death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4.
together with the continuance and conquest of the Gospell, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 39.
and that not by carnall power or policie, but onely by the power of his
Spirit, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 6. and patient suffering of his Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
                  <p>Why was it requisite that our Saviour should be God?</p>
                  <p>Because,<note place="margin">Why it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that Christ should be God.</note> first, none can satisfie for sin, nor be a Saviour of soules, but
God alone; <hi>Psal. 49. 7. 1. Thess.</hi> 1. 10. For no creature though never so
good, is worthy to redeem another mans sin, which deserveth everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:55421:87"/>
Secondly, the satisfaction for our sins must be infinitely meritorious,
otherwise it cannot satisfie the infinite wrath of God that was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
therefore that the work of our Redemption might be such, it was
necessary our Saviour should be God, to the end his obedience and
sufferings might bee of an infinite price and worth, <hi>Acts 20. 28.
Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, No finite creature was able to abide and overcome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wrath of God, and the sufferings due unto us for our sins; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must our Saviour be God, that he might abide the burthen of
Gods wrath, in his flesh, sustaining and upholding the man-hood by
his divine power, and so might get again, and restore to us the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and life which we have lost.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our Saviour must vanquish all the enemies of our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <p>Fifthly, he must also give efficacie to his satisfaction, raising us up
from the death of sin, and putting us in possession of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he must give us his Spirit, and by it seale these graces to
our soules, and renew our corrupt nature, which only God can doe.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have we then by this that Christ is God?</p>
                  <p>Hereby we are sure that he is able to save by reconciling us to the
Father.</p>
                  <p>And what by this that he is the Sonne?</p>
                  <p>That uniting us unto himselfe, he may make us children unto his
heavenly Father. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>Being God before all worlds, how became he man?</p>
                  <p>He took to himselfe a true body and a reasonable soule,<note place="margin">Of the humane nature of Christ.</note> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

<hi>Heb. 1. 6. Joh. 1. 14. Matth. 1. 18. 20. Luk.</hi> 1. 31, 32. &amp; 2. 7. and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

                  <p>In which respect he hath the name of the Sonne of man given unto
him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 24. because he was of the nature of man according to

                  <p>Besides manifold predictions and cleare testimonies of Scripture,
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. Heb. 2. 17. 1 Tim. 2. 5, &amp;c.</hi> it is abundantly proved by plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

                  <p>How by his Conception?</p>
                  <p>Because according to the flesh he was made of a woman, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of her onely substance (she continuing still a pure Virgin) by the
power of the most High. <hi>Rom. 1. 3. Gal. 4. 4. Luk.</hi> 1. 34, 35.</p>
                  <p>Why is he said to be born? <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p>To assure us of his true humanity, even by his infancie and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

That he might be holy and without sin, the naturall course of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
corruption being prevented, because he came not by naturall propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That God is faithful as well as merciful, ever making good his word
by his work in due season, <hi>Luk. 1. 20. 45. Act.</hi> 3. 18. 24.</p>
                  <p>Why is there mention of the Virgin by her name <hi>Mary?</hi> Luc. 1. 27.</p>
                  <p>For more certainty of his birth and linage, <hi>Mat. 1. 16. Heb. 7. 14.
2 Tim.</hi> 2. 8. as also to acquaint us with his great humility in so great
poverty, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 24. compared with <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from hence?</p>
                  <p>The marvellous grace of Christ, who being rich, for our sakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>Did he not passe through the Virgin Mary (as some say) like as
saffron passeth through a bag, and water through a Pipe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit?</p>
                  <p>God forbid: he was made of the seed of <hi>David,</hi> and was a plant of
the root of <hi>Jesse,</hi> for he took humane nature of the Virgin, and so the
Word was made flesh.</p>
                  <p>If he was only made flesh, it would seem that the Godhead served in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a soul unto him?</p>
                  <p>Flesh is here taken according to the use of Scripture for the whole
man, both body and soul, otherwise our Saviour should not have been
a perfect man, and our souls must have perished everlastingly, except
his soul had satisfied for them.</p>
                  <p>Was not the Godhead turned into flesh, seeing it is said he was made flesh?</p>
                  <p>In no wise, no more then he was turned into sin, or into a curse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is said, He was made sin, and made a curse for us, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21.
Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>If the Godhead be not changed into the Manhood, is it not at least
mingled with it?</p>
                  <p>Nothing lesse, for then he should be neither God nor man; for things
mingled together cannot retain the name of one of the simples, as hony
and oyle being mingled together, cannot be called hony, or oyle. 2. The
properties of the Godhead cannot agree to the properties of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
nor the properties of the Manhood to the Godhead: For, as the
Godhead cannot thirst, no more can the Manhood be in all or many
place at once; therefore the Godhead was neither turned nor transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into the Manhood, but both the divine nature keepeth entire all his
essentiall properties to it selfe; so that the humanity is neither omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
omniscient, omnipresent, &amp;c. and the humane keepeth also his
properties and actions, though oft that which is proper to the one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is spoken of the person denominated from the other (which is by
reason of the union of both natures into one person.)</p>
                  <p>The glory of the Godhead being more plentifully communicated with
the Manhood after his resurrection, did it not then swallow up
the truth thereof, as a whole sea one drop of oyle?</p>
                  <p>No, for these two natures continued still distinct, in substance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and actions, and still remained one and the same Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55421:88"/>
Why did he not take the nature of Angels upon him? Heb. 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>Because he had no meaning to save Angels, for that they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the sin against the holy Ghost, falling maliciously into rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against God without temptation.</p>
                  <p>Are not the elect Angels any way benefited by the humane nature of
Christ?</p>
                  <p>No, his humanity only reacheth to sinfull mankind, for if he had
meant to have benefited Angels by taking another nature, he would
have taken their nature upon him.</p>
                  <p>How is it then said, <hi>Eph. 1. 10. &amp; Col.</hi> 1. 20. that he reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
things in heaven?</p>
                  <p>That is to be understood of the Saints then in heaven, and not
any way of the Angels, although by the second Person of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
the Angels were elected, and are by him confirmed, so that they
shall stand for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Why was it requisite that our Mediatour should be Man?<note place="margin">Why it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisire that Christ should be Man.</note> was it not
sufficient that he was God?</p>
                  <p>No, it was further requisite that he should be man also; because
1. Our Saviour must suffer and die for our sins, which the Godhead
could not doe.</p>
                  <p>2. Our Saviour also must perform obedience to the law, which in
his Godhead he could not doe.</p>
                  <p>3. He must be man of kin to our nature offending, that he might
satisfie the justice of God in the same nature wherein it was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Rom. 8. 3. 1 Cor. 15. 21. Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. For the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God did require, that the same nature which had committed
the sin, should also pay and make amends for sin, and consequently
that onely nature should be punished which did offend in <hi>Adam:</hi>
Man therefore having sinned, it was requisite for the appeasing of
Gods wrath, that man himself should die for sin; the Man Christ
Jesus offering up himself a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for us, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 5. Heb. 2. 9, 10. &amp; 14. 15. Rom. 5. 12. 15.
Eph.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>4. It is for our comfort, that thereby we might have free accesse
to the throne of Grace, and might find help in our necessities, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such an high Priest as was in all things tempted like unto our
selves, and was acquainted with our infirmities in his own person,
<hi>Heb. 4. 15, 16, &amp;</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>5. As we must be saved, so likewise must we be sanctified by one
of our own nature; that as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> there was a spring of
humane nature corrupted, derived unto us by naturall generation:
so in the second <hi>Adam</hi> there might be a fountain of the same nature
restored, which might be derived unto us by spirituall regeneration.</p>
                  <p>What comfort then have you by this, that Christ is man?</p>
                  <p>Hereby I am assured that Christ is fit to suffer the punishment of
my sin, and being man himselfe is also meet to be more pitifull and
mercifull unto men.</p>
                  <p>What by this, that he is both God and man?</p>
                  <p>By this I am most certainly assured that he is able most fully to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55421:88"/>
the work of my salvation; seeing that as he is man, he is meet to
suffer for sin; as he is God, he is able to bear the punishment of sin and
to overcome the suffering; being by the one fit, and by the other able
to discharge the office of a Mediatour: Mans nature can suffer death,
but not overcome it; the divine nature cannot suffer, but can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all things; our Mediatour therefore being partaker of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is by the one made fit to suffer, by the other able to overcome
whatsoever was to be laid upon him for the making of our peace.</p>
                  <p>Are these his natures separated?</p>
                  <p>No verily,<note place="margin">Of the union of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Christ.</note> for though they be still distinguished (as hath been said)
in substance, properties and actions, yet were they inseparably joyned
together in the first moment the holy Virgin conceived, and made
not two, but one person of a Mediatour, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 4. 1 Pet. 3. 18. 1 Cor.
15.</hi> 27, 28. The holy Ghost sanctifying the seed of the woman (which
otherwise could not be joyned to the Godhead) and uniting two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in one person, God and man in one Christ, <hi>Luc. 1. 35. 42. Rom.
9. 5. 1 Tim. 2. 5. Joh.</hi> 1. 14. a mystery that no Angel, much lesse man
is able to comprehend.</p>
                  <p>Why so?</p>
                  <p>For that the manhood of our Saviour Christ is personally united
unto the Godhead; whereas the Angels of much greater glory then
men, are not able to abide the presence of God, <hi>Esa.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
                  <p>Was this union of the body and soul with the Godhead, by taking of
the manhood to the Godhead, or by infusing the Godhead into the
manhood?</p>
                  <p>By a divine and miraculous assuming of the humane nature (which
before had no subsistence in it self) to have his beeing and subsistence
in the divine; leaving of it one naturall personship which otherwise
in ordinary men maketh a perfect person; for otherwise there should
be two Persons and two Sons, one of the holy Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God, which were most prejudiciall to our salvation.</p>
                  <p>What then is the personall union of the two natures in Christ?</p>
                  <p>The assuming of the humane nature (having no subsistency in it
selfe) into the person of the Son of God, <hi>Joh. 1. 14. Heb.</hi> 2. 16. and
in that person uniting it to the Godhead, so making one Christ God
and man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>Can you shadow out this conjunction of two natures in one person
by some earthly resemblance?</p>
                  <p>We see one tree may be set into another, and it groweth in the
stock thereof, and becommeth one and the same tree though there
be two natures or kind of fruit still remaining: So in the Son of God
made man though there be two natures, yet both being united into
one person there is but one Son of God and one Christ.</p>
                  <p>What was the cause that the person of the Sonne of God did
not joyn it self to a perfect person of man?</p>
                  <p>1. Because that then there would not be a personall union of both
to make but one perfect Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>2. Then there should be four persons in the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>3. The works of each of the natures could not be counted the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55421:89"/>
works of the whole person, whereas now by this union of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in one person, the obedience of Christ performed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is become of infinite merit, as being the obedience of God:
and thereupon, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. God is said to have purchased his Church
with his own blood.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That his name is wonderfull, <hi>Esa.</hi> 9. 6. and his sacrifice most
effectuall, offering himselfe without spot unto God for us, <hi>Heb.
9.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                  <p>What further fruit have we by this conjunction?</p>
                  <p>That whereas God hath no shape comprehensible either to the
eye of the body or of the soule, and the mind of man cannot rest
but in a representation of something, that his mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
can in some sort reach unto; considering God in the
second person in the Trinity, which hath taken our nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God is after a sort revealed in the flesh, he hath whereupon to
stay his mind.</p>
                  <p>How did the Jewes then before his comming which could not doe so?</p>
                  <p>They might propose to themselves the second Person that should
take our nature, and the same also that had appeared sundry times in
the shape of a man, <hi>Gen. 18. 1, 2. &amp;</hi> 19. 1, 2. Albeit our priviledge is
greater then theirs, as they that behold him as he is; where they did
behold as he should be.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Person of Christ, what is his Office?</p>
                  <p>To be a Mediatour betwixt God and man,<note place="margin">Of Christs office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorship.</note> and so to discharge all
that is requisite for the reconciling of us unto God, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of our salvation, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 5. Heb. 9. 15. Joh.</hi> 14. 6. whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he is called an Intercessor and an Advocate, because he prayeth for
us to the Father, and pleadeth our cause before his Judgement seat.</p>
                  <p>What a one must he be that should undertake this mediation?</p>
                  <p>One which is in very deed a man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and perfectly
righteous without exception, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. and more mighty then all
creatures; that is, he which also is the very true God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>Can no bare man be Mediatour betwixt God and Man?</p>
                  <p>No verily, for <hi>Eli</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. that a man offending a man
it may be accorded by the Judges, but if he offend against God there is
no man can make his peace.</p>
                  <p>Is there then any other Mediatour to be acknowledged besides our
Lord Jesus Christ?<note place="margin">That there is but one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>None but he; because, 1. There is but one God, and therefore but
one Mediatour between God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>2. He only is fit, as he only that partaketh both the natures of God
and man, which is necessary for him that should come between both.</p>
                  <p>3. That is declared by the Types of <hi>Moses,</hi> who alone was in the
Mountain, of <hi>Aaron</hi> or the high Priest, who only might enter into the
(<hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi>) holy place of holy places.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>The same appeareth by the similitudes wherewith he is set
forth:</hi> Joh. 10. 9. I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,
&amp;c. <hi>and</hi> Joh. 14. 6. I am the way, no man commeth to the Father but by me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:55421:89"/>
5. He alone hath found sufficient salvation for all those that come
unto him, <hi>Heb. 7. 9. Joh.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>How commeth it then to passe that this office is given to <hi>Moses</hi> and
unto others? <hi>Gal. 4. 19. Deut.</hi> 5. 31.</p>
                  <p>They are only Ministers of the Word, not authors of the work of
Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. Job</hi> 33. 23.</p>
                  <p>But is there no need of any other Mediatour for us unto Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No: for he is the next of kinne,</hi> Joh. 19. 25, 26. <hi>most mercifull,
most faithfull,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. and able perfectly to save all those that come to
God through him?</p>
                  <p>How is our Saviour graced by God and commended unto us in his
office of Mediation?</p>
                  <p>First, in that he came not to it but being called of God his Father in
a speciall sort, <hi>Esa. 42. 1, 2, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that being called he discharged it most faithfully, in
which respect he is compared to <hi>Moses,</hi> faithful in all the house of God,
&amp; preferred before him as the Master before the servant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2, 3. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make of his calling by God?</p>
                  <p>1. Hereby we learn that none should presume to take a charge in Gods
Church without a calling since he did it not, <hi>Heb. 5. 4, 5. Esa.</hi> 42. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. There ariseth hereby great comfort unto us, in that he thrust not
himself in, but came in by the will of God and his appointment. For
hereby we are more assured of the good wil of God to save us, seeing he
hath called his Son unto it, and that he will accept of all that he shall
doe for us as that which himself hath ordained.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from his faithfulnesse?</p>
                  <p>That he hath left nothing undone of things that belong to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                  <p>What names are given him in regard of his office of Mediation?<note place="margin">Of his names, Jesus Christ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name of Jesus and of Christ, <hi>Luk. 2. 21. 26. Matth.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
                  <p>Why is he called Jesus?</p>
                  <p>He is called Jesus, that is, a Saviour, because he came to save his
people from their sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. and there is no other means whereby
we may in part or in whole be delivered from them.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have you by this?</p>
                  <p>1. My comfort is even the same which I have said, and the rather,
because God from heaven gave him his name, and the Church on
earth hath subscribed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>2. That nothing can hurt me so long as my faith doth not fail me.<note place="margin">Mar. 9. 23.</note>

                  <p>Who was he that was thus anointed?</p>
                  <p>Christ, God and man; though the outward anointing together
with the name of Christ appertained to all those that represented any
part of the office of his Mediatorship; namely, to Prophets, Priests and
Kings which were figures of him.</p>

                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:55421:90"/>
Was Christ anointed with materiall oyle as they were?</p>
                  <p>No: but he was anointed with all gifts and graces of the Spirit of
God needfull for a Mediatour,<note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> and that without measure,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 61. 1.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That all fulnesse of grace dwelling in Christ, all true Christians
shall receive of his fulnesse, grace for grace, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. 16.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto was Christ anointed?</p>
                  <p>Unto the office of his Mediation, by discharging whereof he might
be made an al-sufficient Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Wherein standeth his Mediation, and what are the parts thereof?</p>
                  <p>Being to be a Mediatour between God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. the
first part of his mediation must be exercised in things concerning God,
wherein consisteth his Priestly office; <hi>Heb. 2. 17. &amp; 5. 1. &amp;</hi> 7. 24.
The second in things concerning man, wherein he exerciseth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
and Kingly function.</p>
                  <p>Why must he be a Priest?</p>
                  <p>To offer sacrifice for his Church and to reconcile us unto God, <hi>Psa.
110. 4. Heb. 3. 1. &amp; 4. 14. &amp; 5. 5, 6. &amp;c. &amp; 7. 3. 17. &amp; 8. 2, 3. &amp;</hi> 9. 11. 14.
otherwise we should never have been justified, nor sanctified, and so not
have been at peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Why must he be a Prophet, Doctor or Apostle?</p>
                  <p>To teach his Church, <hi>Deut. 18. 15. 18. Act. 3. 22. &amp; 7. 37. Luke
4.</hi> 18. otherwise we should never have known God nor the things that
belong unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>Why must he be a King or Prince?</p>
                  <p>To rule and govern his Church, <hi>Psal. 110. 1, 2, 3. Luk.</hi> 1. 33. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we should never have been delivered from the captivity of sin and
Satan, nor be put in possession of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>What is his Priesthood?</p>
                  <p>It is the first part of his mediation,<note place="margin">Of Christs Priesthood.</note> whereby he worketh the means
of salvation in the behalf of mankind, and so appeaseth and reconcileth
God to his elect, <hi>Heb. 5. 5, &amp;c.</hi> and 7. 1. <hi>&amp; 3. 13. 17, &amp;c.</hi> and 13. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>Where is the doctrine of Christs Priesthood especially handled?</p>
                  <p>In the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and namely in the 7 Chapter, from the
13. <hi>ver.</hi> to the end, wherein is contained a declaration of his office of
Priesthood, being compared with the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron;</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
shewing, 1. What manner of one he ought to be that hath this
office. 2. How he executeth it.</p>
                  <p>Wherein standeth the manner of him that shall have this office?</p>
                  <p>Partly without him, and partly within himself; without him, as
first that he was chosen of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and not of <hi>Levi;</hi> to
shew that he was not successor of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but rather was to abolish all
those Ceremoniall services and offices.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Priests of <hi>Levi</hi> were appointed by the law of the
fleshly commandement, whereas Christ was appointed by the law of
the power of life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he was installed in it by his Father, and appointed by
an oath for ever, to be a Priest after a new order of <hi>Melchisedec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What benefit ariseth to us in that this was confirmed by an oath?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:55421:90"/>
It giveth unto us comfortable assurance, that all the parts of his
Priesthood be performed unto us, and that he paid the ransome for
our sins.</p>
                  <p>Was not the Word of God sufficient for the performance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
without the binding of it with an oath?</p>
                  <p>Yes, doubtlesse, but the Lord in this promise having to deal with
weak man, and willing more abundantly to shew unto the heires of
promise, the stablenesse of his Counsell, bound himself by an oath,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>Whereby is the perpetuity thereof confirmed?</p>
                  <p>In that it did not proceed by succession, as from <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
from <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and so by descent; but is everlasting, always
abiding in him; which is another difference of their Priestly office.</p>
                  <p>What profit comes to us by the perpetuity of his Priesthood?</p>
                  <p>That he continually maketh intercession for us to God, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
alone is able to save us comming to the Father through him.</p>
                  <p>So much of the quality of him that is to be Priest, which is without
him; what is the part that is within him?</p>
                  <p>1. That in himself he is holy. 2. To others harmlesse and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
3. Undefiled of others, or of any thing; and to speak in a word,
he is separated from sinners: in all which, he differeth from that of
<hi>Aaron;</hi> for they are neither holy in themselves, nor innocent; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
undefiled, but polluting and being polluted by others.</p>
                  <p>What is the fruit we gather of this his holinesse, innocency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defilednesse?</p>
                  <p>That he being holy, innocent, undefiled, and so consequently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from sinners, the same is attributed to the faithfull, and
these his properties imputed for theirs; and therefore he freeth them
both from originall and actuall sins: Contrary to their doctrine, who
say, that he delivereth us from originall sin onely, and that we must
make satisfaction for actuall.</p>
                  <p>What is the difference touching the execution of this office?</p>
                  <p>1. That they offered first for themselves, he for the people only;
for himself he needed not.</p>
                  <p>2. He but once, they many times.</p>
                  <p>3. He offered himself, they something else then themselves.</p>
                  <p>What is the use of this?</p>
                  <p>To prove the absolutenesse, perfection and excellency of this his
Priesthood.</p>
                  <p>May not the Priesthood of the Papists be overthrown by all these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and proved to be a false Priesthood?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily;<note place="margin">The Popish Priesthood o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown.</note> for 1. They are not of the Title of Judah, and so
cannot succeed our Saviour. 2. They are not confirmed by an oath
from God, and therefore not perpetuall. 3. They are not (as he
was) holy in themselves, but unholy; neither innocent, nor undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but defiling others, and being defiled of them; and so not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from sinners, but altogether sinfull and set in sin. 4. They
offer first for themselves, then for the people, likewise many times.
5. They offer sacrifices which are not themselves. 6. They bring
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55421:91"/>
a great disgrace to the Priesthood of Christ, by preferring themselves
to him as the sacrificer to the sacrifice, whom they say they offer.
7. Christ hath a Priest hood that passeth not away.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have we by the Priesthood of Christ?</p>
                  <p>Hereby we are assured that he is our Mediatour, and that we also
are made Priests.</p>
                  <p>VVhat need was there of such a Mediatour?</p>
                  <p>Between parties so disagreeing, the one of finite nature offending,
the other of infinite nature offended; the one utterly disabled to do any
the least good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. or satisfie for the least sin, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 3. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  </p>
                  <p>In this case what was this Mediatour to doe?</p>
                  <p>He was to work the means of our salvation and reconciliation to
God. 1. By making satisfaction for the sin of man. 2. By making
intercession, <hi>Mat. 20. 18. Joh. 17. 19, 20. Heb.</hi> 7. 24, 25, 26, 27.
therefore Jesus Christ our high Priest became obedient even unto the
death, offering up himself a sacrifice once for all, to make a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for all our sins, and maketh continuall intercession to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our name, whereby the wrath of God is appeased, his Justice
is satisfied, and we are reconciled.</p>
                  <p>VVherein then stands his satisfaction to Gods Justice,<note place="margin">Of Christs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</note> which is the
first part of his Priesthood?</p>
                  <p>In yeelding that perfect obedience whereupon dependeth the whole
merit of our salvation, <hi>Dan. 9. 24. Eph.</hi> 1. 2. 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the effect thereof towards us?</p>
                  <p>Redemption, <hi>Luc. 1. 69. Heb.</hi> 9. 24, 25. which is a deliverance of
us from sin, and the punishment thereof, and a restoring of us to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life then ever <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>Rom. 5. 15, 16, 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 45. For
our Saviour Christ hath first redeemed us from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. namely, that wofull and cursed estate which we had
justly brought upon our selves by reason of our sins. Secondly, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
us into his own kingdome and glory, <hi>Col. 1. 12, 13. 1 Cor.
2.</hi> 9. a far more glorious and excellent estate then ever our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had in Paradise.</p>
                  <p>How hath Christ wrought this Redemption?</p>
                  <p>Having taken our nature upon him, he hath in the same as a sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in our stead made full satisfaction to God his Father, by paying all
our debts, and so hath set us free, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
                  <p>What is this debt which we owe to God, that he hath paid for us?</p>
                  <p>This debt is twofold: one is that perfect obedience which we owe
unto God in regard of that excellent estate in which we were created,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. The other is the punishment due unto us for our sins in
transgressing and breaking Gods Covenants, which is the curse of God
and everlasting death. <hi>Deut. 27. 26. Rom. 6. 23. Mat. 5. 17. Gal. 3. 13.
&amp; 4. 4, 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21. All which is contained in the law of God,
which is the hand-writing between God and us concerning the old
Covenant, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>How was our Saviour to make satisfaction for this our debt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:55421:91"/>
1. By performing that perfect obedience which we did owe. 2. By
suffering that punishment due unto us for our sins, that so he might
put out the hand-writing between God and us, and set us free.</p>
                  <p>What then be the parts of Christs obedience and satisfaction?<note place="margin">Of Christs sufferings.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>His sufferings, and his righteousnesse, <hi>Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24.
for it was requisite that he should first pay all our debt, and satisfie
Gods justice, <hi>Esa. 53. 5, 6. Job</hi> 33. 24. by a price of infinite value,
1 <hi>Tim. 2. 6. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.</hi> Purchase and merit for us Gods favour, <hi>Eph</hi> 1. 6. and
kingdome by a most absolute and perfect obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. By
his suffering he was to merit unto us the forgivenesse of our sins, and
by his fulfilling the law he was to merit unto us righteousnesse, both
which are necessarily required for our Justification.</p>
                  <p>But how can one save so many?</p>
                  <p>Because the Manhood being joyned to the Godhead, it maketh the
passion and righteousnesse of Christ of infinite merit, and so we are
justified by a Man that is God.</p>
                  <p>How hath Christ made satisfaction for our sins by his suffering?</p>
                  <p>He endured most grievous torments, both of body and soul, offering
up himself unto God his Father as a Sacrifice propitiatory for all our
sinnes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>In this oblation who was the Priest or Sacrificer?</p>
                  <p>None but Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5, 6. and that as he was both God and man.</p>
                  <p>VVho was the sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>Christ himself as he was man,<note place="margin">Esa. 53. 10.</note> consisting of body and soul.</p>
                  <p>VVhat was the Altar upon which he was offered?</p>
                  <p>Christ as he was God, was the Altar on which he sacrificed himself,
<hi>Heb. 9. 14. &amp; 13. 10. Rev.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
                  <p>How often was he offered?</p>
                  <p>Never but once, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28.</p>
                  <p>VVhereunto was he offered?</p>
                  <p>Unto the shame, pain, torment, and all miseries which are due unto
us for our sins; he suffering whatsoever we should have suffered, and
by those grievous sufferings making payment for our sins, <hi>Esa. ch. 53.
Mat.</hi> 26. 28.</p>
                  <p>VVhat profit commeth by this sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>By his most painfull sufferings he hath satisfied for the sins of the
whole world of his elect, <hi>Esa. 53. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 24. 1 John</hi> 2. 2. and
appeased the wrath of his Father: so that hereby we receive at one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reconciliation with God, our sins are taken away, and we are
freed from all those punishments of body and soul, which our sins
have deserved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26.</p>
                  <p>How commeth it then that Christ having borne the punishment of our
sins, the godly are yet in this world so often afflicted for them with
grievous torments both of body and soul, and that for the most
part more then the ungodly?</p>
                  <p>The sufferings of the godly are not by desert any satisfaction for
their sins in any part, but being sanctified in the most holy sufferings of
Christ they are medicines against sin; neither is their affliction proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a punishment, but a fatherly correction, and chastisement in the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55421:92"/>
world that they should not perish with the world, whereas the wicked
the longer they are spared and the lesse they are punished in this life,
their danger is the greater, for God reserveth their punishment for the
life to come.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That we should not grudge at the prosperity of the wicked, when
we are in trouble: for as the sheep and kine are put in full pastures to be
prepared to the Shambles; so they, the more they receive in this life,
the neerer and the heavier is their destruction in the life which is to
come, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>What are the more generall things which he suffered in this life?</p>
                  <p>Infirmities in his flesh, indignities from the world, and temptations
from the Devill (<hi>Mat. 4. 2. Joh. 4. 6, 7. &amp; 8. 48. 52. Luc.</hi> 4. 2.) Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
belong those manifold calamities which he did undergoe, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
hunger, thirst, wearinesse, reproach, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What benefits doe the godly reap hereby?</p>
                  <p>All the calamities and crosses that befall them in this life are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and sweetned to them, so that now they are not punishments of
sin, but chastisements of a mercifull Father.</p>
                  <p>What are the more speciall things which he suffered at or upon his
death?</p>
                  <p>The weight of Gods wrath, the terrours of death, sorrows of his
soul, and torments of his body, <hi>Esa. 53. 4. 10. Mat. 26. 37, 38. Luc.
22. 44. Mat.</hi> 26. 67.</p>
                  <p>What learn you hence?</p>
                  <p>To admire and imitate the love of Christ, who being the Son of
God, became a man of sorrows even for the good of his utter enemies,
<hi>Eph. 5. 2. 1 Joh. 3. 16. Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>What did our Saviour Christ suffer in soul?</p>
                  <p>He drank the full cup of Gods wrath filled unto him for our sakes,<note place="margin">Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in his soul.</note>
the whole wrath of God due to the sin of man being poured forth upon
him (<hi>Mat. 26. 27, 28. Luc. 22. 44. Rev. 19. 15. Joh. 12. 2. Esa</hi> 53. 5.)
and therefore in soul he did abide most unspeakable vexations, horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
griefs, painfull troubles, fear of mind, feeling as it were the very
pangs of hell; into which both before, and most of all when he hanged
upon the Crosse, he was cast; which caused him before his bodily
passion so grievously to complain.</p>
                  <p>What benefit and comfort receive you by this?</p>
                  <p>Hereby we have our souls everlastingly freed from Gods eternall
wrath, and herein are comforted, because in all our grievous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and assaults we may stay and make sure our selves by this, that
Christ hath delivered us from the sorrowfull griefs and pains of hell.</p>
                  <p>Now for our Saviours bodily sufferings,<note place="margin">Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in his body.</note> why is it said that he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
under <hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 13.</p>
                  <p>For the truth of the story, and fulfilling of his own prophecy, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
his suffering under a forain jurisdiction and authority, <hi>Mat.
20. 19. Joh.</hi> 18. 31, 32. as likewise to teach us that he appeared wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and of his own accord before a mortall Judge, of whom he was
pronounced innocent, and yet by the same he was condemned.</p>

                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:55421:92"/>
What comfort have you hereof?</p>
                  <p>That my Saviour thus suffering, not any whit for his own sins, but
wholly for mine and for other mens sins, before an earthly Judge, I
shall be discharged before the heavenly Judgement seat.</p>
                  <p>What did he chiefly suffer under <hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was apprehended, accused, arraigned, mocked, scourged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and crucified (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 27. and 28. chapters.)</p>
                  <p>What learn you here?</p>
                  <p>That he that knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might be
made the righteousnesse of God in him. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>Did Christ suffer these things willingly, as he suffered them innocently?</p>
                  <p>Yes; he laid down his life meekly as the sheep doth his fleece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the shearer, being obedient even unto the death, <hi>Luc. 23. 41.
1 Pet. 2. 22. Esa. 53. 7. Phil. 2. 8. Heb.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>Vnto what death was he so obedient?</p>
                  <p>Even unto the most reproachfull, painfull and dreadfull death, the
death of the Crosse, <hi>Mat. 27. 30. 38. Phil.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>Why was Christ put unto this death of the Crosse?</p>
                  <p>Because it was not a common death, but such a death as was accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
both of God and man, that so he being made a curse for us, he
might redeem us from a curse due unto us, <hi>Deut. 21. 23. Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have you by this?</p>
                  <p>I am comforted in this, because I am delivered from the curse which
I have deserved by the breach of the law, and shall obtain the blessing
due unto him for keeping of the same.</p>
                  <p>Why was it requisite that our Saviours soul should be separated from
his body?</p>
                  <p>Because we were all dead, that so he might be the death of death for
us, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14, 15. Heb. 2. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 54, 55. for by sin death
came into the world, and therefore the Justice of God could not have
been satisfied for our sins, unlesse death had been joyned with his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</p>
                  <p>How could the death and sufferings of Christ, which were but for a
short time, be a full satisfaction for us, which have deserved eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death?</p>
                  <p>Although they were not everlasting, yet in regard of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the person who suffered them, they were equivalent to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
torments; forasmuch as not a bare man, nor an Angel did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them, but the eternall Son of God, (though not in his Godhead,
but in our nature which he assumed) his person, Majesty, Deity, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Justice, Righteousnesse, being every way infinite and eternall,
made that which he suffered of no lesse force and value then eternall
torments upon others, yea even upon all the world besides. For even
as the death of a Prince (being but a man? and a sinfull man) is of more
reckoning then the death of an Army of other men, because he is the
Prince; much more shall the death and sufferings of the Son of God
the Prince of all Princes, not finite, but every way infinite, and without
sin; much more I say shall that be of more reckoning with his Father
then the sufferings of all the world, and the time of his sufferings of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55421:93"/>
more value (for the worthinesse of his person) then if all the men in the
world had suffered for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>What use are we to make of Christs death and passion?<note place="margin">Uses of Christs Passion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The consideration hereof may bring us to a sound perswasion and
feeling of our sins, because they have deserved so grievous a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as either the death of the Son of God, or hell fire.</p>
                  <p>2. Hereby we reap unspeakable comfort, forasmuch as by his stripes
we are healed, by his bloud washed, by his sacrifice God is satisfied,
and by his death we are saved and redeemed, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. Rev. 1. 5.
Heb. 10. 10. 12. Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>3. We learn from hence to die to our sins, and to live henceforth
unto him that hath dyed for us, <hi>Rom. 6. 2. 6. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>What befell our Saviour after his soule was separated from his

                  <p>He was buried,<note place="margin">Christs buriall.</note>

speak, descended into hell, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 31.</p>
                  <p>Why was it needfull that Christ should be buried?</p>
                  <p>1. To assure us more fully that he was truly dead, <hi>Mat. 27. 59, 60.
94, 65, 66. Act.</hi> 2. 29.</p>
                  <p>2. That even in the grave, the very fortresse of death, he might
loose the sorrows and bands of death, <hi>Act. 2. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 55.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by his descending into Hell?<note place="margin">His descending into hell.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not that he went to the place of the damned, but that he went ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
unto the estate of the dead, <hi>Rom. 10. 7. Eph.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>What doe you call the estate of the dead?</p>
                  <p>That departing this life he went in his soul into heaven, <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 43.
and was in his body under the very power and dominion of death for
a season, <hi>Acts 2. 24. Heb. 2. 14. Rom.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have you by Christs death, buriall, and lying under the
power of death?</p>
                  <p>1. I am comforted, because my sinnes are fully discharged in his
death, and so buried, that they shall never come into remembrance.</p>
                  <p>2. My comfort is the more, because by the vertue of his death and
buriall sin shall be killed in me and buried, so that henceforth it shall
have no power to reign over me.</p>
                  <p>3. I need not to fear death, seeing that sin which is the sting of death
is taken away by the death of Christ, and that now death is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me an entrance into his life.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of his sufferings, what is the other part of his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
                  <p>His perfect righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law.</note> whereby he did that which we were not
able to doe, and absolutely fulfilled the whole law of God for us, <hi>Ps.
40. 7, 8. Rom. 3. 19. &amp;</hi> 5. 19.</p>
                  <p>Why was it necessary that Christ should as well fulfill the Law, as
suffer for us?</p>
                  <p>Because as by his sufferings he took away our unrighteousnesse,
and freed us from the punishment due to us for our sins: so by
performing for us absolute obedience to the whole law of God,
he hath merited our righteousnesse (making us just and holy in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55421:93"/>
the sight of God) and purchased eternall happinesse for us in the
life to come, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Gal. 4. 4, 5. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4.
For as we are made unrighteous by <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, so are we made fully
and wholly righteous, being justified by a man that is God.</p>
                  <p>How manifold is the righteousnesse of our Saviour?</p>
                  <p>Two-fold: Originall, &amp;
Actuall.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is his originall righteousnesse?<note place="margin">Christs origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The perfect integrity and purenesse of his humane nature, which
in himselfe was without all guile, and the least staine of corruption.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</p>
                  <p>Being very man, how could he be without sin?</p>
                  <p>The course of naturall corruption was prevented, because he was
not begotten after the ordinary course by man, but was conceived in
the wombe of a Virgin without the help of man, by the immediate
power and operation of the holy Ghost; forming him of the onely
substance of the woman, and perfectly sanctifying that substance in
the Conception. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 34, 35. 42. So was hee borne holy, and
without sinne; whereunto all other men by nature are subject.</p>
                  <p>VVhy was it necessary that Christ should bee conceived without
sinne?</p>
                  <p>First, because otherwise the God-head and Man-hood could not
be joyned together, for God can have no communion with sinne,
much lesse bee united unto it, which is sinfull, in a personall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, being our Priest he must be holy, harmlesse, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
and perfectly just; without exception. <hi>Heb. 7. 26. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 5.
For if he had been a sinner himselfe, he could not have satisfied for the
sinnes of other men, neither could it be, that an unholy thing could
make us holy.</p>
                  <p>VVhat fruit then and benefit have we by his originall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</p>
                  <p>First, his pure Conception is imputed unto us, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our nature covered from Gods eyes, whiles his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as a garment is put upon us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our originall sinne is hereby dayly diminished,
and fretted away; and the contrary holinesse increased in us.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is his actuall holinesse?<note place="margin">Christs actuall holinesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That absolute obedience whereby he fulfilled in act every branch
of the Law of God, walking in all the Commandements, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
performing both in thought, word, and deed, whatsoever
the Law of God did command: and failing in no duties, either in the
worship and service of God, or duty towards men. <hi>Matth. 3. 15.
Rom.</hi> 5. 18. &amp; 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>VVhat benefit have we hereby?</p>
                  <p>1. All our actuall sins are covered while we are cloathed by faith
with his actuall holinesse.</p>
                  <p>2. We are enabled by him dayly to dye unto sinne, and more and
more to live unto righteousnesse of life.</p>

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:55421:94"/>
But receive we no more by Christ, then those blessings which we lost
in <hi>Adam?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, we receive an high degree of felicity by the second <hi>Adam,</hi>
more then we lost by the first, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. for being by faith incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into him, and by communication of his Spirit unseparably knit
unto him, we become the children and heires of God, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires
with Christ Jesus, <hi>Gal. 4. 6, 7. 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. Rom. 8. 9,
10.</hi> who carrieth us as our head unto the highest degree of happinesse
in the Kingdome of heaven, where we shall lead, not a naturall life,
as <hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradise, with meat, drink, and sleep; but a spirituall
life in all unspeakeable manner and glory.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth yet the second part of Christs Priesthood,<note place="margin">Of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ.</note> namely,
his Intercession, what is that?</p>
                  <p>It is that work whereby he alone doth continually appeare before
his Father in heaven, to make request for his elect in his own worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
making the faithfull and all their prayers acceptable unto him
by applying the merits of his own perfect satisfaction unto them, and
taking away all the pollution that cleaveth to their good works, by
the merits of his passion; <hi>Rom. 8. 34. Heb.</hi> 9. 24. &amp; 12. 24. 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 1, 2.
1 Pet. 2. 5. Exod.</hi> 28. 36, 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>In how many things doth his intercession consist?</p>
                  <p>In five. 1. In making continuall request in our name unto God the
Father, by the vertue of his own merits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in freeing us from the accusations of our adversaries.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in teaching us by his Spirit, to pray, and send up supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for our selves and others.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in presenting our prayers unto God, and making them
acceptable in his sight.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in covering our sins from the sight of God by applying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us the vertue of his mediation.</p>
                  <p>What fruit then have we by his intercession?</p>
                  <p>1. It doth reconcile us to the Father, for those sins which we doe
dayly commit.</p>
                  <p>2. Being reconciled in him, we may pray to God with boldnesse,
and call him Father.</p>
                  <p>3. Through the intercession of our Saviour Christ, our good
works are of accompt before God.</p>
                  <p>How are we made Priests unto God by our communion with Christ?</p>
                  <p>Being sanctified by him, and our persons received into favour,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 6. we have freedome and boldnesse to draw neare and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our selves, soules, and bodies, and all that we have, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
sacrifice to God the Father; and so we are admitted as a
spirituall Priesthood (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.) to offer up the sacrifices of our
obedience, prayers, and thanksgiving; which howsoever imperfect
in themselves, (<hi>Esa.</hi> 64. 6.) and deserving rather punishment then
reward; (<hi>Psalm. 143. 2. Tit.</hi> 3. 5.) are yet, as our persons, made
acceptable unto God, and have promise of reward, (<hi>Matth. 10.
41,</hi> 42.) by the onely merit and intercession of the same our high
Priest.</p>

                  <p>By communicating unto man that grace and redemption which he

                     <hi>His Propheticall and Kingly office.</hi> Acts 3. 22, 23. Psal. 2. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>What is this Propheticall office?</p>
                  <p>The office of instructing his Church, by revealing unto it the way
and meanes of salvation, and declaring the whole will of his Father
unto us, in which respect he was, he is, and ever shall be our Prophet,
Doctor, or Apostle; <hi>Esa. 61. 3, 4. Psal. 2. 6. 7. Luk. 4. 18. Mat. 17. 5.
23. 8, 9, 10. Heb.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>For what reasons must Christ be a Prophet?</p>
                  <p>First, to reveale and deliver unto his people so much of the will of
God as is needfull for their salvation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to open and expound the same being delivered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to make them understand and beleeve the same.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to purge his Church from errors.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, to place Ministers in his Church to teach his people.</p>
                  <p>In what respect doe you say that he is the onely teacher of his
Church?</p>
                  <p>1. In that he only knowing the Fathers as his Sonne, hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
to reveale him of himselfe, and others by him to us: for no
man knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne
will reveale him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
                  <p>2. In that he is onely able to cause our hearts to beleeve and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the matter he doth teach and reveale.</p>
                  <p>What were then the Prophets and Apostles?</p>
                  <p>They were his Disciples and servants, and spake by his Spirit. 1 <hi>Pet.
1.</hi> 10, 11. &amp; 3. 19. <hi>Nehemiah 9. 30. Eph.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>What difference is there between the teaching of Christ, and of the
Prophets and Ministers sent from him?</p>
                  <p>1. Christ taught with another authority then did ever any other
Minister before, or after him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. 28. 32. 34. 44. &amp; 7. 28, 29.
<hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
                  <p>2. By vertue of his Propheticall office, he did not only bring an
outward sound unto the eare, but wrought (as he did before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and as he doth now by the ministery of his word) an alteration
of the mind so farre as to the clearing of the understanding.</p>
                  <p>How then doth our Saviour perform his Propheticall office?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes, outwardly, and inwardly.</p>
                  <p>How inwardly?</p>
                  <p>By the teaching and operation of his holy Spirit, <hi>Ioh. 6. 45. Act.</hi> 16. 14.</p>
                  <p>How outwardly?</p>
                  <p>By opening the whole will of his Father, and confirming the same
with so many signes and wonders.</p>
                  <p>How did he this?</p>

<hi>Mat. 10. 40. Luk.</hi> 10. 16. from the beginning of the world to the end

                  <p>How doth it appeare that he hath opened the whole will of his Father
unto us?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Both by his own testimony,</hi> Joh. 15. 15. I call you no more servants,
because the servant knoweth not what his Master doth, but I call you friends,
because all which I have heard of my Father, I have made knowne unto you;
<hi>and by the Apostles comparison,</hi> Heb. 3. <hi>preferring him before</hi> Moses,
<hi>though faithfull in Gods house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In what respect is our Saviour preferred before Moses?</p>
                  <p>1. As the builder to the house, or one stone of the house.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Moses</hi> was only a servant in the house, our Saviour Master over the
house.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Moses</hi> was a witnesse only, and writer of things to be revealed, but
our Saviour was the end and finisher of those things.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence?</p>
                  <p>1. That it is a foul errour in them that think of our Saviour Christ
(so faithfull) hath not delivered all things pertaining to the necessary
instruction and government of the Church, but left them to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and inventions of men.</p>
                  <p>2. That sith our Saviour was so faithfull in his office, that he hath
concealed nothing that was committed to him to be declared; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the word should not suppresse in silence for feare or flattery
the things that are necessarily to be delivered, and that are in their
times to be revealed.</p>
                  <p>3. That we should rest abundantly contented with that Christ hath
taught, rejecting whatsoever else the boldnes of men would put upon
on us.</p>
                  <p>Did he first begin to be the Prophet, Doctor, or Apostle of his Church,
when he came into the world?</p>
                  <p>No, but when he opened first his Fathers will unto us by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of his servants the Prophets, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. &amp; 3. 19.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
                  <p>Is his Propheticall office the same now in the time of the Gospell, that
it was before and under the Law?</p>
                  <p>It is in substance one and the same, but it differeth in the manner and
measure of revelation: for the same doctrine was revealed by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Prophets before the Law, by word alone, after by word
written, and in the time of the Gospell more plainly and fully by the
Apostles and Evangelists.</p>
                  <p>What have we to gather hence, that Christ taught and teacheth by
the Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles?</p>

1. In what estimation we ought to have the books of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sith the same Spirit spake then that speaketh now, and the same
Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. We must carry our selves in the hearing of the word of God not
to harden our hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 8. 15. For as much as the carelesse and
fruitlesse hearing thereof, hardeneth men to further Judgement: for
it is a two-edged sword to strike to life, or to strike to death; it is
either the favour of life to life, or the savour of death to death; 2 <hi>Cor.
2.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>How doth the Apostle presse this? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. verse 8, 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, he aggravateth the refusall of this office of our Saviour against
the Israelites by the time, forty yeares; by the place, the wildernesse,
and by the multitude of his benefits; then he maketh an application
thereof, <hi>verse</hi> 12, 13. consisting of two parts.</p>
                  <p>1. A removing from evill.</p>
                  <p>2. A moving to good.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have we by the Propheticall office of our Saviour?</p>
                  <p>1. Hereby we are sure that he will lead us into all truth revealed in
his word, needfull for Gods glory, and our salvation.</p>
                  <p>2. We are in some sort partakers of the office of his prophecie by
the knowledge of his will: for he maketh all his to prophecie in their
measure, enabling them to teach themselves and their brethren, by
comforting, counselling, and exhorting one another privately to good
things, and withdrawing one another from evill as occasion serveth.
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>So much of the Propheticall office of our Saviour Christ,<note place="margin">Of the Kingly office of Christ.</note> what is his
Kingly office?</p>
                  <p>It is the exercise of that power given him by God over all, (<hi>Ps. 110.
1. Ezek.</hi> 34. 24.) and the possession of all (<hi>Mat. 28. 18. Psalm. 2. 8, &amp;c.</hi>)
for the spirituall government and salvation of his elect, (<hi>Esa. 9. 7. Luk.
1.</hi> 32, 33.) and for the destruction of his and their enemies; <hi>Psalm.

                  <p>For what reasons must Christ be a King?</p>
                  <p>1. That he might gather together all his Subjects into one body
of the Church out of the world.</p>
                  <p>2. That he might bountifully bestow upon them, and convey
unto them all the aforesaid meanes of salvation, guiding them unto
everlasting life by his Word and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>3. That he might appoint Lawes, and Statutes, which should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his people, and bind their consciences to the obedience of the
same.</p>
                  <p>4. That he might rule and governe them, and keep them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Lawes.</p>
                  <p>5. That he might appoint officers, and a setled government in his
Church, whereby it might be ordered.</p>
                  <p>6. That he might defend them from the violence and outrage of all
their enemies, both corporall and spirituall.</p>
                  <p>7. That he might bestow many notable priviledges, and rewards
upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:55421:96"/>
8. That he might execute his judgements upon the enemies of his
subjects.</p>
                  <p>How doth he shew himselfe to be a King?</p>
                  <p>By all that power which he did manifest as well in vanquishing
death and hell, as in gathering the people unto himselfe which he had
formerly ransomed, and in ruling them being gathered, as also in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
of them, and applying of those blessings unto them, which he
hath purchased for them.</p>
                  <p>How did he manifest that power?</p>
                  <p>First, in that being dead and buried he rose from the grave, quickned
his dead body, ascended into heaven, and now sitteth at the right hand
of his Father with full power and glory in heaven,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Act. 10. 30. Eph.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in governing of his Church in this world, (1 <hi>Cor. 15. 25, 26,
27,</hi> 28.) continually inspiring and directing his servants by the divine
power of his holy Spirit, according to his holy word, <hi>Esa.</hi> 9. 7. 30. 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 24. 31. 33, 34.</note> by his last judgement in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Why is Christ Jesus also called our Lord?</p>
                  <p>Because he is the Lord of glory and life that hath bought us, (1 <hi>Cor.
1.</hi> 2.) our head that must govern us; and our Soveraigne that subdues
all our enemies unto us, <hi>Act 3. 15. 1 Cor. 2. 8. 1 Pet. 1, 19. Eph. 1. 22.
Joshua 5. 14, 15. Dan. 12. 1. Heb.</hi> 1. 10. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>How hath he bought us?</p>
                  <p>Not with gold or silver, but with his precious blood he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
us to be a peculiar people to himself, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have you by this?</p>
                  <p>Seeing he hath paid such a price for us, he will not suffer us to perish.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from hence, that Christ is our head to govern us?</p>
                  <p>To obey his Commandements, and bear his rebukes and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Luk. 6. 46. John 14. 15. Col.</hi> 3. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>In what place of Scripture is the doctrine of Christs Kingdome spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
laid down?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In</hi> Esa. 9. vers. 6, 7. For unto us a child is born, and unto us a son is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the government is upon his shoulder, and he shall call his name Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
Counsellour, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of
Peace. The increase of his government and peace shall have none end, and he
shall sit upon the throne of <hi>David,</hi> and upon his Kingdome to order it and to
establish it with Judgement, and with Justice, from henceforth even for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
the zeale of the Lord of hosts will perform this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What are we here taught concerning Christs Kingdome?</p>
                  <p>The benefit that we receive by it, and the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>How is the former set forth?</p>
                  <p>By declaration, First, of his person, that he is a child born, namely
God made man, whereof hath been spoken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of his properties, with the effects of the same.</p>
                  <p>How are his properties here expressed?</p>
                  <p>They are first generally set forth by comparison of the unlikelihood
of his Kingdome, with the Regiments of worldly Potentates.</p>
                  <p>VVhat difference or inequality is there?</p>
                  <p>That whereas other Kings execute matters by their Lievtenants and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55421:96"/>
Deputies armed with their authority; In our Saviours Kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be used instruments, yet do they accomplish his will and
purpose, not only by his authority, but also by his strength and vertue.</p>
                  <p>VVhat further doctrine doe you note hence?</p>
                  <p>That the man of sin (or Pope of Rome) is not the ministeriall head
of the Church, which is Christs Kingdom, sith he is himselfe present,
yea, and that most notably by his Spirit, and more to the advantage of
his Church, then when he was bodily present, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7.</p>
                  <p>How are his properties set forth more particularly?</p>
                  <p>First, that he should be called Wonderfull, not that it should be his
proper name, which was only Jesus: But that he should be as renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
known to be Wonderfull, as men are known by their names.</p>
                  <p>How is he Wonderfull?</p>
                  <p>Partly in his person, as is before said, and partly in his works; namely,
First, in the creation of the world; Secondly, in the preservation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in the redemption of it.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the next that followeth?</p>
                  <p>It is shewed more particularly wherein he is Wonderfull, and first,
that he is Wonderfull in counsell, and The Counsellour.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is here to be observed?</p>
                  <p>First, in the government of a Kingdom, counsell and wisdom are the
chief; as that which is preferred to strength, <hi>Esa. 9. 15. 2 Sam. 20. 16.
Eccl. 7. 19. 9. 16. Prov.</hi> 21. 22. 24. 5. and therefore that we may assure
our selves, that in the Kingdom of Christ all things are done wisely,
nothing rashly, in which respect he is said to have a long stoal and a
white head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a great comfort for the children of God, that our Saviour
Christ is our Counsellour who giveth all sound advice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that when we are in any perplexity and know not which
way to turn, yet we may come to our Saviour Christ who is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us for a Counsellour.</p>
                  <p>By what means may we come to him for advice?</p>
                  <p>By our humble supplications and prayers to him.</p>
                  <p>How may we receive advice from him?</p>
                  <p>By the doctrine of God drawn out of his holy word, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
termed the man of our counsell, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 24.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the next property?</p>
                  <p>That he is wonderfull in might, and the strong God, having all sound
strength.</p>
                  <p>VVhat have we here to learn?</p>
                  <p>1. That as he is wise and doth all things pertaining to the good of
his Church, so he is of power to execute all that he adviseth wisely.</p>
                  <p>2. That as there is in us no advice of our selves, so there is in us no
sound strength to keep us from any evill, but that as he giveth good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his, so doth he with his own power perform and effect it. <hi>Phil. 2
13.</hi> And therefore although we be as the vine, of all other trees the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest,
or as the sheep, of all other beasts the simplest, yet we have for our
vine a gardner, and for our shepherd Christ Jesus the mighty strong
God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55421:97"/>
3. That we should take heed how we depart from his obedience,
for he will do what he listeth; for if to obey be a good means to help us
into the favour of our earthly Princes, it will much more help us in
the favour of the King of Kings.</p>
                  <p>VVhat other properties follow?</p>
                  <p>Two other, which are, as it were, the branches and effects of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
1. That he is the Father of eternities. 2. The Prince of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Sith he is called the Father of eternities, is there not a confusion of
persons?</p>
                  <p>In no wise, for it is a borrowed speech, signifying that he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of eternity.</p>
                  <p>VVhat doe you here gather?</p>
                  <p>That where other Kingdomes alter, his is everlasting, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44.</p>
                  <p>What doctrine is thereof to be gathered?</p>
                  <p>First, that the Kingdom of our Saviour Christ being perpetuall, he
dasheth &amp; crushes in peeces al other mighty Monarchies &amp; Regiments
that shall rise up against him; and therfore, that his Church &amp; subjects
generally, and every particular member need not to feare any power
whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that whatsoever we have by nature or industry, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany,
like unto the grasse that fadeth away; and whatsoever dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing we have, we have it from Christ.</p>
                  <p>What is the second property arising out of the former?</p>
                  <p>That he is the Prince of peace; that is, the procurer, cause and
ground of peace, that causeth his subjects to continue in peace and
quietnesse.</p>
                  <p>Of what nature is this peace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is spirituall,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. Eph. 2. 14, 15, 16, 17,</p>
                  <p>1. When we have peace with God.</p>
                  <p>2. When we have peace in our Consciences.</p>
                  <p>3. When there is peace between men and men, which ariseth
out of both the former.</p>
                  <p>Where should this peace be established?</p>
                  <p>Upon the throne of <hi>David:</hi> that is, in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>What is the cause of all this?</p>
                  <p>The love and zeal of God, breaking thorough all lets, either inward,
from our selves and our own sins; or outward, from the enmity of the
Devill and the world, <hi>Esa.</hi> 9. 7.</p>
                  <p>What fruit receive we by the Kingly office of our Saviour Christ?</p>
                  <p>By it all the treasures brought in by his Priestly and Propheticall
office, are dealt to us continually. For, from it all the means of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making effectuall unto us Christ and all his benefits doe come;
yea, without it all the actions of his other offices are to us void, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and of none effect.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have we by this?</p>
                  <p>Hereby we are assured, that by his Kingly power we shall finally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the flesh, the world, the devill, death and hell.</p>
                  <p>To whom will this blessed King communicate the means of salvation?</p>
                  <p>He offereth them to many, and they are sufficient to save all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55421:97"/>
but all shall not be saved thereby, because by faith they will not
receive them, <hi>Matth. 20. 16. Joh. 1. 11. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>Are not the Faithfull in some sort also made partakers of this honor of
his Kingdome?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily: For they are made Kings to rule and subdue their stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and rebellious affections, and to tread Satan under their feet, <hi>Rom.
6. 12. 16. 20. Rev.</hi> 1. 6. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of the two natures,<note place="margin">Of Christs Humiliation.</note> and three offices of our Saviour:
Shew now in what state did Christ God and man perform this
three-fold office.</p>
                  <p>In a two-fold estate: 1. Of abasement and humiliation, <hi>Phi.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>2. Of advancement and exaltation, <hi>Ph. 2. 9. Col. 2. 15. Eph.</hi> 1. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>In the former he abased himself by his sufferings for sin; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have heard largely in the declaration of his Priesthood:</p>
                  <p>In the latter he obtained a most glorious victory, and triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sin, thereby fulfilling his Priesthood, and making way to his
Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>What was his estate of Humiliation?</p>
                  <p>It was the base condition of a servant, whereto he humbled himself
from his Conception to his Crosse, and so untill the time of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Wherein did this base estate of the Son of God consist?</p>
                  <p>In his Conception, Gestation, and Birth, and in his Life diversly;
as in his Poverty, Hunger, Thirst, Wearinesse and other Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
even unto death, of which heretofore hath been spoken.</p>
                  <p>What learn you from this, that Christ first suffered many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could enter into his Glory? <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. 46.</p>
                  <p>That the way to reign with Christ, is first to suffer with him, and
such as bear the Crosse constantly, shall wear the Crown eternally,
<hi>Rom. 8. 17, 18. 2 Tim. 2. 12. 4. 8. James</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>What is his estate of Exaltation?<note place="margin">Of Christs Exaltation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>His glorious condition, <hi>Phil. 2. 9. Heb.</hi> 2. 9. beginning at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
of his Resurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24, 31, 36. and comprehending his
Ascension, <hi>Eph. 4. 8. Acts 2. 34. Heb.</hi> 9. 24, 25. Sitting at the right
hand of God his Father, <hi>Psal. 110. 1, 2, 5, 6. Mark 16. 9. 1 Pet. 3.
22.</hi> and the second comming in glory to judge the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31.</p>
                  <p>What is the first degree of this estate?</p>
                  <p>His glorious Resurrection;<note place="margin">Of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ.</note> for after he had in his manhood suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for us, he did in the third day rise again by his own power from the
dead, <hi>Eph. 1. 19. Luc. 24. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
                  <p>What it needfull that Christ being dead should rise again?</p>
                  <p>Yes; it was for his own glory and our good, <hi>Acts 2. 24. 1 Cor. 15.
21,</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>How for his glory?</p>
                  <p>That being formerly abased as a servant, and crucified as a sinner, he
might thus be declared to be the Son of God, and exalted to be a Prince
and a Saviour, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. Luc. 23. 33. <hi>Esay 53. 12. Rom. 1. 4. Act.</hi> 5. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>How for our good?</p>
                  <p>That having paid the price of our redemption by his death, we
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55421:98"/>
might have good assurance of our full Justification by his life, 1 <hi>Pet.
1. 19. Acts 20. 28. Rom. 4. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 17.</p>

                  <p>1. It assureth me that his righteousnesse shall be imputed unto me

                  <p>To whom doth God reveal and apply the Covenant of Grace?</p>
                  <p>Not to the world, but to his Church called out of the world, <hi>John

                  <p>How doth God deal with such Reprobates as are called?</p>

                  <p>Why is this Church called holy?</p>
                  <p>Because she hath washed her robes in the blood of the Lamb, and

hath all her spirituall life and feeling from Christ, who is only able
(and no creature beside) to quicken and give life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to be the Saviour of the body. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. But Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
only is the Saviour of the Church, whom by this title of the head

truly beleeve and yeeld obedience, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. all which are also sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
howbeit God useth outward meanes with the inward for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of his Saints, and calleth them as well to outward profession a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, as to inward fellowship with his Sonne, <hi>Act. 2. 42.
Cant.</hi> 1. 7. whereby the Church becommeth visible. Hence it commeth,
that so many as partaking the outward means, doe joyn with these in
league of visible profession, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13. are therefore in humane judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
accompted members of the true Church, and Saints by calling;
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. untill the Lord, who only knoweth who are his, doe make
known the contrary, as we are taught in the Parable of the tares, the
draw-net, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 24. 47. Thus many live in the Church as it is
visible and outward, which are partakers onely outwardly of grace;
and such are not fully of the Church that have entred in but one step,
<hi>Cant. 4. 7. Eph. 5. 27. 1 John</hi> 2. 19. That a man may be fully of the
Church, it is not sufficient, that he professe Christ with his mouth;
but it is further required, that he believe in him in heart; These doe
the one, but not the other; or if they believe in heart, they believe
not fully: For they may generally believe indeed that Christ is
the Saviour of mankind, but they know not whether themselves
have part in him; yea, by their works they disclaim any interest in
him.</p>
                  <p>VVhat say you then of such?</p>
                  <p>They are partakers of all good of the outward or imperfect Church,
and therefore their children also are baptized and admitted as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christs Church. These are like evill citizens (as indeed the
Church is Gods city) who are in truth but citizens in profession and
name only; For they as yet want the chiefest point, which onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a man to deserve the true name of a citizen; which is to use the
place aright. And therefore have no part in those rewards that are
proposed for good, and perfect citizens; though they enjoy what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
belongeth to the city.</p>
                  <p>Are we then to acknowledge one Church, or many?</p>
                  <p>One alone, as there is but one Lord, one Spirit, one Baptisme, one
Faith; <hi>Eph. 4. 4. Cant. 6. 8. Gal.</hi> 3. 28. Howsoever (as hath been said)
there is a begun, and a perfect Church; For the Church of God is one
in respect of that inward nature of it, having one Head, one Spirit,
and one finall state: But outwardly there be as many Churches, as
there be congregations of Believers knit together by speciall bond of
order, for the religious expressing of that inward nature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 11.
Yet, though there be many visible Churches, there is but one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Universall Church, of which not one shall be lost, and out of
which not one shall be saved. <hi>Acts 2. 47. Ephes. 5. 23. John 17.
12.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>VVhat gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That the Church of Rome is not the Catholick Church, because
it is particular, not universall; and because out of it many have been
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55421:101"/>
saved, and in it some shall be damned, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. 19. 20. 2 Th.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall prerogatives whereof all Gods children,<note place="margin">Prerogatives of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> the true
members of the Catholick Church, are made partakers? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>In the Creed there are some principall notes rehearsed.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Communion of Saints,</hi> Heb. 12. 22, 23. Eph. 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>2. The forgivenesse of sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The Resurrection of the body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52. Act. 24. 15.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Life everlasting,</hi> Rom 6. 23.</p>
                  <p>There are four also recorded by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in that golden sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who of God is made
unto us, Wisdom and Righteousnes, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p>VVhy is Wisdome here set down by the Apostle as necessary to our
salvation?</p>
                  <p>Because it was necessary that having absolutely lost all godly and
saving wisdom wherein we were first created, that it should be againe
repaired ere we could be partakers of life eternall.</p>
                  <p>Why? have we no true wisdome naturally able to bring us unto it?</p>
                  <p>No verily: for although we have wisdome naturally ingraffed in us
to provide for this present life, and sufficient to bring us to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the life to come; yet we have not one grain of saving wisdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to save us, or to make us step one foot forward unto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Where is this wisdom to be found?</p>
                  <p>In the word of God.</p>
                  <p>How come we to it?</p>
                  <p>By Christ; for God dwelleth in light which no man hath approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
unto, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. 16. only the Sonne which was in the bosome of
his Father he hath revealed him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>What doth the Apostle mean by Righteousnesse?</p>
                  <p>As by the chief part thereof, our whole justification, which consisteth
of the remission of our sins, and the imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
                  <p>How doe you prove this righteousnesse here, to be meant of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
that is in Christ?</p>
                  <p>Because he speaketh afterward of sanctification, which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
within us.</p>
                  <p>What is Sanctification?<note place="margin">VVhat Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is freedome from the tyranny of sin into the liberty of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
begun here, and increased dayly, untill it be fully perfected in the
life to come, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Psal.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is Redemption?<note place="margin">VVhat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the happy estate that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God shal have in the last day.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the ground of all these spirituall blessings?</p>
                  <p>The whole work of our salvation must be ascribed to the grace of
God alone.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is meant by the grace of God?</p>
                  <p>First and principally, that free favour with God doth bear towards us:</p>
                  <p>2. Those gifts and helps that are in us, arising from that fountain.</p>
                  <p>Is man idle in this work of grace?</p>
                  <p>Man also worketh with Gods grace, but first he receiveth from God
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55421:101"/>
not only the power to work, but also the will and the deed it selfe,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>Is this work of God only an offering of good things unto us?</p>
                  <p>God doth not only offer grace unto us, but causeth us effectually to
receive it, and therefore is said not only to draw us, <hi>Cant. 1. 3. Joh.</hi> 6. 44.
but also to create a new heart in us, whereby we follow him, <hi>Ps.</hi> 51. 10.</p>
                  <p>What profit hath every one of Gods elect in Christ the Mediatour,<note place="margin">Of our Vnion and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ.</note> by
the application of the covenant of grace?</p>
                  <p>Union and communion both with Christ himselfe and with his
whole Church, whence ariseth the communion of Saints, whereby
nothing else is understood, but that heavenly fellowship which all the
faithfull have with Christ their head, &amp; with the members of his body,
all true Christians, the whole Church thus communicating with
Christ and every member one with another, <hi>Heb. 3. 14. 12. 22. 23.
Eph. 2. 19, 20. 4. 12. 1 John</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>What are the bands of this fellowship, and who is the author of it?</p>
                  <p>The Spirit knits the body to the head by faith, and the members one
unto another by love. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 11. 27. Col. 3. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>What comfort have we by this?</p>
                  <p>1. That we are justified by that faith whereby <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>
were justified, which is tyed to no time or place, and excludeth no
person.</p>
                  <p>2. That we are made partakers of Christ and all his merits by faith,
and of all the blessings of the Church by love.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall comforts of this communion with Christ?</p>
                  <p>That wee are sure to have all graces and all good things from
him, and that both our persons are beloved, and our services accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in him and for him; <hi>John 1. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Eph. 2. 4, 5, 13.
1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>And what especiall comforts doe arise out of our communion with

                  <p>What duty doth this communion of Saints require of us? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                  <p>To renounce all fellowship with sin and sinners, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 17</hi> to edifie
one another in faith and love, <hi>Iude</hi> 5. 20. to delight in the society of the
Saints, <hi>Ps.</hi> 16. 3. and to <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why are all Beleevers called Saints?</p>
                  <p>Because they are partakers of Christs holinesse, dayly growing and
increasing in the same; and to let us know that none shall ever bee
Saints in heaven, but such as are first Saints on earth. <hi>Heb. 12. 10. 2 Pet.
1. 14. 2 Cor. 7. 1. 2 Thess.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>Forasmuch as the point of our union and communion with Christ, is of
great importance, and the very foundation of allour comfort, it is
more largely to be stood upon; First therefore shew how the elect are
united to Christ his person.</p>
                  <p>They are incorporated and made members of the mysticall body,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55421:102"/>
whereof Christ is head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. which the Scripture figureth, as by
other resemblances, so especially under the similitude of marriage, <hi>Eph.
5.</hi> 2. and the whole book of the <hi>Canticles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How may we conceive of this our marriage with Christ?</p>
                  <p>We are to conceive therein as in outward marriage, first, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of parents and parties, secondly, the manner of conjunction.</p>
                  <p>What consent of parents is there in this marriage?</p>
                  <p>Only Gods donation, who being the alone parent of both parties, as
in the marriage of the first <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. 22. giveth first Christ to
us as a Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. 17. 6. Secondly, us to Christ as a people
to be savedby him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>What consent of parties is there?</p>
                  <p>First, Christ consenteth to take us for his own spouse, which hee
witnesseth especially by taking our flesh upon him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. that he
might be our <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us; <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we being drawn of God, <hi>John</hi> 6. 44. and prepared by
the freeing of the Bridegroom, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. doe consent to take Christ
as our Lord and Husband, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 10. as we professe by taking his
name, <hi>Esa.</hi> 44. 5. and yoake, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29. upon us.</p>
                  <p>What is the manner of this our Conjunction?</p>
                  <p>Mysticall, that is to say, reall in respect of the things conjoyned, our
very nature, body, and soule, being coupled to the body and soule of
Christ, so that we are members of his body, of his flesh, of his bones;
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. thereby also to the divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Yet not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
but spirituall, in regard of the meanes whereby this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is wrought.</p>
                  <p>What be the meanes of the spirituall conjunction?</p>
                  <p>On Christs part, his only Spirit, 1 <hi>John 4. 15. Rom.</hi> 8. 9. given by
him to every member of his body in the very moment of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<hi>Gal. 4. 6. 1 John</hi> 3. 24. 4. 13. as the soule of spirituall life,
and fountaine of supernaturall grace, <hi>Gal. 5. 25. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 45. in
which respect he that is joyned to the Lord, is said to be one Spirit,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>What is the Spirit of Christ?</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghost truly residing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. and powerfully work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all those that are Christs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. derived unto them from
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. and knitting them inseparably unto him, 1 <hi>Cor. 12.
13. Eph.</hi> 2. 18. 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>Is the holy Ghost given to none but such as are thus joyned to Christ?</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghost is considered three wayes: first, as the Authour of
all excellence, even in common gifts of nature and reason; as strength
and courage, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14. 6. Arts and Sciences, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 31. Policy
and government, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 6. &amp;c. in which sense he is given to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which never heard of Christ. Secondly, as the Authour of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. so called, because being sanctified they are means
of edification; As the power of working Miracles, Healing, Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
&amp;c. yea a tast of the heavenly gift, and of the good word of
God, and of the powers of the world to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. in which
sense he is given to sundry reprobates that are called, as hath been
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55421:102"/>
shewed. Thirdly, as the Authour of the perpetuall, effectuall, and
virtuall influence of saving grace from Christ the head to every true
member of his body, <hi>John</hi> 6. 51. 57. 63. in which sense the world
cannot receive or know him, <hi>John</hi> 14. 17. but he is bestowed on the
elect only, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and those truly regenerated and converted to
the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But on our part what meanes is there of this conjunction?</p>
                  <p>Onely faith, which yet is not of our selves, but the gift of God; <hi>Eph.
2.</hi> 8. and of all other, the first and more generall effect and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Spirit of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13. Gal.</hi> 5. 5. disposing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
us so to embrace and cleave unto him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. 17. as first

Secondly, to returne to God in him all holy and thankfull obedience,
<hi>Cor. 2. 7. Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>Is faith absolutely required in every one that is united unto Christ?</p>
                  <p>It is absolutely required of all those that are of discretion and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
but in those that are not capable of knowledge (without which
there can be no faith; as some naturally fooles and infants, which are
within the covenant) we are not to proceed farther then Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the secret operation of his Spirit, <hi>Act. 2. 39. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 14. 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>So much of our union with Christs person: what is our communion

                  </p>
                  <p>Justification and glorification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. By the one whereof we

<note place="margin">Glorification.</note> By the other, our nature reformed, and new obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused:
which latter is but begun in this life, and is called Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and perfected in the life to come; which most usually hath the
terme of Glorification, of which in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is Justification?<note place="margin">Of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and first what Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Justification is the sentence of God, whereby he of his grace for
the righteousnesse of his Son, by him imputed unto us, and through
faith apprehended by us, doth free us from sin and death, and account
us righteous unto life. <hi>Rom. 8. 30. 33, 34. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. For
hereby we both have a deliverance from the guilt and punishment of
all our sins, and being accompted righteous in the sight of God by the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55421:103"/>
righteousnesse of our Saviour Christ imputed unto us, are restored to a
better righteousnesse then ever we had in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I perceive your Answer needs further explaining; first, why call you
Justification a sentence?</p>
                  <p>That thereby we may be informed, that the word to justify doth not
in this place signify to make just by infusing a perfect righteousnes into
our natures; (that comes under the head of sanctification begun here in
this life, which being finished, is Glorification in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but here the
word signifieth to pronounce just, to quit and discharge from guilt and
punishment; and so it is a judiciall sentence opposed to condemnation.
<hi>Rom. 8. 34, 35. Who shall lay any thing</hi> (saith Paul) <hi>to the charge of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect?
It is God that justifieth, who shall condemn?</hi> Now as to condemn is
not the putting any evill into the nature of the party condemned, but
the pronouncing of his person guilty, and the binding him over unto
punishment: so justifying is the Judges pronouncing the Law to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and the man discharged and quitted from guilt and judgement.
Thus God imputing the righteousnesse of Christ to a sinner, doth not
account his sins unto him, but interests him in a state of as full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
freedom and acceptance, as if he had never sinned, or had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
fully satisfied. For though there is a power purging the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sin, which followeth upon justification, yet it is carefully to be
distinguished from it, as we shall further shew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This for the name of Justification, but now for the thing it selfe; what
is the matter first of our justification?</p>
                  <p>The matter of justification, or that righteousnesse whereby a sinner
stands justified in Gods sight, is not any righteousnesse inherent in his
own person and performed by him, but a perfect righteousnesse inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in Christ and performed for him.</p>
                  <p>What righteousnesse of Christ is it whereby a sinner is justified?</p>
                  <p>Not the essentiall righteousnesse of his divine nature, but,</p>
                  <p>First, the absolute integrity of our humane nature, which in him our
head was <hi>without guile. Heb.</hi> 7. 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the perfect obedience which in that humane nature of ours
he performed unto the whole law of God, both by doing whatsoever
was required of us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. and by suffering whatsoever was deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by our sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. for he was made sin and a curse for us, that
we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him.</p>
                  <p>What is the forme or being cause of our justification, and that which
makes this righteousnesse so really ours, that it doth justifie us?</p>
                  <p>The gracious imputation of God the Father, accounting his Sons
righteousnesse unto the sinner, and by that accounting, making it his to
all effects, as if he himselfe had performed it.</p>
                  <p>But how can Christs righteousnesse be accompted ours? is it not as
absurd to say that we are justified by Christs righteousnesse, as
that a man should be wise with the wisdom of another, or live and
be in health by the life and health of another?</p>
                  <p>No doubtlesse, because this righteousnesse is in Christ, not as in a
person severed from us, but as in the head of the Church, the second
<hi>Adam;</hi> from whom therefore it is communicated unto all who being
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55421:103"/>
united as members unto him doe lay claim thereunto, and apply it
unto themselves, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. Rom.</hi> 10. 4. For if the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> were of
force to condemn us all, because we were in his loynes, he being
the head of our common nature; why then should it seem strange that
the righteousnesse of our Saviour Christ both God and man, should
be availeable to justifie those that are interessed in him, especially
considering that we have a more strict conjunction in the Spirit with
him, then ever we had in nature with <hi>Adam?</hi> And though it be not
fit to measure heavenly things by the yard of reason, yet it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
that a man owing a thousand pound, and not being able to
pay it, his creditor may be satisfied by one of his friends.</p>
                  <p>If Christ have paid our debt, how are we then freely justified by
grace?</p>
                  <p>It is of grace that Christ is given unto us, and also that his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
apprehended by faith is accounted ours; It is true that the
justification of a sinner, considering the case as it is between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Christ, no man dare call it free; no, the price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was the deepest purchase that the world ever heard of; but what
ever it cost Christ, it cost us nothing: and so to us it is freely of grace
from Christ, yea and to us it is freely grace from God the Father too;
not because he acquits us without a full satisfaction to his Justice, or
accepts that for perfect righteousnesse which is not perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
but because he receives full satisfaction from the hands of a surety,
and that surety being his own Son; when as he might have challenged
the uttermost farthing at our hands, which were the principals; and
then there had been no possibility for us to have been delivered.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from this doctrine of Justification by Christs
righteousnesse?<note place="margin">Vses arising from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. To condemn the proud opinion of Papists, who seek Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by their owne workes and righteousnesse inherent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whereas though being accepted, we must in thankfulnesse
doe all we can for God, yet when all is done, we must acknowledge our
selves unprofitable servants: the onely matter of our joy and triumph
both in life and death, must be the imputation of Christs righteousnes;
not our persons, nor the best actions of the holiest men dare appeare in
Gods presence, but in his name and merit (who consecrates all) the
Lords Jesus.</p>
                  <p>2. We may here take notice, that there is no comfort to a Christian
soule like that which floweth from this Well of salvation, this sweet
doctrine of Justification. 1. Here we have assurance of the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of our Redemption: that soule must be throughly acquited that is
stated in such a righteousnesse, that debt must be fully discharged that
hath such a price laid down for it; our sinnes though never so great,
cannot weigh down his righteousnesse and merit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. and God
having accepted his Sons righteousnes for us, will not hold us any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
trespassers, but he disables his own Justice from making any further
demand. 2. Hence there is nothing comes upon the Saints from Gods
revenging Justice, but all our corrections are medicinall from Gods
Fatherly love; to purge out that sin out of our nature, which he hath
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55421:104"/>
already pardoned to our persons. 3. Lastly, this doctrine may be
great comfort to weak Christians in the midst of their troublesome
imperfections, and sense of their weak measures of Sanctification;
To consider that the righteousnesse that is inherent in themselves, is
not the matter of their Justification, or that which must appear before
Gods presence to be pleaded: the righteousnesse of Christ is compleat
and perfect; that is our main joy and crown of rejoycing to be found
in Christ, not having our own righteousnesse, but that which is in
him, and made ours by Gods gracious account.</p>
                  <p>But how is this great benefit of Justification applyed unto us, and
apprehended by us?</p>
                  <p>This is done on our part by faith alone,<note place="margin">Of Faith.</note> and that not considered as
a vertue inherent in us, working by love; but only as an instrument or
hand of the soule stretched forth to lay hold on the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. &amp; 10 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. So that faith justifieth onely
Relatively, in respect of the object which it fasteneth on; to wit, the
righteousnesse of Christ by which we are justified: Faith being onely
the instrument to convey so great a benefit unto the soule, as the hand
of the begger receives the Almes.</p>
                  <p>Forasmuch as it standeth us much in hand to know what this faith
is,<note place="margin">The various acceptions of Faith.</note> whereby we have profit by Christs Redemption, declare how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes the word Faith is taken in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is taken for true and faithfull dealing between man
and man both in word and deed, called Fidelity or Faithfulnesse, (as
<hi>Mat. 23. 23. Acts 2. 10. 1 Tim. 5. 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 12.) but of that faith
we are not here to speak. Sometimes it is taken for the faith (or fidelity)
of God towards man, but that also is besides our purpose.</p>
                  <p>Here we are to intreat of mans faith towards God, and that word
Faith is also taken two wayes.</p>
                  <p>1. For the object to be apprehended, or things to be beleeved, even
the whole doctrine of faith, or points of Religion to be beleeved.
(as <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 7. &amp; 13. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. &amp; 3. 31. &amp; 12. 3. 6. &amp; 16. 26. <hi>Gal. 1.
22.</hi> &amp; 3. 2. &amp; 5. 23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 4. 1. <hi>Jude vers.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>2. For the action apprehending or beleeving the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that
work of God in man whereby he giveth assent or credence to God in
his word; yea, and applyeth that which any way concerneth him in
particular, how otherwise generall soever it be, (as <hi>Rom. 10. 7. &amp;c.</hi>)
And this faith is set out by two names, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. The substance of
things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen; by the first
meaning, that whereas God in his word hath made promise of things
which are not presently enjoyed, but onely hoped for; they being not
in <hi>esse,</hi> but in <hi>posse:</hi> yet faith doth after a sort give them a present sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
or being, as if they were in <hi>esse.</hi> By the second meaning, that
whereas many of the promises are of things so farre out of the reach
of man, that they are both invisible to the eye, and unreasonable or
impossible to the sense or understanding of man; yet faith is the very
evidence of them, and that which doth so demonstrate them unto
us, that by it (as through a prospective glasse) we as clearly discern
them, as if they were even at hand.</p>
                  <p>

How many kinds of faith be there?<note place="margin">The divers kinds of Faith.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although there be but one true saving faith, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5.) yet of faith
there are two sorts.</p>
                  <p>1. Such as is common to all, which all men have, or may have.</p>
                  <p>2. That which no man hath or can have but the elect, it being
proper to them. 2 <hi>Thess. 3. 2. Rom. 11. 32. Tit. 1. 1. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
                  <p>How many sorts be there of the common faith?</p>
                  <p>Two; ordinary and extraordinary: and of the ordinary two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that which we call historicall, and that wee call temporarie
faith.</p>
                  <p>What is an historicall faith?<note place="margin">Historicall Faith.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a knowledge and perswasion of the truth of Gods word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the letter and story of it: as that there is one onely God, and
in the God a Trinity in Unity; that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the
world, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What is a temporary faith?<note place="margin">Temporary Faith.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a joyfull entertaining of the promises of the Gospell with
some seeming confidence, which yet is but vanishing, uncertain, and
not rooted; lasteth but for a time, and then comes to nothing. <hi>Mat.
13. 20, 21. Luk.</hi> 18. 3, 14.</p>
                  <p>What is that common faith which you call extraordinary?<note place="margin">Miraculous Faith.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the faith of miracles, which is the cleaving to some speciall
and singular promise; either for the doing of some extraordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or for the receiving of some outward good, after an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner. 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 2. Mat.</hi> 21. 2. &amp; 7. 22. <hi>Mark. 9. 3. Acts 14. 9.
Luk.</hi> 17. 19.</p>
                  <p>By this kind of faith, <hi>Judas</hi> might work miracles as well as
the other Disciples; and by this Faith, many might bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by our Saviour in their bodies, who were not healed in their
soules.</p>
                  <p>What now is true saving faith,<note place="margin">Justifying Faith.</note> which none have but the elect, it
being proper to them?</p>
                  <p>It is such a firme assent of the mind to the truth of the word,
as flowes into the heart, and causeth the soule to embrace it as good,
and to build its eternall happinesse on it.</p>
                  <p>What is that which you make the object of saving Faith?</p>
                  <p>The generall object of true saving Faith, is the whole truth
of God revealed; but the speciall object of Faith as it justifieth,
is the promise of remission of sinnes by the Lord Jesus: For as
the Israelites, by the same eyes by which they looked upon the
brasen Serpent, they saw other things; but they were not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by looking upon any thing else, but onely the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
So, though by the same Faith whereby I cleave to Christ
for remission of sinnes, I beleeve every truth revealed; yet I am
not justified by beleeving any truth but the promise of grace in
the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Open the nature of this saving and justifying Faith, somewhat
more fully.</p>
                  <p>Justifying Faith may bee considered two wayes, either as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55421:105"/>
God works it in mans heart, or else as mans heart works by it
towards God againe.</p>
                  <p>For first God enables man to beleeve, and then he beleeves by
Gods enabling.</p>
                  <p>In the first respect, Faith is said to be Gods gift. <hi>Eph. 2. 8. Phil. 1.
29.</hi> And it is the greatnesse of Gods power, that raiseth mans heart
unto it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>In the second respect man is said to beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. and to
come to Christ. But he beleeves by Gods enabling him to beleeve,
and he comes by Gods causing him to come, <hi>Joh. 6. 44. No man can
come unto me except the Father draw him,</hi> saith our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>What doth God work in man when he gives him Faith?</p>
                  <p>First, hee enlighteneth the understanding to see the truth and
preciousnesse of the rich offers of grace in the Lord Jesus. 1. <hi>Cor.
2. 11, 12. 14. John 1. 5. John 12. 39. John 6. 45. Matth. 16. 17.
Acts</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he enables the will to embrace them, and reach all the
desires of the soule after them, and rest and build eternall comfort
on them. The things of God as they are foolishnesse to mans naturall
Judgement; so they are enmity to his naturall will. And therefore
when God gives faith, he gives a new light to the understanding,
and new motions and inclinations to the heart. As the Covenant
of Grace is, <hi>I will give them a new heart, Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. It must be a
mighty power to turne the heart of man upside downe, and cause him
to pitch all the desires of the soule upon a supernaturall object.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44.</p>
                  <p>What gather we from hence?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The Popish implicite faith confuted.</note> the monstrous wickednesse of the Popish Doctors, who
perswade the multitude to rest in a blind faith, which they call im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
and folded up, telling them that it is enough for them to
beleeve as the Church beleeves, though they know not what the
Church beleeves, nor who the Church is, whereas the Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us that Faith comes by hearing; that is, by hearing the blessed
promises of grace offered to the people: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. 17.</p>
                  <p>Faith doth not consist in darknesse and ignorance, but knowledge
is of the ingredience of it, <hi>John</hi> 12. 39. and therefore sometimes put
for it. <hi>John 17. 3. Esa.</hi> 53. 11. Where God doth work Faith, there
he gives a saving light to the understanding, though in divers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and degrees; as there are weak measures of Faith, so weak
measures of knowledge and apprehensions in saving mysteries: But no
man can build upon Gods gracious word and promise for the truth and
reality of what he speaks, without he know what he speaks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">That the whole soule is the seat of Faith.</note> we may here learne that Faith doth not consist one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the understanding, or onely in the will, but in the whole
soule; the whole intelligent nature is the seat of Faith: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either Faith is not a supernaturall gift of God, or else they speak
ungraciously of Gods grace in the work of Faith, who attribute no
more to God then the renovation of mans understanding, and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
those things to him, which by nature he could not see; leaving the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55421:105"/>
action of consenting and embracing by faith the things revealed to
mans free-will, so sharing the businesse of beleeving between God
and man; the enlightning of the understanding shall be Gods, but
the inclining the will must be a mans own, any further then it may
be invited by morall perswasion. But the Scripture every where shews
faith to be such a transcendent and supernaturall gift, as far exceeds
all naturall power to produce or reach unto; God doth all in this high
businesse by his powerfull Spirit and supernaturall grace.</p>
                  <p>But how then is it said, that man beleeveth, man receiveth Christ,
man comes unto him?</p>
                  <p>These phrases and the like shew what man doth when faith is
wrought in him, how his soul acts by it, and exerciseth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
habit received. And it is thus: 1. By Gods teaching him
he understands; by Gods enlightning his mind he sees the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Lord Jesus, and firmely assents unto the word of grace as
true; that indeed Christ is the only blessed Saviour, and that all the
promises of God in him are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen.</hi> 2. By Gods changing
and enabling his will he wils; by Gods sanctifying his affections he
loves and embraceth; by Gods printing and sealing them on his
heart he possesseth and closeth with Christ, and the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of mercy in him, and embraceth the tenure of the Gospel as
the sweetest and happiest tidings that ever sounded in his eares, and
entertains it with the best welcomes of his dearest heart, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
his eternall happinesse on this Rock of salvation.</p>
                  <p>Put now all these things together.</p>
                  <p>They all shew that faith is nothing else but a supernaturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and worke of God in man, whereby mans heart, (that is)
all the powers of mans soule move as they are first moved by God:
So that the action of man in beleeving, is nothing but his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of heavenly things by Gods revealing them and causing him
to know them; his willing them and embracing them by Gods ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
him to will and embrace them: Thus the motion of mans
heart to Christ being moved by God is called mans beleeving
with the heart: even as a wheel which of it self cannot move, yet
being moved by a higher wheel doth move; which motion though
it be but one, yet is said to be the motion of two, that is, of the
Mover and of the thing moved.</p>
                  <p>It seemes then that justifying faith consists in these two things;
<hi>viz.</hi> in having a mind to know Christ, and a will to rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
                  <p>Yes; whosoever sees so much excellency in Christ that thereby
he is drawn to embrace him as the onely Rock of salvation, that
man truly beleeves to Justification.</p>
                  <p>But is it not necessary to Justification to be assured that my sinnes
are pardoned, and that I am justified?</p>
                  <p>No, that is no act of faith as it justifieth, but an effect and fruit that
followeth after Justification: for no man is justified by beleeving
that he is justified, for he must be justified before he can beleeve it: and
no man is pardoned by beleeving that he is pardoned, for he must be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55421:106"/>
pardoned before he can beleeve it. But faith as it justifieth, is a resting
upon Christ to obtain pardon, the acknowledging him to be the only
Saviour, and the hanging upon him for salvation, <hi>Mat. 16. 16. John
20. 31. Acts 8. 37. Rom. 10. 9. 1 John 4. 15. &amp;</hi> 5. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>It is the direct act of faith that justifieth, that whereby I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
it is the reflect act of faith that assures, that whereby I know I
doe beleeve, and it comes by way of argumentation thus,</p>
                  <p>Maj. Whosoever relyeth upon Christ the Saviour of the world for Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and pardon, the word of God saith, that he by so doing is
actually justified and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Min. But I doe truly relie upon Christ for Justification and pardon.
Concl. Therefore I undoubtedly beleeve that I am justified and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>But many times both the former propositions may be granted to be
true, and yet a weak Christian want strength to draw the conclusion;
for it is one thing to beleeve, and another thing to beleeve that I doe
beleeve: It is one thing for a man to have his salvation certain, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing to be certain that it is certain.</p>
                  <p>How then doth the soul reach after Christ in the act of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying?</p>
                  <p>Even as a man fallen into a river and like to be drowned, as he is
carried down with the floud espies the bough of a tree hanging over
the river, which he catcheth at and clinges unto with all his might to
save him, and seeing no other way of succour but that, ventures his
life upon it: this man so soon as he had fastned upon this bough is in
a safe condition, though all troubles, fears &amp; terrours are not presently
out of his mind, untill he comes to himself and sees himself quite out
of danger, then he is sure he is safe, but he was safe before he was sure.
Even so it is with a Beleever; Faith is but the espying of Christ as the
only means to save, and the reaching out of the heart to lay hold upon
him. God hath spoke the word and made the promise in his Son, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
him to be the only Saviour, and remit my soul to him to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his mediation: So soon as the soul can doe this, God imputeth
the righteousnesse of his Son unto it, and it is actually justified in the
Court of Heaven, though it is not presently quieted and pacified in the
Court of Conscience: that is done afterwards, in some sooner, in some
later, by the fruits and effects of Justification.</p>
                  <p>What are the Concomitants of Justification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reconciliation, and Adoption,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. Joh. 1. 12.</p>

                  <p>Adoption is the power and priviledge to be the sons of God, <hi>Joh.
1. 12. Eph.</hi> 1. 5. derived unto us from Christ, who being the eternal Son

What are the benefits that flow to us from our Adoption?</p>
                  <p>1. Some are privative immunities,<note place="margin">The benefits of Adoption.</note> and freedome from many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;
as 1. We are freed from the slavery of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. 2 From
condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. 3 From all slavish fears and terrors, <hi>Rom. 8. 15.
We have not received the spirit of bondage to fear again, but the spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
4 From the law, not Ceremoniall only, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. but Moral; freed
I mean from the curse of it, freed from the condemning power of it,
freed from the coaction and compulsion of it, freed from the rigorous
exaction &amp; inexorable demands of it, as it is a Covenant of works: But
not freed from the doctrine of holinesse contained in it; the justified
and adopted are every way freed from the Law, as it was an enemy and
against us, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. but not freed as it is our guide and director, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the rule of Gods holy will. Our Sonship doth not free us from
service, but from slavery, not from holinesse, but to holinesse: There is
a free service which benefits the condition of a son, Gods service is
perfect freedome.</p>
                  <p>2. Some are positive dignities; as, 1. Free accesse to the throne of
Grace, that we may come to God in prayer as to a Father. <hi>Gal. 4. 6.

which we forfeited in <hi>Adam;</hi> for no man hath any true right to any
thing now by nature; he may have the use of Gods creatures by Gods
patience &amp; forbearance, but not by Gods licence and allowance, untill
he be in Covenant with God in Christ, and made a son and heir with
him, and then all things are restored, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 21. Rom.</hi> 8. 32. 4 From
Adoption flows all Christians joy, which is called the joy in the holy

So much of the first main benefit which Christians receive by their
communion with Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> Justification.</p>
                  <p>Now what is the second benefit which is called Glorification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification?</p>
                  <p>It is the renewing of our nature according to the Image of God,<note place="margin">Sanctification.</note> in
righteousnesse and true holinesse, which is but begun in this life, and
is called Sanctification, and perfected in the life to come, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is most strictly called Glory.</p>
                  <p>How far forth is our nature renewed in this life by Sanctification?</p>
                  <p>This renewing is of our whole nature, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 23. Rom.</hi> 12. 2. the
understanding being enlightned, the will rectified, the affections regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
the outward man reformed. But not wholly in this life; and this
is done by the powerfull operation of the Spirit of God, who having
begun a good work in us, will perfect it unto the day of the Lord, <hi>Joh.
13. 6. Psal. 51. 10. Ezek.</hi> 36. 26.</p>
                  <p>What be the parts of our Sanctification?</p>
                  <p>Two, answerable to the two powerfull meanes whereby they are
wrought; First, Mortification, or dying unto sin, and thereby free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from the dominion thereof by the death of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Vivification, or quickning unto newnesse of life, by the
power of the resurrection of Christ; In regard whereof it is also called
our first resurrection, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6.</p>
                  <p>How doth Sanctification differ from the former grace of Justification?</p>
                  <p>In many main and materiall differences;<note place="margin">The differences between Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification.</note> as,</p>
                  <p>1. In the order, not of time, wherein they goe together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.
nor of knowledge and apprehension, wherein this latter hath prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. but of nature, wherein the former is the ground
of this latter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the Subject: the righteousnesse whereby we are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
being inherent in Christ for us; but this of Sanctification in our
selves from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the cause: our Justification following from the merit;
our Sanctification from the efficacy of the death and life of Christ.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19. 2. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the Instrument; Faith, which in Justification is only
as an hand receiving, in Sanctification is a co-working vertue, <hi>Acts
15. 19. Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, in the measure; Justification being in all Beleevers, and at
all times alike;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> but Sanctification wrought differently and by degrees.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, in the end; which being in both eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23, 24.
yet the one is among the causes of reigning, the other onely as the
high-way unto the kingdome.</p>
                  <p>What is the rule and square of our Sanctification?</p>
                  <p>The whole word of God, <hi>Joh. 17. 17. Ps.</hi> 119. 9. as containing that
will of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. which is even our Sanctification, 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 3, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How doe you prove that Gods word is such a rule?</p>
                  <p>1. By expresse warrant of Scripture, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 17.</p>
                  <p>2. By the resemblances and things whereunto it is compared, as to

                  <p>3. Because they only are commended for a holy and righteous life,

<hi>Isa. 8. 19, 20. Mat.</hi> 22. 29.</p>
                  <p>4. Because nothing can be counted holy and righteous which God
doth not so accompt, and that in his Word, so as he only is righteous,
and maketh this or that to be holy and righteous. So his Word only

                  <p>2. Of the end; The Law requiring all duties, as for the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our own salvation: The Gospel in way of thankfulnesse, for
salvation in Christ already bestowed, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p>3. Of the effect; the Law (like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that required brick, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no straw) demanding obedience, but vouchsafing no assistance; (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
man as in the state of Creation) The Gospel both offering and
conferring to the regenerate that which it requireth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. 8.
for it both requireth and confirmeth faith unto the Elect, and that not
only as a hand to lay hold on Christ, but also as a chief vertue working
by love in all parts of obedience; without which even the Gospel is
a Law, that is, a killing letter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. to the unregenerate, and with
which the Law becommeth as it were Gospel to the regenerate, even
a law of liberty, <hi>Jam. 1. 25. &amp;</hi> 2. 12. For as the Law saveth us not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Gospel, so the Gospel saveth us not without the Law.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the Gospel add other Precepts or Counsels to those of the Law?</p>
                  <p>Not any other in substance of action, but only reneweth and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
those of the Law, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 7, 8. and specifieth some duties, as of
faith in the Messias, of the Sacraments, &amp;c. which have their generall
ground from the Law. As for those that are propounded in form of

                  <p>The Morall law,<note place="margin">The Morall law the rule of Sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> or law of nature engraven by God himself first in the

                  <p>Why did God write that law in Tables of stone?</p>

Partly to signifie the perpetuall use and continuance of them to the
end of the world: Partly to shew the stony hardnesse of our hearts, in
which this law was to be written, and to declare how hard it is to bring
us to obedience of them.</p>
                  <p>VVhy did none but God write this Law in Tables of stone?</p>
                  <p>Because none but God can write his Law in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>How was this Law delivered?</p>
                  <p>To shew the gloriousnesse of it God delivered it in fire, for the
Mountain burned, the Trumpet sounded, the people fled, and <hi>Moses</hi>
himself trembled.</p>
                  <p>What did this signifie to them, and teach us?</p>
                  <p>1. That without Christ the Law is but death.</p>
                  <p>2. That we should be very careful to perform obedience to the same.</p>
                  <p>Did God give no other law but the Morall law onely?</p>
                  <p>Yes, he added the Ceremoniall and Judiciall laws, as speciall expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and applications of the law Morall, unto that present Church
and people the Israelites.</p>
                  <p>What was the Ceremoniall law?</p>

                  <p>Are we bound to keep and observe those laws?</p>
                  <p>No, for the substance being now exhibited, those shadows are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

To what end serveth the Law?<note place="margin">The end and use of the Law.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it is a Glasse, to discover our filthinesse, and to shew us our
sinnes, and the punishment thereof, that thereby we may be driven
unto Christ, to be purged by him, (<hi>Gal. 3. 24. Rom.</hi> 3. 20. 27.) For
it layeth open all the parts of our misery, both sinfulnesse, accursednesse,
and impotency, or unablenesse to relieve our selves; so whipping us,
and chasing us to Christ, that in him we may finde deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when we are come to Christ, and feele our selves saved
by him, it is a guide to direct us in the way we have to walke in all our
life after, <hi>Matth. 5. 17. Luke 1. 6. Deut.</hi> 6. 6. For after the Law hath
brought us to Christ, the feeling of the love of God within us, maketh
us to strive towards the obedience of it, and then it is a rule to direct us
how to behave our selves in all things that we doe, teaching us how we
are to live, in such sort as whosoever walketh not accordingly, cannot
be saved.</p>
                  <p>What further use hath the Law in the Regenerate?</p>
                  <p>First, as a light it directeth us, for the world being a darke wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and we being naturally blinde, are in continuall danger of falling,
unlesse our steps be guided by the Lampe of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as a prick it inciteth us to obedience, because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it frameth us to humility whilst by it wee understand that
we are farre from fulfilling it.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>First, what great reason there is, that we should be well acquainted
with the Law of God, seeing it is of so great use.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that every one should have a warrant of all his doings
out of this Law of God; whereby all the creatures are sanctified for
mans use.</p>
                  <p>What is the contrary vice?</p>
                  <p>Ignorance; whereof Christ saith, that the blinde fall into the ditch.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 14.</p>
                  <p>So much of the use of the Law: What is required for our profiting
therein?</p>
                  <p>In the first place it is required, that we have the right understanding
of the Law, without which it is impossible to reap any of the former
fruits;<note place="margin">1. Knowledge of the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> for how can a man acknowledge the breach of that Law, which

man. <hi>Rom. 7. 14. Deut. 6. 5. Matth. 22. 37. Mark 12. 30.

                  </p>
                  <p>How doth the Law shape all the powers of the soule?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:55421:109"/>
It shapeth the understanding to know every duty, even all the will
of God: It chargeth the judgement to discerne between good and
evill; and between two good things which is the better: It chargeth
the memory to retain: It chargeth the will to chuse the better, and
to leave the worse: It chargeth the affections to love things to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and to hate things to be hated.</p>
                  <p>Doth the Law require these alike of all?</p>
                  <p>No; but according to the Sex, growth in age, and difference of
calling; as more of a man than of a woman; of a young man than of
a childe; of a publike person, than of a private man.</p>
                  <p>What is the second Rule?</p>
                  <p>That the Law is perfect.<note place="margin">2. Rule: That the Law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7. Not onely binding the soule;
but also the whole soule, the severall functions of her faculties, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
as the understanding to know the will of God perfectly; the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to discerne perfectly betwixt good and evill; the memory to retain,
and remember all perfectly; the will to chuse the good, and leave the
evill perfectly; the affections to love the one, and hate the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.
So in condemning evill, it condemneth all evill: and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
good, it commandeth all good, charging man to practise the
good, and refuse the evill perfectly; and that not only as it was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; but also according to the severall times, before,
in, and after the Law.</p>
                  <p>What is the third?</p>
                  <p>That in every Commandement there is a borrowed Speech,<note place="margin">3. Rule: In every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement there is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche.</note> whereby
more is commanded or forbidden than is named.</p>
                  <p>What speciall Rules are comprehended under this third?</p>
                  <p>These three following.</p>
                  <p>1. Whatsoever the Law commandeth,<note place="margin">1. Branch of the third Rule.</note> it forbiddeth the contrary;
and whatsoever it forbiddeth, it commandeth the contrary. <hi>Matth. 5.
21,</hi> 23, 24, 25. So where any duty is enjoyned as in the affirmative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
there we must understand the contrary sinne to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
<hi>Matth. 4. 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 34. And where any sinne is forbidden, as in
the negative, there must we know the contrary duty is required. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28.</p>
                  <p>2. Whatsoever the Law commandeth or forbiddeth in one kinde,
it commandeth or forbiddeth all of the same kinde,<note place="margin">2. Branch.</note> and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
thereof: for under the kinde, manifest, and plaine, are understood
all things of like sort, and under one maine duty, or crime expressed
all degrees of good or evill in the same kinde are either commanded, or
forbidden. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 21, 22, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Branch.</note> whatsoever the Law commandeth or forbiddeth, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
or forbiddeth the causes thereof, and all meanes whereby that
thing is done, or brought to passe: So that with the thing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or the duty enjoyned, all occasions, and provocations, or furtheran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereto, are consequently condemned, or required. 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 22. Heb.
10. 24, 25. Matth. 5. 27</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>Besides the true knowledge, what is further required for a profitable
course in the Law.</p>
                  <p>First, remembrance, without which our knowledge is nothing, as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55421:109"/>
that which is powred into a riven Vessell. And therefore in the fourth
Commandement, God using this word <hi>Remember,</hi> teacheth us how
deeply negligence and forgetfulnesse, (although not alike) in all, are
condemned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, judgement to take heed, that we doe nothing rashly and
suddenly, but ever to examine our wayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the will and affections must be formed to an obedience of
the Commandements: whereto also it may helpe to consider, that God
propoundeth the ten Commandements in the second person of the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number, saying, <hi>Thou shalt not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why are the Commandements uttered in this sort; rather than by yee,
or no man, or every man? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Why the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person.</note> because God being without partiality, speaketh to all men alike;
as well the rich as poore, high as low.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because no man should put the Commandements of God
from himselfe, as though they did not concerne him: but every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
man should apply them to himselfe, as well as if God had spoken to
him by name.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That God wisely preventeth a common abuse amongst men, which is
to esteeme that spoken to all men, to be, as it were, spoken to none: as
you shall have it common amongst men, to say and confesse, that God is
good, and mercifull, and that he commandeth this, and forbiddeth that;
and yet they usually so behave themselves, as that they shift the matter
to the generall, as if it did nothing belong to them in particular; and
as if they notwithstanding might live as they list: and therefore every man
is to judge and esteeme that God speaketh in the Law to him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and is accordingly to be affected therewith.</p>
                  <p>That this obedience may be more willing and cheerefull; what is further
to be thought upon?</p>
                  <p>We must set before our eyes Gods benefits bestowed upon us, as
the Lord did before the Israelites, in the Preface to the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
                  <p>What benefits ought we chiefely to call to minde?</p>
                  <p>First, those which God doth generally bestow upon all his Children,
as our Election, Creation, Redemption, Vocation, Iustification,
Sanctification, continuall Preservation; and then particularly, such
blessings as God hath severally bestowvd upon every one of us.</p>
                  <p>Are not the judgements of God also to be thought upon for furtherance
to this obedience?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, to make us feare to offend in our wayes. <hi>Exod. 20. 5. 7.
Psal.</hi> 119. 120.</p>
                  <p>Remaineth there yet any more?</p>
                  <p>Good company, which with <hi>David</hi> wee must cleave unto. <hi>Psalme
119. 63. Prov.</hi> 13. 20.<note place="margin">Good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny required.</note> not the noblest, or of greatest account, but the
godliest: for if we will avoyd such a sinne, we must avoyd all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that doth delight therein; which is no lesse dangerous, than good
company is profitable.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:55421:110"/>
That whosoever maketh no choyce of company, maketh no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of sinne: as those that dare keepe company familiarly with Papists,
and prophane persons, thinking that they may keep their Conscience to
themselves.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the helpes both of the knowledge and practice: In what
part of the Scripture is the Morall Law of God contained?</p>
                  <p>It is handled at large throughout the whole Scripture; but is sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
first contrived into ten words, or ten Commandements, <hi>Exod. 20.
Deut.</hi> 4. 13. &amp; 10. 4. and then into two, <hi>Matth. 22. 37. 40. Luke</hi> 10. 27.
comprehending the summe of the whole Law, which are now to
be spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Why hath God given ten Commandements, and no more? Deut. 5. 22.</p>
                  <p>First, that no man should either adde any thing to, or take any thing
from the Lawes of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we might be left without excuse, if we learned them
not; seing they be but ten, and no more.</p>
                  <p>How are these ten Commandements propounded?</p>
                  <p>Sometime affirmatively, as the fourth and fift: Others negatively,
as all the rest. Some with reasons annexed, as the five first: Some
without, as the five last: and all of them in the time to come, and in the
second person singular.</p>
                  <p>Why they are layd downe in the second person singular, you have shewed
before, and why some have reasons added unto them, you shall heare a
little after: Declare now why God hath propounded all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the time to come, saying, <hi>Thou shalt not</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Because it is not enough for us that wee have kept the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God heretofore, except we continue in keeping of them to the
end of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Why are there more of the Commandements negative, telling us what we
should not doe, then affirmative, telling us what we should doe, all of
them except two, being set downe negatively?</p>
                  <p>1 To put us in minde of our corruption,<note place="margin">Why the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are propounded negatively.</note> which needeth greatly to be
restrained, whereas if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in integrity, sinne had not
beene knowne, and then vertue onely had beene propounded to us to
follow.</p>
                  <p>2 Because our soules being full of sin, must have them plucked forth,
before we can do any thing that is good.</p>
                  <p>3 Because the negative bindeth more strongly; for the negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
bindeth alwaies, and to all moments of time, the affirmative bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
alwayes, but not to all moments of time.</p>
                  <p>How are the Ten Commandements divided?</p>
                  <p>Into two Tables,<note place="margin">The division of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</note> 
                     <hi>Deutero.</hi> 4. 13. 10. 1, 4. which Christ calleth the
two great Commandements, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>What doth the first containe?</p>
                  <p>Our duty to God in the foure first Commandements.</p>
                  <p>What doth the second?</p>
                  <p>Our duty to man in the six last.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of the first?</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,<note place="margin">The sum of the first Table.</note> and with all thy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55421:110"/>
Soule, and with all thy strength, and with all thy minde, <hi>Deutero. 65.
Mat. 22. 37, 38. Luke</hi> 10. 27.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of the second?<note place="margin">The summe of the second Table.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy selfe, <hi>Luke 19. 19. Matth. 22. 39
Luke</hi> 10. 27.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this summe?</p>
                  <p>Love, which consisteth in two heads (as we have heard) to wit the
love of God, and of our neighbour, <hi>Luk. 10. 27. 1 Iohn 5. 2. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>What use is there of this short summe?</p>
                  <p>Very great; both to shew the marvellous wisdome of God, and also
for singular profit that redoundeth to us thereof.</p>
                  <p>Wherein appeareth the wisdome of God?</p>
                  <p>That sith it was great cunning to contrive the whole will of God
into Ten words, it must needes bee more wonderfull to bring all into
two.</p>
                  <p>What is the profit that redoundeth unto us?</p>
                  <p>It furthereth us unto that two-fold use of the Law before spoken of:
for, first, it is a means the more to humble us, and so the more effectually
to drive us unto Christ; secondly, it helpeth us much in our obedience
to Christ and his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>What profit ariseth of the first use concerning humiliation?</p>
                  <p>That men being brought to a neerer sight of their sins, might bee the
more earnest to come unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>How shall that bee?</p>
                  <p>That when all our sinnes are gathered into one heape, and mustered
into one Troope, they may appeare the greater, and cast us downe the
more: as a man owing sundry debts unto dives, or unto one man, in the
particulars is confident of his ability to pay all, as long as he heareth they
are but small summes, but hearing the whole summe, despaireth of the
payment of it: or when as there bee many Souldiers comming against
their enemy, but yet here and there scattered, they doe not affect us
with so great feare, as when they bee gathered and ranged in order, and
are all under one sight or view.</p>
                  <p>How is this shewed in our love towards God?</p>
                  <p>In that it should be done in simple obedience of the whole man, that
is, of all the powers both of body and soule, which is impossible for any
man to doe.</p>
                  <p>What are they of the soule?</p>
                  <p>Two, of the Minde, and of the Will.</p>
                  <p>What are they of the Minde?</p>
                  <p>The Vnderstanding and Iudgement, unto both which Memory is
annexed.</p>
                  <p>How are these charged?</p>
                  <p>Our understanding should perfectly comprehend all thing that God
would have us to know; in Iudgement we should thinke aright of them,
and the Memory accordingly should retaine them; but wee are ignorant
of many things, and those which we know, wee know but in part, and
that which wee know, wee judge not aright of, nor remember as wee
ought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:55421:111"/>
How stand the Will and Affections charged?</p>
                  <p>Hereby must we love perfectly all knowne good, and perfectly hate
all knowne evill, of which wee come a great deale shorter, then of the
other.</p>
                  <p>What are they of the body?</p>
                  <p>All the Members, parts and graces of the body (as beauty, strength, <hi>&amp;c</hi>)
should bee wholly imployed in the Service of God, and doing of His
Will; but the wandering of our eyes in the hearing of the Word, and
other parts of Gods Service, doth easily bewray our great negligence,
and the small obedience and conformity of the rest of the Members and
parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>Shew the same in our love towards our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>In that we must love him as our selfe, which as it is so much the lesse
then the former, as man is inferior to God; so we being not able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
it, are much lesse able to fulfill the other.</p>
                  <p>How shall that bee tryed?</p>
                  <p>By examination of our selves in some particulars: as for example;
whether we love a stranger, or our utter and most deadly enemy, as our
selves, which no man ever did, nay a common Man, or to bee plainer,
even our dearest friend, as we doe our selves, which cannot bee found,
<hi>Deut. 28. 53, 56. &amp;c.</hi> and therefore the righteousnesse of the Papists
is a rotten righteousnesse, and such as will never stand with the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God.</p>
                  <p>What profit ariseth of the second use?</p>
                  <p>That by it, as by a glasse, wee may the easier see, and being shortly
contrived, we may the better remember our whole duty both to God
and man; it being as a Card or Mappe of a Countrey easier car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about with us.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that the whole summe and maine end of the Law is Love,
what gather you thereof?</p>
                  <p>That which the Apostle exhorteth unto, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To leave all idle que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
as unprofitable, and to deale in those matters onely which further
the practise of love. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Why is the love of God called the first and greatest Commandement?
Matth. 22. 38.</p>
                  <p>Because we should chiefely, and in the first place, regard our duties
to God, and be most carefull to understand his will, and to worship
him. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 20. In which respect the first Table is put before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
as being the principall.</p>
                  <p>How may it appeare that our duties to God are to be preferred before the
other towards our Neighbour?</p>
                  <p>First, by the inequality of the persons offended; because it is worse to
offend God than man. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the punishment assigned in the Scriptures: For the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the first Table are to be more severely punished than the breaches
of the second: As he that revileth the Magistrate shall beare his sinne;
but hee that blasphemeth God shall bee stoned to death. 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 25.
Num.</hi> 24. 11. 14.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:55421:111"/>
The crafty practices of Papists, who would make men beleeve, that
the chiefest godlinesse, and most meritorious good workes of all requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Law of God, are the workes of the second Table; as Charity,
Almes-deeds, &amp;c. thereby deceiving the people to enrich themselves.</p>
                  <p>Are all the duties of the first Table greater than all the duties of the
second?</p>
                  <p>No, unlesse the comparison be equally made: for the morall duties of
the second Table being perpetuall, are greater than the Ceremoniall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the first being temporall: whereunto agreeth, That God will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have mercy than sacrifice. <hi>Hos. 6. 6. Matth.</hi> 9. 13.</p>
                  <p>When doe you count the comparison equall?</p>
                  <p>When they are compared in like degrees, as the chiefe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the first Table, with the chiefe of the second, the middle du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the one, with the middle duties of the other; and the last and least
of the former, with the last and least of the latter: Thus if we compare
the greatest with the greatest, and the meanest with the meanest, the
duties and breaches of the first Table are greater than the duties and
breaches of the second. But though the principall service of the one be
greater than the principall service of the other; if the comparison be not
made in the same degrees: as if (for example) the murther of a man
be compared with the least abuse of the name of God; or Adultery,
with the least breach of the Sabbath; these of the second Table
are greater.</p>
                  <p>Why is the second Table said to be like unto the first? Matth. 22. 39.</p>
                  <p>For that they goe so hand in hand together, that no man can performe
the one, unlesse the other, as St. <hi>John</hi> teacheth. So <hi>Ephes. 1. 2. chap.</hi>
fourth and fift. For whosoever keepeth the first Table well, cannot but
keep the second: and whosoever keepeth the second, must needs keep
the first.</p>
                  <p>What is to be said of those, that seeme to keep the one, and care not
for the other?</p>
                  <p>If they will seeme to serve God, and are not in Charity, they are
meere hypocrites; and if they will seeme to deale uprightly with their
neighbour, and have not the love of God in them, they are prophane
Hypocrites, and very Atheists.</p>
                  <p>Wherein else doe the Tables agree?</p>
                  <p>First, in that they are both perpetuall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that they are both perfect.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doe the Commandements of the first Table agree?</p>
                  <p>In this principally, that they concerne the worship of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
our whole duties towards him.</p>
                  <p>How are they divided?</p>
                  <p>They either respect the root of this worship,<note place="margin">The division of the first Table.</note> as the first; or the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof, as the three following: For the fountaine worship of God
is prescribed in the first Commandement; the meanes of this service in
the other three.</p>
                  <p>Why did God enjoyne his worship in foure Commandements?</p>
                  <p>That we might the better know and retaine them in mind, or otherwise
might be left the more without excuse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:55421:112"/>
What is common to these foure Commandements of the first Table?</p>
                  <p>That every one hath his severall reason annexed, yet with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that the first hath his reason going before the Commandement,
and the other three have it following.</p>
                  <p>Have not the Commandements of the second Table their reasons also?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily in the Scriptures; but for brevity they are omitted in the
Decalogue.</p>
                  <p>Why are the reasons of the Commandements of the first Table rather set
down then of the second?</p>
                  <p>First, that we might know, that there is no lesse light left in us of
the worship of God, then of the duties wee owe to our neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to teach us, that as all obedience should bee grounded upon
Reason and Knowledge, so especially that which concerneth Gods
worship.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That those are greatly deceived who thinke it sufficient, if they have
the Commandements by heart, or can say them by roat.</p>
                  <p>Why is the reason of the first Commandement set before, which in all
the other commeth after?</p>
                  <p>Because it serveth not onely for a reason of this Commandement, but
also for a Preface to all the ten; for it hath a reference to them all, and is
a reason to urge the observance to every one of them.</p>
                  <p>In what words is it expressed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In these words of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Preface of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</note> Exod. 20. 2. I am the Lord thy God which
brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, and out of the house of Bondage.</p>
                  <p>How prove you this to be a Reason, and not a Commandement, as some
doe thinke?</p>
                  <p>First, because it is commonly used for a reason of other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<hi>Exod. 20. 5. 7. Lev.</hi> 19. 36. 37.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it hath not the forme of a Commandement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, sith the other three Commandements have their reasons
added, it is unlikely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the first and chiefest should have none.</p>
                  <p>How is this Preface set as a reason to enforce the observation both of the
first Commandement, and of all the rest?</p>
                  <p>Thus: If I bee the Lord, the God which brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, thou must take me for the Lord thy God alone, and
keep all my Commandements. But I am the Lord thy God which
brought thee out of the land of Egypt: therefore thou must take mee
for thy God alone, and keep all my Commandements.</p>
                  <p>What ground of obedience is there laid in this Reason?</p>
                  <p>That this Law is to be obeyed, because it proceedeth from him; who
is not onely the Lord our Maker, <hi>Psal.</hi> 100. 3. but also our God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 10. Psal.</hi> 36. 6.</p>
                  <p>Whence is the latter?</p>
                  <p>From the Covenant of grace, whereby he is our God, and Saviour
of them that believe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. assuring them of all gracious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
by vertue of his Covenant, from all evills and enemies, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and especially spirituall: a proofe whereof is laid downe in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
deliverance of the people of Israel out of the slavery of Egypt,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55421:112"/>
which was so exceeding great, that by reason thereof they were said
to be in an Iron Furnace; <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 20.</p>
                  <p>How can this belong to us which are no Israelites?</p>
                  <p>Though we be not Israel in name, or according to the flesh, yet wee
are the true Israel of God according to the spirit and promise.</p>
                  <p>Why doth the Lord make choyse of that benefit which seemeth nothing
at all to belong unto us, rather then of any other, wherein we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with them?</p>
                  <p>1. Because it is the manner of God to allure the Israelites,<note place="margin">How the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belongs to us.</note> to whom
the Law was given at first, as children with temporall benefits, having
respect to their infirmity and child-hood: whereas wee are blessed of
God with greater knowledge, and therefore in respect of them are (as
it were) at mans estate, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 13.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it was fittest to expresse the spirituall deliverance from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
by Christ, which was thereby figured and represented; and so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
no lesse, if not more, to us than to them.</p>
                  <p>3. Because we being freed from the slavery of our bloody enemies,
whereunto we were so neere, more than once, and unto whom we justly
have deserved to have beene enthralled, and it being the common case
of all Gods Children to bee in continuall danger of the like, and to
feele the like goodnesse of God towards them; we may also make use
of this Title, and esteeme it a great Bond also of us unto God.</p>
                  <p>4. Because it was the latest benefit, the sweetnesse whereof was
yet (as it were) in their mouth: and herein the Lord had respect unto
our corrupt nature, who are ready to forget old benefits, how great
soever.</p>
                  <p>What is there is this reason to set forth the true God whom we worship,
and to distinguish him from all Idolls whatsoever?</p>
                  <p>1. The name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which betokeneth that hee onely is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and all other things have their being of him: whereby wee are
taught, that there is but one true God, whose being there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
able to conceive, and that hee giveth being to all other things,
both by creating them at first, and by preserving and directing of them
continually.</p>
                  <p>2. The name <hi>Elohim,</hi> or God; which in the Hebrew is of the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
number, to signifie the Trinity of the Persons in the Vnity of the
God-head.</p>
                  <p>3. That he is both Omnipotent, and is able to do all things, and also
willing to imploy his power to the preservation of his people, proved
from an argument of the effects, in the deliverance of the Israelites out
of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>So much of the Preface. What are the words of the first Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. That this <hi>Jehovah,</hi> one in substance, and three in persons, the
Creator, and Governour of all things, and the Redeemer of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is to be entertained for the onely true God, in all the powers of our

to none other, and that sincerely without hypocrisie as in his sight, who
searcheth and knoweth the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. For this word, <hi>Before me,</hi> or,
<hi>Before my face,</hi> noteth that inward entertainment &amp; worship wherof God
alone doth take notice: and thereby God sheweth that he condemneth
as well the corrupt thoughts of mans heart, concerning his Majesty,
as the wicked practice of the body; for our Thoughts are before

is due unto his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth this consist?</p>
                  <p>1. In knowing of God in himselfe, in his properties, and in his
workes; for it should be the joy of every Christian soule, to know the
true God, and whom he hath sent, Christ Iesus. <hi>Io.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>In cleaving unto him.</hi> Deut. 11. 22. Josh. 23. 8. Acts 11. 23.</p>
                  <p>How is that to be done?</p>
                  <p>1. We must be perswaded of Gods love to us, and so rest upon
him for all we want; being assured, that he both can and will abundantly
provide for us here and for ever.</p>
                  <p>2. We are to love him so heartily as to be loath to offend him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to please him in all things.</p>
                  <p>So much of the Commandement in generall: What are we to consider

                  <p>What be the severall branches of this Precept?</p>
                  <p>There is here commanded:</p>
                  <p>1. The having of a God; and herein Religion.</p>
                  <p>2. The having of one onely God and no more; and herein unity.</p>
                  <p>3. The having of the true God, and none other for our God; and
herein truth.</p>
                  <p>To what end doth God command us to have a God; seeing wee cannot
chuse but have him for our God, whether we will or not?</p>
                  <p>Because albeit all men of necessity must have a God above them, yet
many either know him not, or care not for him; and so make him no
God, as much as in them lyeth.</p>
                  <p>What is it then to have a God?</p>

a God?</p>
                  <p>1. To know God as hee hath revealed himselfe in his Word, and in
his Works. 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. John</hi> 17. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. To acknowledge him to be such an one, as we know him to be.</p>

and applying to our selves his good promises.</p>

                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</note> the knowledge of God himselfe. Secondly, of the things

                  <p>In the Vnity of his Essence; and Trinity of his Persons.</p>
                  <p>What are the things belonging unto God?</p>
                  <p>His properties and his actions, whereby onely we can know him, his
substance being past finding out of man or Angel.</p>
                  <p>What are his properties?</p>
                  <p>His Wisedome, Omnipotence, Iustice, Goodnesse, &amp;c. which are

                  <p>3 <hi>Hatred of God and godlinesse,</hi> Psal. 10. 3, 4. Rom. 1. 30.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that any man should be a hater of God?</p>
                  <p>None indeed will confesse this; yet by this marke he may be known,
when he is a despiser of the Worship and Service of God.</p>
                  <p>And how may one that loveth God be discerned?</p>
                  <p>When a childe doth love his father, his only desire will be to do such
things as please his father, and to abstaine from those things which
might displease him, yea, his chiefest felicity will be, to bee alwayes
in his favour, and in his presence; and in his absence hee will be alwaies
thinking and speaking of him. Such then as bee the Children of God,
by grace, as long as they are absent from their father will talke, and
muse, and meditate upon him, in all things they doe, they will desire to
be well thought of by him, they will bee alwayes carefull to please him,
and by their honest callings to glorifie him.</p>
                  <p>What duties then doe arise from the love of God?</p>
                  <p>1 To love his Word and Commandements, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 15. and ver.
21. 23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97.</p>
                  <p>2 To yeild absolute obedience to his whole Will.</p>
                  <p>3 To bestow all our care, paines and diligence in pleasing him, and
so to consecrate our selves to him, never being weary of his Service.</p>
                  <p>What vices are repugnant to this?</p>
                  <p>1 In defect, Profanenesse, when a Man is without all care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of glorifying God.</p>
                  <p>2 In excesse, Superstition, when a man would give more Worship
unto God then he requireth.</p>
                  <p>What other duties appertaine to the love of God?</p>
                  <p>1 To esteeme of his favour above all things.<note place="margin">Thankfulnesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 To give him the praise of all his benefits, bestowed upon our selves
and others, and to bee thankefull unto him for the same, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p>What is contrary to this?</p>
                  <p>Ingratitude, and unthankefulnesse unto God, for all his benefits,
<hi>Romans</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>Upon what is our feare of God grounded?</p>
                  <p>Because wee know and believe that he is most powerfull,<note place="margin">Feare of God.</note> and just
above all, wee stand in such a godly feare, as not to doe any thing, but
that which maketh for his glory, (<hi>Mat. 10. 28. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 17. &amp; 3. 2. <hi>Heb. 12.
28. Psal. 103. 13. Isa.</hi> 66. 2.) For this is not a servile feare, (whereby one is
afraid to be damned) but an awfull feare, whereby we are afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our Maker.</p>
                  <p>What then is required in this feare?</p>
                  <p>That we doe not the good wee doe onely or principally for feare of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55421:115"/>
danger from men, but for feare of God.</p>
                  <p>What is the vice contrary to this?</p>
                  <p>The want of the feare of God, and contempt of his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>What sin is joyned with the want of the feare of God?</p>
                  <p>Carnall security, whereby a man doth flatter himselfe in his owne
estate, be it never so bad.</p>
                  <p>What vertues arise from the feare of God?</p>
                  <p>Reverence and Humility.</p>
                  <p>What is the former?</p>
                  <p>The Reverence of the Majesty of God,<note place="margin">Reverence.</note> in regard whereof we should
carry such an holy shamefastnesse in all our actions, that no unseemely
behaviour proceed from us, that may any wayes be offensive unto him;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. Of which if Men be so carefull in the presence of <hi>Princes,</hi>
who are but mortall Men; how much more carefull ought wee to bee
thereof in the presence of the Almighty, and most glorious God?</p>
                  <p>How was this prefigured in the Ceremoniall Law?</p>
                  <p>That when Men would ease themselves (according to the course of
nature) they should goe without the Hoast, and carry a paddle with
them to cover their filth; because, saith the Lord, <hi>I am in the midest of you;</hi>
whereby the filthinesse and impurity of the minde was forbidden more
then of the body, and the equity hereof reacheth also unto us, <hi>Deut. 23.
12,</hi> 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>What is contrary to this Reverence of the Majesty of God?</p>
                  <p>Irreverence and Prophanenesse of Men to God-ward.</p>
                  <p>What is Humility?</p>
                  <p>That vertue whereby we account our selves vile and unworthy of the
least of Gods mercies,<note place="margin">Humility.</note> and casting our selves downe before his Majesty
doe acknowledge our owne emptinesse of good, and insufficiency in our
selves; for so all our behaviour should be seasoned with humility.</p>
                  <p>What sinnes are repugnant to this vertue?</p>
                  <p>1 Counterfeit humility, when a man would seeme more lowly then
he is.</p>
                  <p>2. Pride,<note place="margin">Pride.</note> vaine glory, and presumption, whereby we boast and glory of
our selves, and our owne strength and goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>Who are to be accounted proud?</p>
                  <p>1 They that would bee thought to have those good things in them
which they want.</p>
                  <p>2 They that having a little goodnes in them, would have it seem greater
then it is.</p>
                  <p>3 They that having any goodnsse in them, doe thinke that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from themselves.</p>
                  <p>4. They that thinke they can merit from GOD, and deserve his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the godly sorrow which is required in this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>Spirituall griefe and indignation against our owne and others trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
<note place="margin">Sorrow.</note> and also lamenting for the calamities of Gods people, private

                  <p>Ioying in God,<note place="margin">Ioy.</note> rejoycing in all our afflictions, with consideration of the

3. James</hi> 1. 2. the defect of which spirituall joy is here condemned.</p>
                  <p>So much of the Affections; what is required of us in respect of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</p>
                  <p>That we live in all good conscience before God, <hi>Acts 23. 1. Heb.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>What sins are here condemned?</p>
                  <p>1. Hardnesse of heart, and benummednesse of conscience.</p>
                  <p>2. Hellish terros and accusations, proceeding from doing things either
without or against the rule of the Word.</p>
                  <p>So much of the first branch of this Commandement, what is required in
the second branch thereof?</p>
                  <p>Vnity in Religion,<note place="margin">Vnity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> because we are commanded to have but one God
and no more.</p>
                  <p>What things are required of us that we may come to this unity?</p>
                  <p>Foure principally.</p>
                  <p>1. An upright and single heart, ready to embrace the true Religion and
no other.</p>
                  <p>2. Constancy and continuance in the truth.</p>
                  <p>3. A godly courage to stand to the truth, and withstand the enemy.</p>
                  <p>4. An holy zeale of the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>What contrary vices are forbidden?</p>
                  <p>1. Indifferency in Religion, when a man is as ready to embrace one
Religion as another.</p>
                  <p>2. Inconstancy and wavering in Religion.</p>
                  <p>3. Obstinate and wilfull continuance in any Religion without any
good ground.</p>
                  <p>4. Rash and blinde zeale, when a man without knowledge or judgment
will earnestly maintaine either falshood or truth by wicked meanes.</p>
                  <p>To what end doth God will us to have no other God but himselfe, seeing
no man can have any other God, though he never so much desire it?</p>
                  <p>Because howsoever there be but one God, yet many doe devise unto
themselves divers things which they place in Gods stead, and to which
they give that honour which is proper to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4, 5. 10. 20.</p>
                  <p>What sin then doth God condemne by forbidding us to have many gods?<note place="margin">What it is to have other Gods.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>All inward idolatry, whereby men set up an Idoll in their heart in stead
of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3. ascribing thereunto that which is proper to him, and
giving it any part of spirituall adoration.</p>
                  <p>Shew how this is done in the Understanding.</p>
                  <p>When men doe thinke that other things have that which is proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God: as Papists when they beleeve; That the Sacrament is their maker;
That the Saints know their hearts; That the Pope can forgive sins, which
none can doe but God.</p>
                  <p>How doth the Memory faile herein?</p>
                  <p>In remembering of evill things, especially of those which most corrupt
us, and chiefly then, when we should be most free from the thoughts of
them.</p>
                  <p>What is the fault of the Will?</p>
                  <p>Readinesse unto, and wilfulnesse in evill, especially the worst.</p>
                  <p>Shew the like in the Affections, first in sinfull confidence.</p>

                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:55421:116"/>
There is here condemned trust in the Creatures more then in God,<note place="margin">Sinfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and
all fleshly confidence in our selves, or in our friends, honour, credit, wit,
learning, wisdome, wealth, &amp;c. thinking our selves the better or more safe
simply for them, <hi>Prov. 18. 11. Psa. 62. 10. Jer. 17. 5. 2 Chron.</hi> 16. 12. whence
ariseth pride, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 23. and security.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is our duty concerning these things?</p>
                  <p>1. To esteem of them only as good means given us of God, whereby
to glorifie him the better.</p>
                  <p>2. To trust in God lesse when we have them, then when we want

then God, of whose favour we ought more to esteem, then of all the

our friends, our pleasure, profit, credit, or any worldly thing else, for whose
sake we leave those duties undone which God requireth of us, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 4.
1 John 2. 15. 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 29. whereas the true love of God will move
us with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> to wish our selves accursed, rather then that
the glory of God should any thing at all be stained by us, <hi>Exod. 32. 32.

                  <p>How may a man know that he is more afraid of God then of any other
thing?</p>
                  <p>If he be more afraid to displease God then any other, and this feare of

                  <p>3. When by tryall we have found the truth we must rest in it.</p>
                  <p>What is here forbidden?</p>
                  <p>1. All errors and heresies, especially concerning God and his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

imagine no likenesse of God, for as much as wee set up an Idoll in our
hearts, if we liken him to any thing whatsoever, subject to the sense or
imagination of man; for the better avoydance whereof we must settle
our mindes upon Christ, in whom onely God is comprehensible.</p>
                  <p>2. To believe any Doctrine concerning God without any tryall.</p>

superstitious Pomps, and Rites in the service of God.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the parts of that Will-worship?</p>
                  <p>Either the worship of any besides God, or of God himselfe, any other
waies then he hath commanded; for both vices are here forbidden, either
to worship the true God falsly, or to worship those things that are not
God at all.</p>

                  <p>The Papists, which give religious worship unto Creatures, and serve
God, not according to his will prescribed in the Word, but according to
the Popes will, and the Traditions of men.</p>
                  <p>VVhy doth the Lord forbid all these Corruptions, under one instance of
Images?</p>
                  <p>Because therein he foresaw there would be greatest abuse.</p>
                  <p>What doth he expresly forbid concerning them?</p>
                  <p>1. That we make no Image to worship it.</p>
                  <p>2. That we worship it not when it is made.</p>

God hath appointed, or may be allowed by his Word; as Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

                  <p>All use in Gods Service of any new devised Inventions, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

                  <p>What is generally required in this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>That we worship and serve God in that holy manner which he in his
Word requireth.</p>
                  <p>How is that to be done?</p>
                  <p>First, we must use all those holy exercises of Religion, publike and
private, which he commandeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must perform all the parts of Gods Worship prescribed
with Reverence and Diligence, using them so carefully as may bee to
Gods glory, and our good. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 17. and 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>What observe you by comparing the second Commandement with the first?</p>
                  <p>That the inward and outward worship of God ought to goe together:
For as in the first Commandement, the Lord requireth that we should
have no other Gods before him: that is, in the secret of our heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he alone taketh notice: So in the second; by the words <hi>Make, Bow,
Worship,</hi> he forbiddeth any outward service of Religion to any other.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore must God be worshipped both by our bodies and our soules?</p>
                  <p>Because he is the Lord and Maker of them both. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>What gather you from hence?</p>
                  <p>That such as dare to present their bodies to a Masse, or to any other
grosse Idolatry, and say that they keep their hearts to God, are here
convicted of falsehood and hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>So much of the second Commandement in generall: what are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
branches of it?</p>
                  <p>There is here first required,<note place="margin">The speciall branches of the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> that all solemne religious Worship should
be given to the true God: and secondly, that it be given to him alone, and
not communicated to anything which is not God. So that the summe of
the first part is; <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt
thou serve. Matth.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                  <p>How are we to worship the Lord our God?</p>
                  <p>By those meanes onely which himselfe approveth in his Word:
according to the saying of <hi>Moses:</hi> Doe that which I command thee,
and doe no more, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. &amp; 12. 32.</p>
                  <p>What is here required?</p>
                  <p>First, that we give unto God that Worship which hee himselfe hath
prescribed in his Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we give him that alone without addition or alteration.</p>
                  <p>What is forbidden?</p>
                  <p>First, the neglect of Gods Worship or any of his Ordinances, when
we contemne, or despise, or leave undone that service, which hee hath
commanded us to performe unto him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the adding any thing unto, or taking any thing from the
pure Worship, when we serve him by any other meanes, then that which
he himselfe hath commanded.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:55421:118"/>
What are we to consider in the pure worship of God, which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in his Word?</p>
                  <p>1. The parts of it. 2. The right manner of using of it.</p>
                  <p>What be the parts of it?</p>
                  <p>They are partly such as we give unto God, and partly such as God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
unto us.</p>
                  <p>What is required of us touching these kinds?</p>
                  <p>1. That we use these things that God hath given us, to that end that
God hath given them for.</p>
                  <p>2. That neither in giving to God, nor taking from him, we devise any
thing of our owne to serve him withall.</p>
                  <p>What are the things God giveth us to serve him by?</p>
                  <p>His Creatures in the first place, and his Word, Sacraments, Ministery,
Discipline and Censures of the Church, which we must use according as
they are instituted of God.</p>
                  <p>What duties are here required?</p>
                  <p>Our presence at the exercise of Religion, the preaching, hearing, and
reading of the Word of God, together with meditation, conference, and
all other means of increasing our knowledge therein, the administring and
receiving of the Sacraments, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42.</p>
                  <p>How doe you worship God in these?</p>
                  <p>In the Creatures, by beholding his glory in them; in his VVord, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
hearing of it, and carefull beleeving and practising of it; in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by receiving them duely; in the Ministery, and Censures, by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our selves to them.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the things that we give unto God?</p>
                  <p>They are either more or lesse ordinary.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the more ordinary?</p>
                  <p>1. To pray to God,<note place="margin">Of Prayer.</note> both publickly and privately.</p>
                  <p>2. To praise God, both alone and with others.</p>
                  <p>Are these duties required of all Christians?</p>
                  <p>Yea, every true Christian must offer this Sacrifice to the Lord every
day: For in all ages, and at all times, it hath been the practise of Gods
Saints, to offer unto God the Sacrifice of Prayer and Praise; as we may
see by the practise of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who went up at noone to pray,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10. 9. and <hi>Isaac,</hi> who went out at Eventide to pray in the Fields,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63.</p>
                  <p>What are the parts of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>Three.</p>
                  <p>1. Confession, which is the Sacrifice of a broken Heart and wounded
Soule.</p>
                  <p>2. Petition for such things as we lack.</p>
                  <p>3. Thanksgiving for such things as we have received.</p>
                  <p>What are the things lesse ordinary?</p>
                  <p>1. Fasts,<note place="margin">Of Fasts.</note> publicke or private, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12, 15.</p>
                  <p>2. Solemne Thanksgiving for speciall Blessings, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 14. whereunto
Feasting also is joyned, when speciall occasion of joy is given us.</p>
                  <p>3. Making and performing holy Vowes unto God.</p>
                  <p>What is Fasting?</p>

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:55421:118"/>
And abstinence for a time from all the commodities and pleasures of
this life, so farre as comelinesse and necessity will suffer, to make us more
apt to Prayer, and more able to serve God.</p>
                  <p>What is a Vow?<note place="margin">Of Vowes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A solemne promise made unto God of some things that are in our
power to performe, which we do to declare out thankfulnesse, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our faith, and to further us in doing of good duties, wherein we are
backward: our abstaining from some evill, whereunto we finde our
selves especially inclined.</p>
                  <p>So much of the parts of Gods solemne Worship: What is required to the
right manner of using of the same?</p>
                  <p>Our carefull,<note place="margin">The manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> sincere, and diligent behaviour in all his Service; that
every thing may be done as he hath appointed, and no otherwise.</p>
                  <p>What are the things required hereunto?</p>
                  <p>They are partly inward, partly outward; the former whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Substance; the latter the Circumstance of Gods worship.</p>
                  <p>What are the inward?</p>
                  <p>As all the powers of the soule are charged to joyne together (by the
first and great Commandement) in the entertaining and loving; so by
this, in performing all acts of solemne worship to the true God; therefore
herein there must bee a concurrence as well of the understanding, that
we have knowledge of the particular service which wee doe, <hi>Romans
14. 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 14, 15. as of the will and affection, that we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in Spirit and in Truth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 22.</p>
                  <p>What things are requisite to the performance of this?</p>
                  <p>Three.</p>
                  <p>1. A diligent Preparation and advisednesse before we come to any
holy exercise.</p>
                  <p>2. A right disposition of the minde in the action of it selfe.</p>
                  <p>3. A comfortable departure, upon the sensible feeling of the fruit
thereof.</p>
                  <p>What is required in the Preparation before the Action?<note place="margin">Of Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That wee bethinke our selves before-hand, about what things wee
come, and dispatch our selves of all the things that hinder us in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God: which sith we must doe in things otherwise lawfull, much
more in things unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>What is further to be observed herein?</p>
                  <p>That every Preparation be answerable to the exercise whereunto wee
are called: as in the parts of Prayer, for example.</p>
                  <p>1. In Confession we must have a true feeling of our former sinnes.</p>
                  <p>2. In Petition, we must have the like sense of our wants, and bethink
our selves what need we have of the things we aske, and strive against
our staggering, and doubting of Gods promises.</p>
                  <p>3. In Thanksgiving we must call to minde at least Gods benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon us, and consider the greatnesse of them. And so in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Services of God.</p>
                  <p>VVhat Disposition of the minde is required in the Action?</p>
                  <p>1. A reverent,<note place="margin">Of disposition in the action.</note> diligent, and earnest attentivenesse to the thing,
withall the powers of our soules, thereby to fasten our mindes, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55421:119"/>
so to hold them during the exercise, that no idle or vaine thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
us from the same.</p>
                  <p>2. Zeale in the Action, with such Affections as are answerable to the
matter in hand: as in Prayer we must have a sure confidence in God, that
we shall obtaine the things we aske agreeable to his will: In thanksgiving
we must have a sweet feeling of the benefits that God hath given us: in
the Word and Sacraments, we must come with affection to them.</p>
                  <p>What is required of us after the Action?<note place="margin">What required after the Action.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we feele the fruit of it; that is, some increase, either of knowledge,
of true feare, or comfort for the strengthning of us in the duties we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme:
So also every one must examine themselves herein, and all those
that belong unto them; else they are like unto them, that having eaten a
good meale, by warme water doe give it up again.</p>
                  <p>What be the outward things that doe accompany Gods Worship?</p>
                  <p>1. Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies.</note> making for Order and Decency, 1 <hi>Cor.
14.</hi> 40. which are left to the appointment of the Church, being of that
nature, that they are varied by Times, Places, Persons, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                  <p>2. All comely and reverend gestures of the body; as kneeling, lifting
up the hands and eyes to Heaven, silence in the service of God, and such
like: For the gestures of religious Adorations being here forbidden to be
given unto Images, are therein commanded to be given unto the God of
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Is there any use of our bodily behaviour,<note place="margin">Of bodily Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</note> sith he is a Spirit, and looketh to
the Heart?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily: For,</p>
                  <p>1. The whole Man; and consequently, the Body it selfe oweth duty
unto God.</p>
                  <p>2. It is a Glasse, wherein the affections of the Mind are beheld.</p>
                  <p>3. The Mind is the better holden in the thing affected, and the better
holpen, and furthered in the inward Worship, when both Body and Mind
are joyned together; notwithstanding the Mind must alwayes proceed in
Affection, else it is shamefull hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>What gestures are most convenient for the Body?</p>
                  <p>Divers, according to the divers Exercises of Religion; as at the reading
of the Word, standing; at prayer, kneeling, and therein to witnesse our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
by casting downe our eyes; our confidence, by lifting them up; or
with the Publicane, to knock our breasts, except our infirmities, or the like
Lets hinder us herein.</p>
                  <p>So much of the right use of Gods Ordinances. Wherein standeth the abuse
of them?</p>
                  <p>1. In rash,<note place="margin">Of the abuse of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> negligent, and carelesse dealing in any particular point of the
worship of God.</p>
                  <p>2. In using any thing that God hath commanded for his worship
otherwise then he himselfe hath appointed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13. For the brasen
Serpent abused, was worthily broken in pieces, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. and the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
for carting the Arke, were worthily punished, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 3, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>What speciall abuses of the Word are here condemned?</p>
                  <p>To hang pieces of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Gospell about Mens necks, or to use
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55421:119"/>
any other Gospell to heale the diseases, as for any man to charge a Devill
to goe out of one, as the Apostles did.</p>
                  <p>VVhat may be lawfully done in this cause?</p>
                  <p>We must and may pray onely unto God, that he would command the
Devill to depart: for he is the Master that authorised him to goe thither.</p>
                  <p>VVhat speciall abuses of the Sacraments are condemned?</p>
                  <p>The receiving of them unworthily, making them to bee Sacrifices.
1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. 27. 29. as is done in Popery.</p>
                  <p>VVhat of the Ministerie?</p>
                  <p>The turning of that which is given to edifie in Christ to other ends
then those for which it was ordained, and when Ministers exercise Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
Lordship over their flock, or their fellow servants, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> use to doe. <hi>Luke 22. 25. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Or
when in the execution of their function, they seek themselves, and not
the edification of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>What of the Discipline and Censures?</p>
                  <p>When they are used in another manner, and for other causes then
God hath ordained. <hi>Esa.</hi> 66. 5.</p>
                  <p>VVhat of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>To aske evill things, or to pray for such things as God hath made
no promise of; or for such persons as he hath made no promise unto;
as when men pray for soules departed; or for those that sinne to death.
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 14, 15, 16. To pray in a strange tongue which we doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
to pray on Beads, and use much babling; as also to ayme more
in our requests at the relieving of our necessity, then at the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>VVhat of thanksgiving?</p>
                  <p>To thanke God for things unlawfully gotten, or come unto us.</p>
                  <p>VVhat of Fasting?</p>
                  <p>To make it a matter of merrit, or to use superstitious choyce of meats,
as is done in Popery.</p>
                  <p>VVhat of Vowes?</p>
                  <p>To undertake rash Vowes, to break, or else to delay and deferre the
paying of our lawfull Vowes; as also to performe Vowes that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,

in the performance of all these parts of Gods worship?</p>
                  <p>1. Want of understanding,<note place="margin">Defects respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship.</note> when we doe good duties ignorantly, or
thinke that we can please God by meaning well, when that which wee

                  <p>2. Want of Zeale and Affection in performing God service.</p>
                  <p>3. Hypocrisie, when men make a greater shew of the service of God
outwardly, then they have a desire to serve him inwardly.</p>
                  <p>4. Hearing, Reading, Meditating, Conferring, singing of Psalmes,
and receiving the Sacraments without Preparation, Attention, Reverence,
Delight, and Profit.</p>
                  <p>5. Praying without Faith, Feeling, Reverence, Fervency, not waiting

                  <p>So much of the parts of Gods Worship prescribed, together with the right
use and abuse thereof. What say you of such formes of Worship as are
not prescribed by God in his Word?</p>
                  <p>We are commanded to serve God, not according to the Traditions of
men, but according to his Will revealed in the Scripture, <hi>Col. 2. 18.
Mat.</hi> 15. 9.</p>
                  <p>What followeth hereupon?</p>
                  <p>That no Power must be admitted in the Church, to prescribe other
formes of Worship not appointed by God himselfe in his Word.</p>
                  <p>What is then to be observed herein?</p>
                  <p>We must observe the Apostles rule and practise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. where he
saith, <hi>That which I have received, I have delivered unto you:</hi> For if he might
adde nothing to Gods Ordinances, much lesse may we.</p>
                  <p>What is here forbidden?</p>
                  <p>In generall, all VVill-worship, whereby we make any thing a part of
Gods service, which he hath not commanded: For how great a shew so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

which God hath appointed; to devise any other Ministery, then that which
God hath ordained; to place any Religion in Meat, Drinke, Apparell,
Time, Place, or any other indifferent things.</p>
                  <p>What Caution must we keep in the use of things indifferent?</p>
                  <p>1. VVe are to maintaine that Christian Liberty which Christ hath
purchased for us.</p>
                  <p>2. VVe must yet be carefull not to abuse the same; to the hardening,
insnaring, perverting, or just grieving of any.</p>

that end, meditation, conference, good Books, and good company.</p>
                  <p>2. That they marry, and make leagues of Friendship only with such as
professe the true God; and therefore no Professor of the true worship of
God may joyne himselfe in Marriage with one of another Religion, or an
apparent, prophane, and irreligious person; but with such only as are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
at least in shew.</p>
                  <p>3. That we give no toleration to superstition, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13. but shew
our hatred and reluctation of all false Worship, so far as we may within
our Calling.</p>
                  <p>4. That we joyne together with order and decency in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance

2 <hi>King</hi> 6. 1.</p>

                  <p>9. That as occasion requireth, Synods and Councels be called and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,

                  <p>What is required in the second maine branch of this Commandement?</p>

Adultery, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Who are guilty of the first of these sins?</p>
                  <p>1. The practisers of all diabolicall Arts, <hi>Lev. 20. 27. Deut.</hi> 18. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>2. Such as seeke after them, <hi>Lev. 20. 6. Isa. 8. 19, 20. 1 Sam. 28. 7.

thereby, that to seeke secret things of strange Ministries is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>Who are guilty of the latter of these sins?</p>

                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:55421:121"/>
To whom must this Worship be denyed?</p>
                  <p>To every thing that is not God, as the Sunne and Moone, Angels,
Saints, Reliques, Images, and such trash, as <hi>Rome</hi> alloweth, <hi>Deut. 4. 17.

                  <p>What is here in this Commandement expressely forbidden concerning
Images?</p>
                  <p>First, the making of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Images.</note> the bowing unto them, or worshipping them.</p>
                  <p>Why is the first of these so largely set forth?</p>
                  <p>To meet with the corruption of men that by nature are exceeding
prone unto Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>What men are forbidden to make Images?</p>
                  <p>All men which have not some special warrant from God to make them.</p>
                  <p>But though I doe not make Images my selfe, may I worship them that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
man makes?</p>
                  <p>No: For that is likewise forbidden, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 1.</p>
                  <p>Is it not lawfull to put them in Churches, or in publick places, if they be
not worshipped?</p>
                  <p>No.</p>
                  <p>Why then did Moses make the Cherubims, and the brazen Serpent?</p>
                  <p>For so doing he had a speciall Commandement from God, who may
dispence with his owne Lawes when he will.</p>
                  <p>To what end did God command them to be made?</p>
                  <p>The one, to signifie the crucifying of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14. The other, to
signifie the Angels readinesse to helpe Gods children in all distresses.</p>
                  <p>Is all manner of making of Images forbidden?</p>
                  <p>No: but onely in matters of Religion, and Gods Service: for in
civill matters they have a lawfull and commendable use, <hi>Matthew
22.</hi> 20. But to make them for religious ends and uses, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
<hi>Amos</hi> 5. 26. with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 43.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That the Popish Doctrine of Images; that they are Lay-mens bookes,
is directly contrary to the word of God, and therefore as false and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
to be detested of all Gods Children, <hi>Hab. 2. 18. Ierem. 10. 14.
Esa.</hi> 44. 10.</p>
                  <p>What kinde of Images are we forbidden to make?</p>
                  <p>All kindes, whether hewen or ingraven, cut or carved, (which in
the Commandement is expressed, Molten, Imbroydered, Painted,
Printed, or Imagined, <hi>Hosea 13. 2. Ezekiel 8. 10. Acts 17.
25.</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p>Of what things are we forbidden to make Images?</p>
                  <p>Of all things which are in the heavens above; or in the earth beneath,
or in the waters beneath the earth.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by things which are in the heavens?</p>
                  <p>GOD, CHRIST, the Angels, and the Saints which are
in the Highest; the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, which are in
the middle, and the Fowles, which are in the lowest heaven, <hi>Deut.
4.</hi> 27. 19.</p>
                  <p>Is it not lawfull to make the Image of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55421:121"/>
To represent him by any shape is most of all forbidden and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<note place="margin">That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to make the Image of God.</note> for it is a great sinne, to conceive or imagine in our heart that hee
is like any thing, how excellent soever we thinke it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29. but
it is much worse to set him out to the view of others, considering that
the minde can conceive a further beauty then the hand of the Artificer
can expresse: and therefore the children of <hi>Israel</hi> did sinne grievously,
and were worthily condemned for making God like a Calfe, <hi>Exod. 32. 4,
9,</hi> 10, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>How may it further appeare, that it is unlawfull to make the Image
of God?</p>
                  <p>First, because God being Infinite and Invisible, cannot without a
lye bee resembled by any Finite or visible thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God by such Images is, as it were, mocked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the Law was delivered by God himselfe unto the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
he appeared in no shape unto them, lest they should make a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of him, and fall to Idolatrie. And therefore <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 10. 12. hee
forewarned them, that as they saw no Image of him, when he gave the
Law, but onely heard a voyce, they should learne that the knowledge
of God commeth by hearing, and not by seeing, <hi>Esa.</hi> 40. 17, 18. where
the matter is laid downe at large.</p>
                  <p>But what moved the Papists to paint God like an old man?</p>
                  <p>The false expounding of that place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where God is described
to be that Ancient of dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. whereby is meant his Eternity,
that he was before all times, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 15. But whatsoever property in
God it bee, that they should set it forth by an Image, it is execrable so
to doe.</p>
                  <p>May we then paint Christ for remembrance of his death?<note place="margin">That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to make the Image of Christ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>No verily. For,</p>
                  <p>1. It is a part of the worship here forbidden, because his body is
a creature in Heaven, therefore not to be represented by an Image in the
service of God.</p>
                  <p>2. An Image can onely represent the man-hood of Christ, and
not his God-head, which is the chiefest part in him. Both which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being in him unseparable, it were dangerous by painting the one
apart from the other, to give occasion of <hi>Arianisme, Apollinarisme,</hi>
or other Herisies.</p>
                  <p>3. Sith that in all the Scriptures, which speake so much of him, there
is no shew of any portrayture or lineament of his body: it is plain that
the wisedome of God would not have him painted.</p>
                  <p>4. Sith by Preaching of the Gospell, and Administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
Christ is as lively painted, as if hee were crucified againe
amongst us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. it were to no purpose to paint him to that end.</p>
                  <p>What lastly may be added to these former Reasons?</p>
                  <p>That although the painting of Christ were both lawfull to doe, and
profitable for remembrance, yet because it hath been so much abused,
and no where in the Scripture commanded, it is not now to be used: As
<hi>Ezechias</hi> worthily brake the Brazen Serpen, being abused, although <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
had set it up at the Commandement of the Lord, and might have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a singular Monument of Gods mercies, after the proper use
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55421:122"/>
thereof, had not the superstitious opinion thereof been.</p>
                  <p>What is meant in this Commandement, by things in the Earth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The likenesse of man, or woman, or or beasts, or creeping things,</hi>
Ezek. 23. 14. Deut. 4. 16, 17, 18. Isa. 44. 13. Rom. 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>What by things in the Waters under the Earth?</p>
                  <p>The resemblance of any Fish, or the like, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>So much for the making of Images.<note place="margin">What is meant by worshiping Images.</note> What is meant by the bowing unto
them, and worshipping them?</p>
                  <p>That we must not give the least token of Reverence; either in Body,
or in Soule, unto any religious Images, <hi>Psal. 97. 7. Hab. 2. 18. Isa. 44. 15.
Exod.</hi> 32. 4. For that is a further degree of Idolatry; as to shrine, elothe, and
cover them with precious things; to light Candles before them; to kneele
and creep to them, or to use any gestures of religious Adoration unto
them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 18. wherein, although the grosse Idolatry of Popery be
taken away from amongst us; yet the corruption cleaveth still to the
hearts of many, as may be seen in them that make curtesie to the Chancell
where the High Altarstood, and gave the Right hand unto standing
Crosses and Crucifixes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But though we doe not reverence the Images themselves, may we not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in or by the Images?</p>
                  <p>No: For the Israelites are condemned, not for the worshipping the
golden Calfe as a God, but for worshipping God in the Calfe.</p>
                  <p>How doth that appeare?</p>
                  <p>In that they said, Let us make a Feast to morrow to Iehovah, <hi>Exod. 32.
5.</hi> And that <hi>Moses</hi> otherwise might seem, not to have done well, in making
them to drinke that against their conscience, which they judged to be
God, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>Wherein did they sinne so grievously?</p>
                  <p>In tying the presence of God to the worke of their owne hands, and
coupling him with their Idols, which he cannot endure: For God saith by
his Prophet <hi>Hosea, You shall no more call me Baal, Hos.</hi> 2. 16. So impossible it
is truly to serve God by an Idoll, as the Papists doe.</p>
                  <p>What kind of Images are here forbidden to be worshipped?</p>
                  <p>All kinds; whither, such as are made with mans hands, of which <hi>Esay</hi>
speaketh, saying; <hi>One peece of wood is cast into the fire, and another of the
same Tree is made an Idoll, Isa.</hi> 44. 15, 17. or such as in themselves are the
good Creatures of God, as those which <hi>Hosea</hi> speaketh of, saying; <hi>They
worship their Gold and Silver, Hos.</hi> 8. 4. Yea of whatsoever things it may be
said, <hi>That they have eyes and see not, eares and heare not, noses and smell not,
feet and goe not, Psal.</hi> 115. unto them is this Worship forbidden to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That the Popish Idolatry is here flatly condemned: For although they
worship not <hi>Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and such like Heathen Idols, but the holy
Saints (as they say) in and by their Images; yet that worship of theirs is
alike with the other, because these places of Scripture doe agree as well to
the one as to the other; and therefore it is impious and abominable
Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>So much for the practising of Idolatry What is forbidden in the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

                  <p>What Reasons doth God use to strengthen this Commandement withall?</p>
                  <p>They are taken partly from his Titles,<note place="margin">Reasons to back this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, taken from his titles.</note> and partly from his Works.</p>
                  <p>What have we to learne from hence?</p>
                  <p>That if we consider aright of the Titles and Works of God, it will
be a notable meanes to keep us from sinne.</p>
                  <p>How is the reason drawne from Gods Titles laid downe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In these words;</hi> For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</p>
                  <p>Which is the first Title that is mentioned here?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which noteth the Essence of God, and the perfection
thereof.</p>
                  <p>What have we to learne from thence?</p>
                  <p>That Idolaters are so farre from worshipping the true God; that they
deny his Being and Perfection.</p>
                  <p>What is the second Title?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy God;</hi> whereby the Covenant of grace is signified, which on
our part is by no sinne so directly violated as by Idolatry; called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Scripture, Spirituall Adultery, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>What doth this teach us?</p>
                  <p>That Idolaters are most miserable in forsaking the true God, who is
all happinesse to his people.</p>
                  <p>What is the third Title?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>El;</hi> That is, a mighty and strong God; and therefore perfectly able
to save and destroy.</p>
                  <p>VVhat doth this teach us?</p>
                  <p>That there is no power so great which can deliver Idolaters, or any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
from the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the fourth Title?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iealous:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iealous God.</note> whereby the nature of God is signified, loving chastity in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55421:123"/>
his Spouse, with a most fervent love; and abhorring spirituall whoredome,
with most extreame hatred.</p>
                  <p>What are we to learne from hence?</p>
                  <p>That the Lord can no more abide Idolatry, then a married man can
brooke it, that his Wife should commit adultery: For his wrath is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the rage of a jealous Husband, upon unchaste behaviour of his
Wife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 34, 35.</p>
                  <p>Declare this Comparison more at large.</p>
                  <p>The jealous man finding the Adulterer with his Wife, spareth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one nor the other: So if any that by profession hath been espoused
to Christ, and joyned unto God in him, and hath promised in Baptisme to
serve him alone; yet notwithstanding shall forsake him, and worship
others: How good soever they be (whether Saints or Angels) they shall
not escape Gods wrath: For if corporall Adultery be so severely punished,
much more shall spirituall.</p>
                  <p>What doe the reasons drawne from the Works of God containe?</p>
                  <p>A just recompence to the breakers of this Law,<note place="margin">Reasons drawn from the works of God.</note> and a gracious reward
to them that keep it; God shewing himselfe in this case to be jealous,</p>
                  <p>1. By punishing sin in many generations.</p>
                  <p>2. By extending his mercy in a far more abundant manner to them
that keep his Law.</p>
                  <p>So the former reason containeth a threatening to restraine from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
the latter, a promise to allure to obedience.</p>
                  <p>How is the former of these reasons laid downe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In these words:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The 1. Reason.</note> Visiting the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this reason?</p>
                  <p>That he will visit such as (howsoever pretending love) doe thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their hatred of him, and punish them both in themselves, and their
Children, to many generations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What doth God meane, when he saith,</hi> That he will visit the sins of the
Fathers upon the Children?</p>
                  <p>Two things. 1. That he will enquire and search, whether he can find
any of the Parents sins; and especially, their Idolatry in their Children,
continuing in their Fathers sins; and that if he doe, he will remember the
same in the punishment of them.</p>
                  <p>What are we to learne from hence?</p>
                  <p>1. That howsoever God for a time doth seeme not to regard our sins;
yet he doth both see them, and in his due time will punish them, if we doe
not repent.</p>
                  <p>2. That neither the example of our Parents, nor any other that doe
amisse, can be sufficient warrant to us to commit any sin.</p>
                  <p>3. That all Parents are carefull to take heed how they commit any
sin; because in so doing, they bring Gods Iudgements, not only upon
themselves, but also upon their Children.</p>
                  <p>4. That Children are to sorrow for being borne of Idolatrous Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
                  <p>But how doth that agree with the Righteousnesse of God, to punish the
Children for the sins of their Fathers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:55421:123"/>
Very well: for if Princes (whose judgements are shallow in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of Gods, the depths whereof are past finding out) doe with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dis-inherit and put to shame the posterity of Traytors; the Lord may
much more justly doe the like with the wicked childe which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Fathers steps, and is a Traytor himselfe, having both his Fathers
sinne and his owne upon his head: for God here onely threatneth to
punish those children which continue in their Fathers sinnes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they have part in their fathers sinnes, so it is reason they should
have part in their Parents punishments.</p>
                  <p>What doth God meane by the third and fourth generation?</p>
                  <p>He meaneth that not onely the next children, but the children of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and many generations shall smart for their fathers sinnes: As in
<hi>Amos;</hi> for three transgressions and for foure: that is, for many.</p>
                  <p>Why then doth he specially name three or foure Generations?</p>
                  <p>Because Parents live so long oft-times, that they see their Posterity
for foure Generations following punished for their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Why doth God say, Of them that hate me?</p>
                  <p>To shew, that not all the sonnes of the wicked, but onely such as
continue in their Fathers wickednesse shall be punished for their sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>But is there any that hate God?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, so many as worship him otherwise then himselfe hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
doe hate him: for although every Idolater will say, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
God; yet here God witnesseth of him, that he is a lyer, and that he
hateth God, in that he hateth the worship that he commandeth; in
the love whereof, God will have the experience of his love, 2 <hi>Chron.

clemency of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherere it is said, that</hi> he sheweth mercy unto thousands of them that love
him, and keep his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this reason?</p>
                  <p>That God will blesse the obedient unto many generations; both in
themselves, their children, and posterity, and in whatsoever belongeth
unto them: thus extending his mercy unto thousands of such as shew
their love of him by obedience to this his Law.</p>
                  <p>Why doth the Lord say, that he will shew mercy to them that love him,
and keep his Commandements?</p>
                  <p>To teach us that the best deeds of the best men, cannot merit or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any thing at Gods hands, but had need to bee received of him
in mercy.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore doth hee say, that he will have mercy to thousands, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he said, that he would visit onely the third and fourth Generation
of them that hate him?</p>
                  <p>Because he is more willing and ready to exercise his mercy then his
anger.</p>
                  <p>But what will God be mercifull to all the Children of the godly?</p>
                  <p>No: But onely such as love him, and keep his Commandements.</p>

Is this Blessing proper to the Godly?</p>
                  <p>Not altogether neither: For God rewardeth the posterity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p>What doe you observe herein?</p>
                  <p>The high honour that God sheweth unto us, who being able without
us, to maintaine his owne Name and glory; either by himselfe, or by his
Angels, hath notwithstanding committed the maintenance thereof unto
us, which should teach us to be very chairy of it; and carefull to discharge
our duty faithfully, in walking worthy of this honour and defence of his
Name, which he vouchsafeth us.</p>
                  <p>What is the meaning of those words: Thou shalt not take?</p>

whole Commandement cannot be imployed amisse, for the direction of it
in the use of the Name of God. And seeing in the second Table there is
a Commandement, tending almost wholly, to restraine the abuses of our
tongues towards our neighbours, there is much more need of a Precept,
both for direction and restraint of it, in the matters concerning God, and

                  <p>Yes,<note place="margin">The right use of Oathes.</note> in matters of importance, that cannot be decided but by an Oath,
it is good and lawfull to sweare by the Name of God, and a duty specially

rightly; for so is the Commandement, <hi>Jer. 4</hi> 2. Thou shalt sweare in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>
                  <p>How are we to sweare in truth?</p>

undertake, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 4. &amp; 24. 4.</p>
                  <p>What is here meant by Judgement?</p>
                  <p>A due consideration both of the nature and greatnesse of an Oath,
wherein God is taken to witnesse against the soule of the swearer, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 23. and of the due calling and warrant of an Oath; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>What Considerations are then to be had in taking of an Oath?</p>
                  <p>1. Whether the Party we deale with, doubt of the thing we speake of

                  <p>2. If the Party doubt whether the matter whereof we speake, be
weighty and worthy of an Oath.</p>
                  <p>3. If it be weighty, whether the question or doubt may be ended with
truly and verily, or such like naked asseverations, or by doubling our asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations,
as our Saviour Christ did: for then by his example we ought
to forbeare an Oath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 37.</p>

before we come to an Oath.</p>
                  <p>5. Whether he for whose cause we give the Oath, will rest in it, and
give credit unto it; for otherwise the Name of God is taken in vaine,

6. Whether the matter is of importance, and there is no other tryall,
but an Oath. And then we must have our minds wholly bent to sanctifie
the Name of God by the Oath we take; and thinke upon the greatnesse
of Gods power to punish Oathes taken amisse, and to blesse the true use of
them.</p>
                  <p>How are we to sweare in Righteousnesse?</p>

                  <p>2. A rash and vaine Oath, where there is no cause of swearing, when

Jer.</hi> 23. 10.</p>
                  <p>3. Superstitious or Idolatrous Oathes, when we sweare by an Idoll,
or by Gods creatures, <hi>Zeph. 1. 5. Amos</hi> 8. 14. as by the masse, our Lady,
bread, salt, fire, and many fond trashes, whereas God never appointed the
creatures for such uses.</p>
                  <p>4. A counterfeit and mocking Oath.</p>
                  <p>5. A passionate swearing, whereby we call God for a witnesse of our
furious anger, 1 <hi>Sam. 14. 39. 2 King</hi> 6. 31.</p>
                  <p>6. Outragious and blasphemous swearing.</p>
                  <p>7. Perjury, when God is called for a witnesse of an untruth, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing,
<hi>Isa. 48. 1. Zach.</hi> 5. 4. which is, 1. When one sweareth, that which

and doth not performe his Oath, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 13.</p>

glorifying God for that which may be seen in them.</p>
                  <p>3. Vaine and foolish thoughts concerning the Creatures, whereby a
vertue is attributed unto them which God never gave unto them: as all
ghessing of future things by the Stars; by a mans face and hands; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it a prodigious token, that a Hare should crosse our way, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>4. Not using the Creatures as we ought, nor receiving them to Gods
glory with thanksgiving: As when a man giveth not thanks to God for his

which is a fearfull taking of Gods Name in vaine.</p>

                  <p>What is implyed herein?</p>

What is the meaning of the Commandement?</p>
                  <p>It challengeth at the hand of every man one day of seven in every
week,<note place="margin">The meaning of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to be set apart unto a holy rest, and requireth all persons to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselves from their ordinary labour, and all other exercises, to
his service on the same, that so they being severed from their worldly
businesses and all the works of their labour and callings, concerning this
life, they may wholly attend to the worship of God alone, <hi>Neh. 13. 15,
16. Esa.</hi> 58. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you adde these words [apart] and [separate?]</p>
                  <p>To make a difference between the Sabbath dayes, wherein wee must
wholy and only serve God, and the exercises of the other six days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every man must serve him in his lawfull calling.</p>
                  <p>What need is there of one whole day in every week to serve God, seeing we
may serve him every day?</p>
                  <p>That is not enough:<note place="margin">What need there is of one day in seven to serve God.</note> For,</p>
                  <p>1. To the end that we should not plunge our selves so deeply into the
affairs of the world, as that we should not recover our selves, the wisdome
of God hath thought it fit, that one day in seven there should be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from them, that we might wholly separate our selves to the
service of God, and with more freedome of spirit performe the
same.</p>
                  <p>2. A whole day is needfull for the performance of all the parts of
Gods service and worship, as hearing of publike Prayer, and the Word
preached, Chatechising, Administration of the Sacraments, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of holy Discipline, and consideration of the glory of God in the
creatures.</p>
                  <p>3. If <hi>Adam</hi> in his perfection had need of this holy day, much
more have we who are so grievously corrupted.</p>
                  <p>4. If the Lord in love and wisedome, considering our necessities
both of soule and body, hath set out a weeks time for both of provision,
that as every day we set apart some time for food, and spend the rest in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
so we set one day in the week aside for our spirituall food, and
bestow the other dayes on our earthly affaires: so as this day may in
comparison be accounted the soules day, wherein yet wee must have
some care of our bodies: as on the six dayes we must have some care of
our soules.</p>
                  <p>What is forbidden in this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>The unhallowing or prophaning of the Sabbath, either by doing
the works of our calling and of the flesh, or by leaving undone the works
of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But is not this Commandement Ceremoniall, and so taken away by the
death of Christ?</p>
                  <p>No;<note place="margin">That the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day is not etremoniall.</note> but is constantly and perpetually to be observed; and never to
cease till it bee perfectly consummated in the heavenly Sabbath, <hi>Hebr.
4.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>How prove you that?</p>
                  <p>1. Because it is placed in the number of the perpetuall Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
otherwise the Morall Law should consist but of nine words
or Commandements, which is contrary to Gods Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:55421:127"/>
2. Because this Commandement (amongst the rest) was written by
the finger of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. whereas no part of the Ceremoniall
Law was.</p>
                  <p>3. For that it was written in Tables of stone, as well as the other,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 22. As to signifie the hardnesse of our hearts; so to signifie the
continuance and perpetuity of this Commandement as well as the rest.</p>
                  <p>4. Because it was before any Shadow or Ceremony of the Law; yea
before Christ was promised, whom all Ceremonies of the Law have
respect unto: for the Sabbath was first instituted in Paradise, before there
was any use of Sacrifices, and Ceremonies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>5. The Ceremonies were as a Partition wall betwixt the Iews and the
Gentiles; but God doth here extend his Commandement not onely
to the Iewes themselves, but also to strangers. <hi>Exod. 20. 10. Nehem.
13.</hi> 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>6. Our Saviour Christ willing his followers which should live about
forty yeares after his Ascension, to pray that their flight might not bee
on the Sabbath day, to the end that they might not bee hindred in the
service of God, doth thereby sufficiently declare, that hee held not
this Commandement in the account of a Ceremony, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20.</p>
                  <p>But it sometimes shadoweth our sanctification, and our eternall rest. <hi>Col.
2. 16, 17. Exod.</hi> 31. 13. and is therefore Ceremoniall?</p>
                  <p>That followeth not: For,</p>
                  <p>1. There is no Commandement which hath not some Ceremonies ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto it; as in the Commandement touching Murther, to abstain from
strangled things, and bloud: And the whole Law had the Ceremony of
the <hi>Parchment Law.</hi> So that by that reason the whole Law should be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,
which is absurd.</p>
                  <p>2. The Ceremoniall representation of our eternall rest came after
the Commandement of the rest, and therefore is accessary and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall:
for which cause, the time of correction and abolishment of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
being come, <hi>Dan. 9. 7. Matth. 11. 13. Acts 15. 6. Col. 2. 13,
14. Heb. 10. 14. Gal.</hi> 5. 2. that use may well fall away, and yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
remaine, it being out of the substance of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                  <p>What is the speciall day of the week, which God hath set apart for his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Worship?</p>
                  <p>The first day of the week, called the Lords day, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 2. Rev.
1. 10. Acts</hi> 20. 7.</p>
                  <p>Was this day set apart thereunto from the beginning?</p>
                  <p>No:<note place="margin">Of the change of the seventh day to the first, and the reasons of it.</note> For from the first Creation till the Resurrection of Christ, the
last day of the week, commonly called Saturday, was the day that was
appointed thereunto; and that which the people of God constantly
observed.</p>
                  <p>And why so?</p>
                  <p>Because upon that God ceased from the worke of Creation, <hi>Gen. 2. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Exod.</hi> 31. 17.</p>
                  <p>How came this day to be changed?</p>
                  <p>By divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>How doth that appeare?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:55421:128"/>
1. By the practise of our Saviour Christ, and his Apostles, <hi>Iohn 20.
19, 26. Acts</hi> 2. 1. 20. 7. which should be a sufficient rule unto us, especially
the Apostles, having added a Commandement thereunto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 12.</p>
                  <p>2. There is no reason why it should be called the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.
but in regard of the speciall dedication thereof to the Lords service: for
otherwise all the dayes in the weeke are the Lords dayes, and he is to be
served and worshipped in them.</p>
                  <p>What was the cause that the day was changed?</p>
                  <p>Because it might serve for a thankfull memorial of Christs Resurrection.
For as God rested from his labour on the last day of the weeke: so Christ
ceased from his labour and afflictions on this day, <hi>Mat. 28. 1. Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2.
As the one therefore was specially sanctified, in regard of the Creation
of the World: so was the other, in respect of the restauration and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, which is a greater worke then the Creation.</p>
                  <p>Can this day then be altered?</p>
                  <p>No power of any Creature in Heaven or Earth can alter it, or place
another seventh day in the place and stead thereof.</p>
                  <p>But doth this Commandement directly require the seventh day from the
Creation?</p>
                  <p>No: but the seventh day in generall.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the reason annexed, where the Lord in six dayes is said to make
Heaven and Earth, and to rest the seventh day, and therefore to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, confirme so much?</p>
                  <p>No, not necessarily: For it doth not hence follow, that we should rest
the same day the Lord rested; but that we should rest from our worke the
seventh day, as he rested from his; which seventh day, under the Law, he
appointed to be Saturday: so nothing hindreth, but by his speciall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
under the Gospell it may be Sunday, and yet the substance of
the Commandement nothing altered.</p>
                  <p>Why doth not the New Testament mention this change?</p>
                  <p>Because there was no question moved about the same in the Apostles
time.<note place="margin">The time of the Sabbath, and when it beginneth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>When then doth this our Sabbath begin, and how long doth it continue?</p>
                  <p>This day, as all the six, is the space of twenty foure houres, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at the dawning, though we ought in the Evening before, to prepare
for the day following.</p>
                  <p>Why doth our Sabbath begin at the dawning of the day?</p>
                  <p>Because Christ rose in the dawning; and to put a difference between
the Iewish, and a true Christian Sabbath. For as the Iewes begun their
Sabbath in that part of the day, in which the Creation of the World was
ended, and consequently, in the Evening: so the celebration of the memory
of Christs Resurrection, and therein of his rest from his speciall labours,
and the renewing of the World, being the ground of the change of that
day; it is also by the same proportion of reason, to begin when the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
began, which was in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>Can you shew this Example?</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Troas,</hi> after he had preached a whole day, untill mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
celebrated the supper of the Lord the same night, which was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
dayes exercise; and therefore, that night following the day, was a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55421:128"/>
part of the Sabbath; For in the Morning he departed, having staid there
seven dayes, by which it is evident, that that which was done, was done
upon the Lords day, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7, 10.</p>
                  <p>Is the Lords day only to be separated to Gods service?</p>
                  <p>No: For of this manner are holy Fasts observed for the avoiding of
some great evill, present or imminent, <hi>Lev. 23. 27. Ioel</hi> 2. 12. &amp; holy Feasts,
for the thankfull remembrance of some speciall memorable mercies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<hi>Zach. 8. 19. Ester.</hi> 9. 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>To what Commandement doe you refer the Churches meeting on the
working dayes?</p>
                  <p>That is also, by a manner of speech of one part for the whole, contained
in this Commandement: yea, it reacheth to the times which the Family
appointeth, or that every one for his private good proposeth, although
the Bond to that time is not so strict, as is the Bond to observe the dayes
of Rest.</p>
                  <p>So much of this Commandement in generall: What doe you note therein
in particular?</p>
                  <p>1. The entrance in the word <hi>Remember.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What is meant by the word, Remember.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The parts of the Commandement.</p>
                  <p>What is to be observed in the word, Remember?</p>
                  <p>That although all the Commandements are needfull diligently to be
remembred, yet this more specially.</p>
                  <p>Why so?</p>
                  <p>1. Because this Commandement hath least light of nature to direct us
to the observation of it.</p>
                  <p>2. For that we are naturally most negligent in it, suffering our selves to
be withdrawne by our worldly businesse, from the Lords service, upon
the Lords day; and therefore, such a speciall warning is needfull to be
added.</p>
                  <p>What things are we thence to remember?</p>
                  <p>1. To looke backe unto the first institution of the Sabbath day in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. before all Sacrifices and Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>2. So to beare it in mind, as to live in continuall practise of the duties
we learned the Sabbath day last past.</p>
                  <p>3. To bethink our selves before of the works of the Sabbath, and so to
prepare our selves, and our affaires, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 54. that we may freely and
duely attend on the Lord in the Sabbath approaching.</p>
                  <p>What should be done in this preparation of the Sabbath?<note place="margin">Of the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sabbath:</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. We should so compasse all our businesses in the six working dayes,
that our worldly affaires enter not, or incroach into the possession of the
Lords day; Not only willingly, but not so much as by any forgetfulnesse.
As when through want of foresight, or forecasting the payment of mony
due by obligation, or any such businesses that might be prevented, shall
fall out on that day.</p>
                  <p>2. We should sanctifie our selves, and those that are under us, to keep
that day.</p>
                  <p>What is contrary to this?</p>
                  <p>The neglect of Preparation for the Sabbath before it come, and of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our hearts for holy service, when it is come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:55421:129"/>
What are the parts of this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>They are two.<note place="margin">The parts of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, to keep the Lords rest.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to sanctifie this rest: For it is not sufficient that we rest from
worldly businesses, but it is further required, that it be a holy rest.
The first sheweth, what works we are to decline upon this day; the other,
what duties we are to performe.</p>
                  <p>What are the workes that we must decline, and leave undone on the
Lords day?</p>
                  <p>Not onely the workes of sinne,<note place="margin">What Workes ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</note> which we ought to leave undone
every day, but also the workes of our ordinary callings concerning this
life, and bodily exercise and labours, which upon other dayes are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary to bee done, <hi>Marke 3. 4. Ezek. 23. 37, 38. Num.
15. 32, 33. Exod.</hi> 31. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. &amp; 34. 21. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 15, &amp;c.
<hi>Esa.</hi> 58. 13.</p>
                  <p>What instances have you in Scripture of the performance hereof?</p>
                  <p>The Israelites ceased both from those works which were of the least
importance, as gathering of sticks, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 32. and from such also
as were of greatest weight, as working at the Tabernacle, and building
the Temple on the Sabbath day; and consequently all other workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these extreams, as buying and selling, working in seed time, or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
were forbidden unto them.</p>
                  <p>Are we as strictly bound to rest from all our outward businesses, and to
forbeare all worldly labour upon this day, as the Israelites?</p>
                  <p>Yea, so farre forth as the morality of the Commandement reacheth,
but by the Ceremoniall Law, there was enjoyned unto the Iewes a more
exact observation of outward rest, which to them was a part of their
Ceremonial worship: whereas unto us the outward rest is not properly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of the sanctification of the day, or of the service of God: but only
a meanes tending to the furtherance of the same; even as in Fasting and
Prayer; Fast is of it selfe no part of Gods service, but a thing adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereunto, and so farre forth onely acceptable in the worship of
God, as it maketh a way and readier passage for the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
                  <p>What did that most strict observance of outward rest signifie unto the
Jewes?</p>
                  <p>Their continuall Sanctification in this world, <hi>Exodus 31. 13. Ezek.
20.</hi> 12. and their endlesse rest in the world to come; whereof
this was a Type no lesse then the land of Promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 4, 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>How was the latter of these specially typified?</p>
                  <p>In this world, Gods Children are subject to the fiery tryall, but after
these troubles, rest is provided for them, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7. and no fire to be
feared in that after world. For a more lively representation of that,
there was a charge laid upon the children of Israel, that no fire might be
kindled throughout all their habitations upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Exodus
35.</hi> 3. though it were for the very preparing of the meat which they
should eate, <hi>Exodus</hi> 16. 23. which was allowed unto them, even in the
two great solemne dayes of the Passeover, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. 16.</p>
                  <p>Is it then lawfull for us to make a fire and dresse meat upon the
Lords day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:55421:129"/>
Yea certainly; because these were proper to the Pedagogy, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of government of the Children of Israel under the Law, as may
appeate by this, that there was no such thing commanded before the
Law was given by <hi>Moses;</hi> and consequently being not perpetuall, must
necessarily follow to bee Ceremoniall. Now after the Sabbath that
Christ our Lord rested in the grave, the Ceremoniall Sabbath lyeth
buried in that grave, together with those other Rites which were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of things to come, the body being in Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we being dead with Christ, from these Ceremonies, are no more to
be burthened with such Traditions, <hi>ibid. verse</hi> 20. Nor to bee brought
under the bondage of any outward thing: It is a liberty purchased unto
us by Christ, and we must stand fast unto it, that blessed houre being
come, wherein the true worshippers are to worship the Father in Spirit
and Truth, <hi>John</hi> 4. 23.</p>
                  <p>To leave then the Ceremoniall Sabbath, and to come to the Morall;
How is the Rest required therein laid downe in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</p>
                  <p>By a Declaration:<note place="margin">What rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> First, of the Works from which there must be a ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
Secondly, of the persons that must observe this Rest.</p>
                  <p>How is the former of these expressed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In these words:</hi> In it thou shalt not doe any Worke, <hi>Exodus
20.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>What is required of us hereby?</p>
                  <p>That for the space of that whole naturall day, we cease in minde and
body from all our worldly labours; yea from the workes of our lawfull
Calling, and all other earthly businesses whatsoever, more then needs
must be done, either for Gods glory, or mans good.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That all exercises which serve not in some degree to make us fit to the
Lords worke, are unlawfull upon the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you say, that we must rest in minde and body?</p>
                  <p>Because this rest must be of the whole man, in thoughts, words, and
deeds, <hi>Esa.</hi> 58. 13.</p>
                  <p>Is it meerely unlawfull to doe any bodily, or outward businesse on the
Lords day?</p>
                  <p>No. First, for such works are excepted as are presently necessary, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for common honesty, or comelinesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the actions of Piety requisite for the performance of Gods
service on that day, <hi>Acts 1. 12. Mat.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, extraordinary exigents of Charity, for the preservation of the
Common-wealth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the preservation of our owne and others life, health, and
goods, in case of present necessity, or great danger of their perishing, if
they were not saved on that day, <hi>Mat. 12. 10, 11. Marke 3. 4. Luke
13.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>What be the speciall breaches of this part of the Commandement?</p>
                  <p>1. The making of the Sabbath a common day through common
labours in our ordinary callings,<note place="margin">The speciall breaches oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to an holy rest.</note> 
                     <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 15. vaine speech, and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of our worldly affaires, <hi>Esa.</hi> 58. 13. thinking our owne thoughts,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55421:130"/>
and no other but a common use of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>2. The making it a day of carnall rest unto idlenesse, feasting, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes,
&amp;c. which draw our mindes further from God then our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
labours, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 6. Whither are referred all recreations, which
distract us, as also excessive eating and drinking, which causeth drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and unaptnesse unto Gods Service and Worship.</p>
                  <p>3. The making it a day of sinne, or the Devills holy day, by doing
that on the Lords day which is no day lawfull, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 4. but then most
abominable, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>4. The keeping a peece of the day, not the whole; or giving
liberty to our selves in the night, before the whole Sabbath be ended.</p>
                  <p>5. The forbearing our selves, but imploying others in worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
for preventing of which sinne, God is so large in naming of the
persons, which in this Commandement are forbidden to worke.</p>
                  <p>Why is there a particular rehearsall of these persons in this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement?</p>
                  <p>To take away all excuses from all persons in this Commandement;
for the Lord did see, that such was the corruption of men, that if they
themselves did rest upon this day from labours, they would thinke it
sufficient, not caring how they toyled out and wearied their servants
at home with continuall labour, as many doe; so that it were better
to be such mens Oxen then their servants, so small care they have
of their soules.</p>
                  <p>What is the speciall use of this rehearsall?</p>
                  <p>To teach us, that all sorts and degrees of persons are bound to yeeld
this duty unto God; and that the Sabbath is to be kept both by our selves,
and those that doe belong unto us.</p>
                  <p>Was it not ordained also for the rest and refreshing of men and
beasts; especially Servants, which could not otherwise continue
without it?</p>
                  <p>That also was partly intended, as may appeare by <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 14. but not
principally, for the things here contained doe concerne the worship of
God; but that wearing and toyling out of servants and beasts, is against
the sixt Commandement; and working is here forbidden, that men
might be the more free for the worship of God; and therefore though
servants had never so much rest and recreation upon other dayes, yet
they ought to rest upon this day in that regard.</p>
                  <p>Why is there mention made of allowing rest to the beasts?</p>
                  <p>First, that we may shew mercy even to the beasts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to represent after a sort, the everlasting Sabbath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all Creatures shall bee delivered from the bondage of corruption,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because of the whole imployment of men in the Lords
service: for beasts cannot be travelled or used in any worke upon that
day, unlesse man be withdrawne from Gods service; yea, though the
beast could labour without mans attendance, yet his minde would
some time or other be carryed away and distracted thereby, that it would
not be so fit as it ought to be for Gods service.</p>
                  <p>To whom especially is the charge of this Commandement directed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:55421:130"/>
To Housholders and Magistrates,<note place="margin">To whom this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is chiefly directed.</note> who stand charged in the behalfe,
both of themselves, and of all that are under their roofe and Government,
<hi>Jos. 24. 15. Neh. 13. 15. Heb.</hi> 13. 15.</p>
                  <p>What is the charge of the Housholder?</p>
                  <p>That not only himselfe keep the Lords day; but also, his Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Servants, as much as may be. For as they serve him in the weeke
dayes: so he must see that they serve God on the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That a Housholder should be as carefull of the Lords businesse, as of his
owne; And if he will not keep such a servant as is not carefull in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
worke, much lesse should he keep any that will not be carefull in the
Lords worke, how skilfull soever he be in his owne.</p>
                  <p>What is the Magistrates part?</p>
                  <p>To see that all within his gates keep the Lords day, <hi>Jo.</hi> 24. 15. even
strangers, though Turks and Infidels, <hi>Neh</hi> 13. 15. causing them to cease
from labour, and restraining them from all open and publick Idolatry, or
false Worship of God; much more all his owne Subjects, whom he ought
to force to heare the Word, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 33.</p>
                  <p>So much of the first part of this Commandement, touching our rest from
all worldly businesses: What followeth in the next place?</p>
                  <p>The second and greater part of this Commandement,<note place="margin">The second part of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the sanctifying of the Rest.</note> which is the

that day.</p>
                  <p>Are we as strictly bound to these duties as the Jewes?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, and more then they, because of the greater measures of
Gods graces upon us, above that which was upon them.</p>
                  <p>What is required of us herein?</p>
                  <p>To make the Sabbath our delight; to consecrate it as glorious to the

VVhat proofe have you of this continuall exercise and imployment?</p>
                  <p>1. In the Law; every evening, and every morning were Sacrifices,
which on the Sabbath were multiplyed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
                  <p>2. The 92. <hi>Psalme</hi> (entituled, <hi>A Psalme for the Sabbath</hi>) to bee sung
that day, declareth, that it is a good thing to begin the praises of God
early in the morning, and to continue the same untill night.</p>
                  <p>That wee may know then, how to spend a Sabbath well, declare more
particularly how we may bestow the whole time in exercises of holines;
and first begin with the evening preparation.</p>
                  <p>Our care must be over night,<note place="margin">Of the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that having laid aside all our earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,

fall asleep, as it were, in the Lords bosome, and awake with him in
the morning.</p>
                  <p>VVhat must be done in the morning when we awake?</p>
                  <p>We are to put away all earthly thoughts,<note place="margin">The first du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the morning.</note> and to take up such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
as may most stirre up our hearts with reverence and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to serve the Lord the whole day after: wherein, first, we are to
consider the great benefit of the Lords Sabbath, and so cheere up our
hearts in the expectation to enjoy the same. Secondly, to covenant with
the Lord, more religiously to sanctifie the whole day after.</p>
                  <p>In making of our selves ready, what are we to doe?</p>
                  <p>Rising as early for the Lords service, as we doe for our owne busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
and bestow no more time nor care about our apparell, and such like,
then needs must: we may then occupy our minde about such matters
as bee most fit for that time; which ordinarily may be these two.</p>
                  <p>1. To thinke upon Gods goodnesse in giving us such apparell, and
other necessaries, which many others want: so that wee may judge all
things we have rather too good for us, then bee discontented with any
thing we enjoy.</p>
                  <p>2. Considering how well our bodies be apparelled, and provided
for; to seek more to have our soules better apparelled with Christ Iesus.</p>
                  <p>Being up and ready, what are we to set our selves to?</p>
                  <p>Wee must set our selves to our morning sacrifice, either alone, or
with others, if it may be, some short Prayer for our preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
used.</p>
                  <p>VVhat Meditations must we here enter into?</p>
                  <p>Two especially: the one, for that which is past; the other, for that
which is to come.</p>
                  <p>VVhat for that which is past?</p>
                  <p>To cast our weeks account at least how God hath dealt with us in
benefits and chastisements, and how wee have dealt with him in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
or breaking his Commandements, that by both we may finde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to comfort and humble us, to move us to thankfulnesse for mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and to earnest suit and labour for pardon of our trespasses, and
supply of all our necessities.</p>
                  <p>VVhat for that which followeth?</p>
                  <p>To prepare our selves for the publick Ministerie, and as it were to
apparell our selves, and make our selves fit to go to the Court of the Lord
of Hosts with his children, and before his Angels.</p>

                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:55421:132"/>
What things are necessary hereunto?</p>
                  <p>1. A due regard whither we goe, before whom, what to doe, and what
ends, wherewith to honour God, and to receive grace from him.</p>
                  <p>2. An earnest hunger, so to use the meanes to Gods honour, and our
good.</p>
                  <p>3. True faith, that we shall enjoy our desire.</p>
                  <p>4. Ioy and Thankfulnesse, in the hope of such Blessings.</p>
                  <p>5. Humility, in regard of our unworthinesse.</p>
                  <p>6. Vnfained purpose of amendment of life.</p>
                  <p>What must be added unto these?</p>
                  <p>To the Meditations, fervent Prayer must be joyned, and Reading, for
our furtherance in Gods service; and such as conveniently can, are to joyne
together in a Christian Family, to read, pray, and confer, and Governours
to instruct their Families in such matters as are then befitting.</p>
                  <p>Having thus spent the time privately,<note place="margin">Of the publick duties of the Sabbath.</note> what is to be done in publick?</p>
                  <p>We are to goe to Church in all comely sort, before the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
is begun, and then with all diligence to attend, and to give consent
thereunto, and so to take to heart whatsoever shall be brought unto us,
that by all the holy exercises we may be edified in all needfull graces.</p>
                  <p>The publick Ministry ended, what are we to doe?</p>
                  <p>We are to occupy our minds on that we have heard, and when we
come to place and time convenient,<note place="margin">What is to be done after the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</note> to set our selves more especially to
make use of it, to our selves and others pertaining to us, and to water it
with our prayers, that it may grow and bring forth fruit.</p>
                  <p>What say you to our diet, and refreshing of our nature on this day?</p>
                  <p>Care would be had, that it be such as every way may make us fitter for
holy duties; And to this end, we are to season it with Meditation, and
speeches of holy things.</p>
                  <p>How is the afternoone to be spent?</p>
                  <p>1. The time before the Evening Sacrifice, we are to bestow, either
alone, or with others, in such Exercises as may best quicken in us Gods
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. For the Evening Sacrifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all respects to behave our selves as in
the Morning, and to continue to the end.</p>
                  <p>3. This publick Ministry fully ended, to keep our minds (in like sort as
before) on that we have heard; and so being come home, either alone, or
with others, to enter into an examination of our selves for the whole day.</p>
                  <p>How are we to end the day?</p>
                  <p>1. With thanks for Gods blessings on our labours.</p>
                  <p>2. Humble suit for pardon of all our faults escaped.</p>
                  <p>3. Earnest desire of grace, to profit by all, that we may persevere unto
the end, and be saved.</p>
                  <p>Doe you make any difference betwixt the Sabbath nights, and other
nights?</p>
                  <p>Yes: we should lay our selves downe to rest in greater quietnesse that
night, upon the sense and feeling of the former Exercises; so that our sleep
should be the more quiet, by how much the former Exercises of that day
have been more holy; otherwise we should declare, that we have not kept
the whole day so holy to the Lord as we ought.</p>

same?</p>
                  <p>Foure.</p>
                  <p>Whence is the first taken?</p>
                  <p>From equality,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> by a secret reason of comparison of the lesse; That
forasmuch as God hath allowed us six dayes of seven for our affaires, to
doe our owne businesse in; whether it be labour, or honest recreation, and
reserved but one for himselfe, when as he might most justly have given us
but one of seven, and have taken six to himselfe; we ought not to thinke
it much, to spend the whole seventh day in the service of God.</p>
                  <p>What learne you from hence?</p>
                  <p>The unequall and wretched dealing of most men with God, who by
the grant of this Commandement urge usually at their servants hands,
the worke of a whole day, in every of the six dayes; yet upon the Lords
day, thinke it enough, both for themselves, and those under them, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
out unto the Lord three or foure houres only for his service, using one
measure to mete the service due unto themselves, and another to mete the
service due unto God; which is a thing abominable before God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 1.
And so much the more as the things are greater, and of more value, which
they mete with lesser measures.</p>
                  <p>Whence is the second Reason taken?</p>
                  <p>From Gods owne right,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> who made the Sabbath, and is Lord of it. <hi>For
the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;</hi> This day is his, and not
ours.</p>
                  <p>Whence is the third?</p>
                  <p>From the example of God;<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> That as God having made all things in the
six dayes, rested the seventh day from creating any more: so should we rest
from all our works: God himselfe ceasing from his worke of Creation on
that day, and sanctifying it, with what joy ought we to imitate our God
herein? <hi>Gen. 2. 2, 3. Exod.</hi> 31. 17.</p>
                  <p>Did God cease from all works on the seventh day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:55421:133"/>
No verily; he did then, and still continueth to doe a great worke in
preferring the things created, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>What learne you from this?</p>
                  <p>1. That we be not idle on the Lords day, seeing Gods example is to
the contrary, but attend upon the Lords service.</p>
                  <p>2. That as the Lord preserved on the Sabbath day things created in
the six dayes before, but created none other new: so by his example, we
may save things on that day, which otherwise would be lost; but we may
not get or gaine more.</p>
                  <p>Whence is the fourth and last reason drawne?</p>
                  <p>From hope of blessing;<note place="margin">Fourth reason:</note> because God ordained not the Sabbath for
any good it can doe to him, but for the good of unthankfull man;
and therefore he blessed and sanctified it, not onely as a day of service
to himselfe, but also as a time and meanes to bestow encrease of grace
upon such as doe continually desire the same; <hi>Exodus 31. 13. Esa.
56.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by Sanctifying it?</p>
                  <p>The setting it apart from worldly businesses, to the service of God.</p>
                  <p>What by Blessing?</p>
                  <p>Not that this day in it selfe is more blessed then other dayes; but as
the acceptable time of the Gospell is put for the persons that receive
the Gospell in that time: so by blessing this day, he meaneth that those
that keep it shall be blessed; and that by setting it apart, and separating
it by this Commandement from other dayes to be kept holy by publick
exercises of his holy worship and service, God hath made it an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
meanes of blessing to them that shall sanctifie it as they ought.</p>
                  <p>Wherein shall they be blessed that keep the Sabbath day?</p>
                  <p>1. In all the holy exercises of the Sabbath, which shall serve for their
further increase both of the knowledge and feare of God, and all other
spirituall and heavenly graces accompanying salvation.</p>
                  <p>2. In matters of this life, we shall not onely not be hindred by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Sabbath, but more blessed then if we did worke that day: as on
the other side, the gaine on the Lords day shall by the curse of God
melt and vanish away, what shew of profit soever it have, and bring
some curse or other upon our labours in the week dayes, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are lawfull and honest.</p>
                  <p>So much of the first Table, concerning our duties to God, the due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

                  <p>2. That the workes thereof are in higher or lower degree of good

farre forth as we hinder not Gods glory, nor some great duty to others,
especially the houshold of faith; for sometime it may so fall out, that
that which men require, (and that otherwise are right) may not bee
given; as <hi>Rahab,</hi> though subject to the King of <hi>Jericho,</hi> might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
the Spies, but should have failed in her duty, if she had betrayed
them at the Kings Commandement; and therefore in this case shee did
well in preferring the obedience she owed to God, before the duty she
owed to man, <hi>Josh.</hi> 2. 3. In like case also <hi>Ionathan</hi> revealing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
counsell unto <hi>David,</hi> and preferring the greater duty before the
lesser, did well, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 3. So we owing a greater duty to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,

they be Trayters, then suffer any hurt to come to our Countrie.</p>
                  <p>But what if two have need of that which I can give but to one

                  <p>I must then preferre those that bee of the houshold of faith, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 10. and my kinsemen, and those that I am tyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <p>What are we specially forbidden to doe by the Commandements of the
second Table?</p>
                  <p>To doe any thing that may hinder our neighbours dignity, in the
fift; Life, in the sixth; Chastity, in the seventh; Wealth, in the
eighth; or good Name, in the ninth; though it bee but in the
least secret motions and thoughts of the heart, unto which we give
no liking nor consent: for unto that also the last Commandement doth
reach.</p>
                  <p>How are these six Commandements of the second Table divided?</p>
                  <p>Into such as forbid all practise,<note place="margin">Division of the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> or advised consent to any hurt of our
neighbours; and such as forbid all thoughts and motions of evill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our neighbour, though they never come to advised consent of the
Will. The first five Commandements doe concerne such things as
come unto consent, and further; the last, such as come not unto consent
at all.</p>
                  <p>How are those five Commandements of the first sort divided?</p>
                  <p>Into those that concerne speciall duties to speciall persons: and those
that concerne generall duties, to all those duties which concerne speciall
persons, are commanded in the first; those that generally concerne all
men, either in their life, chastity, goods, or good name, are enjoyned in
the foure Commandements following.</p>

What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That we are to distinguish between duties and duties; between sinne
and sinne, done towards men; and that to offend principall persons,
and such unto whom wee are in speciall manner obliged, is greater
sin, because God hath singled out this one Commandement for these
persons.</p>
                  <p>What are the words of this Commandement, which is the fift in

all such duties, as one man oweth unto another, by some particular bond,
in regard of speciall callings and differences, which God hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
speciall persons.</p>
                  <p>What be these speciall persons?</p>
                  <p>Either in Equalls, or Superiours and Inferiours; for this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enjoyneth all due carriage of Inferiours to their Superiours; and by
consequent also of Superiours to their Inferiours; and likewise by analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
of equalls among themselves, under the sweet relation betwixt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

                  <p>Why are all Superiours here called by the name of Parents?</p>
                  <p>1. For that the name Parents being a most sweet and loving name,
men might thereby be allured the rather to the duties they owe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be duties that are to bee performed to them, or which they
should performe to their inferiors.</p>
                  <p>2. For that at the first and in the beginning of the world, Parents were
also Magistrates, Pastors, Schoole-masters, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>How doth this agree with the Commandement of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 7, 8, 9.
that we should call no man Father or Master upon earth?</p>
                  <p>Very well; for there our Saviour meaneth onely to restraine the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious

who are principally and in the first place, to performe the duties required
in this Commandement.</p>
                  <p>Why is the Commandement conceived in the name of Inferiours?</p>
                  <p>Because their duties are hardest obeyed in all estates.</p>
                  <p>What is here contained under the name of Honour?</p>

                  <p>Why are these duties comprehended under the word Honour?</p>
                  <p>Because it adds an ornament and dignity unto them.</p>
                  <p>What is the Honour that Inferiours owe to all Superiours in generall?</p>
                  <p>1. Reverence in heart, word, and behaviour, <hi>Lev. 19. 3. Eph.</hi> 6. 1. 5. For

                  </p>
                  <p>That thy dayes may be prolonged, and that it may
goe well with thee in the Land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee, <hi>Deut. 5. I6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is taught in this reason?</p>
                  <p>That God moveth the hearts of Superiours, to promote the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of Inferiours; for so also doe the words sound, <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. 12.
that they may prolong thy dayes: besides the providence of God to
the obedient, which is farre above all experience of mens provision.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this promise?</p>
                  <p>The blessing of long life and prosperity to such as by keeping this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
shall shew that they regard the Image and Ordinance of
God, <hi>Eph. 6. 1, 2, 3. Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Have not the other Commandements this promise?</p>
                  <p>No, not expressely; which sheweth that a more plentifull blessing in
this kind followeth from the obedience of this Commandement then of
the other that follow. Hence it is called by the Apostle, the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
with promise; <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 2, 3. it being the first in order of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55421:140"/>
second Table, and the only Commandment of that Table, that hath an
expresse promise, and the only Commandement of the Ten, that hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
promise.</p>
                  <p>But how is this promise truly performed, seeing some wicked men live
long, and the godly are taken away in the midst of their time?</p>
                  <p>1. The Lord performeth all temporall promises,<note place="margin">Of the promise of long life, &amp; how performed</note> so far forth as it is
good for us; and therefore, the godly are sure to live so long as it shall serve
for Gods glory, and for their owne good; but the wicked live to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condemnation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. It is enough, that the promises of this life be performed for the most
part.</p>
                  <p>3. What loseth the obedient childe? what injury is done unto him, who
being taken out of this life, is recompenced with a better? or what breach
of promise is in him that promiseth silver, and payeth with gold, and that
in greater weight and quantity? As for the wicked, they gaine nothing by
their long life, receiving by meanes thereof, hereafter, judgement in hell.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the Lord oftentimes revenge the breach of his Commandement,
even in this life?</p>
                  <p>Yes: 1. Vpon the Parents, who have been ungracious themselves, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
unto them ungracious and disobedient children.</p>

                  <p>4. Mockings for some want of the body, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 14. especially for

                  </p>
                  <p>That according to the counsell of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> we see that no corrupt
communication proceed out of our mouth, but that which is good, to the

that our speech be alwayes gracious, seasoned with salt, that we may know
how we ought to answer every man, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. For as flesh in Summer, if it
be not poudred with salt, will smell: so will it be with them that have not
their hearts seasoned with the word of truth. And thence for want of care,
proceed angry, wrathfull and loathsome speeches against our brother,
which are in the Scripture compared to Iuniper coales, which burne most
fiercely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 120. 4. or to the pricking of a sword, or a razor, which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
most sharply, <hi>Prov. 12. 18. Psal.</hi> 52. 2. Whereupon the tongue is by
Saint <hi>James</hi> said to be an unruly evill, set on fire of Hell, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 6, 8. We

                  <p>Either directly, or indirectly.</p>
                  <p>How indirectly?</p>
                  <p>1. When one defendeth himselfe with injury or purpose of revenge,<note place="margin">How wee doe indirectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger our neigbours life.</note>

                  <p>2. When women with childe, either by mis-diet, or streine by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,

by dancing, either hurt the fruit of their wombe, or altogether mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>

stood in that integrity wherein God created them, such an act as this
should never have happened.</p>
                  <p>3. Because there is some impudency in him that doth it, and want of
consideration.</p>
                  <p>What should this teach us?</p>
                  <p>To take heed of all occasions that may make us guilty of this sin.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When one killeth another in his owne defence: whereunto also may be
added: If one should kill a man at unawares, in hurling stones to no use;
Or if a drunkard in reeling should fell another, whereof he should dye; for

                  <p>1. The desire of strange flesh, with resolution to have it if he could,
<hi>Col. 3. 5. 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 5. For to lust after a strange woman with consent of heart,

Not that the bare affection is of it selfe a sin, being rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

subject, manner and measure being not observed.</p>
                  <p>2. Inward boiling and burning in affection, whereby godly motions, as
with a fire are burnt up, and a mans mind is so carried away, that he is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in all other things belonging to his Calling. This is an high degree
of corruption, which if it be not restrained, will breake forth into further

imaginations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15.</p>

                  <p>How is this Commandement broken in the abuse of apparell, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the body?</p>
                  <p>1. By excesse,<note place="margin">Abuse of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.</note> when it is above our estate or ability, <hi>Mat. 11. 8. Isa.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>2. By lightnesse, when it is wanton and lascivious; And hence some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell

occasion of lust and uncleannesse.</p>
                  <p>3. By immodesty, and wearing of such attire, as doth disfigure the

                  <p>4. New-fanglednesse, when it is not according to the custome of the
Country, City, or Towne where we dwell, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 18.</p>
                  <p>5. When it is otherwise then belongeth to the sexe: As if a man put on
womans apparell, or a woman a mans, which is abominable to God, <hi>Deut.
22.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>What are the Reasons hereof?</p>
                  <p>1. God would have every sexe here maintained, that the man should
not become effeminate, nor the woman mannish.</p>
                  <p>2. To avoid a most notorious occasion of shamelesse and namelesse sin:
For if a man may be inflamed with a wanton Picture painted, much more
with a lively Image, and portraiture of the sexe.</p>
                  <p>3. It is a dishonour for a man to belye his sexe, and to spoile himselfe
of the dignity God hath given him, and presumption for a woman to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the reputation of a better sexe then God hath set her herein.</p>
                  <p>May not women in their apparell submit themselves to please their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands?</p>
                  <p>They must seeke to please them by lawfull meanes; and therefore by
clothing themselves in decent apparell with sobriety, and for their successe
to put their trust in God, who is able by modesty in apparell, without any
such indirect meanes, to maintaine their Husbands love towards them,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>What Apparell are we then to use?</p>
                  <p>Such as commeth under the rule of the Apostle; namely, such as may
witnesse our godlinesse and modesty, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 9. Tit.</hi> 2. 3. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
some (exceeding this measure) say they doe it not to allure any; yet
if others be allured by it, it is a sin in them, although not so grievous &amp; great
as in the other, who propound to themselves (by their wanton apparell) to
allure.</p>
                  <p>How is this Commandement broken in the abuse of meat and drinke?</p>

                  <p>How in regard of the quality?</p>
                  <p>1. When we seeke after too much daintinesse, <hi>Deut. 14. 21. Luke</hi> 16. 19.</p>
                  <p>2. When we seeke such kind of meat and drinke which provoke this sin.</p>
                  <p>How in regard of the quantity?</p>
                  <p>By excesse and intemperance in diet, when we feed to fulnesse, and give

                  <p>What doth it containe?</p>
                  <p>A charge of our owne, and our neighbours goods, that we shew love
and faithfulnesse therein, and not onely not impeach or hinder, but by all
meanes preserve and further the same.</p>

                  <p>It is divers.<note place="margin">The end of the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> First, in respect of God, that the goods which he hath
bestowed on us should be conserved and imploied to those uses for which
he hath intrusted them unto us, and principally to the setting forth of his
glory who gave them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:55421:149"/>
Secondly, in respect of the Church; for whatsoever is given unto
any member thereof, whether it be either spirituall or externall good,
it is given for the common benefit of the whole body. And therefore
he that taketh away the goods of any member, or refuseth to imploy
for the common profit what he hath, hee neglecteth this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and consequently sinneth against this Commandement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in respect of the Common-wealth; for the preservation
whereof, justice is required, in giving unto every one that which is his
owne; which being neglected, great Kingdomes are great Thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in respect of every singular person, that every man may
freely and quietly enjoy those his goods which God hath given him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was that covetousnesse which naturally adhereth unto us, whereof it
commeth to passe, that we are not contented with our estate &amp; means, but
lust and long after other mens, and use all our endeavours to compasse
them, whether it be by right or wrong. And from hence arise injuries,
oppressions, thefts, and robberies. By which meanes what is gotten doth
naturally more delight and please us, then that we get in our lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,

                  <p>What are the words of this eighth Commandement?</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt not steale, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 15.</p>
                  <p>What is here forbidden?</p>
                  <p>Theft, in all the kindes thereof.</p>
                  <p>What is theft?</p>
                  <p>It is the fraudulent imbezeling,<note place="margin">Of Theft.</note> or taking away of those goods which
belong to another man, without the knowledge, or against the will of the
owner; or the unjust detaining of it from him, when wee know that in
right it belongeth unto him.</p>
                  <p>What things are chiefely to be here considered?</p>
                  <p>Two. First, the Objects, about which it is chiefely exercised:
and secondly, the Vertues and Vices commanded and forbidden.</p>
                  <p>What are the Objects?</p>
                  <p>Our owne and our neighbours goods; or as they commonly speake,
<hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> mine and thine. For whereas he forbiddeth theft, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
beneficence, he implieth and requireth, that there should bee
distinct proprieties and possessions: for otherwise there could bee no
theft, nor exercise of bounty and beneficence: for a man cannot steale
but that which is anothers, nor give but that which is his owne.</p>
                  <p>What are the Vertues commanded, and the Vices forbidden in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Apostle hath comprised all in a briefe summe,</hi> Eph 4. 28. Let
him that stole steale no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands
the thing which is good, that hee may have to give to him that needeth. <hi>Of
which the Apostle propoundeth himselfe for an example,</hi> Acts 20.

                  </p>
                  <p>Two. First, the negative, forbidding all Theft. Secondly, the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
injoyning the just getting, and the just and liberal use of our goods.</p>

What understand you by Stealing, or Theft?</p>
                  <p>All vices of the same nature and kinde, whereby we any wayes hinder
or hurt our selves, or our neighbours in our goods. And as Theft it selfe
is here forbidden, so also the cause and root of it, which is covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
together with the meanes and signes of it, and the procuring
of it in others; As also the contrary vertues hereuuto are required.</p>
                  <p>How must we proceed in handling of them?</p>
                  <p>From the generalls to the more speciall.</p>
                  <p>What degrees are there of the generall duties?</p>
                  <p>They are three.<note place="margin">Generall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, to abstaine from all injuries and injustice, whereby we hurt or
hinder our selves, or our neighbour, in our owne, or his goods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that wee use our best endeavour to preserve by all lawfull
meanes, both our owne and his.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we chearfully communicate our goods to the relieving
of our neighbours necessities.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>They are three.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Opposite vices.</note> injuriously to hurt or hinder our selves or neighbours in our
goods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to be wanting in any meanes whereby they may bee justly
preserved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to bee wanting to our neighbours in relieving them when
their necessities require our helpe; for we are not absolute owners of the
things which we possesse; but Gods Stewards, who are enjoyned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his Talents to such uses as he requireth; and particularly to the
benefit of our fellow-servants, <hi>Luke 16. 2. Matth. 25. 14, 15, 19.
Luke</hi> 19. 13.</p>
                  <p>What is the second generall duty respecting our owne, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
goods?</p>
                  <p>That we use our best endeavour to preserve them. First, our owne:
For though wee may not set our hearts upon them, <hi>Psalme</hi> 62. 10. yet
seeing they are Gods gifts, and are to bee imployed for his glory and
our owne, and neighbours good, if we should wilfully or negligently
suffer them to perish, we should be worse then the unprofitable servant,
who kept the Talent committed unto him, though hee did not increase
it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 25.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must doe our best to conserve our neighbours goods,
seeing they have not by chance come unto them, but by the wise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing
of Gods Providence, whose wise dispensation wee resist, if by
our best endeavour we doe not preserve them for their use. And to this
end that Law concerning our neighbours Cattell tendeth, <hi>Deut. 22. 1, 2,
3. Exod.</hi> 23. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall duties here required?</p>
                  <p>They are of two sorts:<note place="margin">Speciall duties here required.</note> the first respect the just getting and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
the other, the right using and imploying of our goods.</p>
                  <p>What are the duties which are referred to the former?</p>
                  <p>They are either internall, or externall.</p>
                  <p>What are the internall?</p>

They are chiefely foure:</p>
                  <p>First, little or no love and desire of money.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, selfe-contentednesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a lawfull measure of our appetite, or moderate concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
and desires.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, lawfull providence without carking care, or a laudable stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and endeavour in getting of goods.</p>
                  <p>What doe you meane by little or no love of money?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When wee done not set our hearts upon riches and worldly wealth,</hi>
Psalme 62. 10. But first seek Gods Kingdome and righteousnesse, Matth.
6. 33.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>Love of money: that is, when wee set our hearts upon riches, and
worldly things, which should be devoted unto, and fixed upon God.</p>
                  <p>By what Arguments may we be disswaded from this vice?<note place="margin">Arguments disswading from the love of money, and earthly things.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By divers; especially these that follow.</p>
                  <p>First, because it is a foolish vice, seeing riches to those that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
love them, are not onely vaine, but also hurtfull, and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>Hab. 2. 6. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it is unseemly: for we are Pilgrims in this world,
and Citizens of Heaven; and therefore we should not set our hearts and
affections on earthly, but on heaveuly things, <hi>Phil. 3. 20. Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because it is impious: for 1. He that loveth the world loveth
not God, 1 <hi>Joh 2. 15. James</hi> 4. 4. neither can we serve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24.</p>
                  <p>2. Because a lover of money is an Idolater, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. For that is our
God on which we set our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, because it is pernicious. For,</hi> he that soweth unto the flesh,
shall of the flesh reap corruption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8. and their end is destruction who
minde earthly things. <hi>Phil. 3. 19. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, because the love of money is the root of all evill, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
men to all tentations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>What is the second speciall vertue here commanded?</p>
                  <p>Selfe-contentednesse:<note place="margin">Selfe-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</note> when a man is contented with that estate and
condition which God in his wise providence hath allotted unto him.
And doth not covet either that which is another mans, or that which
is unnecessary and superfluous, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12. And this springeth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the neglect of money, and contempt of worldly things, and
partly from our affiance in God, resting it selfe upon his promises, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
goodnesse, and all-sufficiency.</p>
                  <p>What motives may induce us to embrace this vertue?</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>By the consideration of the vanity of worldly things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Motives per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading to selfe-content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</note> 
                     <hi>and the
profit which ariseth from piety, and the love of divine excellencies,</hi> 1 Tim.
6. 6, 7, 8. Godlinesse is great gaine with contentation: <hi>For this abundantly
supplyeth all our wants,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. Psal. 34. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. 16. Mat. 6. 33.
Prov. 15. 16. Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treasures
and trouble therewith.</p>
                  <p>2. Of Gods providence, who is our provident and loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And therefore seeing we are his sonnes, wee ought to bee content
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55421:150"/>
with our portion which our gracious Father hath allotted unto us; and to
say with <hi>David, Psal. 16. 6. The lines are falne unto me in pleasant places.</hi> For
he best knoweth what we stand in need of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32. Goe, let us submit
our selves to his will and providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, let us meditate on Gods promises,</hi> Heb. 13. 5, 6. Be content with
such things as you have, for he hath said, I will never leave nor forsake thee.
<hi>And therefore let us</hi> cast our care upon God, for he careth for us, 1 <hi>Pet.
5. 7. Psalme</hi> 55. 22. Cast thy burthen upon the Lord, and he shall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
thee, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the vice opposite to this vertue?</p>
                  <p>Not to be contented with our present state and condition, but immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
to desire more and greater things, and to afflict our selves with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting,
and carking cares in getting and compassing them.</p>
                  <p>VVho are most addicted to this vice?</p>
                  <p>Those who will not live according to the proportion of their meanes
which God hath given them: for these wanting more then is needfull,
their ordinary commings in and lawfull meanes doe not suffice them, but
they desire and seek things superfluous by unlawfull meanes; as food and
raiment above their state and ability.</p>
                  <p>But is it then unlawfull, in a meane and poore condition to use meanes to
improve and better our estate?</p>
                  <p>Our affiance in God, and selfe contentednesse doe not hinder us from
using all lawfull meanes to better our condition, nor make us slothfull in
our callings; so that our desires be moderate, and the meanes wee use bee
lawfull, we in the meane time resting upon Gods just and wise providence
with contentation.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the third internall duty, respecting the lawfull getting and
possessing of earthly things?</p>
                  <p>The lawfull measuring of our appetite,<note place="margin">Lawfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of our appetite.</note> and the moderating of our
concupiscence: For all appetite and desire is not unlawfull, but that onely
which is inordinate and immoderate; for that desire which tendeth to the
neeessary sustentation of our selves and others is commendable.</p>
                  <p>What things are here considerable?</p>
                  <p>Two things. First, what is necessary. Secondly, when the appetite
is lawfull. Concerning the former, things are said to be necessary, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the necessity, either of our selves or others.</p>
                  <p>What things are to be reputed necessary in respect of our selves?</p>
                  <p>There may be a three-fold necessity, as either in respect of Nature, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or Estate.</p>
                  <p>What in respect of Nature?</p>
                  <p>Those things which are required to the sustaining of nature, as
we are men; that is, food, and raiment, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>What is necessary in respect of Person?</p>
                  <p>When we have sufficient for our selves, and those that belong unto us,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>What is necessary in respect of State?</p>
                  <p>When we have that which is sufficient to maintaine us according to
our ranke, place, and calling, whether it be Magistrates, Ministers, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:55421:151"/>
What is necessary in respect of others?</p>
                  <p>It is either private, or publick.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is that necessity which respecteth the private?</p>
                  <p>When we have wherewith to relieve the necessities of private men, after
which ability all ought to labour, <hi>Eph. 4. 18. Prov. 4. 15, 16. For it is a more
blessed thing to give, then to receive,</hi> Acts 20. 35.</p>
                  <p>VVhat in respect of the publick?</p>
                  <p>It either concerneth the Church or Common-wealth; unto both
which we must be serviceable, as being borne not onely for our selves,
but also for them: Therefore we may justly desire and labour after such
abilities, as that we may not be wanting to either of them, when their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
require our helpe.</p>
                  <p>When is the Appetite lawfull?</p>
                  <p>When it is ordinate and moderate.</p>
                  <p>When is it ordinate?</p>
                  <p>When it is subordinate to our study, and desire of Gods glory and
our owne salvation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. and contrariwise it is inordinate and
preposterous when earthly things are more affected and desired then
heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Who doe sinne in this kinde?</p>
                  <p>Those who seek worldly things by sinfull and unlawfull meanes, to the
hazzard of their soules, and their eternall salvation; such are more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
then <hi>Esau,</hi> that sold his Birth-right for a messe of Pottage;
<hi>Mark</hi> 8. 36.</p>
                  <p>What is a moderate Appetite or Desire?</p>
                  <p>When we desire onely things necessary; and these also so as that we
can be content, though we cannot get them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
whereof we have in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4. 11. 12. and in <hi>Agur, Pro.</hi> 30. 8.
And Christ hath taught us to pray, <hi>Give us this day our dayly bread;</hi> that
is, food convenient and necessary.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the extreames opposed hereunto.</p>
                  <p>They are two:<note place="margin">Affected po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</note> The first is voluntary affectation of poverty, as the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Friars among the Papists, commending that for a vertue and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of perfection, which the Spirit of God hath taught us to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
<hi>Proverbs</hi> 30. 8. And hath enjoyned us not to begge, but to
labour with our hands, that we may be helpfull unto others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>What is the other extreame?</p>
                  <p>The immoderate affectation of riches and honours, and that in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure then is needfull for us. The former, we call Covetousnesse;
the other, Ambition.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is Covetousnesse?</p>
                  <p>An immoderate desire of Riches;<note place="margin">Covetousnesse.</note> in which these vices concurre.</p>
                  <p>1. An excessive love of Riches, and the fixing of our hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
                  <p>2. A resolution to become rich, either by lawfull, or unlawfull means,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. Too much haste in gathering riches, joyned with impatience of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
delay, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 20. 22. &amp; 20. 21.</p>
                  <p>4. An unsatiable appetite which can never bee satisfied, but when
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55421:151"/>
they have too much, they still desire more, and have never enough,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 8. like the Horse-leech, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 15. the Dropsie, and Hell it
selfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 20.</p>
                  <p>5. Miser-like tenacity, whereby they refuse to communicate their
goods either for the use of others, or themselves.</p>
                  <p>6. Cruelty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 18, 19. exercised both in their unmercifulnesse
and oppression of the poore.</p>
                  <p>VVhat doe you think of this vice?</p>
                  <p>That it is a most hainous sinne: for it is Idolatry, and the root of all
evill, <hi>Col. 3. 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 10. A pernicious Thorne that stifleth all grace,
and choaketh the seed of the Word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. and pierceth men
through with many sorrowes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. and drowneth them in destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and perdition, <hi>verse.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>What is Ambition?</p>
                  <p>An immoderate love and desire of honours,<note place="margin">Ambition</note> which is a vice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of Covetousnesse and Pride; in which concurre all those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Covetousnesse before spoken of: as an immoderate love of
honours, a resolution to aspire unto honours, either by lawfull or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, too much haste in aspiring unto honours, not waiting upon
God for preferment in the use of lawfull meanes, unsatiablenes in aspiring
higher and higher, and enlarging of the ambitious mans desire, like unto
hell, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 5. Vnto which may be added Arrogancy, whereby hee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteth
to be preferred before all others; and Envy, whereby he disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that any should he preferred before him.</p>
                  <p>What is the fourth and last vice here forbidden?<note place="margin">Carking care.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immoderate and carking care, in the pursuing of these earthly things,
riches and honours; and contrariwise, moderate appetite and desires of
having, and moderate care of procuring them is approved and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
that we may not be burthensome, but rather helpfull unto others,
2 <hi>Cor. 12. 13. Eph.</hi> 4. 28.</p>
                  <p>What are the extreames opposed to the former vertue?<note place="margin">Carelesnesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are two: the first, is carelesnesse and neglect of our goods
and state. For as he is commended who gathereth in seasonable times, so
he is condemned who neglecteth those opportunities, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 5. &amp; 6. 6.
and is censured by the Apostle to be worse then an Infidell, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>What is the other extreame?</p>
                  <p>Anxious and solicitous care,<note place="margin">Solicitous and distracting cares.</note> which distracteth the minde that it
cannot be wholly intent to Gods service. And this doth partly arise
from Covetousnesse, and partly from diffidence in Gods Promises and
Providence.</p>
                  <p>What are the reasons that may disswade from this vice?</p>
                  <p>They are chiefely two. First, because it is Impious. Secondly, because
it is Foolish.</p>
                  <p>Why is it impious?</p>
                  <p>Because it chargeth God either with ignorance, that he knoweth not
our wants, contrary to that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 32. or of carelesnesse, that hee
neglecteth us; or of impotency, that he is notable to supply our wants;
whereas he is omniscient, and knoweth our necessities; omnipotent, and
able to relieve us; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. and our most gracious Father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55421:152"/>
willing and ready to helpe us in time of need.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it divideth the heart between God and Mammon,
and we cannot at once serve these Masters, <hi>Matth. 6. 24. 1 John 2. 15.
Iames</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because it is heathenish, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32.</p>
                  <p>Why is it foolish?</p>
                  <p>Because it is both superfluous and vaine: superfluous, because God
hath undertaken to provide for us; and therefore in the use of lawfull
meanes wee must cast all our care upon him, 1 <hi>Peter 3. 7. Psalme
55.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>How is it vaine?</p>
                  <p>Because it is Gods blessing onely that maketh rich, <hi>Prov. 10. 22. Deut.
8.</hi> 18. and by our owne care wee can no more adde to that stint of state
which he hath allotted unto us, then we can thereby adde one Cubit to
our stature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 27.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken generally of the internall duties: what duties are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
and more specially required?</p>
                  <p>They respect either the just acquisition and getting of our goods,
or the just retention and possessing of them; unto which is opposed
the unjust getting, and keeping of them; which are here forbidden under
the name of Theft.</p>
                  <p>What is required to just getting?</p>
                  <p>That we get them by just and lawfull meanes:<note place="margin">What required to just getting.</note> For riches are Thorns,
which are not to be hastily catched, but to be handled warily, and with
much caution, that they doe not pierce the soule, and wound the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p>What may move us hereunto?</p>
                  <p>First, by considering, that a little justly gotten, is better then abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
gotten unjustly, <hi>Prov. 16. 8. Psal.</hi> 37. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that what is justly gotten is the gift of God, and a pledge
of his love; but that which is gotten unjustly, is given in his wrath, and
is a snare of the devil to our destruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that as goods justly gotten are Gods gifts, which he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
unto us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. so that which is ill gotten, is lyable to his curse,
<hi>Prov. 13. 11. Hab. 2. 9. Jer.</hi> 27. 11.</p>
                  <p>How many wayes are goods lawfully gotten?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes. First, without Contract. Secondly, by Contract. Out
of Contract, either such as are gotten by our selves, or received from
others.</p>
                  <p>How gotten by our selves?</p>
                  <p>Either ordinarily, or extraordinarily. Ordinary getting is by the
sweat of our browes in our lawfull Callings. So that here two things
are required: First, a lawfull Calling: and secondly, that we labour
in it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28.</p>
                  <p>What is a lawfull Calling?</p>
                  <p>It is the setting apart of singular men unto some lawfull labour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<note place="margin">Lawfull Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; labour in it.</note> according to the variety of their gifts, and inclinations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be publick or private.</p>
                  <p>What is in the second place required of every man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:55421:152"/>
That they diligently labour in their lawfull calling, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10. and
that variously, according to every mans condition, and the variety of their
severall callings. For if <hi>Adam</hi> was not to be idle in the state of Innocency,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. much lesse we after the fall, <hi>Gen</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>What doe you call extraordinary getting?</p>
                  <p>That which is acquired by the law of nature,<note place="margin">Extraordinary getting.</note> or the law of Nations,
as that which is gotten by the law of Armes, or that which is casually
found, being lost, of another, unto which men have right, when as by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
enquiry the owner cannot be knowne.</p>
                  <p>How are goods justly gotten as they are retained from others?</p>
                  <p>When as by a civill right we retaine them from others, who are the
true and lawfull owners; and that either by free gift, or by succession and
inheritance, whether it be given unto us by the Testators will, or by Law
and right doe fall unto us.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite to the former vertues?</p>
                  <p>All means and kinds of unjust getting, opposite to just acquisition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordinary or extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is opposite to ordinary just getting?</p>
                  <p>Inordinate walking, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. 7. 11. which is opposed either to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
calling, or to labour required in it.</p>
                  <p>What is opposed to a lawfull Calling?</p>
                  <p>Either no Calling at all,<note place="margin">What is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to a lawfull Calling.</note> or such a Calling as is unlawfull. They who
have no Calling, are unprofitable burdens to the Common-wealth, and
like pernicious humours in the body.</p>
                  <p>Who are these?</p>
                  <p>First, sturdy beggers and rogues, who can worke and will not, but live
upon other mens labours: which kinde of people are not to be suffered in a
Common-wealth. For though we shall have the poore alwayes, <hi>Deut. 15.
11. Mat.</hi> 26. 11. yet there ought to be no beggers, and inordinate walkers,
who eate, labour not, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10, 12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, idle and superfluous Gentlemen, who having no Calling,
spend all their time in pleasure, hunting, hawking, revelling, gaming, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, such as thrust themselves into such Callings for which they
are altogether unfit, and so steale the rewards and profits of it, to which
they have no right.</p>
                  <p>What are unlawfull Callings?</p>
                  <p>Those that have no warrant out of Gods Word, or the Lawes of the
Land: as those that live by unlawfull Arts; as Whores, Bawdes, <hi>Deut. 23.
17,</hi> 18. Witches, Wizards, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 11, 12. Stage-playes, Beare-wards,
Gamesters, and the like.</p>
                  <p>What is opposed to lawfull labour in our Callings?</p>
                  <p>An idle life, which as it is condemned in the seventh Commandement,
as being a cause and incentive of lust: so here as a companion and cause of
theft, <hi>Eph. 4. 28. Prov.</hi> 18. 9. For sloth causeth beggery, and this stealing,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 11. &amp; 28. 19. &amp; 30. 9.</p>
                  <p>What are the kinds of unjust getting out of Contract?<note place="margin">Vnjust getting out of contract.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are two:</p>
                  <p>1. Theft.</p>
                  <p>2. Rapine or Robbery, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 13. Both which men may commit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55421:153"/>
as principals, or accessaries.</p>
                  <p>What is Theft?<note place="margin">Theft.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fraudulent taking of another mans goods, against the knowledge
or the will of the owner; which is the sin that is chiefly forbidden in this
Commandement, and comprehendeth under it all the rest, which is a great
sin strictly forbidden by God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 11. and severely punished, <hi>Zach. 5.
3, 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 10. and by our Lawes also made Capitall.</p>
                  <p>What are the kinds of Theft?</p>
                  <p>They are either Domesticall,<note place="margin">Domesticall theft.</note> and in the Family, or out of the Family.
Thefts in the Family, are either of the wife, or children, or of servants.</p>
                  <p>What is the Theft of the Wife?</p>
                  <p>When she purloineth her Husbands goods, either without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or against his will. For howsoever she have a right unto them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of use, yet the propriety belongeth only to the Husband.</p>
                  <p>What is the Theft of the Children?</p>
                  <p>When they take away their Parents goods, either without their privity,
or against their will: For howsoever Children thinke this to be no Theft,
yet <hi>Salomon</hi> saith otherwise, <hi>Proverbs 28. 24. Whoso robbeth his Father or
his Mother, and saith it is no transgression, the same is the companion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the Theft of Servants?</p>
                  <p>When they are unfaithfull, or wastfull; unfaithfull, when as they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loine
their Masters goods, <hi>John 12. 6. Tit.</hi> 2. 10. or are idle and negligent
in their service, or run away from them, as did <hi>Onesimus, Philem.</hi> 12. or
give away their goods without their knowledge and consent, though it be
to good uses. Wastfull, when as they wastfully and riotously consume
their Masters substance.</p>
                  <p>How is Theft that is committed out of the Family distinguished?</p>
                  <p>It is either of goods,<note place="margin">Theft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of the family.</note> or of persons; of goods, either common and sacred,
and those either private or publick: Private, are such goods as belong to
private men; whether it be Cattell, money, or any thing that is money
worth.</p>
                  <p>What is the Theft of publick things?</p>
                  <p>When things are stollen which belong to the publick State, or Body of
the Common-wealth, which is more hainous and capitall then that which
is committed against a private man. And in this kinde, inclosures of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
are to be reputed as theft, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>What is the Theft of sacred things?</p>
                  <p>When things consecrated to an holy and sacred use,<note place="margin">Sacriledge.</note> are purloined and
embezeled; the which we usually call Sacriledge. As when the utensils
and instruments of divine Worship are stollen; when the Lands or Tythes
devoted unto God for the maintenance of his Ministers are imbased, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
or taken away, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. In which kind, the chiefe offenders are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Patrons; who having only the right of presentation of fit persons, doe
incroach upon part of the Tythes, or sell Church-Livings for money; and
also Proprietaries, who seise upon Church-Livings devoted ro the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Ministry, and convert them to their owne proper and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
use: And finally, the Court Harpies, who seise upon the Revenues of
the Church, by preferring of unworthy, idle, and ambitious men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:55421:153"/>
What doe you thinke of this sin?</p>
                  <p>That it is most hainous, seeing such as commit it, rob God himselfe,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. and thereby bring his heavy curse upon them, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. As we see
in the example of <hi>Achan, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Ananias, Sapphira,</hi>
and the rest.</p>
                  <p>What is the Theft of Persons?</p>
                  <p>It is an hainous sin punished by the Law of God with death,<note place="margin">Theft of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> 
                     <hi>Exod. 21.
16. Deu.</hi> 24. 7. As being so much worse then the theft of goods, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of men are better then they, <hi>Mat. 6</hi> 25. And this is committed by
such as steale men or children, to sell them for slaves; and by lustfull
or covetous wooers, who steale mens daughters to make them their
wives.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of Theft properly so called: VVhat is the other kind which
is more improper?</p>
                  <p>Rapine,<note place="margin">Rapine.</note> which is a violent taking away of another mans goods; which
is done either for his profit who taketh, or to his losse from whom it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And the former is committed under the pretext of Authority and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
power, or else without it. The former are publick theeves, of which
<hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 7. which are worse then common theeves, and
shall be more severely punished, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 6. 6. because their sin is aggravated
by the abusing of their Authority; and because commonly violence
and cruelty is joyned with it, <hi>Zeph. 3. 3. Ezek. 22. 27. Mica. 3. 2, 3.
Esa.</hi> 3. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>What is this Theft called?</p>
                  <p>Oppression,<note place="margin">Oppression.</note> and Extortion; when a man spoyleth his neighbour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of Law, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> did <hi>Naboth, 1 Kings</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>What is that Rapine which is committed without any pretext of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie?</p>
                  <p>It is either in Warre, or in Peace. In Warre, either by Land, when
Souldiers being not content with their pay, doe spoyle and plunder, not
onely their enemies, but also their friends, <hi>Deut. 2. 5, 6. Luke</hi> 3. 14.
Or by sea, when as Pirats they rob and spoyle all they meet with, and
can master.</p>
                  <p>What is that Rapine which is exercised on the Land?</p>
                  <p>It is either robbery by the high-way, <hi>Luke 10. 30. John</hi> 18. and last
verse; or Burglary, when as they break open houses that they may rob
the inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Are there no other to be esteemed Theeves but those onely who act theft
themselves?</p>
                  <p>Yes; They also who are accessaries, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 18. and doe consent to
the theft of others: And these thefts are common to all, or proper to
Superiours. The former is committed before, with, or after the theft.</p>
                  <p>How is a man an accessary before the theft?</p>
                  <p>When he counsaileth or provoketh another unto it,<note place="margin">Accessaries to theft.</note> as <hi>Jezabell</hi> did
<hi>Achab, 1 Kings 21. Prov.</hi> 1. 11, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>How with, or in the theft?</p>
                  <p>Either when he aideth the Theefe, or doth not hinder him when as it
is in his power.</p>
                  <p>How after the theft?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:55421:154"/>
First, when he receiveth, and concealeth what is stolne, or hideth,
or keepeth the Theefe from being apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when he partaketh with him in the stolne goods, <hi>Prov. 29.
24.</hi> And this is done; 1. When he taketh the goods from the Theef, that
he may keep them to himselfe. 2. When hee knowingly buyeth stolne
goods, which ought to be restored to the owners. 3. When by silence
he concealeth the Theefe.</p>
                  <p>How are the Superiours accessary?</p>
                  <p>When they doe any wayes encourage, or doe not punish them: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they doe acquit them for a Bribe.</p>
                  <p>So much of that acquisition, and getting of goods which is out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract:
Now shew that which is in, or by Contract: And first what a
lawfull Contract is, and what is required in it.</p>
                  <p>A Contract is an agreement between parties by mutuall consent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the alienation of goods from one to another,<note place="margin">Acquisition by lawfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> upon some just and
honest conditions. And this either respecteth the things themselves, or
their use for a time.</p>
                  <p>What is required in a lawfull contract?</p>
                  <p>That it be done in simplicity and integrity, without guile and deceit;
unto which three things are required: first, truth in our words: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
fidelity in our promises: thirdly, justice in our deeds, <hi>Psal. 15. 24.
Zac.</hi> 8. 16.</p>
                  <p>What is opposed hereunto?</p>
                  <p>First, all collusion and deceit, whereby one seeketh to circumvent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 6. which is a vice odious unto God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 12. and
severely punished, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 7. &amp; 55. <hi>and last v. Mic.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, lyes in contracting the bargaine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 6. and most of all
when they are confirmed by oathes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, perfidiousnesse in promises, when covenants are not kept.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, injustice in Contracts, when equality is not observed.</p>
                  <p>What are the sorts of things gotten by Contract?</p>
                  <p>They are either of things alienated,<note place="margin">Acquisition by liberall aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or committed to trust: and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is either liberall, or illiberall.</p>
                  <p>What is liberall alienation?</p>
                  <p>It is either for ever, or onely for a certaine time. For ever, as when
things are given absolutely, or upon certaine conditions.</p>
                  <p>What is liberall alienation for a time?</p>
                  <p>When as things are lent for a time, either to be restored in the same, or
in the like kind; as money, corne, and such like.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is opposed hereunto?</p>
                  <p>When the Borrower being able doth not pay all, or not at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, or doth not doe his best endeavour to pay it, <hi>Psalme</hi> 37. 21.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is that Acquisition,<note place="margin">Acquisition by illiberall alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> which you call illiberall alienation?</p>
                  <p>That which is made by way of recompence, or exchange, which is
either of the thing it selfe, or the use of it, or of labour and industrie:
in which the generall rule to be observed is, that there be an equall and
just proportion in the recompence or exchange betweene the things
exchanged; as between the price and thing prised, the industry, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and reward.</p>
                  <p>

VVhat is opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>When as this just proportion is not observed?</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the kindes of the alienation of the thing it selfe?</p>
                  <p>They are two: Either that which is for ever, or that which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  </p>

                  <p>VVhat is required to just selling?</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the person, that he be the just owner, or by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

                  <p>Secondly, in respect of the goods, that it be saleable, and neither sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated
by mixture, nor base and corrupt in respect of the substance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in respect of use, that it be profitable for necessity of life, or
for ornament and delight.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in respect of the manner of selling, that it bee without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deceit.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that it bee sold at a just and equall price, according to the

to the necessary paines and danger which the Seller hath beene at in
getting of it.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is required to the manner of lawfull selling?</p>
                  <p>That it be done with simplicity and integrity, and that we doe not in

                  <p>They are many; and concerne either the Seller himselfe, the Ware, or
things sold, the price, or the manner of selling.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the vices which respect the person of the Seller?</p>
                  <p>First, when as he selleth that which is not his owne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as he selleth that which is not vendible: as first, when
it is defective, and faulty, or not usefull. Secondly, when as it is such a
thing as ought not to be sold, as <hi>Gehazi, 2 Kings</hi> 5. 20. the miracle of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
wrought by divine power. So when Magistrates for Bribes sell ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<hi>Amos 2. 6. Esa.</hi> 5. 23. &amp; 1. 23. Thirdly, when men by lying and
false witnesse-bearing sell the truth; in which ranke, Lawyers are chiefly
to be numbred, who wittingly for Fees plead ill causes.</p>
                  <p>How doth the Seller offend in respect of the price?</p>
                  <p>When as he observeth not a just and equall proportion betweene the
price, and the worth of the thing sold: And this is the vice either of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55421:155"/>
private men, or of whole societies. Private men who thus offend, are
those which we call Regraters, Monopolists, hoarders up of Corne,
and other commodities, to raise the Market by making a dearth and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
                  <p>How doe whole Societies in this kinde offend?</p>
                  <p>First, when as they of the same Trade and Craft agree together to sell
their wares at an unequall rate above the true worth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not to finish the work which another hath begun, though he
dealeth deceitfully and unjustly with his work-Master.</p>
                  <p>What are the sinnes committed by the Seller in respect of the manner?</p>
                  <p>They may be referred to two heads; Either his Words, or Deeds.</p>
                  <p>How offendeth he in Words?</p>
                  <p>First, when as he immoderately praiseth his wares above their true
worth, and concealeth the faults and defects in them, which he well
knoweth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as he asketh much above the worth, and protesteth
that he cannot afford it better cheap.</p>
                  <p>How doth he offend in his Deeds?</p>
                  <p>Either in respect of the kinde, quality, or quantity, of his wares. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the kinde, when as he selleth one thing for another, or one colour
for another, presuming on the ignorance of the buyer.</p>
                  <p>How in respect of the Quality?</p>
                  <p>When as he deceitfully selleth old for new; that which is corrupt and
sophisticated, for that which is pure and simple; and bad for good. To
which end he useth many arts, and false lights, and shewing course and
bad wares, to commend those for the best which he sheweth after, though
they be but a little better.</p>
                  <p>How in respect of the Quantity?</p>
                  <p>When as he detracteth from the just and equal proportion by using false
weights and measures not agreeable to the Standard, using lesse and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when they sell, and larger and heavier when they buy, which God
forbiddeth, as abominable, <hi>Lev. 29. 35, 36. Deut. 25. 14, 15. Prov.</hi> 11. 1. &amp;

                  <p>You have spoken of Selling: Now what is that alienation which is by

                  <p>What is required in buying?</p>
                  <p>Things answerable to those before spoken of in selling: and respect;
first, the person buying: secondly, the thing bought: thirdly, the price gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
and fourthly, the manner of buying.</p>
                  <p>What is required in respect of the person buying?</p>
                  <p>That hee buy onely of him whom hee thinketh to bee the right ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the thing sold: for he that buyeth knowne stolne goods, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth

                  <p>That hee buy that onely which he knoweth may be lawfully bought

Bribery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they that buy Lyes and false Testimonies to prevent Iustice.</p>
                  <p>What is required of the buyer in respect of the price?</p>
                  <p>That according to his knowledge and judgement he give a just, equall,
and proportionable price, according to the true value of the things sold,
and bought; especially when he buyeth of the poore, who are by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

                  <p>That they use all simplicity, and upright dealing, and shun all injustice
and deceit both in their Words and Deeds.</p>
                  <p>How in Words?</p>
                  <p>First, that they doe not offer much under the true value of the wares
they buy, according to their knowledge and judgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that they doe not undeservedly dispraise it, and without
cause, to beat down the price; yea even when they inwardly like and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 14.</p>
                  <p>How in Deeds?</p>
                  <p>When as they doe not pay at all, or lesse then the price that was
agreed upon: and this deceit respecteth either the quality, when as they
put off in payment base and adulterate money; or in quantity, when as
they passe for payment clipt money, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 16. or such as is defective in
weight or number: And to these private thefts in buying, we may adde
one that is more publick; when as the buyer buyeth up and ingrosseth a
whole commodity, that having all in his owne hand, hee may raise the
market, and sell at what rate he listeth.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of that illiberall alienation which is for ever: what is that
which is onely for a time?</p>
                  <p>It is called pawning;<note place="margin">Of pawning, and what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unto it.</note> which is a contract whereby the dominion and
right of a mans goods is alienated from the owner to another man, onely
for a time, upon some condition agreed upon between the parties;
which condition being not observed, the right of the thing belongeth to
the receiver, at least so long till it be performed. And this pawning is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of moveables, and is called properly pawning; or of immoveables,

                  <p>What is his duty who layeth a thing to pawne?</p>

                  <p>What is his duty that receiveth a pawne?</p>
                  <p>First, that if the party be poore, and the thing pawned necessary to
the preservation of life, that either he doe not receive it, or that hee
doe restore it to the owner when his necessity requireth it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 6.

Secondly, that if the borrower be not able to restore it at the appointed

                  <p>So much of the illiberall Alienation of the thing it selfe: Now what is the
illiberall Alienation only of the use?</p>
                  <p>This contract of Alienation concerning only the use,<note place="margin">Of Location and letting.</note> is either location
and letting, which is the alienation of the thing for hire: or hiring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,

                  <p>It is a contract, whereby only the use of a thing, and not the interest and

                  <p>It is a contract,<note place="margin">Of conduction and hiring.</note> whereby a man getteth the use of a thing for a certaine
time, for a just price or reward.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is his duty that thus hireth any thing?</p>
                  <p>First, that he use the thing hired onely for that end and purpose to
which he hired it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he use it no worse then if it were his owne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he restore it to the owner at the time agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that he restore whole and sound the thing hired; or if through

                  </p>
                  <p>What doe you thinke of it?</p>
                  <p>If you speak of that property which the Scriptures forbid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
it is a wicked and unlawfull Contract, into which as a common
sinke, the filth of many other sinnes, and unlawfull Contracts doe runne;

which, if we live and dye in it without repentance, wee are excluded

and not to put our soules, which are of more value then the whole world,
upon nice disputes, and subtle distinctions, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 36.</p>

                  <p>VVhen receiving these spirituall things, they defraude them of their

                  <p>What is required of such as thus imploy others?</p>
                  <p>1. That they give an equall and proportionable recompence to those

                  <p>What then is their Theft?</p>

                  <p>They are either of things committed to others only for safe custody,<note place="margin">Of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited, and committed to trust.</note> or

                  </p>
                  <p>That they faithfully discharge their trust, and doe their will (and not

                  <p>How doe they offend?</p>
                  <p>When they faile in their trust, and aime more at their owne profit, then

                  <p>So much of just getting goods: now in the order propounded we are
come to the just possession, and retention of them: what is required
unto this just possession?</p>
                  <p>Two things.</p>
                  <p>First, the keeping of our owne goods.<note place="margin">Of just pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of goods, and what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the restitution of that which justly belongeth to others.</p>
                  <p>What doth this Commandement require of us in the former respect?</p>
                  <p>That we be not wanting to the just preservation, not onely of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but also of our owne goods.</p>
                  <p>How prove you this.</p>
                  <p>Because our goods are Gods Talents, eommitted unto us; of which
wee must give an account to our great Lord and Master. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if through our owne fault and negligence wee suffer them to bee
lost, or to be taken unjustly from us, we rob our selves, and the poore
also, who have right unto that which wee can well spare from our
owne uses.</p>
                  <p>What doth this Commandement require concerning restitution of other
mens goods?</p>
                  <p>That we readily restore those goods which either we have unjustly
gotten from the right owners,<note place="margin">Of Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it.</note> or which we cannot justly retaine.</p>
                  <p>How doe you prove that goods unjustly gotten ought to be restored?</p>
                  <p>Both by Gods Precepts, the examples of the godly, and necessary
reasons. For the first, God strictly requireth, that if any thing be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
gotten, as either by violence, or by fraud and deceit, or any other
wayes, restitution bee made to the true owner, <hi>Lev. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5. Num.
5.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>By what examples doe you evince it?</p>
                  <p>Before the Law, by the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> and his sonnes, <hi>Gen. 43.
12</hi> 21. Vnder the Law, by the profession of <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> 12. 4. and
the practice of <hi>Micah, Judges</hi> 17. 2. who, though an Idolater, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of it; and of the <hi>Jewes, Nehem.</hi> 5. 11, 12. And under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
we have the example of <hi>Zaccheus, Luke</hi> 19. 8. Yea <hi>Judas</hi> himselfe,
being convinced of his sinne, maketh restitution: so that they herein are
worse then <hi>Judas</hi> who refuse to doe it.</p>
                  <p>What reason have you for it?</p>
                  <p>Because it is a duty necessarily to be performed by all that hope for
salvation: For without restitution wee can neither have any true faith to
perswade us that our sinne of Theft is remitted, nor any sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
For God pardons no sin which we still pertinaciously retaine and
live in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. But he that restoreth not ill-gotten goods, liveth still
in his theft, and repenteth not of it, seeing restitution is an inseparable
fruit of repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 15.</p>
                  <p>But what is to be considered in this restitution?</p>
                  <p>Foure things.</p>
                  <p>First, who is to make it; namely, every man who hath gotten any thing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55421:158"/>
unjustly, either by force or fraud, by contract or out of contract, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and false accusation, by lying, oppression, or any other evill course,
<hi>Luke 19. 8. Numb. 5. 6 Lev.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to whom restitution is to be made; namely, to him who is
wronged, defrauded or oppressed; <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 5. or to his kindred, if he bee
dead, or if none such can be found, to pious uses.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how much ought to be restored; to wit, all the whole that is
unjustly gotten, if he be able, or at least so much to the uttermost as he is
able; yea the Law of God required, that to the principall a fifth part should
be added, <hi>Lev. 6. 5. Numb.</hi> 5. 7. And even equity it selfe requireth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the principall it selfe, so much more should be added as the party is
damnified by this unjust detention of his goods.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when this restitution ought to be made; namely, not at the end
of our lives, or after our death; but as soone as we repent, and desire at Gods
hands that our sin should be forgiven. We must confesse, bewayle, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
our sin, that God may be reconciled unto us, and then we must make
satisfaction to our wronged Neighbour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>What are the things, which though they be justly gotten, yet are unjustly
detained?</p>
                  <p>Such things as others having lost, we have found: For such things come
unto us by the disposing of Gods providence, and we may justly keep
them till we can find out the true owners; so that we make diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after them, with a resolution to restore what we have thus found,
when we know to whom they belong, <hi>Deut. 22. 3. Exod.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the duties which belong to just getting and possession of goods:
Now what is required to the right use of them?<note place="margin">Of the right use and fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things: Fruition, in respect of our selves; and communication, in
respect of others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>What is required to the former?</p>
                  <p>That we thankfully and comfortably enjoy Gods blessings which he
hath bestowed upon us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>How must this be done?<note place="margin">Of parsimony and frugality.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By exercising two vertues. The first is Parsimony or thriftinesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we honestly keep and preserve our goods, that they be not vainly and
unprofitably mis-spent, <hi>John 6. 12. Prov.</hi> 27. 23. to 28.</p>
                  <p>The second is Frugality, whereby we dispose of our goods justly and
honestly gotten, to fit and necessary uses, in a sober and moderate manner.</p>
                  <p>What vertues then must here concurre in the right use of our goods?</p>
                  <p>These foure:</p>
                  <p>1. Iustice in getting them.</p>
                  <p>2. Thriftinesse in keeping them.</p>
                  <p>3. Frugality in enjoying them.</p>
                  <p>4. Liberality in communicating them.</p>
                  <p>For without justice, parsimony degenerateth into covetousnesse; Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
without liberality, into sordid miserlinesse; Liberality without parsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and frugality, into prodigality.</p>
                  <p>What vices are opposed to these vertues?</p>
                  <p>Two:</p>
                  <p>1. Tenacity, or sordid gripplenesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:55421:158"/>
Secondly, profusion, and wastefulnesse.</p>
                  <p>What is tenacity?<note place="margin">Of tenacity &amp; miserlinesse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A kinde of covetousnesse which restraineth men, both from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
their goods to others, and from enjoying them themselves, <hi>Eccles.
6.</hi> 2. &amp; 5. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doe such offend?</p>
                  <p>By committing a double theft.</p>
                  <p>First, against their neighbours, seeing God hath not made them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
owners of their riches, but Stewards, who must dispose of them also
for the good of others, which if they doe not, they rob them of their
right, <hi>James</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, against themselves, in defrauding their owne soules of the
use of those blessings which God hath allowed them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>What doe you think of such Misers?</p>
                  <p>First, that none are more wicked, seeing they are neither good for
themselves, nor others, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 14. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, none poorer, seeing though they possesse much, yet they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
nothing, and want as well what they have, as what they have not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, none more foolish, seeing they want for feare of wanting, and
live poore that they may dye rich.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, none more wretched, seeing they deprive themselves both
of the comforts of this life, and of the joyes of the life to come.</p>
                  <p>What is the other extreame?</p>
                  <p>Profusion and wastfulnesse:<note place="margin">Profusion and Prodigality.</note> And this is two-fold, either in spending
above their meanes in unnecessarie expences, whereby they either ruine
their estates, or expose themselves to the devills tentations, in using un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
meanes to recover that which they have wastfully mis-spent.</p>
                  <p>Or secondly, in wasting their goods in dishonest &amp; riotous courses, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to luxurie and riot, whereby they necessitate themselves to use all
unlawfull meanes to get so much more wealth as may serve to maintaine
their riotous expences; and so Luxury becommeth the mother of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse;
and Covetousnesse the nurse of Luxuriousnesse.</p>
                  <p>What is the use of our goods respecting others?</p>
                  <p>It is by communication or liberall alienation of them for the use and
benefit of others.</p>
                  <p>What vertues are hereunto required?</p>
                  <p>Two: Liberality and Iustice.<note place="margin">Of Liberality.</note> Liberality, whereby we communicate
our goods with a ready and cheerefull minde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Iustice, that we thus communicate that onely which is our
owne. And these must goe hand in hand, and are therefore conjoyned
by <hi>Salomon, Proverbs</hi> 21. 21.</p>
                  <p>What are the kindes of liberall alienation?</p>
                  <p>They are two. For it is for a certaine time onely, or for ever.</p>
                  <p>What is that which is onely for a certaine time?</p>
                  <p>It is either a liberall alienation of the use onely of a thing for a certaine
time,<note place="margin">Of lending.</note> or of the dominion also, and that freely, without any expectation
of recompence. For both these ought to be liberall, respecting onely the
profit of the receiver: and secondly, just, to which is required that that
which is lent bee his own who lendeth it, and fit for his use who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55421:159"/>
it: And this duty is commended, <hi>Psalme</hi> 112. 5. and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Deut. 15. 7. 8, Matth. 5. 42. Luke</hi> 6. 35.</p>
                  <p>What is that alienation which is for ever?</p>
                  <p>It is free giving,<note place="margin">Of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> when as goods are alienated from the true owner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another liberally, and without expectation of any recompence, 2 <hi>Cor.
9. 7. Acts</hi> 20. 35.</p>
                  <p>What is further required to it?</p>
                  <p>That it be not only free, but also just, giving that only which is a mans
owne, and not anothers, which were no better then theft: As when a man
by lavish giving defraudeth his children of their inheritance, or giveth his
goods or lands from his daughters to strangers, or remote kindred of his
name, because he hath no sonnes to continue it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That we make good choice of those upon whom we confer
benefits, either for their worth or indigency; but especially, we must give
and doe good to those who are of the houshold of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>What are the uses unto which we must freely contribute?</p>
                  <p>They are either publick or private, and the publick are either civill or
Ecclesiasticall.</p>
                  <p>What are the Civill?</p>
                  <p>When as we freely give our goods for the service, preservation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Common-wealth, both in the time of peace and warre. To
which uses we must give freely, to the uttermost of our ability: yea, even
above it, when the necessity of the State requireth it, seeing the good of the
whole body must be preferred before the good of any particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>What are the Ecclesiasticall?</p>
                  <p>When as we give freely for the maintenance of the Ministery, and
means of Gods Worship, tending to the salvation of our soules. To which
uses we must give so much the more cheerefully, as the soule is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the body, or outward estate, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. and last. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9.
An example whereof we have in the Israelites, <hi>Exod. 36. 5, 6. 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 9.
And if they were so free and liberall in giving towards the building of the
Tabernacle and Temple, how much more should we towards the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Gods spirituall Houses and Temples for the Holy-Ghost?</p>
                  <p>What are the private uses?</p>
                  <p>For the benefit and reliefe of private men, whose necessity doth require
it of us according to our abilities; and these are those Almes-deeds, and
other works of mercy, unto which the Apostle exhorteth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16.
And are partly fruits of mercy, and partly of brotherly love, and Christian
charity, of which we shall have occasion to speake afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto you have spoken of the duties respecting our owne and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
person, both in regard of life in the sixth, and of chastity in the
seventh, as also our owne and their gods in the eighth. Now what is
the ninth Commandement?</p>

The conservation of truth amongst men, and of our owne and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
fame and good name.</p>
                  <p>Why doth God so much regard truth?</p>
                  <p>Because it is most deare unto him; for he is the God of truth, <hi>Deut. 32. 4.
Psal.</hi> 31. 5. yea truth it selfe, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. Therefore Christ came into the
world, that he might beare witnesse unto the truth, <hi>John</hi> 18. 37. and by
speaking the truth God is glorified, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
                  <p>Why doth he respect so much our fame and good name?</p>
                  <p>Because it is his owne good gift, and therefore he taketh care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that unto us, which himself hath given.</p>
                  <p>What was the occasion of this commandement?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The occasion of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> our naturall corruption, which maketh us prone to lying, <hi>Psal.
58. 3. Rom.</hi> 3. 4. as appeareth hereby, in that we no sooner speak then lye,
and not onely for advantage, but without any cause, out of meer vanity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, out of a naturall disposition men are ready to trespasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the fame and good name of others; and this ariseth out of meere
envie and pride, which maketh us ready to abase others, to advance our
selves: And these corruptions God opposeth in this commandement.</p>
                  <p>What is the thing that is here chiefly forbidden?</p>
                  <p>That we should not in legall proceedings and Courts of justice give a
false testimony concerning our neighbours,<note place="margin">The chiefe sin here forbidden.</note> as appeareth by the words
expresly used, <hi>Thou shalt not answere a false testimony concerning thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
which imply a precedent question or examination, unlesse we will
say that answering is here used for speaking or saying, as it is often times,
<hi>Matth. 11. 25. Luk. 14. 3, 5. Matth.</hi> 28. 5. and then the meaning is, that we
must not give a false testimony of our neighbour either publikely or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
whether it be with or against him; or if we had rather take it of
legall testimonies in Courts of justice, then by a <hi>synecdoche</hi> we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this one kinde understand all other kindes of false testimonies, but this
is here named as the chiefe, and of all the rest most hurtfull and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
to comprehend under it all the rest, as it is in the other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
                  <p>What then is the negative part of this commandement?</p>
                  <p>It generally forbiddeth all false,<note place="margin">The Negative part.</note> vaine, and offensive speeches concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our neighbour, whether it be for or against him, whether in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or out of judgement, although principally here are forbidden all
false testimonies which tend to the prejudice of the fame or state of our
neighbours; or more briefly it forbiddeth all falsity and untruth, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that which is prejudiciall to our neighbour in any respect, or to our
selves.</p>
                  <p>What doth the affirmative part require?</p>
                  <p>Two things:<note place="margin">The Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part.</note> the conservation of the truth, and of our own and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
good name, with all duties of the tongue homogeneall and of the
same nature and kind, with all helps and meanes tending hereunto.</p>
                  <p>Why are our words and speeches so much to be regarded, seeing they are
but winde, as is commonly supposed?</p>
                  <p>Great care is to be had of our speech, seeing it is an excellent faculty
peculiar to man, and being a speciall gift of God it must not be abused to
Gods dishonour and our owne destruction. Neither are words slightly to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55421:160"/>
be regarded, seeing we must give account of every idle word, and by our
words we shall be justified or condemned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 37. And the wise
man telleth us, <hi>that death and life are in the power of the tongue, Pro.</hi> 18. 21.
and that <hi>a wholesome tongue is a tree of life,</hi> whereas an evill tongue <hi>is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
evill, and full of deadly poison, James</hi> 3. 8. which if we doe not subdue
and rule, whatsoever profession we make of Religion it is all in vaine
<hi>James</hi> 1. 26.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of the duties of the tongue here required?</p>
                  <p>That our speeches be both true and charitable:<note place="margin">The summe of the duties here required.</note> for these must insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
goe together; for Charity rejoiceth in truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 6. and the
truth must be spoken in love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15. For truth without love savoureth
of malice, and charity without truth is false, vaine, and foolish.</p>
                  <p>Unto what heads then are these duties of the Tongue, required in this
Commandement, to be referred?</p>
                  <p>Vnto two: 1. The conservation of truth amongst men; And 2. the
conservation of our owne and our neighbours fame and good name.</p>
                  <p>What have you to say concerning Truth?</p>
                  <p>Two things.<note place="margin">Of Truth.</note> First, what this truth is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the meanes of conserving it.</p>
                  <p>What is to be considered in truth it selfe?</p>
                  <p>Three things, First, what it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether it be to be professed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after what manner.</p>
                  <p>What is truth or veracity?</p>
                  <p>It is an habit of speaking that which is true from our hearts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 2.</p>
                  <p>What is required hereunto?</p>
                  <p>Two things. First, that our speech be agreeable to our minds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that our minds be agreeable to the thing: For though we
speak that which is true, yet if we think it false, we are lyers, because our
tongue agreeth not with our mindes: and if that we speak be false, and
yet we think it true, we doe not speak truely, for though truth be in our
hearts, yet a lye is in our mouths; and though we cannot be called lyers,
because we speak as we think, yet may we be said to tell a lye, because
that we say is false.</p>
                  <p>What great necessity is there of this truth?</p>
                  <p>Very great: for if speech be necessary, (as all confesse) then also speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truth, without which there would be no use of speech; for take away
truth, and it were better that we were dumbe, then that we should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with this faculty of speaking</p>
                  <p>What other motives are there to embrace it?</p>
                  <p>Because it is both commended and commanded in the Scripture: It is
commended as a vertue which God greatly loveth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 8. as a note
of a Citizen of heaven, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 2. and of one who shall be established for
ever, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12. 19. It is commanded <hi>Ephes. 4. 25. Zach.</hi> 8. 16, 19.</p>
                  <p>Is it onely sufficient to know the truth and beleeve it?</p>
                  <p>No:<note place="margin">Truth must be professed, and how.</note> we must also upon all fit occasions professe it with our mouthes,
<hi>Rom. 10. 9, 10. Matth.</hi> 10. 32, 33.</p>
                  <p>How must the truth he professed?</p>
                  <p>Freely and simply.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:55421:160"/>
How is it done freely?</p>
                  <p>When as we professe it willingly and undauntedly, so farre forth as
the matter, place, and time doe require. So <hi>Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18. Acts 4. 8,
10,</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>How is it done simply?</p>
                  <p>When as it is done without guile and dissimulation, shifts or shuffles.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite to truth?</p>
                  <p>They are two:<note place="margin">Opposites to truth.</note> First, falsity and lying.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, vanity, or an habite of lying.</p>
                  <p>What is lying?<note place="margin">1. Lying.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is twofold: First, when we speak that which is false.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as we speak that which is true, falsly, and with a mind
to deceive.</p>
                  <p>What is it to speak that which is false?</p>
                  <p>When as we doe not speak as the thing is, whether we thinke it true
or no.</p>
                  <p>What is it to speak falsly?</p>
                  <p>When as we doe not speak as we think, whether the thing be true or
false.</p>
                  <p>What are the reasons which may disswade from lying?</p>
                  <p>1. Because God is true,<note place="margin">Reasons to disswade from lying</note> and the author of truth; and the Devill a lyer,
and the father of lyes; and as truth maketh us
like unto God, so lyes make
us like unto the Devill.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it is strictly forbidden in the Scriptures, <hi>Lev. 9. 11. Exod.
23. 7. Col. 3. 9. Eph.</hi> 4. 25.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the lyer sinneth grievously, not onely against his neighbour,
but also against God himself, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
                  <p>4. Because the Scriptures condemne lying as the spawne of the old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>John</hi> 8. 44. and as a thing abominable and odious unto God, <hi>Pro. 12. 22. &amp;</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p>5. Because it perverteth the use of speech, taketh away all credit and
faith between man and man, and quite overthroweth all humane society,
which cannot stand without contracts and commerce, nor they without
truth.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because God severely punisheth lyes, <hi>Pro. 19. 5, 9. Psal. 5. 6. Acts
5. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> and that both in this life with infamy and disgrace, for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a man esteemed base and of no credit, so that the usuall lyer is not
beleeved when he speaketh truth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 34. 4. And in the life to come, for
it excludeth out of heaven, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 15. and casteth men into that lake
which burneth with fire and brimstone, <hi>chap.</hi> 21. 8.</p>
                  <p>How are lyes usually distinguished?<note place="margin">Three sorts of Lyes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Into three sorts,<list>
                        <item>Merry Lyes.</item>
                        <item>Officious Lyes.</item>
                        <item>Pernicious
Lyes.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>What are merry Lyes?</p>
                  <p>Such as are spoken onely to delight the hearers, and make sport.</p>
                  <p>Are such to be condemned as sinfull, seeing they doe no man hurt?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, for the Scriptures condemne not onely false, but also all
vaine speeches, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:55421:161"/>
Secondly, because they are against truth, and cannot be spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impeaching of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, lies must not be spoken to delight Princes, who have most
cause of care and trouble, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, lyes must not be spoken for profit, and therefore much lesse
for delight.</p>
                  <p>What are officious Lyes?</p>
                  <p>Such as are spoken either for our owne, or neighbours profit, and doe
not hurt any man.</p>
                  <p>Are such lyes unlawfull likewise?</p>
                  <p>Yes surely, and upon the same grounds; for though we may buy the
truth at a deare purchase, yet we must not sell it at any rate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23.
And if it be unlawfull to lye in the cause of God, because it hath no need
to be supported by our lyes, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 7, 8. much lesse for our owne or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
profit.</p>
                  <p>What doe you call Vanity in lying?</p>
                  <p>When men by a corrupt custome are so habituated to lying, that they
will lye for every cause, yea even for no cause, and when they might attain
their ends as well and easily by speaking truth.</p>
                  <p>What vices are opposite to Freedome and Liberty in speaking the truth?</p>
                  <p>They are either in the excesse,<note place="margin">Vices opposite to freedom of speech.</note> or in the defect.</p>
                  <p>VVhat in the excesse?</p>
                  <p>Vnseasonable and undiscreet profession of the truth, with the danger or
losse of our selves or others, when neither the glory of God, nor our own,
or neighbours good doth require it. And in such cases our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
would not professe the truth, though he were pressed unto it by his
malicious enemies, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 20, 21. Because he should thereby have but
cast Pearles before Swine, contrary to his owne Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite in defect?</p>
                  <p>When either out of a cowardly fear, or some other sinister respect wee
deny the truth in our words, or betray it by our silence. Of the former
we have an example in <hi>Peter, Matth. 26</hi> of the other in those weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>But is it not sometime lawfull to conceale the truth?</p>
                  <p>Yes surely, when neither the glory of God, nor our owne, or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
good doe require the profession of it, but yet with this caution,
that we doe not speak any untruth to conceale it. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>What is opposed to simplicity in speaking the truth?</p>
                  <p>Simulation or double dealing;<note place="margin">Opposites to simplicity of speaking truth.</note> which is two-fold, either in our words,
or deeds.</p>
                  <p>What is that in our words?</p>
                  <p>When wee speake one thing, and thinke another, or speake with an
heart and a heart, in the Scripture phrase, <hi>Psalme</hi> 12. 2. This is called
a deceitfull tongue and mouth, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 13. and a tongue that frameth
deceit, <hi>Psalme</hi> 50. 19. as it is described, <hi>Psalme 52. 22. Ier.</hi> 9. 8, 9. The
which is to be avoyded, <hi>Psalme</hi> 34. 14. and Christs example to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
                  <p>What is simulation in our deeds?</p>
                  <p>When as one thing is pretended, and another thing is intended. So
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55421:161"/>
                     <hi>Ioab</hi> killed <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Amasa</hi> under pretence of friendship. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this is esteemed policie with men, yet it is odious to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 7.
and punished with immature death, <hi>Psal. 55 and last.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have spoken of truth it selfe, and the opposites unto it; now shew
what are the meanes of it?</p>
                  <p>They are of two sorts.<note place="margin">Means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving truth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that it may be amongst men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it may have a profitable being.</p>
                  <p>What is required to the being of it.</p>
                  <p>Two things.</p>
                  <p>First, that it may be knowne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that being knowne, it may be preserved.</p>
                  <p>What is required to the knowing of it?</p>
                  <p>Two things.</p>
                  <p>First, a love of the truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, teachablenesse.</p>
                  <p>What is the love of the truth?</p>
                  <p>First, when as men are so affected towards the truth, that they study
with all their endeavour to get it, but will not sell it at any price, <hi>Proverbs
23,</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as they are willing to defend it upon all occasions,
<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 4. 33.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>First, love of lies, which excludeth out of heaven, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, voluntary ignorance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite to the defence of truth?</p>
                  <p>When as it is deserted or opposed.</p>
                  <p>What is teachablenesse?</p>
                  <p>A fruit of the love of truth: when as men are ready and willing to
admit the truth, and to give place to better reasons, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11.</p>
                  <p>What is further required to the preserving of truth?</p>
                  <p>That we be constant, and not carried away with every winde of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. And these two vertues must concurre: for teachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
without constancy degenerateth into levity and vain credulity, and
constancy without teachablenesse into pertinacie.</p>
                  <p>What are the meanes of the profitable being of truth amongst men?</p>
                  <p>Profitable speech; which is accompanied and furthered with curtesie,
and civility, and remedied with silence.</p>
                  <p>When is our speech profitable?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Profitable speech.</note> when it advanceth Gods glory, either in respect of the matter
of it, or the end. The matter, when as we praise God, and celebrate his
glory, <hi>Psalme 50. and last. Ephes. 5. 4. Iames</hi> 5. 13. And Gods glory
is the end of our speech, when as it is chiefely referred thereunto.</p>
                  <p>How doth our speech tend to our neighbours profit?</p>
                  <p>First and chiefly when it tendeth to his spirituall good and edification,
as instructing the ignorant, counselling them that need counsell, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the afflicted, strengthening the weak, exhorting the sluggish, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
them that erre, and rebuking them who wilfully offend.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when it tendeth to his temporall profit either for his honest
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55421:162"/>
delight in a witty and facetious way, called Vrbanity, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the sauce that seasoneth truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. or for his profit, when
as it hath some necessary use for the good of his body or state.</p>
                  <p>What is the meanes of furthering this profitable truth in our speeches?</p>
                  <p>Curtesie and affability,<note place="margin">Curtesie and affability.</note> which is a vertue whereby we are easily drawn
to communicate with others, by talking with them in a humane and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
manner, with expressions of love and good-will: an example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have in Christ, <hi>John</hi> 4. 7, 10. who for this cause was said to be a
friend to publicans and sinners.</p>
                  <p>What is the remedy against the contrary vice?</p>
                  <p>Taciturnity,<note place="margin">Seasonable si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> or seasonable silence, which is a vertue that keepeth
counsell, and restraineth us from uttering secrets, or any unprofitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary,
and unseasonable speeches, which in the Scriptures is made a
note of a wise man, <hi>Pro. 17. and last, 10. 19. Jam.</hi> 1. 19. and is commended
to all, especially to women, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and young men in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of their elders and betters, <hi>Ecclus</hi> 32. 9. And these two vertues, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citurnity
and affability, must goe together; for affability without season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
silence degenerateth into vaine babling; and silence without affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
into Cynicall sullennesse, and sowre churlishnesse.</p>
                  <p>What are the opposites to these vertues, and namely to profitable speech?</p>
                  <p>They are two:<note place="margin">Opposites to profitable speech.</note> First, speech unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which is hurtfull.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is unprofitable and vaine speech?<note place="margin">1. Vnprofitable</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is not referred either to Gods glory, or our own or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
good, which is condemned in the Scripture, <hi>Psal. 12. 2. Deut. 5. 20.
Tit. 3. 9. Pro.</hi> 30. 8. and accountable at the day of judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36.</p>
                  <p>What is hurtfull speech?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">2. Hurtfull speech.</note> that which tendeth to Gods dishonour, as imprecations, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
rash and false oaths.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which tendeth to our owne and neighbours hurt, and
is opposed either to edification, or the temporall good of his person,
name, or state.</p>
                  <p>What is speech opposite to edification?</p>
                  <p>Rotten and unsavoury speech,<note place="margin">3. Rotten speech.</note> 
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 29. which is called rotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it springeth from a rotten and poisonous fountaine, and is also apt
to infect and poison the hearers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33.</p>
                  <p>What are the kinds of this rotten speech?</p>
                  <p>They are many: as by our words to misse-lead men, to give evill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
grieve the afflicted, to encourage men to run on in sinne, to praise men
in their evill courses, and the like.</p>
                  <p>What vices are opposed to Urbanity?</p>
                  <p>There are divers: some in the excesse, as witty speeches wantonly
wicked, scurrility, talkativenesse, and vaine babling. In the defect, such
speeches as are foolish and unsavoury.</p>
                  <p>VVhat vices are opposite to Affability?</p>
                  <p>In the excesse, counterfeit Complements, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 5. Secondly, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and idle talk. And in the defect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Morosity, and churlish speeches.</p>
                  <p>VVhat vices are opposed to seasonable silence?</p>
                  <p>Prating, and immoderate and unseasonable multiplying of words, <hi>Pro.
10. 19. Psal.</hi> 140. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:55421:162"/>
Secondly, futility, when men can hold in no secrets; but unseasonably
vent out all that is in their mindes, <hi>Prov. 15. 28. and 12. 23. and 29. 11. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus
21.</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, unseasonable suppressing of truth with silence.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of conserving of truth, now speak of our fame and good
name: and first shew why it is to be respected?</p>
                  <p>We ought to have singular care of preserving of our owne and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
good name,<note place="margin">Fame and good name.</note> because it is no lesse deare to a good man then his life,
<hi>Eccles. 7. 2. Pro. 15. 30. &amp;</hi> 22. 1.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is required to the conserving of our neighbours good name?</p>
                  <p>First, an internall disposition, care, and study of preserving it, which
we shall shew by these fruits: First, when we are glad of it, and rejoice in
it, <hi>Rom. 1. 8. Coloss.</hi> 1. 3, 4. and are grieved when as it is blacked and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished.</p>
                  <p>VVhat other fruits are there of it?</p>
                  <p>They respect either our hearing, judgment, or reports.</p>
                  <p>Our hearing; first, when as we shut our eares to whisperers and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
for their detractions and slanders cannot hurt our neighbours good
name, if we will not heare and beleeve them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25. 23. And this is a note
of a Citizen of heaven, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as we willingly and cheerfully heare the praises of
our neighbours, which is a signe of an honest heart, that is free from self-love
and envie.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is required in the judgement?</p>
                  <p>A candid and ingenuous disposition to preserve our neighbours fame,
and in all things doubtfull to judge the best of his words and deeds.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the fruits hereof?</p>
                  <p>Not to nourish hard conceits of him, but when they arise to suppresse
them, if the grounds of them be not very probable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not to beleeve rashly any evill of our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to take and conster all things well done and spoken by him
in the best sense.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to interpret and take things doubtfull in the better part.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the fruits respecting reports?</p>
                  <p>Silence and secrecy: For it is a Christian duty to keep secret our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
faults, which proceed from infirmity and humane frailty, unlesse it
be to amend him by admonition or seasonable reproofe, <hi>Lev. 19. 17. Matth.
18. 15, 16. Gen. 37. 2. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 11. or to give warning to the hearer, that he
may prevent some evill that is intended against him, <hi>Jer. 40. 14. Act. 23.
16.</hi> or to preserve him that he be not infected with the contagion of his
sinne with whom he converseth: or finally, when himselfe is necessitated
to discover anothers faults and crimes, lest by silence he become accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto them, as in case of Felony, Murther, or Treason, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 19. 8.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite to these vertues?</p>
                  <p>To the care of preserving our neighbours name is opposed,</p>
                  <p>First, carelesnesse, as if it did not concerne us, which argueth defect
of love.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a study and desire to detract from his fame, and to lessen his
credit and estimation, which is a fruit of hatred and envie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:55421:163"/>
What are the vices opposite to those vertues which respect the meanes?</p>
                  <p>They are referred either to hearing, the judgement, or report.</p>
                  <p>What are those which respect hearing?</p>
                  <p>First, to have itching eares after such rumors as tend to our Neighbors
infamy and disgrace, forbidden, <hi>Exod. 23. 1. Prov.</hi> 17. 4. which was <hi>Sauls</hi>
sin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to have our eares open to heare calumnies and reproaches,
and shut to our Neighbours praises, which is a fruit of envy and self-love.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices which respect the judgement?</p>
                  <p>They are vices opposite to candid ingenuity; as first, suspiciousnesse,
when we suspect evill of our Neighbour without just cause, and upon
every slight occasion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. which is a false testimony of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to beleeve rashly rumors reported from others, tending to
the disgrace of our Neighbours, which have no sure ground; which was
<hi>Putiphars</hi> fault, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 19. and <hi>Davids, 2 Sam.</hi> 16. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hard and uncharitable censures; either in respect of their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and doings, sinisterly interpreting things well spoken or done, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
things doubtfull in the worst sense: or in respect of their persons,
censuring and condemning them rashly, when as we have no just cause,
1 <hi>Sam. 1. 13. Acts 2. 13. Luke</hi> 7. 39. and 13. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 4.</p>
                  <p>What vice respecteth report?</p>
                  <p>First, when as men raise false reports against their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as they discover uncharitably their secret faults, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
arising from infirmity and humane frailty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite to the externall profession of truth, concerning our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which ought to be charitable?</p>
                  <p>First, a malicious testimony, though true, which ariseth from malice
and envy, and tendeth to a sinister and evill end, 1 <hi>Sam. 22. 9. Psal. 52.
3,</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a false testimony, which is either simply false, as that 1 <hi>King.
21. 13. Acts</hi> 6. 13. or true in the letter of the words, but false in the sense,
as that against thirst, <hi>Mat. 26. 60, 61. John</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>Into what sorts are testimonies spoken of in this Commandement to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished?</p>
                  <p>They are either publick,<note place="margin">Publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> or private; and the publick, either in the
Courts of Iustice, or out of them.</p>
                  <p>Of which doth this Commandement principally speake?</p>
                  <p>Of publick and Legall Testimonies, which are to be regarded above
others, because it is the judgement of God rather then man, <hi>Deut. 1. 17.
2 Chron.</hi> 19. 6. and therefore he that perverteth this judgement, maketh
God himselfe as much as in him is, guilty of his sin of injustice.</p>
                  <p>What are the kinds of Legall Testimonies?</p>
                  <p>They are either of the Iudge, or of the Notary, or the parties suing,
contending and pleading, or of the Witnesse.</p>
                  <p>What is the Testimony of the Judge?</p>
                  <p>It is his sentence which he giveth in the cause tryed before him.</p>
                  <p>What is herein required of him?</p>
                  <p>First, that before he give sentence, he throughly examine and finde out
the truth and equity of the cause, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 14. &amp; 17. 4. &amp; 19. 18. according
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55421:163"/>
to Gods owne example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 9, 10. &amp; 18. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that in passing sentence he judge according to truth, justice,
and equity: for Iudges must be men of truth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. Secondly, just
and righteous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 16. &amp; 16. 20. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 15. And thirdly, not just in a
rigid and extreame way, according to the letter of the Law; but so as when
there is just occasion he must moderate the rigour of the Law with equity,
which is the true sense and life of the Law.</p>
                  <p>But is not the Judge to give sentence according to things legally
alleadged and proved?</p>
                  <p>Yes ordinarily. But if he undoubtedly upon his owne certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
know, that things are otherwise then they seeme to be by Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
pleadings and reasons alleadged, he must judge according to knowne
truth, and defend the cause, being just, which is oppressed by false eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and reasons, or otherwise he shall sin against his owne knowledge
and conscience, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>They are two:</p>
                  <p>1. Rash.</p>
                  <p>2. Perverse judgement.</p>
                  <p>What is rash Judgement?</p>
                  <p>It is done divers wayes:<note place="margin">Rash Iudgment</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, when as the Iudge pronounceth sentence before the cause be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
examined and knowne, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when as they condemne any man before they have heard his
cause, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when as they pronounce sentence, having heard one part only.
So <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 16. 4. Let such remember that of <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 18. 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when as they in matters concerning life and death give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon the single testimony of one witnesse, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6.</p>
                  <p>Whas is perverse Iudgement?<note place="margin">Perverse Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>When as truth is oppressed, and justice and right is perverted, whereby
the wicked is acquitted, and the just condemned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. which for
the most part hapneth, because the Iudge is corrupted with bribes, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
persons, both which are forbidden and condemned, <hi>Deut. 16. 18,
19. Exod. 23. 8. Prov.</hi> 24. 23, 24. &amp; 28 21. <hi>Lev. 19. 15. Deut.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>What must Iudges doe to avoid this?</p>
                  <p>They must ever remember that in the Seat of Iustice they represent
God himselfe, and in that regard are called Gods, <hi>Exod. 22. 28. Psal 82.
1,</hi> 2. and therefore they must judge as God would if he were present,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. which if they doe not, they must expect that woe threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 23. Neither must they protract suites, but put as speedy an end
unto them as the cause will permit, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 17. 23.</p>
                  <p>What is the duty of the Notary?</p>
                  <p>That they commit things truly to writing, conserve them truly, and
truly recite them.</p>
                  <p>What are the Persons suing and contending in Law?<note place="margin">The duties of the Plaintiffe, and the vices opposite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are either the principall, or lesse principall: The principall are
the Plaintiffe and Defendant, to both which this common duty belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:55421:164"/>
1. That they doe not contend in Law, unlesse in their consciences
they are perswaded that their cause is good &amp; just; yea and necessary also.</p>
                  <p>2. That in pursuing of it they doe not say or doe any thing that is
false and unjust.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>First, to commence suits out of a love and desire of contention.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to produce false instruments, writings, proofes, seales, and
suborne false witnesses.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall corruptions of the Plaintiffe?</p>
                  <p>First, to calumniate upon a false or uncertaine ground, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 16.
So <hi>Haman, Esth.</hi> 3. 8. So <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when prevaricating and trifling in the cause, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
and let passe weighty matters and hainous crimes, and insist upon
those which are light, feigned, and impertinent; so as they may seem to
dally and trifle with their adversary, rather then to contend in a legall
manner.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when as they fall off, and hang back from a just accusation
once undertaken.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall sinnes of the Defendant?</p>
                  <p>To defend himselfe in a false way; which is done in a various
manner.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The vices of the Defendant.</note> by false speaking, in denying the fault whereof hee is accused,
and standeth guilty, as it is usuall among us; whereas wee should give
glory unto God by confessing our sinne, <hi>Ios. 7. 19. Iob</hi> 31. 33. and not by
denying the truth, to adde sin unto sins</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by concealing and hiding the truth, which hee ought to
confesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by answering indirectly; and so waving a just accusation.
So <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>How else doth the Defendant offend?</p>
                  <p>First, by making an unjust appeale to protract the suit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by resisting a just sentence, which is to resist Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in a lawfull power instituted by him, and so to make himselfe liable
to damnation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, to undertake the defence of such causes onely as in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appeare to be good and just.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to defend them in a true and just manner.</p>
                  <p>VVhat are the corruptions opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>First, wittingly, to undertake the defence of ill and unjust causes,
wherein they sinne; First, against God, whilst they labour to overturne
truth and judgement, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, against their neighbour: as First, against the Iudge, in
seeking to corrupt his judgement, that hee may passe an unjust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
Secondly, against his Client, by incouraging him in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
course, if hee prevaile; or defrauding him of his money, if hee
doe not: Thirdly, against his adversary, whom he woundeth, either in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55421:164"/>
his body, goods, or fame, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, against his owne soule: first, in a sinfull defence of an unjust
cause, <hi>Exod. 23. 1. 2. Chr. 19. 2. Rom.</hi> 1. 31. 2. Secondly, by setting his
tongue to sale to speak lyes for fees, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 6. and with their tongue
their soules also.</p>
                  <p>What other vice doe Lawyers commit by handling of their causes in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
manner?</p>
                  <p>They handle them ill,</p>
                  <p>First, by lying either for their client, or against their adversary; in
both which they are guilty of a false testimony.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by prevarication in betraying the cause of their Client,
whilst they seeme to defend it: and this is the worst kinde of cousenage
and theft.</p>
                  <p>What is the testimony of the witnesse which this Commandement speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
respecteth, and what is required unto it?</p>
                  <p>Two things.<note place="margin">The duty of witnesses.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that he be ready and willing to give his testimony when need
requireth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he doe give a true testimony.</p>
                  <p>When doth need require it?</p>
                  <p>Either when lawfull authority calleth for it; or when thereby he can
doe his neighbour good, <hi>Prov. 24. 11. Psal. 82. 4. Prov.</hi> 14. 25.</p>
                  <p>What are the vices opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>First, to detract and with-hold a true testimony. Secondly, to give a
false testimony.</p>
                  <p>What doe you thinke of this sinne?</p>
                  <p>That it is odious, &amp; abominable to God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 18. and therefore God
made choice of this sin as most hainous, to comprehend under it also sins
of the like kinde, as in the other Commandements forbidding murther,
adultery, theft.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because he addeth perjurie to his false testimonie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because he sinneth against the Iudge, whom he laboureth to
pervert, against the Plaintiffe and the Defendant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 18. and most
of all against his owne soule, as before, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 5. 9. &amp; 21. 28. <hi>Deut.
19. 16. 19. Apoc.</hi> 21. 15. &amp; 21. 8.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of publike testimonies in Courts of Justice: Now what
are those which are given out of Courts?</p>
                  <p>They are either open and manifest, or else hid and secret.</p>
                  <p>What are those that are open and manifest?</p>
                  <p>They are either in the publick ministery of the Word, or in publick
Writings, or in Elections.</p>
                  <p>How in the publick Ministery?</p>
                  <p>He giveth therein a false testimony,<note place="margin">False testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministery of the word.</note> who preacheth false Doctrine,
which is repugnant to Gods glory, or hindreth mans salvation, which
God hath appointed to be punished with death, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 3. And the
same is to be said of those who in their publick writings broach errours,
or oppose the truth.</p>
                  <p>How in elections?</p>
                  <p>When those are not preferred that are worthy, but those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55421:165"/>
for in elections men testifie their excellency that are chosen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others.</p>
                  <p>What are the false testimonies that are hidden and in secret?</p>
                  <p>They are either in infamous Libels, which by the Civill Law disable a
man from giving any testimony; or the spreading of false rumours, and
scandalous reports, tending to the disgrace of our neighbours, <hi>Exod.
23.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of publike testimonies, now what are private tectimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
or the private profession of the truth with charity?</p>
                  <p>It is either of the vertues, or vices of our neighbours.</p>
                  <p>What is the duty which respects the vertues of our neighbours?</p>
                  <p>It is willingly to acknowledge, and ingenuously to commend, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and good parts of our neighbours, both absent and present, to the
glory of God that gave them, and the encrease of vertue in him that hath
received it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>What is that duty which respecteth the vices of our neighbour?</p>
                  <p>It is freely to admonish and reprove him being present, <hi>Matth. 18. 15.
Lev. 19. 17. Pro. 27. 5, 6. Psal.</hi> 141. 5. and in his absence to cover his faults,
as far as will stand with justice and charity, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>What are the opposite vices?</p>
                  <p>They are two: Flattery, and evill speaking.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is flattery?</p>
                  <p>It is faire and fawning speech,<note place="margin">Flattery.</note> whereby a man is falsly and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praised.</p>
                  <p>How doth the Flatterer offend?</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the object, when they commend another either for
a thing doubtfull and uncertaine, whether it be good or evill; or for a
knowne evill, <hi>Pro. 28. 4. &amp;</hi> 24. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of the manner, and that either in dissimulation, <hi>Pro.
27.</hi> 24. or above measure, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in respect of the end, and that either for their owne profit, as
Parasites doe; or for his hurt and ruine whom they flatter, <hi>Pro. 29. 5. Jer.
9. 8. Matth.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the second opposite vice?</p>
                  <p>It is evill speaking:<note place="margin">Evill speaking.</note> and this is either against one present, by railing and
reproachfull words, tending to his discredit and disgrace, <hi>Matth. 5. 22.
1 Cor.</hi> 6. 10. and by scoffing and mocking, which is a kind of persecution,
<hi>Gen. 21. 9 Gal.</hi> 4. 29. Or else against one absent, which is whispering, or
obtrectation, or detraction.</p>
                  <p>What evils are in the vice of whispering?</p>
                  <p>Whisperers defame their neighbours,<note place="margin">Whispering.</note> by discovering their faults and
failings; dissolve all friendship between man and man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 28. and sow
dissensions between them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 26. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they spoile their neighbours of their good name, which is
better then riches, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22. 1. and more sweet then a precious ointment,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 2. and also of their friends, by sowing discord amongst them,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 19.</p>
                  <p>What is Obtrectation?<note place="margin">Obtrectation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The blacking and branding of our neighbours good name by secret
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55421:165"/>
and malitious words; and that either by detracting from his vertues, or by
malitious discovering of his vices.</p>
                  <p>VVhat doe you thinke of this vice?</p>
                  <p>That it is a grievous sinne: for it deeply woundeth our neighbour in
his life, goods, and fame. In which regard it is compared to Bowes and
Arrowes that shoot in secret, <hi>Ier. 9. 3. 8. Psal.</hi> 64. 3, 4. to coales of Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>Psalme</hi> 120. 4. to a Sword, <hi>Psalme 64. 3. Proverbs</hi> 12. 18. to a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
<hi>Psalme</hi> 52. 2. to the tongue of a Serpent, <hi>Psalme 140. 3. Eccles.
10,</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>How should we keep our selves from it, being naturally addicted to it?</p>
                  <p>By considering that the Scriptures forbid it, <hi>Lev. 19. 16. Iames
4.</hi> 11. and condemne it as an hainous sinne, <hi>Psalme 50. 20. Ezek. 22. 9.
Rom.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it is a signe of an hypocrite, who will declame
against the sinnes of others, that themselves may be thought religious,
<hi>James</hi> 1. 26.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because above other sinnes it maketh men like unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
who hath his name from slandering, being a slanderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
2 <hi>Tim. 3. 3. Tit.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because Gods heavy judgements and punishments are denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against it, <hi>Psalme 50. 20, 21. Ezek. 22. 9. Psalme</hi> 52. 5. &amp; 15. 3.</p>
                  <p>But is it not lawfull to speake truely of our neighbours faults?</p>
                  <p>There are few detracters and back-biters doe so, but either devise ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of things that are not, or adde something that is untrue of their
owne. But though a man speak truth, yet if it be malitiously to doe
hurt, or out of a vaine custome to keep their tongue in ure, he is a slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and offendeth, if not against truth, yet against charity.</p>
                  <p>What is the chiefe cause of detraction?</p>
                  <p>To be curious in prying into other mens lives and manners, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in looking into our owne, and judging our selves.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of concerning our neighbours fame: now what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the conserving of our owne?</p>
                  <p>Two things.<note place="margin">Conserving of our own good name.</note> First, that every one have a care of preserving his owne
good name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that every one give a true testimony of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>What is to be considered in the former?</p>
                  <p>Three things. First, what this good fame is. Secondly, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be esteemed, that hereby we may be moved to this care of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it. Thirdly, by what meanes it may be attained unto and kept.</p>
                  <p>What is good Fame?</p>
                  <p>It is a good opinion and esteem which men conceive of others for their
vertues and deeds well done. And this is highly to be valued, <hi>Proverbs
22. 1. Eccl.</hi> 7. 2. as being not onely profitable to our selves, but also unto
others, who are refreshed with the smell of this fragrant oyntment; and
studiously to be sought after, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth the care of conserving our good name consist?</p>
                  <p>First, in prosecuting, and using the meanes of getting it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in avoyding the meanes of both vaine-glory, and also
infamy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:55421:166"/>
VVhat are the meanes of getting and conserving our fame and good
name?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The meanes of getting a good name.</note> and above all things to seek Gods glory, his kingdome and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and to glorifie him by our serious study to walke before him
in holinesse of life, and the exercise of all good workes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. &amp; 5.
16. <hi>Psalme 112. 6. 1 Sam. 2. 30. Prov.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must avoyd the meanes of vain-glory, whereby men
seek more the praise of men then of God, <hi>John</hi> 12. 43. &amp; 5. 44.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to preferre the testimony of a good conscience, before the
applause of men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to look more to the inward, then the outward man, and take
more care to be good then to seeme good, and to approve our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God then our outward actions unto men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, to avoid hypocrisie and dissimulation, which though for a time
it may gaine the praise of men, yet at length God will pull off this false
vizard, and expose the hypocrite to shame and contempt.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, to shun that glory which men seek to gain by vanity and vice,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 18. which were to glorie in our shame.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, to abhorre flatterers, and parasites, and to love those who
faithfully admonish us when we erre, and reprove us when we offend,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 18.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, to be severe in judging our selves, and charitable in censuring
others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 1, 2. For if we thinke well of others, they likewise
will thinke well of us.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, not to undertake great matters above our strength to gaine an
opinion of our great parts and abilities, but to be lowly in our own eyes,
<hi>Psalme 131. 1. Luke</hi> 14. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>But may we not at all in our good actions seek the praise of men?</p>
                  <p>We may not principally, and in the first place aime at this end in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
our duties, but rather Gods glory, and the adorning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
which we professe; yet if God cast upon us this blessing of a good
name and praise of well-doing, as a vantage unto the bargaine, it is not
to be neglected; seeing contempt of others opinion of us, especially
those that are good, argueth both arrogancy, and desperate dissolutenesse;
wee must seek Gods glory by good report, and evill report, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8.
But if he be pleased to blesse us with unaffected fame, let us thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it, and use it as incouragement in well-doing, <hi>Phil. 4. 8. Rom. 13. 3.
1 Pet.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>What are the meanes of infamy from our selves?</p>
                  <p>All manner of sinne. For as sinne is the cause of shame, so shame the
punishment of sinne. Therefore all sinne is to bee avoyded of him that
would preserve his fame. As first, open sinnes, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 1. Yea
not onely the sinne it selfe, but all appearance of it, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 22. Rom.
14.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, secret sins, which if they be not repented of, God will
discover them to our shame, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 12. if not in this life, yet at Christs
comming before men and Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 17. &amp; 12. 2. <hi>Matth. 25. 31. Luk.
8. 17. 1 John</hi> 2. 28.</p>
                  <p>What are the meanes of infamy from others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:55421:166"/>
Either the opprobrious obloquies of Railers, or the rumours and
whisperings of Back-biters and Sycophants, against which we are bound
to preserve our fame by speaking, writing, and (if need bee) the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Magistrate; especially if we be publike persons, whose infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
may prejudice the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken of conserving our fame, what say you to the second
thing propounded, that is, a true testimony of our selves?</p>
                  <p>Every one is bound by this Commandement to give a true testimony
of himselfe,<note place="margin">A true testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our selves.</note> as occasion is offered: For as we must speake nothing but
truth of our neighbours, so also of our selves.</p>
                  <p>How is this done?</p>
                  <p>Either by modest acknowledging that which is good in us, or ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confessing that which is evill; or by denying a false good attributed
unto us, modestly and humbly, or a false evill, wisely and warily.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>When as we give a false testimony of our selves, by denying any truth;
or affirme any thing false concerning our selves, whether it be good or
evill.</p>
                  <p>May we then acknowledg that which is good in our selvs without vanity?</p>
                  <p>Yes, if we do it with modesty, and chiefly to Gods glory, from whom
we have received all that is good in us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite to the profession of truth concerning our selves?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The opposites to the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of truth concerning our selves.</note> an ironicall speech, whereby true good in our selves is denied.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, boasting or bragging, whereby it is falsly arrogated.</p>
                  <p>How is the former vice committed?</p>
                  <p>Either out of simplicity, when in an humble conceit of themselves men
speak as they think, though it be not true, and therefore doe not properly
lye, because their words agree with their minde; who are not wholly to
be justified, because they speak that which is not true, yet their falsity is
no more to be condemned then their humility to be commended. And
such was the excuse of <hi>Moses, Exod. 3. 11. &amp;</hi> 4. 10. 13. and of <hi>Jeremy, Jer. 1. 6</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or secondly, they speak worse of themselves then they are in their own
opinion, and that either out of modesty, to avoid bragging; which though
it cannot be wholly excused from being sinfull, because it is ingratitude
to God to deny his gifts, and so derogatory to his glory and bounty, and
not free from lying, yet it is extenuated by modesty and humility; or else
it proceedeth from a dissembled and counterfeit modesty and pride of
heart, when men deny the good that is attributed unto them in a slight
manner, to draw on double praise; and so men offend both in opposing
truth by lying, and humility also by seeking praise in a cunning way.</p>
                  <p>What is the other opposite?</p>
                  <p>Boasting and arrogancy.<note place="margin">Arrogancy and boasting.</note> For as we must truly professe the good that
is in us, or done by us, to Gods glory, when need requireth, in a modest
manner; so must we carefully shun all vaine bragging, in arrogating unto
our selves that good which belongeth not to us, or extolling it above due
measure, seeing it cannot stand with modesty, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 2. and is opposite
to Gods glory, from which we so much detract as we arrogate to our
selves, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. John</hi> 5. 31.</p>
                  <p>In what respect doth the arrogant boaster offend?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>How in respect of the manner?</p>
                  <p>When this boasting is contrary to truth or charity: To truth, either
in respect of the thing it selfe, or of opinion.</p>
                  <p>How in respect of the thing it selfe?</p>
                  <p>When he arrogateth to himselfe the good he hath not, or in a greater
measure then it is: So <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 33, 35.</p>
                  <p>How in respect of opinion?</p>
                  <p>Either his owne, when he arrogateth that to himselfe which in his
owne opinion belongeth not to him: or the opinion of others, when his
boasting exceedeth that merit and worth, which men truely conceive is
not his due, or above that measure that he deserveth.</p>
                  <p>How doth he sinne against charity?</p>
                  <p>Both in respect of God, and his Neighbour. In respect of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
openly and professedly, as when he arrogates to himselfe that which
is due onely to him, <hi>Ezek. 28. 2. Exod. 5. 2. Esa. 36. 20. Dan.</hi> 3. 15. Or else
more covertly and cunningly, when he spoyles God of his glory, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
the praise of the good things he hath given him unto himselfe,
<hi>Esa.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of his neighbour, when as his owne praises tend
to the disgrace of others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 10.</p>
                  <p>How doe men sinne in respect of the end?</p>
                  <p>When as they boast and bragge, either for their glory, which usually
is accompanied with shame, <hi>Rom. 1. 22. Pro.</hi> 26. 12. Or for their gaine, as
when they glory in their skill to draw on profit; which is the practice of
Empericks and Mountebancks, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>What is the confession of truth concerning the evill that is in us, or
done by us?</p>
                  <p>It is either before God,<note place="margin">Confession of sinne.</note> or men: Before God we must confesse our sins,
if we expect to have them pardoned, <hi>Pro 28. 13. 1 John 1. 9. Psal.</hi> 32. 5.</p>
                  <p>How are they to be confessed before men?</p>
                  <p>So farre forth as the glory of God requireth it, <hi>Josh. 7. 19. John</hi> 1. 10.
or the good and salvation of our neighbours, or our owne profit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
<hi>James</hi> 5. 15. otherwise it is not necessary that we should lay them
open to our owne shame. But howsoever we may conceale that which
is evill in us, yet when it is questioned we must not deny that which is
true, nor confesse that which is false in us: For by denying the truth, we
lye, and adde sin unto sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 15. and by confessing that evill falsly
which is not in us, we also lye, and expose our selves to disgrace and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

                  <p>VVhat is the Tenth Commandent?</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours House,<note place="margin">The 10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> thou

                  </p>
                  <p>VVhat is the sinne chiefely here forbidden?</p>
                  <p>Concupiscence, that is, those secret and internall sinnes, which goe
before consent of will, and are the seedes of all other vices, of which
sort are wicked and corrupt inclinations, thoughts, desires, which are
repugnant to charity.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the end of this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>It respecteth either God,<note place="margin">The end of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> our Neighbours, or our Selves.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the end which respecteth God?</p>
                  <p>That He might shew the perfection of that Charity which in His Law
He requireth of us, and the excellency of it above all other humane laws.
For humane and Divine Lawes differ, as the Lawgivers themselves. And
as God is a Spirit, who is omniscient and searcheth the heart, so Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
spirituall obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. and bindeth by His Law, which
is spirituall, like Himselfe, not onely the hand, tongue and outward man,
as men doe by humane lawes, but even the most inward, hidden and
secret thoughts and desires of the minde and heart.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the end respecting our Neighbours?</p>
                  <p>That wee might not thinke or desire any thing tending to their hurt,
but that with all the powers of our soules, we exercise Charity, in doing
them good, not seeking our owne good onely, but theirs also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
                  <p>What is the end of this Commandement respecting our selves?</p>
                  <p>That it might discover unto us our corruption, and how far wee are
from that perfection which Gods Law requireth, <hi>Rom. 7. 7. 13. 24.
Prov. 20. 9. Psal.</hi> 19. 13. and secondly, that it might bee unto us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
rule of spirituall obedience, and might teach us chiefly to observe
our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. to suppresse the first and inward motions of sin,
and to aspire to that originall puritie, that we had by Creation.</p>
                  <p>What was the occasion of this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>Threefold:<note place="margin">The occasion of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> first, the pravity of our hearts and thoughts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. and
8. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the blindnesse and stupidity of our mindes and hearts,
which could neither see nor feele their owne pravity and corruption,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the errour of our judgements, which suppose that our
thoughts be free, and that concupiscence and first thoughts are not sins
till they have our conscent, because they are not in our power to restraine
them.</p>
                  <p>What is the difference betweene the spirituall obedience required in this
and the other Commandements?</p>
                  <p>In that it not onely requireth the internall obedience of the heart, with
the outward man, as the rest doe, but also restraineth the first motions
and inclinations, which goe before consent; If wee had not rather say,
that it is added to the other, as a full and more cleare explication of that
spirituall obedience, which is required in all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Now shew the meaning of this commandement; and first, what is that
concupiscence which is here spoken of?</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of concupiscence,<note place="margin">Two sorts of concupiscence.</note> or of the affections of the heart;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55421:168"/>
the first called the Irascible, conceived against things evil which we shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
as anger, hatred, feare, griefe, &amp;c. The other called Concupiscible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
towards things good and desirable, as love, joy, delight, &amp;c. And
these are things either truely evill or good, or else so onely in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Is all concupiscence here forbidden?</p>
                  <p>No, for there is some good and lawfull, some evill and unlawfull; the
one commanded, the other forbidden.</p>
                  <p>What is lawfull concupiscence?</p>
                  <p>It is either naturall,<note place="margin">Lawfull concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.</note> or spirituall. Naturall, that which desireth things
good and necessary to our being, or well-being; as food, cloathing, and
other lawfull comforts of this life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, spirituall, which lusteth and fighteth against the flesh, <hi>Gal.
5.</hi> 17. and affecteth and coveteth after spirituall things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 40.</p>
                  <p>What is opposite hereunto?</p>
                  <p>Vnlawfull and evill concupiscence,<note place="margin">Vnlawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and the kindes thereof.</note> 
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. which is also called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
of men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2. concupiscence of the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 17.
worldly concupiscence, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. lusts of the Devill, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.</p>
                  <p>What are the kindes of this evill concupiscence?</p>
                  <p>Either habituall, or actuall: Habituall, is an evill inclination and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to that which is evill, or an evill desiring of it, which is a part of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
injustice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>What is that evill concupiscence which is actuall?</p>
                  <p>It is distinguished into two kinds.</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the forme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of the object.</p>
                  <p>What is that which respecteth the forme?</p>
                  <p>It is either inchoate and imperfect, which is an act of sensuality onely,
and the first and sudden motions of concupiscence, which goe before the
act of reason and the will, tickling the minde and heart with a kinde of
delight: Or it is formed and perfected, having also the act of the will joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with it, and consenting to it, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>What are the degrees of that inchoate concupiscence?</p>
                  <p>They are three: First, an evill motion cast into our mindes, by either
the Devill, the World, or our owne Flesh, corrupting the sense, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or phantasie, whereby wee have an hanging and hankring appetite
after that which is our Neighbours, as thinking it fit and convenient
for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a longing after it, and wishing for it, following that motion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a tickling delight, arising from a conceit of the pleasure or
profit which we should have in the enjoying of it, <hi>James</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>How then doth sinne grow from its first conception to its full growth?</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>James</hi> in respect of the degrees of it compareth it to the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">The growth of sinne.</note> growth, and birth of an Infant, in, and from the wombe, <hi>James 1.
14,</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The first is, the abstraction of the minde and heart from good to evill,
by the evill motion and appetite, which may be called the carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
between the heart, and sinne, and Satan.</p>
                  <p>The second, inescation, and enticing of the heart with delight and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55421:168"/>
consent unto it, as it were the retention of the seed.</p>
                  <p>The third, consent to the acting of it, which may be called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, deliberation after this consent, by what meanes and how
it may be acted, which is the articulation and shaping of the parts and
members.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is the acting of sin it selfe, that is the birth of it, which being
borne causeth death: Which degrees and growth of sin may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the example of <hi>Eve, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>How may evill concupiscence be distinguished in respect of the object?</p>
                  <p>Into three kindes.</p>
                  <p>First, of pleasure, which is the lust of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of profit, which is the lust of the eyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of honour and glory, which is the pride of life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 25.</p>
                  <p>What are the parts of this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>Two:<note place="margin">The parts of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and 1. the negative.</note> First, the Affirmative: Secondly, the Negative: The first is here
to be understood, the other is plainly expressed.</p>
                  <p>What is forbidden in the Negative?</p>
                  <p>Evill concupiscence, which is twofold, either originall or actuall.</p>
                  <p>What is originall concupiscence?</p>
                  <p>Originall sin,<note place="margin">Originall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence.</note> which is the corruption and disorder of all the powers
and faculties of soule and body, disposing them to all that is evill: It is
also called habituall concupiscence, which is nothing else but an evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and pronenesse to the transgression of Gods Law, which by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature is bred with us.</p>
                  <p>How is it called in the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>The old man, <hi>Ephes. 4. 22 Coloss.</hi> 3. 9. Sin inhabiting and dwelling in us,
the Law of sin, the Law of the members warring against the Law of the
mind, the flesh, the encompassing sin, &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 7. 23. Gal. 5. 17, 24. Heb.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <p>Is this to be reputed sinne?</p>
                  <p>Yes, and a great sin, as may appeare by these reasons.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">That originall concupiscence is sinne.</note> because it defileth and corrupteth the whole man, soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with all their faculties, powers, and parts; as the minde, will, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
heart, affections, appetite; with all the members of the body,
which it maketh to be the instruments of evill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it polluteth all our words and works, and maketh them all
repugnant to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is the root and fountaine of all our actuall sins, from which
they grow and spring.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because it continually warreth against the spirit, and choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
and quencheth the good motions of it, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, because it maketh a man the slave of sinne and Satan, <hi>Rom.
7.</hi> 14, 23.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, because it joyneth with the Devill and the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth
us to their tentations, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, because it is an uncurable evill, seeing it so hangeth upon
us that we cannot shake it off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, because it is but the more irritated by the Law of God,
which should suppresse it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:55421:169"/>
Lastly, because it maketh us children of wrath, and liable to everlasting
condemnation, although dying in childhood, we should never commit
any actuall transgression: <hi>For death and damnation raigned even over them
which had not sinned after the similitude of Adam.</hi> that is, by actuall transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>But doth this Commandement extend to the prohibition of Originall sin
in the whole body, and all the parts of it?</p>
                  <p>No; for it forbiddeth sins committed against our Neighbours only,
like all other Commandements of the second Table, as appeareth by the
words themselves, and the Apostles epitomizing of this whole Table,
in those words: <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe, Rom.</hi> 13. 9. And
therefore, all originall injustice, wicked inclinations, thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are here only forbidden, as they respect our neighbours, and are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to charity; but as they respect God, and are repugnant to the love of
him, they are forbidden in the first Table.</p>
                  <p>What are actuall Concupiscences?</p>
                  <p>They are evill motions which are repugnant to charity.<note place="margin">Actuall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What are the kinds of them?</p>
                  <p>They are either such as are vaine and unprofitable, or such as are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and pernicious.</p>
                  <p>How are they unprofitable?</p>
                  <p>So farre forth as they fasten mens minds to earthly things, and thereby
withdraw them from heavenly.</p>
                  <p>In what respects are they hurtfull?</p>
                  <p>First, because they are instruments of sin, as they are fit objects to every
sin in its kinde: For if any objects are offered to the minde or senses, which
self-love causeth them to thinke to be profitable, pleasant and desireable,
concupiscence presently apprehendeth and catcheth at them to satisfie
worldly lusts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They choake the seed of the Word in the hearts of carnall
men, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They make men insatiable, knowing no end or measure in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
worldly things.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They cast men headlong, in whom they raigne, into sin, <hi>Eph.
2.</hi> 3. and give them up to vile lusts, and a reprobate mind, <hi>Rom. 1. 24. Psal.
81.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They fight against the soule, and if they overcome, bring it to
destruction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>How many wayes are these motions evill?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes, either in respect of the phantasie and cogitations of the
minde, or in respect of the affections and imaginations of the heart.</p>
                  <p>When are the thoughts evill?</p>
                  <p>Then,<note place="margin">Evill thoughts.</note> and so far forth as they sollicite and encline us unto evill.</p>
                  <p>Why doe men thinke that thoughts are free, and not to be charged upon
men, or called to account?</p>
                  <p>Foolish men thinke and say so, but the Scriptures say otherwise, and
affirme them to be sins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 9. as being repugnant to charity, 1 <hi>Cor.
13.</hi> 5. and therefore forbid them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. injoyne us to confesse them,
and to crave pardon for them, <hi>Isa. 55. 7. Acts</hi> 8. 22. and though we sleight
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55421:169"/>
them yet God taketh notice of them, <hi>Psal. 94. 11. 1 Chron. 28. 9. Ezek. 11. 5.
Psal.</hi> 139. 2. yea, he hateth evill thoughts, as abominable, <hi>Prov. 15. 26.
Zach.</hi> 8. 17. and severely punisheth them, as we see in the example of the
old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. and 8. 21.</p>
                  <p>How are these evill thoughts injected?</p>
                  <p>Either by Satan, or else arise from originall concupiscence, and both of
them either waking or sleeping.</p>
                  <p>How are they injected by Satan?</p>
                  <p>Either immediately by himselfe,<note place="margin">Evill thoughts injected by Satan.</note> 1 <hi>Chron. 21. 1. John 13. 2. Luke 9. 46,
47.</hi> or mediately by his instruments, as of old by the serpent. And that he
may the more easily insinuate into his minde whom he tempteth, he often
suborneth those that are nearest and dearest unto us to be his instruments,
as we see in the example of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, and <hi>Peter, Iob 2. 9. Math.</hi> 16. 23.</p>
                  <p>But are these tentations to be reputed our sins?</p>
                  <p>Not if we repell and extinguish them, as fire in water: for Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was tempted, yet without sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. But if we admit them, and
doe not presently reject them, they infect our minds and hearts with their
poison, and become our sins.</p>
                  <p>How else doe evill thoughts arise in us?</p>
                  <p>From our naturall corruption,<note place="margin">Evill thoughts arising from naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> and habituall concupiscence, <hi>Luke 24. 38.
Gen. 6. 5. Math. 15. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 5. And these thoughts arise in us, either wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or sleeping.</p>
                  <p>How are these motions evill, in respect of the affections of the heart?</p>
                  <p>These though they have not the consent of the will to act them, yet
are they sinfull in respect of the sins which arise from them, of which
also they are the first degrees, as we see in the first boyling of anger in
the heart, and of lust and uncleane motions, which proceed from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that charity and purity which God requireth in us, and afterwards
produce the acts of murther and fornication, when the will consenteth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22, 28.</p>
                  <p>Are there no degrees of these evill affections, and perturbations of the
heart?</p>
                  <p>Yes, for they are to be considered either in their first beginnings, as
they are the first motions of concupiscence, by which the minde is first
withdrawne from its rectitude, and then the heart suddenly affected: Or
else, when by the pleasure and delight in those first motions, they are
tickled and inticed to retaine them still, that they may enjoy a greater and
more full measure of delight.</p>
                  <p>What followeth this pleasure thus retained and continued in the mind and
heart?</p>
                  <p>Consent to the acting of the sin, which in Gods sight is all one with the
sin it selfe, seeing he reputeth the will for the deed, whether it be in good
or evill, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 12. Mat.</hi> 5. 28.</p>
                  <p>Why then, it seemeth that it were as good for a man to act sin; as to consent
to the acting of it?</p>
                  <p>Not so: For though they be both sins, the one as wel as the other, yet not
equall, and in the same degree; but as the one is more hainous then the
other, and more defileth the conscience, so maketh it a man liable to a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
degree of hellish condemnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:55421:170"/>
You have spoken of the degrees of evill affections: now shew what are
the kindes?</p>
                  <p>They are either concupiscible, about things affected and desired; or
irrascible, about things which they abhor and shun; as suddain and rash an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the first motions of envy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>How are the concupiscible distinguished?</p>
                  <p>By the Objects: for it is either the lust of the eyes, the lust of the
flesh, or the pride of life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15. all which are forbidden in the first
Commandement, as they are repugnant to the love of God: and in this
Commandement, as they are opposite to the love of our neighbours; and
so farre forth as they are more secret and covert, and the first motions of
concupiscence, and the first principles and degrees of the sins against our
neighbours forbidden in the other Commandements.</p>
                  <p>You have shewed what concupiscence is in the generall; now shew what it
that speciall kinde of it which is here expressely forbidden.</p>
                  <p>The concupiscence of the eyes,<note place="margin">The speciall kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence here forbidden.</note> which is varied and diversified by the
removing of divers objects.</p>
                  <p>But why is this rather forbidden, then any other kinde?</p>
                  <p>Because it is the worst of all, and most pernicious, and therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to comprehend under it all the rest, as it is done in the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
                  <p>But why is it the most pernicious?</p>
                  <p>First, because it is the root of all the vices forbidden in the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
either in begetting or nourishing them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it extinguisheth charity towards God, by turning
the heart from him after earthly things, <hi>Ephes. 5. 5. Col.</hi> 3. 5. and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our neighbours by disposing mens hearts to cruelty, lust, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse;
and making them averse to charity, mercy, and Christian
beneficence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because it is unsatiable, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because it is unquiet and restlesse, vexing the covetous
minde and heart as it were hellish furies, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 10. 1 Kings</hi> 21. 4.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, because it is joyned with selfe-love and envy.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because it betrayeth men unto Satans tentations to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>But is all concupiscence here forbidden as unlawfull?</p>
                  <p>No, but that onely which is repugnant to charity towards God and
our neighbours; that which is inordinate, and that which by unlawfull
meanes seeketh to be satisfied, and tendeth to an evill end, <hi>James</hi> 4. 3.
Finally, that which is either immoderate, having no bounds, or else
unjust, coveting that which is another mans, against their will and
profit.</p>
                  <p>What are the objects which are here removed?</p>
                  <p>They are infinite and innumerable; but for examples sake, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
upon some which men more usually and ardently covet after.</p>
                  <p>What meaneth he by the house of our neighbour?</p>
                  <p>Both his place of habitation,<note place="margin">What is meant by our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours house.</note> and his family, <hi>Genesis 17. and last.</hi> For
a house is necessary to him that hath a family; which convinceth them
of a great sin, that for every slight cause thrust their Tenants out of their
houses, <hi>Esa.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:55421:170"/>
What are the parts of the Family here numbred?</p>
                  <p>The wife,<note place="margin">Neighbours wife.</note> servant, maid, &amp;c. The wife of another must not be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for such is the union in marriage between man and wife, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to covet another mans wife; not onely to commit adultery with
her, but to enjoy her for his own, though by lawfull meanes, and after the
others death.</p>
                  <p>What are the other parts of the family?</p>
                  <p>Servants,<note place="margin">Our neighbors servant.</note> men and maidens, whom we are here forbidden to covet,
or to use any meanes to entice them from their masters to come to us.</p>
                  <p>For though this were a greater sinne among the Iewes, because they had
a propriety in them, their servants being part of their goods: yet it is
a sinne also amongst us, as being against charity and the common rule
of Iustice, which enjoyneth us to let every one have his owne, and to do
to another as we would have him doe unto us.</p>
                  <p>What other things doth this Commandement forbid to covet?</p>
                  <p>Our neighbours Oxe,<note place="margin">His Oxe and Asse.</note> or Asse, which are here named, to comprehend
all other goods, immoveable, or moveable, because they are of most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
use for mans life. And lest we should think it lawfull to covet any
other thing not here named, he includeth all in the last words; <hi>Nor any
thing that is thy Neighbours:</hi> whether it bee for necessity, profit, or
delight.</p>
                  <p>What doe you further gather from hence?</p>
                  <p>First, that those things are our Neighbours which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that by this gift of God every man hath a propriety and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
right in that he possesseth by vertue of this tenure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: that he ought to be contented with that portion which God
hath given him, and not to covet another mans: and consequently, that
the Doctrine and practice of the Familists, is erroneous and wicked.</p>
                  <p>You have spoken hitherto of the Negative part: now shew what is the
Affirmative.</p>
                  <p>Here is commanded a pure,<note place="margin">The affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part.</note> charitable, and just heart towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. unto which, though none can attaine in a legall perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet ought all to desire and aspire unto it.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth this purity consist?</p>
                  <p>In two things:</p>
                  <p>First, in originall justice, and internall perfect charity, in which wee
were created.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in spirituall concupiscence.</p>
                  <p>What is originall Justice?</p>
                  <p>Not onely an exact purity from all spots of unrighteousnesse, but
also a disposition to performe cheerefully all offices of Charity and
Iustice.</p>
                  <p>What is spirituall Concupiscence?</p>
                  <p>It containes two things:</p>
                  <p>First, good motions of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a fight of the Spirit against the lust of the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>What are those good motions of the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Charitable and just motions, thoughts, desires, and affections, that all
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55421:171"/>
which we think or desire may be for our neighbours good. And this wee
must doe frequently and constantly.</p>
                  <p>What is the fight against fleshly lusts?</p>
                  <p>When as being regenerate, and assisted by Gods Spirit, we make warre
against the flesh, and the lusts thereof; and in all we may, labour to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
crucifie, and subdue them, because they make warre against our
soules, and spirituall part, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. 1 Pet. 2. 11. Rom.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
                  <p>What are the meanes moving, and enabling us to performe the duties
required in this Commandement?</p>
                  <p>They are either generall and common;<note place="margin">The meanes enabling us to obey this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> or else more speciall and
proper.</p>
                  <p>What are the generall meanes?</p>
                  <p>Such as tend to the conserving of the heart in purity, that it may shun
all sinfull concupiscence: As first, to walke with God; and so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane
our selves at all times, and in all things, as being alwayes in his
presence, who searcheth the heart and reines.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to observe and set a watch over our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. And
first, that it doe not admit any evill concupiscence. Secondly, that if it be
admitted, it be not retained. And this care must be taken both when wee
be awake, that we keep our mindes intent unto lawfull and good things,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 44. And when we goe to sleep, that by hearty prayer we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them to Gods keeping.</p>
                  <p>But what if the heart have admitted evill concupiscences?</p>
                  <p>We must strive and fight against them, and never be at rest, untill we
have cast them out, and extinguished them.</p>
                  <p>What further is required to the conserving of the heart in purity?</p>
                  <p>In the third place we must observe our sences, that they doe not bring
into our mindes such objects as being apprehended, will stirre up in us
evill concupiscence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. &amp; 6. 2. <hi>Josh. 7. 21. 2 Sam. 11. 2. Matth. 5. 28.
Job 31. Psal.</hi> 119. 37.</p>
                  <p>What are the speciall meanes to suppresse or take away the concupiscence
of the eyes?</p>
                  <p>First, we must mortifie selfe-love, and not seek our owne, but every
man anothers wealth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must pull out the eyes of envy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must labour after contentation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. And to this
end consider: First, how many want those good things which thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyest,
who are farre more worthy of them. Secondly thine owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse
of the least of Gods benefits. Thirdly, meditate on Gods
providence, and fatherly care, who provideth all things necessary for thy
good and salvation.</p>
                  <p>What doe you learne from this Commandement thus expounded?</p>
                  <p>That it is most impossible for any man to keep it.<note place="margin">The impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> For who can say,
that his heart is cleane from the first motions of sinne, and concupiscence
that goe before consent? <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 9.</p>
                  <p>To what purpose serveth the knowledge of this impossibility?</p>
                  <p>To humble us in the sight and sense of our sinnes, which have made
us subject to the wrath of God, and the curse of the Law; that so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
in our owne merits we may be driven out of our selves, and with
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55421:171"/>
more ardent desire, flye unto the mercies of God in the satisfaction and
obedience of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>What other use are we to make of it?</p>
                  <p>That being by Christ freed from the curse of the Law, we study and
endeavour to conforme our selves, our soules and lives according to the
prescript rule of this holy and most perfect law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 48. and that
mortifying the flesh, with all the carnall concupiscences, and lusts of it,
we be dayly more and more renewed unto the Image of God in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and righteousnesse, and walke worthy of our high calling, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Hitherto we have treated of the rule and square
of our Sanctification, viz. The ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:</head>
                  <p>Now wherein is the effect or exercise of Sanctification seene?</p>
                  <p>IN unfeigned repentance,<note place="margin">Repentance &amp; new obedience.</note> and new obedience springing from thence.
For the fruits of Sanctification, are; First, inward vertues, whereby all
the powers of the minde are rightly ordered. Secondly, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of the same, by putting those heavenly and sanctified abilities to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
use and service.</p>
                  <p>If then the exercise of Sanctification be first seen in repentance, what
is repentance?</p>
                  <p>An inward and true sorrow for sinne,<note place="margin">Repentance what it is.</note> especially that we have offended
so gracious a God, and so loving a father; together with a setled purpose
of heart, and a carefull endeavour to leave all our sinnes, and to live a
Christian life, according to all Gods Commandements, <hi>Psalme 119. 57.
212.</hi> Or a turning of our selves to God, whereby wee crucifie and kill
the corruptions of our nature, and reforme our selves in the inward man,
according to Gods will.</p>
                  <p>What is it to crucifie the corruption of our nature?</p>
                  <p>It is freely, and with all our heart to be sorry that we have angred God
with it, and with our other sinnes, and every day more and more to hate it
and them, and to flye from them.</p>
                  <p>How is this wrought in us?</p>
                  <p>It is wrought in us, partly by the threatning of the Law, and the feare
of Gods judgements, but especially increased by feeling the fruit
of Christ his death, whereby we have power to hate sin, and to leave it:
For when the sinner is once humbled with the terrours of the Law;
he flyeth to the comforts of the Gospell: and he there seeth in Christ
Crucified, not onely the mercy of God, discharging him of all his sinnes;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55421:172"/>
but also how deep the wounds of sin are, wherewith he hath pierced his
Saviour, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. and how severe the wrath of God is against sin,
even to the slaughtering of his owne Son; and hence 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
he to hate his sins, <hi>Psalme</hi> 97. 10. as God hateth them, and to look
backe thereon with godly sorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. resolving for ever after to
forsake them all.</p>
                  <p>How is the reformation of our selves newnesse of life wrought
in us?</p>
                  <p>Onely by the promise of the Gospel, whereby we feele the fruit of the
rising again of Christ.</p>
                  <p>What doth ensue hereof?</p>
                  <p>Hereby we are raised up into a new life, having the Law written in our
hearts, and so reforme our selves.</p>
                  <p>Wherein then doth repentance properly consist?</p>
                  <p>In a thorough changing of our purpose and desires from the evill
which Gods Word rebuketh in us, to the good which it requireth of us,
<hi>Rom. 12. 1, 2. Esa.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>What is required in respect of the evil we turne from?</p>
                  <p>First, knowledge of the evill, then a condemning of the same, together
with a judging of our selves for it, and then with godly sorrow for that
which is past, a hatred of it for ever, and all this because it is sin, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth
our God.</p>
                  <p>What is required in regard of the good we turne unto?</p>
                  <p>First, a knowledge and approbation of good to be done, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of heart to doe it: then, an earnest love of the same, shewed by care,
desire, and endevour.</p>
                  <p>Can men repent of themselves, or when they list?</p>
                  <p>No, for it is the gift of God, given unto them that are born againe.</p>
                  <p>Is it sufficient once to have repented?</p>
                  <p>No, we must continue it alwayes in disposition, and renew it also in
act, as occasion is given by our transgressions, and Gods displeasure: for
there is none of Gods Saints but alwayes carrying this corruption about
them, they sometimes fall, and are farre from that perfection and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which the Lord requireth, and therefore stand in need of repentance
so long as they live.</p>
                  <p>When then is this repentance to be practised of us?</p>
                  <p>The practice of repentance ought to be continually,<note place="margin">When repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is to be exercised.</note> an abhorring of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and cleaving unto that which is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. for as much time as

                  <p>How must we contend with God?</p>
                  <p>No otherwise then <hi>Iacob, Hos.</hi> 12. 3, 4. and other holy men have done;
that is, by obedience, humility, patience, and fervent prayer unto God, who
only inableth us to previle with himselfe, giving us the blessing and name
of <hi>Israel, Gen.</hi> 32. 28.</p>
                  <p>What are those enemies of ours that seeke to seduce and indanger us?</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever marcheth under the banner of Satan, the god and prince
of the darknesse of this world, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. Eph.</hi> 6. 12. who sometimes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
assaileth us with impious and odious suggestions, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7.
Zach.</hi> 3. 1. But more usually imployeth his forces or attendants, namely,
the world, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 15. and the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. So that the faithfull in this
life have battell, both without, by the temptations of Satan, and the world;
and within, by the battell of the flesh against the spirit.</p>
                  <p>How doe these enemies fight against our soules?</p>
                  <p>By imploying all force and fraud, to draw us by sin from the obedience

                  <p>What must we doe being thus assaulted?</p>
                  <p>We must stand fast, being strong in the Lord, and in the power of his

                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:55421:173"/>
How shall we overcome?</p>
                  <p>By a lively faith in Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>To come then to these enemies in particular: What call you Satan?</p>
                  <p>The adversary or enemy of God and his people.<note place="margin">Of our first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, Satan.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How may we be able to stand against his assaults?</p>
                  <p>First, we must labour to informe our selves, that we may not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his enterprises or stratagems, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must boldly resist, <hi>Iam. 4. 7. 1. Pet.</hi> 5. 9. that is, give no
place or ground unto him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 27. or admit no conference with him,
but rather neglect and despise his suggestions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must take the shield of faith in Christ, and his assistance,
setting him on our right hand, who is mighty to save, <hi>Psal. 16. 8. Isa.</hi> 63, 1.
whereby we may quech all the fiery darts of the wicked one, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>Forthly, we must brandish against him the sword of the Spirit, that is,
the word of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. after the example of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 4.
&amp;c. keeping our selves to that only which God revealeth to us, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of us.</p>
                  <p>What is the first assault of Satan against us?</p>
                  <p>By subtilty he allureth us to sin, and therefore he is called a Tempter,
and a Serpent.</p>
                  <p>How shall we overcome him in these temptations?</p>
                  <p>First, by faith in Iesus Christ, who overcame all Satans temptations
in his owne person, that so we might overcome him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by resisting the inward motions, and outward occasions of sin.</p>
                  <p>How shall we doe that?</p>
                  <p>By beleeving that we are baptized into the death and Resurrection of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>What is the second assault of Satan against us?</p>
                  <p>He layeth fearfully to our charge our sins committed, and therefore he
is called the Devill, and accuser.</p>
                  <p>How shall we overcome him in these accusations?</p>
                  <p>First, by faith in Iesus Christ, who hath justified us from all the sins for
which Satan can accuse us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by all those comfortable promises of forgivenesse of sins,
which in Christ name are made unto us.</p>
                  <p>What is the third assault of Satan against us?</p>
                  <p>He seeketh by manifold inward terrors, and outward troubles, to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us up, and therefore is called a roaring Lyon.</p>
                  <p>How shall we overcome him in these terrors and troubles?</p>
                  <p>1. By faith in Iesus Christ, who was heard in all his troubles, to give us
assurance, that we shall not be overcome in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by faith in Gods providence, whereby we know that Satan
can doe no more harme unto us, then the Lord doth permit him for our
good.</p>
                  <p>So much of Satan our first enemy:<note place="margin">2. Enemy, the World.</note> What call you the World?</p>
                  <p>The corrupt state and condition of men, and of the rest of the creatures,
which Satan abuseth as his store-house, or armory of temptations, 1 <hi>Iohn
2.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>How doth the World fight against us?</p>
                  <p>By alluring and withdrawing us to the corruption thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:55421:174"/>
What meanes doth it use?</p>
                  <p>First, it allureth us to evill, with hope of false pleasures, gaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit,
preferment and glory of this world, drawing us from our obedience
to God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, otherwhiles with feare of paines, troubles, losses, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
it discourageth us from our duty, and allureth us to distrust Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33.</p>
                  <p>How may we withstand these temptations of the world?</p>
                  <p>By our faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. which setteth a better world, even Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
kingdom before our eyes, and so enableth us both to contemne, <hi>Heb.
11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24, &amp;c.</hi> and crucifie, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. the love of this present world, and to
endure manfully the threats and wrongs the reof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 36, 37. both
confessing Christ in perill, and suffering martyrdome for his sake, if we be
thereto called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
                  <p>How are then the pleasures, profits, and glory of this world to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</p>
                  <p>First, by a true faith in Iesus Christ, who despised all these things to
worke our salvation, and to make us overcome them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by faith in Gods word, that feareth us from doing any thing
that is against his will.</p>
                  <p>And how shall we overcome the paines, losses, and reproaches of this
world?</p>
                  <p>First, by a lively faith in Iesus Christ, who suffered all these things to
worke our salvation, and to enable us to suffer them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by a stedfast faith in Gods promises and providence, that we
shall want no good thing, and that all things seeming hurtfull, shall bee
turned to the furtherance of our salvation.</p>
                  <p>So much of the World, the second enemy: What call you the Flesh?</p>
                  <p>The corruption of our nature wherein we were borne and conceived.<note place="margin">Third enemy, our flesh.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doth that remaine after Regeneration?</p>
                  <p>Yea, it dwelleth in us, and cleaveth fast unto us, so long as we carry the
outward flesh about us.</p>
                  <p>How doth the flesh fight against the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>As a treacherous parte within us, being by Satan stirred up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vegled
with the baits of the world, or discouraged with the evill entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, it fighteth on his side against our soule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. That is,
our spirituall life and welfare, by continuall lusting against the Spirit,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24.</p>
                  <p>How is that?</p>
                  <p>First, by hindring, or corrupting us in the good motions, words, and
deeds of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by continuall moving us to evill motions, words, and
deeds.</p>
                  <p>What call you the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>The holy Spirit which God in Christ hath given us, whereby we are
begotten againe.</p>
                  <p>Doe we not receive the Spirit in full measure and perfection at the first?</p>
                  <p>No; but first wee receive the first fruits, and afterward daily increase
of the same unto the end, if the fault be not in our selves.</p>
                  <p>

How doth the Spirit fight in us?</p>
                  <p>By lusting against the flesh.</p>
                  <p>How doth it lust against the flesh?</p>
                  <p>First, partly by rebuking, and partly by restraining in us the evill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and deeds of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by continuall enlightning and affecting us with thoughts,
words, and deeds agreeable to Gods will.</p>
                  <p>How may we withstand the temptations of our flesh?</p>
                  <p>By setting before our eyes the patterne of the death of Christ, and
arming our selves with the same minde, that it behoveth us also to suffer
in the flesh, ceasing from sinne, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. hereto craving and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the victory in any tempatation or affliction?</p>
                  <p>Experience of Gods love in Christ, and so increase of peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

                  <p>What followes if in any temptation he be overcome, and through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

                  <p>After a while there will arise godly sorrow; which is, when a man is
grieved for no other cause in the world, but for this onely, that by his sin
he hath displeased God, who hath been unto him a most mercifull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <p>Repentance renewed afresh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</p>

what properties are to be required in good works?</p>
                  <p>Five:<note place="margin">Of good works in generall, and of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of them.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. They that doe them must first be such as are ingraffed into Christ,
and continue in him, that so their persons may be acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>2. They must be agreeable to the Law of God; and he that doth them,
must know that he hath a warrant for his action from the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</p>
                  <p>3. He that doth them, must not only have a warrant for his action, and
know that it is lawfull, but he must also doe it in that manner which God
hath appointed.</p>
                  <p>4. He that doth them, must be perswaded in his heart that God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them.</p>
                  <p>5. They must be done to that holy end for which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them; namely, to glorifie God, and to assure our owne salvation.</p>
                  <p>Cannot all men doe good works?</p>
                  <p>No, but only the regenerate, who are for that purpose created anew,
and indued in some measure with the spirit of Christ, and power of
his resurrection, and carry the Image of God in them, <hi>Ephes. 2. 10.
2 Tim.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
                  <p>What say you then of the good works of the unregenerate?</p>
                  <p>They doe no good works, because they neither are as yet members of
Christ, nor doe offer them to God in the name of Christ, and therefore
are the evill Tree, which bringeth forth only evill fruit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 17, &amp;c.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23.</p>
                  <p>Is there no difference between those unregenerate, which keep themselves
to their owne wives, and those that take other mens: Or between
him that stealeth, and him that liveth of his owne labour, though not
converted?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily: For the former actions are civilly good and profitable for
maintenance of the society of men, and before God not so abominable as
they which are committed against civill honesty; yet comming from
some other cause (either of vain-glory, or of servile feare, or opinion of
merit) then from faith, and consequently, the love of God, they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then sins, what shew of goodnesse soever they have.</p>
                  <p>Is there no concurrence of nature in the doing of a good worke?</p>
                  <p>Taking nature (in the common sense of Scripture) for that hereditary
corruption that cleaveth to all the sons of <hi>Adam, Eph. 2. 3. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14.
no good worke hath any ground or help from nature, but is altogether
contrary thereto, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 7. But if we understand by nature, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14.
the created abilities of soule and body, as the light of reason, liberty of the
will, motion of the bodily members, &amp;c. we acknowledge nature not to
be the principall mover or guide, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17. but the things moved and
guided by grace in well doing, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
                  <p>Doe not our good works make us worthy of eternall life, or in some part
justifie us, or any whit merit and deserve the favour of God?</p>
                  <p>No: because,<note place="margin">That there is no merit in good works.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. We are ten thousand times more indebted to God, then all our
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55421:175"/>
good works, or our selves are worth.</p>
                  <p>2. We can doe no good thing but that which commeth from God.</p>
                  <p>3. The righteousnesse which is able to stand in the judgement of God,
must be perfect in all respects, but in many things we sin all. And againe,
our best works are imperfect, corrupt and defiled with sin, and therefore
can deserve nothing at the hands of God, who being perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe, will find in the best works we doe, more matter of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then of salvation: wherefore, we must rather condemne our selves for
our good works, then looke to be justified before God thereby, <hi>Ps. 143. 2.
Isa. 64. 6. Iob. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Is there no works of man perfectly good?</p>
                  <p>No worke of a sinfull man is wholly free from sin, neither is there any
good worke perfect, no not of the most perfect in this life, by reason of
the remainders of corruption, <hi>Isa 64. 6. Gal.</hi> 5. 17. but only the worke of
Christ, in whom alone there was no mixture of sin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
                  <p>But when our Sanctification here begun shall be perfected in the world to
come, shall we not then be justified by an inherent righteousnesse?</p>
                  <p>No, but by the imputed righteousnesse of our Saviour Christ, which
being once given us, is never taken away from us.</p>
                  <p>How is pollution conveyed into the good works which God worketh in us?</p>
                  <p>There is (besides the worke of his owne hand, through the operation
of his holy Spirit) a pollution in us, and an infection of ours, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from the sin that dwelleth in us: as cleare water put into an uncleane
vessell, or running through a filthy channell, receiveth some evill quality
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doe our good works faile of Gods Iustice?</p>
                  <p>Partly in the instrumentall causes from which they proceed, and partly
in the finall cause or end whereunto they ayme.</p>
                  <p>What are the instrumentall causes hindring the perfection of our worke?<note place="margin">Wherein our good works faile.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Our understanding, in that the worke is not done with knowledge,
absolute and throughly perfect.</p>
                  <p>2. Our memory, in that our remembrance is infeebled, and doth not so
fully retaine that which the understanding conceiveth.</p>
                  <p>3. Our will and affections, in that they are short of their duty.</p>
                  <p>4. Our body, in that it is not so apt and nimble for the execution of
good things as is required.</p>
                  <p>Expresse this by a similitude.</p>
                  <p>We are in the instrumentall causes like to a common Labourer, which
being hired by the day, worketh with one hand whereas both are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or worketh a peece of the day, being hired for the whole.</p>
                  <p>What is the finall end wherein good works faile?</p>
                  <p>In that we have not so direct an eye to Gods glory, or the good of our
neighbour as is required; but looke asquint, as it were, at those duties
which are injoyned us: Like to those Artificers, who preferre their owne
credit in their skill before their Masters profit.</p>
                  <p>If then it be so that sin cleaveth to our best works, and maketh them sin,
are not our good works sin? and are not all evill works equall?</p>
                  <p>No, doubtlesse, be it far from us to thinke it: For their imperfection is
sinfull, but the good worke is not a sin, and even in bad actions (as hath
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55421:176"/>
been said) some are better, that is lesse evill and hurtfull then others.</p>
                  <p>But seeing our works are thus corrupt, how can they please God? and
why doth he promise a reward unto them?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Why God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth our works.</note> the reward that God doth promise, is not for the desert of our
works, but of his owne grace and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the corruption and pollution that cleaveth unto our good
works is taken away by the intercession of our Saviour Christ, for whose
sake God covering the imperfection, accepteth and accounteth of, and
so rewardeth them, as if they were perfect, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. Exod.</hi> 28. 36, 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>What Doctrine is hence to be gathered?</p>
                  <p>A Doctrine of great comfort to the children of God to stir them up
to abound in good works, sith they are so acceptable to God and Christ
Iesus: for when men know any thing to be delightsome to their Prince,
they will withall endeavour &amp; strive for it: how much more then ought
we to be pricked forward to the service of God, who quencheth not the
smoaking Flaxe, nor breaketh the bruised Reed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. yea which
forgetteth not a cup of cold water given in faith, and for his sake? <hi>Matth.
10.</hi> 42.</p>
                  <p>Declare now the ends for which good works are to be done.</p>
                  <p>1. That by them Gods glory may be advanced.<note place="margin">The ends of good works.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That by them we may shew our thankfulnesse to God for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
                  <p>3. That by them we may be assured of our faith and election.</p>
                  <p>4. That by our good workes we may edifie others.</p>
                  <p>How may we edifie others?</p>
                  <p>1. By encouraging and strengthening those that are good.</p>
                  <p>2. By winning those that are not come to God.</p>
                  <p>3. By stopping the mouthes of the wicked, and of those that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible.</p>
                  <p>Is it not lawfull to seek our owne praise and merit by our good works?</p>
                  <p>No; for all our good works are imperfect, and salvation is only merited
by the death and obedience of Christ, (as hath been said.)</p>
                  <p>But will not this Doctrine make men carelesse of well-doing:</p>
                  <p>No; for they that are ingraffed into Christ, must needs bring forth
good works; and good workes are necessary, (as hath been declared)
though not for merit, yet for Gods glory, the edification of others, and
our owne assured comfort.</p>
                  <p>Are good works so needfull, that without them we cannot be assured of
salvation?</p>
                  <p>Yes; for though good workes doe not worke our salvation in any
part; yet because they that are justified are also sanctified, they that doe
no good workes, doe declare that they neither are justified, nor sanctified,
and therefore cannot be saved.</p>
                  <p>Then they must much more be condemned, which commit sinne, and
lye in it.</p>
                  <p>Yea; for such are not onely pronounced to be accursed by the Law,
but also the Gospell hath pronounced, that they shall not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven.</p>
                  <p>What consideration may draw us to be zealous in good works?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:55421:176"/>
That if we doe well, we shall have well, as the old saying is.</p>
                  <p>But that is a hard thing to be perswaded of?</p>
                  <p>So it is indeed; because our hearts are naturally distrustfull in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God: As also our flesh, the world, and the devill doe suggest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, that it is a vaine thing to doe good. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>What remedy is there against this assault?</p>
                  <p>That it shall be well with them that doe well, by the testimony of God
himselfe, commanding the Prophet <hi>Esaiah</hi> to say so to the righteous, <hi>Esa.
3.</hi> 10. which ought to teach all men, that laying aside all their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and whatsoever seemeth good in their owne eyes, they should rely
wholly upon the direction of God.</p>
                  <p>What may be gathered of this?</p>
                  <p>That it is better to endanger our selves with obedience to God, then
with disobedience to rid our selves out of appearance of trouble.</p>
                  <p>But why did the Lord thus charge the Prophet?</p>
                  <p>Because the wicked (as saith <hi>Malachi</hi>) wearied God with their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
saying, that he delighted in their wickednesse, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>How secondly is that poynt confirmed?</p>
                  <p>By a continuall practice and experience from time to time, as the friends
of <hi>Job</hi> doe well reason thereupon.</p>
                  <p>What is the third proofe?</p>
                  <p>That sith the Lord must doe either good for good, or evill for good;
and that it is absurd, yea blasphemous, to say that God doth evill for
good; it must needs follow, that he will doe good for good: for
if a reasonable honest man would not requite kindnesse with unkindnesse;
it can much lesse fall into the nature of God so to doe; especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he did then shew kindnesse unto us, when we were enemies unto him.</p>
                  <p>How fourthly is it confirmed?</p>
                  <p>In that God is said to write up the good deeds of his servants into his
book of Records, as the Kings of the earth are wont to doe, <hi>Mal. 3.
16,</hi> 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>But this seemeth not so, sith the wicked doe so triumph over the godly, as
if there were no difference?</p>
                  <p>A difference shall specially appeare at the day of judgement, when by
the sentence of the great Iudge the wicked like stubble shall be consumed
with fire, and the Sun of righteousnesse shall shine upon the just.</p>
                  <p>Is there no difference at all in this life?</p>
                  <p>Yes, inwardly: For the godly in doing well have alwayes a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
howsoever earthly things goe with them; so that the green Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
of hearbs, or dry bread, is better to them then all the rich mans
wealth; because the grace of God goeth with them whither soever they
goe, whereas the wicked have a hell in their conscience, how well soever
they fare outwardly.</p>
                  <p>So much of good works in generall: What speciall good works are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us in the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>The things which we give unto God,<note place="margin">Of speciall good works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> prescribed in the first Table;
and the giving of almes to our needy Neighbour, touching which among
all the duties of the second Table, our Saviour giveth speciall direction in
the sixt of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he entreateth of prayer and fasting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:55421:177"/>
What are those things that we give unto God?</p>
                  <p>Prayers and Vowes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 13, 14. &amp; 66. 13, 14. which being speciall
parts of Gods worship may not be communicated to any other, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42. 8.
&amp; 48. 11.</p>
                  <p>What is prayer?</p>
                  <p>It is a familiar speech with God in the name of Christ,<note place="margin">Of prayer, what it is.</note> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14.
opening the desires of our hearts unto him, and so a lifting up of the mind,
and a powring out of the heart before God, for the more ample and free
fruition of the good things we have need of, <hi>Psal. 50. 15. Jer. 33. 3. Lam.
2. 19. Phil.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>How further is the necessity of Prayer considered?</p>
                  <p>Prayer is a key to open the Store-houses of all Gods treasures unto us;<note place="margin">The necessity of prayer.</note>
and as by knocking we enter into the place we goe to, so by Prayer we
obtaine those things we need. Also as men provide gifts to make way for
favour, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 8. so Prayer is a gift to appease Gods anger towards us,
and as a hooke to reach those things that are above our reach, and to put
by those things that stand in our way and let us. Adde hereunto, that it
is so necessary, as without it the use and enjoying of the things we have is
unlawfull, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. For as if we take any thing that is our Neighbours
without asking him leave we are accounted Theeves, so to take any thing
of Gods (whose all things are) without asking them at his hand, is Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Finally, Prayer is a principall meanes serving for the strengthening
and encreasing of Faith, and for the further advancing and more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
effecting of the outward meanes of salvation, <hi>Jude 20. 1 Thess. 5. 17,
18. Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. And therefore the Apostles did not onely say unto Christ,
<hi>Increase our faith, Luk.</hi> 17. 5. but also, <hi>Lord teach us to pray as John taught
his Disciples, Luke</hi> 11. 1.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That we can never honour God aright, in calling upon his name,
unlesse wee bring faithfull and feeling hearts before him, <hi>James 1. 6, 7.
1 Sam.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>Describe Prayer yet more largely?</p>
                  <p>It is a religious calling upon God alone in the name of Christ,<note place="margin">A more full description of prayer.</note> by the
titles wherewith in the Scripture he is set forth unto us, as well thereby
to doe service and homage unto the Lord, as to obtaine those further
things and Graces that are necessary for us. Or thus. It is the holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of an humble and sanctified heart, together with thanksgiving
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.) offered by the power of the spirit of Prayer (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.) as a
speciall service unto God (<hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15.) in the name of Christ (<hi>John 14.
14.</hi>) in behalfe of our selves and others, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 18.) with assurance to be
heard in what wee pray for according to the will of God, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 14.
Iames</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>Why doe we call it a request with thanksgiving?</p>
                  <p>Because in all our Prayers there must both petition of the good things
we need, and thankfull acknowledgment of those things we have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
(1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 17, 18.) As for those formes which containe neither sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
nor giving of thanks, as the Articles of the Beleefe, the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may, and ought, for other good purposes, be committed
to memory and rehearsed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. but to use them as Prayers savoureth
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:55421:177"/>
of deep ignorance, if not of superstition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you call it the request of the heart?</p>
                  <p>Not to exclude the use of bodily gesture, much lesse of the voice and
tongue, in the action of Invocation, (therefore called <hi>the Calves of the
Lips, Hosea</hi> 14. 2.) but to shew, first, that the heart is on our part the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
mover and speaker in prayer, from whence both voice and gesture
have their force and grace, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15. Psal.</hi> 45. 1. &amp; 108. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Prayer on sudden occasions may be secretly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
offered, and is of God heard and accepted, when neither any
voice is uttered, nor any bodily gesture employed, <hi>Exod. 14. 15. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.
2.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you adde, Of an humble and sanctified heart?</p>
                  <p>Because as in generall none can pray, or doe any thing acceptable, <hi>Psal.
109.</hi> 7. but such as are truely regenerate and sanctified unto this and every
good work, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 15. so in speciall (and for the present action of prayer)
it is required as the summe of all sacrifices, that the heart be humble and
contrite, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 17. acknowledging it owne unworthinesse by reason of
sinne, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 8, 9. feeling the want of Gods grace and mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 6.
and submitting it selfe unto him, willing to be beholding for the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of favour, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>What then is required of us, that our prayers may be holy?</p>
                  <p>1. That we pray with faith and assurance that God for Christ sake wil
heare us.<note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that prayer may be holy.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That we pray with feare and reverence of God.</p>
                  <p>3. That we pray with humility, and a lively sense of our owne unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
to obtaine any thing at Gods hands.</p>
                  <p>4. That we pray with a true feeling of our owne wants, and an earnest
desire to obtaine those things for which we pray.</p>
                  <p>5. That our affections be agreeable to the matter for which we pray.</p>
                  <p>6. That we purpose to use all good meanes for the obtaining of those
things for which we pray.</p>
                  <p>In brief, these be the speciall properties of true prayer. It must be</p>
                  <p>1. In faith, without wavering, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>2. In truth, without faining, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 18.</p>
                  <p>3. In humility, without swelling, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13.</p>
                  <p>4. In zeale, without cooling, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p>5. In constancy, without fainting, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1.</p>
                  <p>What learne you hence?</p>
                  <p>That even they which are most frequent and fervent in this duty had
need to pray God to forgive their prayers, in conscience of their owne
frailties and infirmities, <hi>Esa. 38. 14, 15. Psal.</hi> 77. 9, 10. &amp; 32. 3, 5.</p>
                  <p>What is the spirit of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>An especiall grace and operation of the holy Ghost, <hi>Iude</hi> 20. called
therefore the spirit of grace and supplication, <hi>Zachary</hi> 12. 10. enabling us
to powre out our soules unto the Lord, <hi>Psalme</hi> 62. 8. with sighes that
cannot be expressed, <hi>Romanes</hi> 8. 26. For the holy Ghost must bee our
helper in prayer, to teach us both what to pray, and how to pray,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
                  <p>To whom must we pray?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:55421:178"/>
To God alone,<note place="margin">That we must pray to God alone.</note> and to none other. For 1. He alone is the searcher
of the hearts, heareth the voice, and knoweth the meaning of the spirit of
prayer, <hi>Psal. 65. 2. Rom. 8</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>2. He is able to grant whatsoever we demand, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>3. He challengeth our faith and confidence, without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. Wherefore seeing he alone heares all prayers,
heales all sins, knowes all suiters, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. 2 Chron.</hi> 7. 14. &amp; 6. 30. 1 <hi>Chro.
28. 9. Psal.</hi> 44. 21. He alone hath love enough to pitty all, and power
enough to relieve all our wants and necessities, to him alone we are to
pray, and to none other.</p>
                  <p>What learne you hence?</p>
                  <p>That seeing the Scripture forbiddeth us to communicate Gods honour
to any other, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 8. &amp; 48. 12. such as pray either to Saints or Angels,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. have forgotten the name of their God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 20. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
those of the Church of Rome, who would have us to pray to
Angels and Saints departed.</p>
                  <p>Whether must we direct our prayers, to the Father, or the Sonne, or to the
Holy-Ghost?</p>
                  <p>We must pray to the Trinity of Persons in the Vnity of the Godhead;
that is to say, to our God in Trinity.</p>
                  <p>In whose name, or for whose sake must we pray to God?</p>
                  <p>In the only name,<note place="margin">That we must pray only in the mediation of Christ.</note> and for the only sake of his Sonne our Lord Iesus
Christ, <hi>Dan. 9. 17. Iohn</hi> 16. 23, 24. the alone Mediator between God and
man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. As of propitiation, so or intercession, 1 <hi>John 2. 1, 2. Rom.
8.</hi> 34. who through the vaile of his flesh, and merit of his bloud, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for us a new and living way, whereby we may be bold to enter into
the holy place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19. in whom alone we are made the children of
God, and have liberty to call him Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. Finally, in, with, and for
whom God giveth all things that be good to his Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>Who are condemned by this Doctrine?</p>
                  <p>They of the Church of Rome, who teach us to pray in the name of
Saints, and make them to be our Mediators between God and us.</p>
                  <p>For whom are we to pray?</p>
                  <p>For our selves and others,<note place="margin">For whom we must pray.</note> us and ours; in a word, for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.
even our enemies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. because they beare the common Image of
God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 9. and bloud of mankinde, whereof we are all made, <hi>Act. 17.
26.</hi> unlesse it be apparent that any one hath committed the unpardonable
sin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 16. But principally, for such as are our brethren in Christ,
and of the houshold of faith, <hi>Eph. 6. 18. Gal.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for all sorts and degrees of men, especially publick persons,
as Rulers, and such as are in authority, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. Ministers that watch over
our soules, <hi>Eph. 6. 19. Col.</hi> 4. 3, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What assurance have we that we shall be heard in what we pray for?</p>
                  <p>1. Because we pray to that God that heareth prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. And is the rewarder of all that come unto him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and in his
name to whom who so asketh, God denieth nothing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 42. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
howsoever we are not alwayes answered at the present, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 1.
or in the same kind that we desire, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. yet sooner or later we are
sure to receive even above that we are able to aske or thinke, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55421:178"/>
with constancy, patience, and importunity to sue unto him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his will, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 5. &amp; 18. 1. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>What things must we come to God in prayer for?</p>
                  <p>Not for trifles and toyes, but for things needfull and necessary, and
such as God hath made us promise of; some whereof doe immediately
concerne the glory of God, others the necessity of man; either in things
belonging to this present life, or those especially which belong to the
life to come.</p>
                  <p>But how can we remember all the promises that God hath made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to ground our Petitions, especially being unletter'd?</p>
                  <p>There are generall promises, that whatsoever wee shall aske accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his will, it shall be given us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14. Againe, whatsoever we
read or heare that the servants of God have uncontrollably demanded
in the Scriptures, or without speciall calling; that is a good warrant for
us to demand at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Where then is that will of God revealed, according whereto we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our prayers?</p>
                  <p>Throughout the whole booke of the Scriptures of God, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
us as concerning other duties, so especially concerning this of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Recording also for this purpose many excellent prayers, as of <hi>Moses,
David, Daniel, Nehemiah, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> But most absolutely in that passage
or portion delivered by our Saviour himselfe; and therefore commonly
called, the Lords Prayer.</p>
                  <p>What learne you from thence?</p>
                  <p>That for helpe of our weaknesse and rudenesse in prayer, we are to
look to the prayers of the holy men of God, set downe in Scripture, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the state wherein they were at the time of those prayers, may best
sort with the speciall cases wherein we are when we pray. But especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and above any other, yea above all of them together, wee are to
looke unto that most absolute prayer which our Saviour Christ hath
taught us in the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>VVhat is the speciall end and use of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>To recover our peace, and to nourish our communion with our God,
<hi>Dan. 9. 9. Phil. 4. 6, 7. John</hi> 17. or 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That such as have least care, and make least conscience to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, have also least acquaintance and acceptance with him, <hi>Psalme
14.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>What is the excellency of this duty?</p>
                  <p>It setteth head and heart, and all our best affections aworke, giving God
the praise of his Majesty and mercy, goodnesse and greatnesse both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
1 <hi>Sam. 10. 12, 13. Jam. 5. 13. 14. Psal.</hi> 50. 23. and therefore it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Incense or sweet perfume, <hi>Psalme 141</hi> 2. for that it is acceptable
to the Lord, as perfumes are to men; and to the drops of honey, as it were
dropping from the lips of the Church, as from an honey-combe, <hi>Cant. 4.
11. Thy lips ô my Spouse drop as the honey-combe, honey and milk are
under thy tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How can God so infinitely wise, take delight in our Prayers that are
so rude?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:55421:179"/>
Because in Christ he taketh us for his children; and therefore as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
rather take pleasure to heare their children stammer, then some
other to speak eloquently; so doth the Lord take pleasure in the weake
prayers of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of Invocation and Prayer in generall: what are the parts
thereof?</p>
                  <p>Two principally,<note place="margin">The parts of Prayer.</note> (<hi>Psalm 50. 15. 23. 1 Thes. 5. 17, 18. 1 Tim. 2. 1. Phil.
4.</hi> 6. Petition, or Request, (properly called Prayer) whereby we crave
things needfull; and Thanksgiving, or Praise, whereby we magnifie the
goodnesse of God, and give thanks for benefits received; to both which
is annexed, confession of sinnes, and of the righteous judgement of God
against them: at the view whereof we being humbled, may come more
preparedly to prayer in both kindes.</p>
                  <p>What is Petition?</p>
                  <p>Petition,<note place="margin">Of Petition.</note> (or prayer properly so called) is a religious calling upon
the name of God, by sute or request; in which we desire and beg all
things necessary, <hi>Luke 11. 1, 2. 3. Phil. 4. 6, 7. Psalme</hi> 50. 15. And it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for things of this present life, with this exception, so farre forth
as the same shall bee thought good unto the wisdome of God; or
(and that especially) for the things of the life to come, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Matth. 8. 2. 2 Sam.</hi> 15. 25. 26.</p>
                  <p>What learne you of this; that it is a religious calling upon God?</p>
                  <p>First, that we may not rush unadvisedly into Gods presence, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
his Throne with feare and reverence, <hi>Heb. 12. 28. Eccl.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the best hearing is in heaven, and readiest help from
Gods hand, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
                  <p>What doe you meane by calling upon God?</p>
                  <p>Not the calling of the tongue, but the cry of the heart; as <hi>Hannah</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon God, when her voyce was not heard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. and <hi>Moses</hi>
cryed unto the Lord, when yet he spake not a word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>VVhat gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That the heart without the tongue, may pray with fruit and feeling
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 10. But the tongue without the heart is nothing but vaine bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>What doe you meane by the name of God?</p>
                  <p>God himselfe considered in his attributes and properties, whereby (as
men by their names) hee is knowne unto us. <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7. Psalme
145. 12, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What learne you hence?</p>
                  <p>First, that neither any may claime, nor we may yeeld this duty, but
where we may find the power and properties of the Deity, <hi>Psa.</hi> 44. 20. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is a good ground of prayer to stay our hearts on such
of Gods properties, as are best suiting with our necessities, 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 6,
7, 8, 9. Neh.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that they that will not settle their hearts on God alone by
faith can never lift up their hearts to him alone in prayer, <hi>Rom. 10. 14. Psal.
44. 20. Lam.</hi> 3. 41.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that in every state and condition, they that pray best, speed
best, and live best, <hi>Dan. 9. 23. Psalme.</hi> 50. 15. &amp; 66. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:55421:179"/>
It seemeth to be of no use to make our Petitions to God, seeing he both
knoweth what we want, either for his glory or our good, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
what to bestow upon us?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily: we must aske, and that continually; that is, at set times,
without intermission, by the Commandement of Christ himselfe, bidding
us <hi>aske and we shall receive, seeke and we shall find, knocke and it shall be opened
to us, Mat.</hi> 7. 7. wherein we should rest: For as God hath fore-appointed all
necessaries to be given us; so hath he also appointed the meanes whereby
they should be brought to passe, whereof Prayer is a chiefe.</p>
                  <p>What other reason have you for this?</p>
                  <p>We should therefore pray for the things we have need of, that having
received them, we may be assured we had them of God, and not by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or fortune, as naturall men say.</p>
                  <p>What, doth not God oftentimes bestow his benefits without Prayer?</p>
                  <p>Yes: both upon the wicked, either to provoke them to repent, or to
make them inexcusable; and upon his owne children: even as a loving
father, in regard of his ignorant, and sometimes negligent childe, doth give
things unasked, even so doth God towards his.</p>
                  <p>Why will the Lord have us beg his blessings of him?</p>
                  <p>To exercise our faith in seeking, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. and our patience in waiting,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 10, 11. as also to stir up a feeling of our wants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22. and to
quicken our affections unto good things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That where the heart is faithlesse, the Prayer must needs be fruitlesse;
for according to our faith it shall be unto us, <hi>Luk. 18. 11, 14. Iam.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>But why doth not he answer when we aske, but delayes to help us when yet
he sees and heares us?</p>
                  <p>Because we are sometimes too haughty, and he will humble us; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
too hasty, and he will curbe us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. sometimes we faile
in the matter asking, we know not what; sometimes in the manner asking,
we know not how; and sometimes in the end, asking we know not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Iam.</hi> 4, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Doth he not sometimes delay us, when yet he purposeth to answer us?</p>
                  <p>Yes he doth:</p>
                  <p>First, because he loves to heare the voice of his owne spirit in us, <hi>Rom. 8.
26,</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because the suite may be good, and yet the season not so
meet for us, <hi>Rev. 6. 10, 11. Acts</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he takes pleasure in our constancy, being a fruit of faith and
fervency, <hi>Luk. 18. 1. Mat.</hi> 15. 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because such blessings as are won by long and strong pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are alwayes esteemed very highly, received in humility, enjoyed in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
and imployed faithfully for mans good and Gods glory, 1 <hi>Sam. 1.
20, 21. 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That if we faint not in praying, we shall in due season be sure of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 7, 8. And that when our God denyes us, or delayeth us in
that which seemes good unto us, even then he gives us that which he
knowes is better for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:55421:180"/>
What good meanes may we use to obtaine the gift of prayer in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?</p>
                  <p>1. To get some true feeling of our misery,<note place="margin">The meanes of obtaining the gift of prayer.</note> for sense of misery breeds
suit for mercy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
                  <p>2. Bring hungring and thirsty soules after grace and good things, <hi>Psal.
42.</hi> 1, 2. when the soule panteth most, the soule prayeth best.</p>
                  <p>3. Gather principles of knowledge, that the head may guide the heart,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. for what we know is worth the having we will not lose for
the asking.</p>
                  <p>4. Consider the examples of Gods servants in like sorrowes, and make
like suits, <hi>Dan. 9. Nehem.</hi> 9. be thou as they were to him, and he will be
to thee what he was to them.</p>
                  <p>5. Be well perswaded of Christs ordinance, <hi>Master teach us to pray;
Luke</hi> 11. 1. and of Gods acceptance, reckon of him as of our father, <hi>Matth.
6.</hi> 5, 9. for according to our faith it shall be unto us.</p>
                  <p>6. Be resolute against sin, neither living in grosser iniquities, nor allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lesser infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. so he will never shut out our prayers, not
with-hold his mercies from us, <hi>Psalme</hi> 66. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>7. In reading or hearing turne precepts into prayers; Lord give what
thou commandest, and command what thou wilt: Duties enjoyned, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
commended, blessings promised, and cursings threatned, do all quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
us to prayer, and furnish us with matter for the same, <hi>Matth. 5. 6, 7.
Rom. 12. Ephes.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>But when for all this our prayers are few and faint, cold and weak, what
speciall helps may we then have against our infirmities?</p>
                  <p>None better then to pray for the spirit of prayer, which helpeth
and healeth our infirmities, and teacheth us both for manner, measure,
and matter, to lay open all our necessities, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. Luke</hi> 11. 13. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
call others which are best acquainted with the practice and
power of prayer, to pray with us, being present, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 14. and for us,
being absent from us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>What be the signes of a sound prayer?</p>
                  <p>1. To use all other good meanes carefully, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 23, 31.</p>

                  <p>It is a reverent calling upon the name of God, wherein the heart being

mercy, and purposeth all for his glory, <hi>Luke 10. 21. 1 Chron. 29. 10, 11,
12,</hi> 13. And it is either in praising all his goodnesse, wisedome, power,

particular favours, that by Petition wee have received from his mercifull
hand.</p>
                  <p>Whence doth this duty of praise arise?</p>
                  <p>As Petition ariseth from the feeling of our miserie: so praise from
the feeling of Gods mercy: Petition beggeth what we want, and praise
acknowledgeth what and whence we have it, <hi>Rev. 15. 3. 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 12.</p>

of all kindes, left us in that prayer which our Saviour Christ taught
his Disciples, and in them all succeeding ages, called the Lords Prayer.</p>
                  <p>What is the Lords Prayer?</p>
                  <p>It is an absolute Prayer in it selfe;<note place="margin">Of the Lords Prayer.</note> and a Prayer giving a perfect dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to frame all others prayers by.</p>

all our Prayers by?</p>
                  <p>It is both a prayer which we both may, and ought to pray; and also a
platforme of Prayer, whereunto we are to conforme, and by which we
ought to square all ours: and therefore as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> biddeth us pray af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this sort, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 9. so St. <hi>Luke</hi> biddeth us say; <hi>Our Father, &amp;c. Luke

the other, as the most excellent forme to be used of all Christians.</p>
                  <p>What is the platforme propounded in this Prayer, whereunto we ought to
looke?</p>
                  <p>It teacheth us both the manner how to pray, and the matter for which
to pray. It teacheth us in all our prayers to whom, and through whom,
and for what to pray. Also what difference to make of the things we aske,
and with what affection we are to come unto God in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>What are the words of the Lords Prayer?</p>
                  <p>They are thus set downe in the 6. of <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. After this manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>What doe you observe here in generall?</p>
                  <p>That Prayer is to be made in a language which we understand: for
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55421:182"/>
our Saviour Christ taught his Disciples here in a Tongue which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,

of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which teach the people to pray in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
Tongue, contrary to Christs practice here, and the will of God,
who commandeth us to serve him with all our hearts, and therefore with
our understanding as well as our affection.</p>
                  <p>What are the parts of this prayer?</p>
                  <p>They are three.</p>

                     <hi>Eccles. 5. 1. Psalme 26. 6. Exod.</hi> 3. 5. for the Angel of the Lord
standeth at the entry, to strike with hardnesse and blindnesse &amp;c. those
that come not with preparation: And if we make preparation before we
come to an earthly Prince, and bethink us of our words and gesture, how
much more ought we to doe it when we come before the Prince and
Lord of heaven and earth?</p>
                  <p>How are we to prepare our selves?</p>
                  <p>Not onely to put off our evill affections, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. but even our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and (otherwise in their due time) necessary cogitations, as the cares
and thoughts of our particular vocations, as of house, family, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What doth the preface put us in mind of?</p>
                  <p>1. Of him to whom we pray.</p>
                  <p>2. Of our owne estate in prayer, that we come unto God as to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with boldnesse, and yet with reverence of that Majesty that filleth
the heavens.</p>
                  <p>What are we taught concerning him to whom we must pray?</p>
                  <p>That God, and God onely (not any Saint or Angel) is to be prayed
unto, <hi>Rom. 10. 14. Psal. 73. 25</hi> For although there be other Fathers besides
God, and others in heaven besides him, yet there is none which is our
Father in heaven but God alone. Besides that, this being a perfect plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
a patterne of all prayer, it is evident that all prayers (as in other
things, so in this) must be framed unto it.</p>
                  <p>Why doe you here name the <hi>Father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because discerning the Persons, we pray to the Father, secretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that we doe it in the mediation of the Son, by the working of
the holy Ghost; and so come to the first person in the Trinity, by his
Son, through the holy Ghost; which forme is to be kept for the most
part, although it be also lawfull to pray unto Christ, or to his blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
particularly, <hi>Acts 7. 59. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 13, 14. if so be that in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we doe conjoyn them, as those which cannot be separated in any
actions either belonging to the life to come, or pertaining to this life.</p>
                  <p>Why must we pray to the Father in the mediation of Jesus Christ his
Sonne?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:55421:183"/>
Because God being displeased for sin, we can have no dealing with
him, but only by the means of his Son, in whom he is well pleased, <hi>Mat. 3.
17.</hi> and in whom alone we have liberty to call him Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>Why is it required that we pray by the working of the Holy Ghost?</p>
                  <p>Because the Holy Ghost assureth us that he is our Father: And whereas
we know not what to pray, nor how to pray, the Holy Ghost doth teach
us both.</p>
                  <p>What must we be perswaded of, and how must we be affected in Prayer?</p>

                  <p>Why doth our Saviour direct us to give such Titles unto God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and entrance of our Prayers?</p>
                  <p>That thereby we may testifie,<note place="margin">Our Father.</note> increase, and strengthen our faith in God,
considering what he is to us, to whom we are about to pray, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                  <p>What are we taught to consider from this, that we are taught to call God
Father?</p>
                  <p>That God in Christ is become our Father, and giveth us, both the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 12. and spirit of sons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. so to call him.</p>
                  <p>What ariseth from hence?</p>
                  <p>First, confidence in his fatherly love and compassion towards us as his
children, <hi>Psalme</hi> 103. 13. with assurance of obtaining our suites and desires,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 14, 15. For as young children desire to come unto their Fathers
bosome, or to sit upon the knee, or in the Mothers lap: so we by prayers
doe creep into the Lords bosome, and as it were, doe stand between the
Lords legges, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. comming with boldnesse unto him, as unto our
mercifull Father, whose bowels are larger in pittifull affection then any
parents, yea then the Mothers towards the tendrest childe, if we come with
faith and affiance, that he will grant what we require: For if parents will
give good things to their children when they aske them, much more will
the Lord give his spirit to them that aske it of him, without doubting,
<hi>Mat. 7. 11. Luke</hi> 11. 13. and this doubting is the cause why many goe away
so often from prayer without profit and comfort, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 5. which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
the long and idle prayers of the Papists, who have not assurance
of Gods love towards them in the thing they demand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, necessity of duty on our parts: that we both reverence, <hi>Mal. 1.
6.</hi> and imitate him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. as our Father, <hi>Eph. 5. 1. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:55421:183"/>
Thirdly, that to come in any other name then our Saviour Christs, is
abominable, which was figured in <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 24. 2. &amp; 20. 19. and <hi>Aaron,
Levit.</hi> 16. 17. But is notably set forth of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. therefore
it is abominable to come by Saints, as in Popery they doe.</p>
                  <p>What is to be considered by this, that we are directed to call him our
Father?</p>
                  <p>The nature of faith, which is to apply it home to himselfe, <hi>John 20. 28
Gal. 2. 20. Matth.</hi> 27. 46. Also, that our Saviour Christ is the naturall Son,
and we his Sons by grace and adoption.</p>
                  <p>May not a man say in his prayer, My Father?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, and that with warrant of our Saviour Christs example,
<hi>Matth</hi> 27. 46.</p>
                  <p>Why then are we taught here to say, Our Father?</p>
                  <p>As the word <hi>Father</hi> directeth us to meditate upon the relation between
God and our selves, so the word <hi>Our</hi> directeth us to meditate upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
between our selves, and so many as are or may be the children of
the same father with us.</p>
                  <p>What doth this put us in mind of?</p>
                  <p>That we must at all times maintain or renew love and peace one with
another, but especially when we make our prayers we must come in love,
as one brother loveth another, and therefore reconcile our selves, if there
be any breach, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 8. Esa. 1. 15. Matth. 5. 25, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, that we
are bound to pray, and to be suitors to our God and Father one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as for our selves, <hi>James 5</hi> 16. That every one praying for all,
and all for every one, we may jointly encrease and enjoy the benefit of
the common stock of prayers, laid up in the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Whereto doe the words following direct us, when we say, Which art in
heaven?</p>
                  <p>To the meditation of the glory,<note place="margin">Which art in heaven.</note> powerfull providence, wisdome, and
holinesse of God, in which regard he is said to dwell in the high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place, <hi>Psalm 11. 4. Esa.</hi> 57. 15. not that he is excluded from earth, or
included in heaven, or any place, who filleth all places, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. yea,
whom the heaven of heavens is not able to containe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27. But
first, because his wisdome, power, and glory, appeareth most evidently
in the rule of the heavens, as of the most excellent bodily creatures, by
which inferiour natures are ruled, <hi>Psal. 19. 1, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; 8. 3. &amp; 103. 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that in heaven he doth make himselfe and his goodnesse
knowne to the Angels, and blessed Spirits of men, immediately, and
without the helps and aids which we have.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because he communicateth himselfe and his goodnesse more
powerfully to them then to us: and so God is said to be present in the
Temple, and in the Elect.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because there, and not on earth, we should now seek him,
<hi>Psalm 123. 1. Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. where also we hope another day to dwell with
him, in the same happy fellowship, which now the holy Angels and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
soules doe enjoy; which teacheth us not to have any fleshly conceit,
but to have our cogitations above any worldly matter.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, to teach us that as we come boldly to him as to a Father, so also
we are to come with humility and reverence of his Majesty, who is so
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55421:184"/>
high above us; we wretched men being as wormes crauling upon the
earth, and he sitting in great Majesty in the highest heaven, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 16.
&amp; 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, to teach us to pray not onely reverently, but also fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, so directing and lifting up our hearts to Almighty God, that our
prayers may ascend into heaven, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32. 20.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, to encrease our confidence in him, who is both ready and
able to doe all things for us, that acknowledging him to ride on the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
for our help, (<hi>able</hi>) as in heaven to doe for us whatsoever (<hi>as a father</hi>)
he will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3. we may with full confidence in his power and love
ask every good thing of him, <hi>Psalm 2. 8. Luke</hi> 11. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the preface: Now are we to come to the prayer it selfe:
What is generall unto it?</p>
                  <p>That our affections with zeale and earnestnesse ought to wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on prayer, which appeareth by the shortnesse of all the petitions.</p>
                  <p>What is declared hereby?</p>
                  <p>The great affection we should have to the things we come for: which
giveth a check to our cold prayers, where the understanding is witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is a fault of us (when we are distressed) in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>

benefits received.</p>
                  <p>How many Petitions are there in the Lords Prayer?<note place="margin">6. Petitions in the Lords Prayer.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six, (equally divided, as it were, into two Tables) whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
concerne God, as doth the first Table of the Law; three doe concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> our
selves and our neighbours, as doth the second Table: For in the three first
we make request for those things that concerne Gods Majesty, whose
glory and service we are to preferre before our owne good, <hi>Iohn 12. 27,
28.</hi> In the three latter, for those things that concerne the necessity of man,
and our owne welfare, which we must referre to the former, <hi>Psalme</hi> 50. 15.
So that by the very order of the Petitions, we learne this instruction, that
we must and ought first to thinke upon Gods glory before any thing that
appertaines or belongs to us, and that we should seeke the service of God
before our owne good, <hi>John</hi> 12. 27, 28. yea, and preferre the glorifying of
the name of God before our owne salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. As also by the
order of the Commandements, which being divided into two Tables, the
first concernes the Worship of God, the second our selves.</p>
                  <p>What observe you from this?</p>
                  <p>Our hypocrisie: for were it not for our selves and our wants, we would
not come to God at all in prayer: As in Popery, all their prayers are for
themselves, and their salvation, &amp;c. whereas this word (<hi>thy</hi>) in all these
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55421:184"/>
Petitions doth shut forth the consideration of our selves, to the end that
we might have our minds altogether fastened upon the service of God.</p>
                  <p>What further observe you proper to those Petitions that concerne the
glory of God?</p>
                  <p>That as they must be begged in the first place, so must they likewise
be performed with further zeale of spirit, and earnestnesse of affection:
as may be gathered, in that they are propounded without any band or
coupling of one with another.</p>
                  <p>How are the three first Petitions divided?</p>
                  <p>Thus: the first concerneth Gods glory it selfe, the other two, the
things whereby God is glorified; as when his Kingdome commeth, and
his will is done.</p>
                  <p>What are the words of the first Petition?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Petition.</note> Mat. 6. 9. Luke 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this Petition?</p>
                  <p>That in all things God may be glorified, That he, who in himselfe, his
words and works is most glorious and holy, may be acknowledged and
honoured for such by us, <hi>Psal. 46. 8. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>Why is this Petition set before all?</p>
                  <p>Because it is that which ought to be dearest unto us, and for that all
things are to be referred unto it, <hi>Prov. 16. 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
                  <p>What is to be considered for the further opening of this Petition?</p>
                  <p>First, for the meaning of the words apart, then of them together.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by the word Name?</p>
                  <p>By the name of God,<note place="margin">What is meant by Name.</note> we are to understand God himselfe, 1 <hi>King. 5. 5.
Isa.</hi> 26. 8. as he maketh knowne to us the fame and glory of his nature,
otherwise unconceivable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 29. For the name of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
signifieth God himself; because the nature of a thing is taken for that
it is the name of, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15. his Essence, and all things by which he is
knowne unto us.</p>
                  <p>What are those Names whereby God is made knowne unto us?</p>
                  <p>First, his Titles; as <hi>Jehovah, Elohim,</hi> the Lord of Hosts, and such like,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14. and 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his Attributes and Properties; as his wisedome, power, love,
goodnesse, mercy, justice, truth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18, 19, &amp;c. &amp; 34. 5, 6, &amp;c. which
being essentiall in him, are for our capacity expressed under the name of
such qualities in us, and are called the names of God, because as names
serve to discerne things by, so God is knowne by these things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, also his memorials signified by his name, because he getteth
glory by them.</p>
                  <p>What are these Memorials?</p>
                  <p>First, the works and actions of God; as the Creation and government
of the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. but especially, the worke of redemption, <hi>Psalme
19.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the things that belong unto God; as his Worship, Word,
Sacraments and disclipine; but especially his Word, <hi>Psalme</hi> 138. 2. &amp; 19.
&amp;c. which is the booke of grace, and the boxe of ointment, out of which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55421:185"/>
the sweet savour of his name is most effectually powred, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by the word Hallowed?</p>
                  <p>Sanctified and reverenced:<note place="margin">What is meant by hallowed.</note> for to <hi>hallow,</hi> is to set apart a thing from the
common use to some proper end; and therefore to hallow the name of
God, is to separate it from all profane and unholy abuse, to a holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
use.</p>
                  <p>Can any man adde any thing unto Gods holinesse?</p>
                  <p>No, no, we cannot adde any holinesse unto God, or take any from
him; but as God is holy in his properties and actions, and also in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
both in the Church and Common-wealth, so wee desire they
may be (and that not onely by our selves, but also by all men) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and reputed as they are worthy in themselves to be reputed and
accounted. And in this respect onely are we said to hallow his name,
when we acknowledge it and honour it for such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 96. 7, 8. thereby (as
it were) setting the Crowne of holinesse and honour upon the head of
God: contrariwise, failing so to doe, we are guilty of the profanation of
Gods holy name; not that he can receive any pollution from us, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a man that lusteth after a chast woman is said by our Saviour to be
guilty of adultery with her, though she remaineth in her self spotlesse and
undefiled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28.</p>
                  <p>May none else be glorified but the name of God?</p>
                  <p>When it is said, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> thereby is noted that no glory
or honour should be given to any thing in the world, but to the name of
God, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42. 8. &amp; 48. 11. further then they are instruments whereby we
may arise to the glorifying of it; for God will not give his glory to any
other thing, no not to the manhood of our Saviour Christ.</p>
                  <p>What is to be considered in the words together?</p>
                  <p>That it is a singular benefit of God to admit us to the sanctifying of his
name, and (as it were) to set the Crowne (which is his glory) upon his
head, and to hold it there, especially seeing he is able himself alone to doe
it; and when he would use others thereto, he hath so many Legions of
Angels to doe it, yea, can raise up stones to doe it.</p>
                  <p>What doe you then aske of God in this Petition?</p>
                  <p>That as God is glorious in himselfe,<note place="margin">What we ask in this petition</note> so he may be declared and made
knowne unto men: that therefore God would have himselfe known and
acknowledged by all men, but especially by my selfe, to be most holy;
that whether we speak, think, or any way use his name, properties, works,
or Word, we may doe it holily, and with all reverence: That his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
power, goodnesse, mercy, truth, righteousnesse, and eternity, may
more and more be imparted unto me, and other of Gods people: That
he may be acknowledged just, wise, &amp;c. in all his works, even in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
of some to eternall life, and other some to everlasting destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
That his infinite justice, and infinite mercy over all his creatures (but
especially over his Church) may be reverenced and adored by all men,
but especially by my selfe: That the name of God may be reverently and
holily used of all men, but especially of my selfe: That when the glory
of God commeth in question, between my selfe and any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
unto me, I may preferre that unto this: Finally, that God would
vouchsafe to plant and encrease in me and others such graces whereby his
name may be glorified.</p>

kingdome of power: Secondly, that he exerciseth over all the Church

                  <p>What desire we of God concerning the government he exerciseth over all

                  <p>That he would governe all the creatures, both in the naturall course of

rule of Devils themselves, in such sort as they may serve for the good of

                  <p>What great need is there that we should pray for the kingdome of God?</p>
                  <p>For that being taught, that we should pray that the kingdome of God

                  <p>They doe in words and shew: but when they doe his will, live under
his lawes, delight in his works of darknesse, subject themselves to the
Pope, and other his instruments; they are found indeed to love him as
their father, and honour him as their Prince, whom in words they would
seeme to abhorre: For as the same men are affirmed by our Saviour Christ

of grace, so they may be both ministred and received in that pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sincerity, which is according to his Word, and all false Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and sacrifices put under foot.</p>
                  <p>What pray we for concerning the Censures?</p>
                  <p>That not only private persons, but the whole Church may be ruled by
the line of Gods Word, that so well doers may be advanced, and evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
censured and corrected, according to the degree of their fault; and
therefore, that all impunity or tyrannous tortures of conscience may be
taken away.</p>
                  <p>What further doe we pray for?</p>

that every Church may be polished and garnished, that Sion may appeare

heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>2. That the number of the elect being accomplished, the finall disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of all things may come: That God would hasten the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his Son to judgement for the elects sake, who with singular love
and affection long for it, saying; <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, Rev. 22. 20.
2 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. that we and all his chosen may obtaine full salvation, and enjoy
the fruition of that glory prepared for us before the beginning of the
world.</p>
                  <p>3. That God would get himselfe glory by the finall confusion of his
enemies.</p>
                  <p>What are the words of the third Petition?</p>
                  <p>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heauen,<note place="margin">The third Petition.</note>
                     <hi>Mat. 6. 10. Luke</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this Petition?</p>
                  <p>That God would grant us, that we may voluntarily and willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
our selves unto him and his providence: That renouncing the will of
Satan, and our owne corrupt inclination, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 26. 1 Peter</hi> 4. 2. and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
all things that are contrary to the will of God, we may doe his will,
not as we will, nor grudgingly, but readily, <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. 60. and heartily,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23. following in our measure the example of the Angels and Saints
that are in heaven, <hi>Psalme</hi> 103. 20. Finally, that obedience may be given to
Christ, in ruling us untill we be as the holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by this word [Thy.]</p>
                  <p>Hereby we exclude all wils opposed to, or diverse from the will of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55421:188"/>
God; whether the will of Satan, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. or our owne, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 2.
naturally corrupt and enthralled to Satan; yea, whatsoever unlawfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
or desires, repugnant to the will of God, 2 <hi>Sam. 2. 7. James</hi> 4. 15.
For when we pray for obedience to Gods will, we pray that all wils of
wicked Angels, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 2. and men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 140. 8. as contrary to the will
of God, may be disappointed. We desire also the suppression of our
owne will, as that which being prone to all sin, as a match to take fire, is
naught and repugnant to the will of God, so far are we from having any
free-will naturally to doe that which is good, <hi>Psalm</hi> 86. 11. &amp; 119. 37,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. &amp; 8. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. &amp; 7. 24. which we must bewaile both in our
selves and others, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 7. Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. freely acknowledging that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
of our selves doe the will of God, but by his assistance, and desiring
grace that we may obey his will, and not the lusts of our flesh.</p>
                  <p>How manifold is the will of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twofold,</hi> Deut. 29. 29.</p>
                  <p>1. His secret and hidden will, whereof the Scripture speaketh thus, <hi>If
so be the will of God, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 17. whereunto are to be referred his eternall
counsell, the events of outward things, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 1. times and seasons, &amp;c.
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                  <p>2. His manifest will, which is revealed and made knowne unto us in
the Word, both in his promises, which we are to beleeve, and in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and commandements, which (as conditions of obedience in way
of thanksgiving annexed unto the promises) we are to performe.</p>
                  <p>What will are we to understand in this petition?</p>
                  <p>Not so much that part which God keepeth secret from us, as that
part thereof which he hath revealed in his Word, wherein is set downe
what we ought to doe, or leave undone.</p>
                  <p>How doth that appeare?</p>
                  <p>1. Because it is unlawfull to search or enquire into the secret will of
God, and impossible for man to know it untill it come to passe; whereas
to the doing of this will knowledge is requisite.</p>
                  <p>2. No man can resist or withstand Gods secret will, neither is it any
thank for us to accomplish it, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28.</p>
                  <p>3. There are no promises for performing the secret will of God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man may doe it and perish, as <hi>Pilate, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. God proposeth many things in his secret will, for which it is not
lawfull for us to pray.</p>
                  <p>What then must we especially pray for in the secret will of God?</p>
                  <p>That when God bringeth any thing to passe by his secret will, which
is grievous to our natures, we may with patience and contentment sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our wils to his will, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 14.</p>
                  <p>What doe we aske of God in this petition concerning his revealed will?</p>
                  <p>1. That we may know his will, without the which we cannot doe it.</p>
                  <p>2. That we may doe all his will being knowne, and shew our selves
obedient to our heavenly Father and Lord.</p>
                  <p>3. That he would bestow upon us the gifts and graces of his Spirit, that
so our hearts being by grace set at large, strengthened, and directed, <hi>Psal.
119.</hi> 32, 36. we may be enabled to doe his will.</p>
                  <p>4. That he would remove from us all things that shall hinder us from
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55421:188"/>
knowing his will, and putting it in execution; as ignorance of the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
will of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 18. rebellion, dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22, 23. all pretences, and dispensations, or powers, presuming
to dispence with the will of God. In a word, that so many as are subjects
in the kingdome of Christ may doe the duty of good subjects, and be
obedient to the revealed will of God, seeking his kingdome and his
righteousnesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. so that there is a mutuall relation of this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the former, where we pray that God may rule; as here, that his
rule may be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>What understand you in this petition by Doing?</p>
                  <p>Not a good intent onely in the heart, or profession of obedience in
word and pretence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 30. but an actuall and thorough perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of what is required of us, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 25. And therefore wee pray
here, that the will of God may not onely be intended and endevoured,
but also accomplished, although it be with griefe and smart, <hi>Phil. 2. 13.
Acts</hi> 20. 24.</p>
                  <p>What is here meant by earth and heaven?</p>
                  <p>By earth, those that are in earth, and by heaven, those that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
For here we propound to our selves the patterns of the Angels and
blessed soules, who being freed from all mixture of corruption, doe in
their kind perfectly obey God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 20, 22. whereby we learne that
our obedience should be done most humbly, willingly, readily, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and wholly, (not doing one, and leaving another undone) even as
the will of God is done by the Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. who therefore are
set forth winged, to shew their speedinesse, <hi>Esa</hi> 6. 2. and round footed,
to expresse their readinesse to all and every commandement of God,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>But seeing we are sinfull, and the Angels holy, how can wee imitate
them?</p>
                  <p>We desire to imitate them in the manner, though we know we cannot
equall them in measure and degree of obedience: and hereby we are
taught that we should endevour to the like holinesse, and so grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
daily more and more till we be like unto them; not that we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it to the full as they doe. As also in this regard God himselfe saith,
<hi>Be ye holy as I am holy, Lev. 11. 44. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 16. and yet it were absurd to say
or think, that any man could come to the holinesse of God, whose holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
he is commanded to follow: And this answereth to our desire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening
the Lords comming in the former petition.</p>
                  <p>What then doe wee desire here for the manner of performance of Gods
will?</p>
                  <p>That we may after the heavenly patterne afore mentioned, willingly,
without constraint or repugnancy, <hi>Psalm</hi> 110. 3. speedily, without delay,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 60. sincerely, without hypocrisie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 28, 29. fully, without
reservation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. and constantly, without intermission, <hi>Psal. 119.
112.</hi> beleeve the promises of mercy, and obey the precepts of holinesse:
and so all unwilling, and by law onely inforced obedience is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and we enjoined to performe our service with delight, joy, and
alacrity.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the three first Petitions, for things concerning God. To
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55421:189"/>
come to the three latter that concerne our selves,<note place="margin">The three last Petitions.</note> and our neighbour;
what are we generally to note in them?</p>
                  <p>1. The order and dependance they have from the former three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God; whereby we are taught that there is no lawfull use of these
Petitions which follow, or any of them; unlesse we first labour in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Petitions concerning the service of God. For we are then allowed,
and not till then, (<hi>Luke 17. 7, &amp;c.</hi>) to seek good things for our selves,
when we have first minded, and sought those things that concerne the
glory of God; because unto godlinesse onely the promises of this life
and that which is to come are entailed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>What further?</p>
                  <p>That as in the former the word <hi>[Thy]</hi> did only respect God, so in these
following by these words <hi>[our</hi> and <hi>us]</hi> we learne to have a fellow-fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the miseries and necessities of others; and therefore in care to
pray for them, which is one tryall of the true spirit of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Is there any thing else common to them all?</p>
                  <p>That in all these Petitions under one thing expressed, other things are
figuratively included, and under one kinde all the rest, and all the meanes
to obtaine them are comprehended, as shall appeare.</p>
                  <p>How are these Petitions divided?</p>
                  <p>The first concerneth mans body, and the things of this life: the two
last concerne the soule, and things pertaining to the life to come. For
all which we are taught to depend on God; and namely according to the
order observed in the Creed, (called the Apostles) 1. On the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God our Father the Creator for our nourishment, and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
blessings. 2. On the mercies of Christ our Saviour for pardon
of our sinnes. 3. On the power and assistance of the holy Spirit, our
sanctifier, for strength to resist and subdue all temptations unto evill.</p>
                  <p>What observe you out of the order of these Petitions?</p>
                  <p>That we have but one Petition for outward things, as lesse to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
but for spirituall things two, as about which our care is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. to teach us how smally earthly things are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in regard of heavenly: and therefore that our prayers for the things
of this life should be short, and further drawn out for the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Why then is the Petition for the temporall things put before the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for spirituall?</p>
                  <p>The first place is given to outward things, not because they are chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
but because,</p>
                  <p>First, it is the manner of the Scriptures, commonly to put things first
that are soonest dispatched.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that outward things may be helpes to enable us to spirituall
duties, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 20. 21.) and that in having aforehand earthly things, we
may be the more ready and earnest to intreat for heavenly things: so our
Saviour Christ healed the bodily diseases, to provoke all men to come
unto him for the cure of the spirituall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that outward things may be as steps or degrees, whereby our
weake faith may the better ascend to lay claime and hold on spirituall
graces, (<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27, 28.) That by experience of the smaller things we
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:55421:189"/>
may climbe up to higher; whereby their hypocrisie is discovered, which
pretend great assurance of forgivenesse of sinnes, and of their keeping
from the evill one; whereas they are distrustfull for the things of this life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God hath a consideration of our weaknesse, who are unapt
to performe any duties, or service to God, if we want the things of this
life, and that which is requisite to sustaine and suffice nature.</p>
                  <p>To proceed in order: what are the words of the fourth Petition, which
concerneth the things of this life?</p>
                  <p>Give us this day our daily bread,<note place="margin">The fourth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</note> 
                     <hi>Matth. 6. 11.
Luke</hi> 11. 3.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this Petition?</p>
                  <p>That God would provide for us competent meanes, and such a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of outward blessings, as he shall see meet for us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8. not only
for our necessities, but also for Christian and sober delight, according to
our calling, and his blessing upon us. Likewise, that he would give us grace
to relye our selves upon his providence, for all the meanes of this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life, and to rest contented with that allowance which he shall thinke
fit for us, <hi>Phil</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by Bread?<note place="margin">What meant by (Bread.)</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>All outward things, serving both for our necessity, and sober delight,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 27. &amp; 31. 14. as health, wealth, food, physick, sleep, rayment,
house, &amp;c. together with all the helps and meanes to attaine them; As
good Princes, Magistrates, peace, seasonable weather, and such like; As
also the removall of the contrary, as war, plague, famine, evill weather, &amp;c.
And the blessing of God upon these creatures w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he bestoweth upon us.</p>
                  <p>What is here to be observed?</p>
                  <p>That we must desire bread, not Quailes, or other delicates, not riches
and superfluity, <hi>James 4. 3. Num</hi> 11. 4, 5, 6. but a proportion of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
credit, liberty, &amp;c. convenient for us, <hi>Prov. 30. 8. 1 Tim</hi> 6. 8. and
that with condition, if God shall see it good for us, or so be his good
pleasure, <hi>Mat. 8. 2. James 4. 15. 2 Sam.</hi> 7. 27. which exception is a caution
proper to this Petition for outward things.</p>
                  <p>What need is there of asking these things?</p>
                  <p>The frailty of our nature, not able to continue in health scarse one day
without these helps, and as it were, props to uphold this decayed and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous
cottage of our mortall bodies, lesse able to forbeare them then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
beasts: for seeing there were a necessary use of our meat in the time of
innocency, the necessity by our fall is much greater.</p>
                  <p>What learne you from the word [Give?]</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">What meant by (Give)</note> that from God all things come, <hi>Psal. 104. 27, 28, 29, 30. Acts</hi> 14. 17.
which we are ready to ascribe either to the earth called the nurse, or to
our money wherewith we buy them, or to our friends that give them us:
As if we should looke upon the Steward only, and passe by the Master of
the Family; or upon the breast that giveth sucke, and neglect the nurse or
bottle we drinke of, and passe by the giver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:55421:190"/>
What next?</p>
                  <p>That although in regard of our labour, or buying any thing, it may be
called ours, yet we say, <hi>Give Lord,</hi> both because we are unable by any
service or labour to deserve the least crum of bread, or drop of water,
(much lesse the kingdome of heaven and salvation) at the hands of God,
<hi>Luke 17. 10. Gen.</hi> 32. 10. and because our labour and diligence cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
without Gods blessing.</p>
                  <p>What learne you further?</p>
                  <p>That seeing God giveth to whom he will, and what he will, we learne
to be content with whatsoever we have received: Moreover, to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for it, seeing all things in regard of God are sanctified by the Word,
and in regard of our selves, by prayer and thanksgiving, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 5. And
last of all, not to envie at other mens plenty, being it is Gods doing,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 15.</p>
                  <p>What reason is there, that they should pray for these things of God,
which have them already in their Garners, Cellars, &amp;c. in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance?</p>
                  <p>Very great. Because, 1. our right unto the creatures being forfeited
in <hi>Adam,</hi> we having now nothing to plead, but onely Gods Deed of
gift made unto us in Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and heire of all things, in
whom, and with whom, all things are conveyed to us, <hi>Psalm 8. 7, 8, 9.
Heb. 1. 2. Rom. 8. 32. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 22. so that although we possesse them, yet are
we not right owners of them but by faith, which is declared by prayer
for them.</p>
                  <p>2. The things we doe possesse we may easily a hundred wayes be thrust
from the possession of them before we come to use them, according to
the proverb, that <hi>many things come between the cup and the lip, 1 Sam. 30.
16, 17. Dan. 5. 5. 2 Kings</hi> 7. 17.</p>
                  <p>3 Although we have the use of them, yet will they not profit us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in feeding nor cloathing us, unlesse we have the blessing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; yea, without the which they may be hurtfull and poisonable
unto us, <hi>Esa. 3. 1. Hag. 1. 6. Prov. 10. 22. Dan. 1. 13, 14, 15. Psal.</hi> 78. 30, 31.
By all which reasons it may appeare, that the rich are as well to use this
petition as the poorest, praying therein not so much for the outward
things, as Gods blessing upon them.</p>
                  <p>Why doe we say,<note place="margin">Give us.</note> Give us?</p>
                  <p>Hereby we professe our selves Petitioners for all men, especially the
houshold of faith; that for the most part every one may have sufficient,
and where want is, others may be enabled to supply it out of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
                  <p>Why doe we say,<note place="margin">This day.</note> This day, or, For the day?</p>
                  <p>That we are to pray for bread for a day, and not for a month, or yeare,
&amp;c. it is to teach us to restraine our care, that it reach not too farre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to
rest in Gods providence and present blessing, and therefore not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
<hi>Exod. 16. 19, 20, 21. Pro.</hi> 30. 8. So that hereby we professe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our care, and desire of earthly things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 34. with our
purpose every day by labour and prayer to seeke these blessings at the
hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Is it not lawfull to provide for children and family?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:55421:190"/>
Yes verily; not onely lawfull, but also needfull, <hi>Gen. 41, 34, 35. Acts
11. 28. 29. 2 Cor. 12. 14. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 8. But here our affections are onely
forbidden to passe measure, as to have a carking and troubling care, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vexation of the day is enough for it selfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 34. but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our wayes unto the Lord; and to roll our matters upon him who will

                  <p>Why is the Bread called ours, seeing that God must give it us?</p>
                  <p>To teach us,<note place="margin">Out.</note> that we must come unto it by our owne labour, <hi>Gen. 3. 17.
Psalme 128. 1. 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 11. In which respect, hee that will not labour,
should not eate, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10. For it is called our bread, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to us by the blessing of God on our lawfull labours, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 12.
so that neither God nor man can justly implead us for it.</p>
                  <p>What is the reason of the word daily?</p>
                  <p>By daily bread,<note place="margin">Daily.</note> or bread instantly necessary, or such as is to be added
to our substance; wee understand such provision, and such a proportion
thereof, as may best agree with our nature, charge, and calling, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 8.

my condition; Which is an especiall lesson for all estates, and callings, to
keep them within their bounds; not onely of necessity, but of Christian
and sober delight, and not to aske them for the fulfilling of our fleshly

preservation of this life.</p>
                  <p>3. That he would give us care and conscience to get those needful things
by lawfull meanes: which condemneth: First, those that use wicked

                  <p>So much of the Petition for things belonging to this life: What doe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in those two which belong unto the life to come?</p>
                  <p>Perfect salvation, standing in the deliverance from the evils past, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the former, and those to come, comprised in the latter: By the
former we pray for justification, and by the latter for sanctification.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the former: What are the words of the fifth Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>And forgiue us our debts,<note place="margin">The fifth Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as euen we forgiue
them that are debters unto us, <hi>Mat. 6. 12. Luk. 11</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Where we are to observe:</p>
                  <p>1. The Petition for the forgivenesse of our sins.</p>
                  <p>2. The reason added for the confirmation thereof, or a reason of the
perswasion that they are forgiven.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of this Petition?</p>
                  <p>That we may be justified, and be at peace with God, that God giving
us a true knowledge and feeling of our sins, would forgive us freely for
his Sons sake, and make us daily assured of the forgivenesse of our sins,
as we are privy to our selves of the forgivenesse of those trespasses which
men have offended us by, <hi>Job 33. 24. Psal. 35. 3. Jer. 14. 7. Col.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>What is meant here by debts?</p>
                  <p>The comparison is drawne from debters,<note place="margin">What is meant by debts.</note> which are not able to pay
their creditors, to whom all we are compared, for that we have all sinned;
Therefore by debts we must understand sins; (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> expoundeth
the metaphor) and that not in themselves, as breaches of the Law of God,
(for who would say that we owe, and are to pay sin unto God?) but with
respect to the punishment, and satisfaction due to Gods justice for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of sin: For our debt being properly obedience, whereto we are
bound under penalty of all the curses of the Law, especially eternall
death, <hi>Rom. 8, 12. 13. 18. Gal.</hi> 5. 3. we all in <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited that bond wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the penalty became our debt, and is daily increased in us all by sinning,
<hi>Luke 13. 4. Mat.</hi> 18. 24, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
                  <p>What learne you from hence?</p>
                  <p>Here hence two things are implyed: One, a franke and humble confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that we have sinned both originally and actually; Another, that there
is no power in us to make satisfaction for our sins.</p>
                  <p>What use is there of Confession?</p>
                  <p>Great, for that we have naturally a senselesnesse of sin: or else, being
convinced thereof, we are ready to lessen it and make it light; the contrary
whereof appeareth in the children of God, 1 <hi>John 1. 8, 9. Psal. 32. 3, 4.
Prov. 28 13. Job 31. 33. 1 Sam. 15. 19, 20. Psal. 51. 3, 4, 5, 6. Acts 22.
3, 4, 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 15.</p>
                  <p>How can a man confesse his sins, being not knowne, and without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</p>
                  <p>Those that are knowne we must expresly confesse, and the other that
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55421:191"/>
are unknowne, and cannot be reckoned generally, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12.</p>
                  <p>How appeareth it that we are not able to pay this debt?</p>
                  <p>Because by the Law as an obligation every one being bound to keep it
wholly and continually, <hi>Deut. 27. 26. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. so that the breach thereof
even once, and in the least point, maketh us debtors presently, (as having
forfeited our obligation) there is no man that can either avoid the breach
of it, or when he hath broken it, make amends unto God for it, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that whatsoever he doth after the breach, is both imperfectly done,
and if it were perfect, yet it is due by the obligation of the Law, and
therefore cannot goe for paiment, no more then a man can pay one debt
with another.</p>
                  <p>What doth it draw with it, that causeth it to be so impossible to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied?</p>
                  <p>The reward of it, which is everlasting death both of body and soule,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. the greatnesse and also number whereof is declared by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of ten thousand talents, which no man is able to pay, being not able
to satisfie so much as one farthing.</p>
                  <p>But are we not able to satisfie some part of it, as a man in great debt is
sometime able to make some satisfaction, especially if hee have day
given him?</p>
                  <p>No: and therefore we are compared to a child new borne, red with
bloud, and not able to wash himselfe, nor to help himself, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 5.
And to captives close shut up in prison and fetters, kept by a strong one,
<hi>Luke 4. 18. Matth.</hi> 12. 29. so that there is as small likelihood of our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of the power of Satan, as that a poore Lamb should deliver it
selfe from the gripes and pawes of a Lion.</p>
                  <p>What is the meanes to free us from this debt?</p>
                  <p>By this petition Christ teacheth us, that being pressed with the burden
of our sin, we should flee unto the mercy of God, and to entreat him for
the forgivenesse of our debt, <hi>Matth. 11. 28. Esa.</hi> 55. 1. even the cancelling
of our obligation, that in Law it be not available against us. In which
respect the preaching of the Gospel is compared to the yeare of Iubile,
when no man might demand his debt of his Brother, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>How shall we obtaine this at Gods hands?</p>
                  <p>By the onely blood and suffering of Christ, as the onely ransome for
sin: contrary to the Papists, who confessing that originall sinne is taken
away by Christ in Baptisme, doe teach that we must make part of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for our actuall sin, and therefore some of them whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as if their bloud might satisfie for sinne, which is abominable to
think.</p>
                  <p>What doe you then understand here by forgivenesse?</p>
                  <p>Such remission as may agree with Gods justice, which will not endure
him to be a loser, wherefore it is forgivenesse of us by taking paiment of
another, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 24. even of our surety Iesus Christ in our behalfe,
1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>What meane you by saying, Vs, and Ours?</p>
                  <p>We include with our selves in this petition as many as are in Christ
enabled by a true faith to lay hold on him, and to plead his paiment and
satisfaction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 7, 8. &amp; 51. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:55421:192"/>
Doe we here pray for the sinnes of this day, as before for the bread of
this day?</p>
                  <p>Not onely for them, but also for all that ever we have done at all times
before, to the end that we might be the further confirmed in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the remission of all our sins.</p>
                  <p>What is further to be considered in this Petition?</p>
                  <p>That as in the former by <hi>Bread</hi> more was understood, so here under
one part of our Iustification, to wit, the remission, or not imputation of
sins unto death, by meanes of the satisfaction of Christs sufferings, we
doe also conceive the other part, which is the imputation of his holinesse
unto life eternall, as implyed under the former, and inseparably annexed
thereto. For as Christ hath taken away our sins by suffering, so he hath
also cloathed us with his righteousnesse, by fulfilling of the Law for us,
<hi>Dan. 9. 24. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>What doe we then aske of God in this Petition?</p>
                  <p>Six things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Grace,<note place="margin">What we aske of God in this fifth petition.</note> feelingly to know, and frankly and tremblingly to confesse,
without excuse or extenuation, the great debt of our sins, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3. and
our utter inability to satisfie for the same, or for the least part thereof,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 3. &amp; 142. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. That God would bestow upon us Christ Iesus, and for his sake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
out of his sight all our sins, and the guilt and punishment due unto
us for the same.</p>
                  <p>3. The power of saving faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 5. to lay hold on the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sufferings and obedience of our Lord Iesus Christ, unto our full Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>Esa.</hi> 53. 5.</p>
                  <p>4. The Spirit of prayer, that with griefe and sorrow for our sins wee
may crave pardon for our sinnes, and increase of faith, <hi>Zach. 12. 10.
Mark</hi> 9. 24.</p>
                  <p>5. An assurance of the forgivenesse of our sins by the testimony of the
Spirit of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. and exemplifying and applying the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
pardon of sins once for all granted unto us at our conversion, unto the
severall sins and debts of every day and moment of our life.</p>
                  <p>6. We pray for remission of sin, not as intending our selves to undergoe
the punishment, or any part thereof, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 7. But contrariwise, that the
whole debt (which is properly the punishment, as hath been shewed)
may be accepted at the hands of Christ our Surety, and we fully dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and acquitted, so that nothing may remaine on our account, but the
righteousnesse of Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 8, 9. whereby the favour and kingdome
of God is purchased for us.</p>
                  <p>So much of Petition: What is set downe in the reason?</p>
                  <p>A true note to certifie us whether our sinnes are forgiven us or not,<note place="margin">The reason of the petition.</note> by
that we forgive, or not forgive others, that have offended us.</p>
                  <p>Doth this reason binde God to forgive us?</p>
                  <p>No otherwise then by his gracious and true promises, this being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
consequent and fruit of the other, and not a cause. For when we
say, <hi>As we,</hi> or <hi>for we also forgive, &amp;c.</hi> we argue with the Lord, not for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but from the modell of Gods grace in us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 14, 15. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incomparably inferiour to the mercy and love of God; and yet dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55421:192"/>
us to forgive and let fall (in regard of hatred or private revenge,
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19.) any wrongs and injuries of our brethren against us, may both
stirre up the compassion of the Lord towards us his children, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 19.
and assure us of the attaining of this our request, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 13. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that we may not be destitute of so important an argument, <hi>Marke 11.
25. 1 Iohn</hi> 3. 14. both to plead for mercy with God, and to assure our
selves of successe, we desire of God a portion of that mercy which is
so abundant in him, that we may be tenderly affected one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake forgiveth us,
<hi>Eph. 4. 32. Col.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>But seeing God alone forgiveth sinnes, <hi>Matth. 9. 2. Mar. 2. 7. Iob 14.
4. Esa.</hi> 43. 25. here understood by the word Debt: How is it said
that we forgive sinnes?</p>
                  <p>We forgive not the sinne so far as it is sinne against God: but so far as
it bringeth griefe and hinderance unto us, we may forgive it.</p>
                  <p>Are we hereby bound to forgive all our Debts?</p>
                  <p>No verily; we may both crave our debts of our debtors; and if there
be no other remedie, goe to Law in a simple desire of Iustice; (yea in
lawfull warre we may kill our enemies, and yet forgive them) being free
from anger and revenge; yet so, that if our Debtors be not able to pay, we
are bound in a duty to forgive them, or at least to have a conscionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their inability.</p>
                  <p>How is this reason drawne?</p>
                  <p>From the lesse to the greater, thus: if we wretched sinners upon earth
can forgive others, how much more will the gracious God of heaven
forgive us? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 7. &amp; 6. 14, 15. if we having but a drop of mercy
can forgive others, how much more will God, who is a sea full of grace?
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 10. &amp; 3. 14. especially when we by forgiving sometimes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
losse: whereas from God by forgiving us nothing falleth away.</p>
                  <p>Wherein appeareth the inequality between our debt unto God, and mans
debts unto us?</p>
                  <p>First, in the number; our debts to God being compared to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
mens debts to us, to one hundred.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the weight; our debts to God being compared to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Talents, mens debts to us to an hundred pence.</p>
                  <p>How riseth this great inequality in the weight?</p>
                  <p>From the great inequality between God and man: for if to strike a King
be much more hainous then to strike a poore boy; what is it then to strike
God, who is infinitely greater then all the Kings of the earth?</p>
                  <p>What is to be gathered out of this reason?</p>
                  <p>That we should daily pray unto God, that he would mercifully worke
in us a mercifull affection, and give us loving and charitable hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all men, free from malice and revenge, and desirous of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And that as this is a testimony to our hearts, that God will forgive
us, if we for his sake can heartily forgive such as have offended us: so on
the other side, if we can shew no favour unto others, we can look for none
at the hands of God: And therefore to pray, without forgiving such as
have offended us, were not onely a meere babling, but also a procuring of
Gods wrath more heavily against us: which condemneth the hypocrisie
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55421:193"/>
of many, which assuring themselves in great confidence of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their sinnes, yet cannot finde in their hearts to forgive others;
end so by mocking the Lord, bring a curse upon themselves in stead of a
blessing; seeing heart, and hand, and mouth should goe together.</p>
                  <p>What further learne we by this reason?</p>
                  <p>That as our forgivenesse is nothing, unlesse the danger of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be taken away, which inability of paying the debt doth draw with
it: so it availeth us nothing to have our sinnes forgiven us of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the punishment also bee forgiven. Contrary to the Papists, who
teach that sinne and the guilt thereof is taken away by Christ, but that
we must satisfie for the punishment of it: wherein they make God like
unto those hypocrites, (here also condemned) who will seem to forgive,
and yet keepe a prick and quarrell in their hands, watching all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of advantage, which say, they will forgive, but not forget.</p>
                  <p>So much of the former Petition belonging to the life to come: What
are the words of the latter, which is the sixt and last Petition of
the Lords Prayer?</p>
                  <p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evill,<note place="margin">The sixt Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>Matth. 6. 13. Luke</hi> 11. 4.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe of it?</p>
                  <p>In it we pray for sanctification and strength against our sinnes;<note place="margin">The summe of the sixt Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that
sinne may not onely be pardoned unto us, but daily mortified in us, <hi>Rom.
6.</hi> 1, 2. and we either kept by the providence of God from temptations,
<hi>Prov. 30. 8. 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 8. are preserved by his grace from being hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. and as we pray that by the power of God
we may be strengthened against all tentations; so do we also pray, that
by the same power we may be raised up to new obedience: For under
one part of sanctification, that is the avoyding and mortifying of sinne,
is implyed the other part also, which is ability unto new obedience, 2 <hi>Cor.
7. 1. Rom.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>What is here to be observed in regard of the order, that this Petition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
followeth upon the former?</p>
                  <p>That therefore to strengthen our faith for the obtaining of this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we must be assured of the former; that seeing God hath forgiven us
our sinnes, he will be pleased also to mortifie our flesh, and quicken our
spirit, which are the two parts of sanctification, and never severed from
true justification.</p>
                  <p>What learne you of this?</p>
                  <p>That we cannot rightly desire God to forgive us our sinnes, unlesse we
crave also power to abstaine from the like in time to come, else our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is but babling: so that here we would be stirred to pray for strength
to avoid those sinnes whereof we craved pardon for before: So farre is
it that men should thinke that they are justified, when they have not so
much as a purpose to leave their sinne. For who being delivered from a
great disease will returne to it again, and not rather desire a Diet whereby
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55421:193"/>
he may escape it. Swine indeed after they are washed, and dogs after
their vomit returne, the one to their mire, the other to their vomit, <hi>Prov.

                  <p>If they cannot returne to their vomit, what need have they to pray?</p>
                  <p>Yes, very great, because God hath ordained prayer one meanes of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them from revolt, and they ought to be so much the more earnest in

                  <p>What learne you from hence?</p>
                  <p>Much comfort in temptations, in that it is a token of Gods favour, and
of pardon of our sins, that we are subject to temptations.</p>
                  <p>What other cause is there to pray, that we be not lead into temptation?</p>

be worse then the state of those that never tasted of the good word of
God, if they give themselves to evill; As a relapse in diseases is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then the first sicknesse was, <hi>John 5. 14. 2 Pet. 2. 22. Mat.</hi> 12. 43.</p>
                  <p>May we pray simply and absolutely against all temptations?</p>
                  <p>No verily:</p>
                  <p>For first, the best men that ever were (yea, the Son of God himselfe)
were subject to temptations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all temptations are not evill, but some are trials of our faith
and hope, and oftentimes make for our good: In which regard, they are
pronounced blessed that fall into divers temptations; and therefore ought
we not to pray simply and without exception to be delivered from them,
<hi>James 1. 2. Deuter.</hi> 8. 2. &amp; 13. 3. but only from the evill of them.</p>
                  <p>What then doe we pray for concerning them?</p>
                  <p>That if the Lord will be pleased to take tryall of the grace he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon us, either by afflictions or by occasion of temptation to sin
offered us, that we be not given over to them, or overcome by them; but
that we may have a good issue, and escape from them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. And
that if either we must goe under trouble, or offend the Lord, we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuse affliction then sin, <hi>John</hi> 36. 21.</p>
                  <p>Why are they called Temptations?</p>
                  <p>Because by them God trieth our obedience, and to notifie our faith and
patience, both to our selves and others, whether we will follow him or
not; and therefore we may be assured, that so often as we beat backe, or
overcome the temptations, we have as many undoubted testimonies of
his love.</p>
                  <p>What is here meant then by the word Temptation?</p>
                  <p>Sin, and whatsoever things by the corruption of our nature are occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to leade us into sin; as prosperity, adversity, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 9. which
otherwise simply are not to be numbred among these temptations we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
here to be delivered from.</p>
                  <p>How many wayes may a man be tempted?</p>
                  <p>Three:</p>
                  <p>1. By God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:55421:194"/>
2. By Satan and his wicked instruments.</p>
                  <p>3. By a mans owne corruption.</p>
                  <p>How may God be said to tempt?<note place="margin">How God tempteth us.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though God tempteth no man unto evill, as he is tempted of none,
<hi>James</hi> 1. 13. yet sometimes he leadeth men into temptations of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1. &amp; 6. 13. and that first by unusuall probatory precepts, as
when he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his sonne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 1, &amp;c. Secondly,
by sending an extraordinary measure of prosperity or adversity, <hi>Deut. 8.
16.</hi> Thirdly, by letting loose Satan (his band dog) to buffet and molest
the godly, as Saint <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7. or to seduce the wicked, as <hi>Ahabs</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 22. Fourthly, by desertion, leaving men to themselves,
whether for a time, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 15. as <hi>Ezechias</hi> in the businesse of the King of
<hi>Babels</hi> Embassage, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31. or utterly, as those whom he justly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
up to their owne lusts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26, 28. and the power of Satan, <hi>Acts
5.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>How agreeth it with the goodnesse of the Lord, to leade thus into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>When all things are of him, and by him, it must needs follow, that the
things that are done are provided and governed of him; yet in such sort, as
none of the evill which is in the transgressor cleaveth unto him.</p>
                  <p>But how can that be without staine of his righteousnesse?</p>
                  <p>It is a righteous thing with God to punish sin with sin, and to cast a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
into further sins, by way of just punishment. Therefore we desire God
not to give us over to our selves, by withdrawing his Spirit from us, as
when men doe delight in lies, he giveth them over to beleeve lies, 2 <hi>Thes.
2.</hi> 11. and for Idolatry, he justly punisheth them with corporall filthinesse
in the same degree, <hi>Hos. 4. 14. Rom.</hi> 1. 24. Now being naturally prone to
sin, when by the just judgement of God we are left to our selves, we rush
into all evill, even as a horse into the battell, to whom we put the spurres,
or as an Eagle flyeth to her prey.</p>
                  <p>May not earthly Magistrates thus punish sin?</p>
                  <p>No verily, it were a cursed thing in Magistrates so to doe: But God is
above all Magistrates, who even for our naturall corruption may justly
give us over to all naughty affections.</p>
                  <p>Why doe the Papists say, and suffer us not to be led into temptation?</p>
                  <p>In a vaine and foolish feare of making God to be guilty of sin, if he
should be said to leade us into temptation; and therefore they lay the
Lords words (as it were) in water, and change his tongue, and set him to
the Grammar Schoole to teach him to speake, which teacheth all men
to speake, whose folly is so much the greater, as it is the usuall phrase of
Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 21. &amp; 9. 16. 1 <hi>Kings 22. 20, 21, 22. Rom. 1. 24. 2 Thes.
2.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>What inconvenience followeth upon this addition?</p>
                  <p>Very great: For by this bare permission of evill, they rob God of his
glory (working in the most things that are done of men) yea even of the
best things, the doing whereof is attributed to his permission, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>May we not offer our selves unto temptation as Christ did?</p>
                  <p>In no wise: for he was carried extraordinarily by the power of his
Godhead into the desart, to be tempted for our sakes, that in his victory
we might overcome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:55421:194"/>
What learne you of this?</p>
                  <p>1. That no godly man should chuse his dwelling among those of a
sinfull profession: As a chaste man among stewes, or a temperate man
among drunkards, belly-gods, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. If we fall into such companies or occasions at unawares, as did <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,
Gen.</hi> 39. 12. and <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 25. 13. 22. that we pray God for his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
to carry our selves godly, and in no wise to be infected by them.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by [deliver us from evill?]</p>
                  <p>This expoundeth the former,<note place="margin">Deliver us from evill: What is meant by it.</note> by a flat contrary; as thus, [leade us not
into temptation] but pull us out of it, even when we fall into it by our own
infirmity) and that with force: For by delivering, here is meant, a forcible
rescuing of our nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. neither able nor willing to help it selfe
out of these dangers.</p>
                  <p>What doth this teach us?</p>
                  <p>That men are deeply plunged into sin, as a beast into the mire, which
must be forcibly pulled out, although a beast will help it selfe more then
we can doe our selves, of our selves; not that there is not a freedome and
willingnesse in that which is well done, but as that force commeth from
that which is without, so the grace commeth not from us, but from God;
therefore the Church saith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. draw me, we will run; and Christ,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 44. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
draw him: Whence we learne, that to have this desire of being drawne
out, is a singular favour of God.</p>
                  <p>What is Gods hand to pull us out of this evill?</p>
                  <p>The Ministry of his Word, whereby he frameth our wils through the
power of his Spirit to yeeld to his worke.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That we kicke not at the Ministers for reproving our sins, seeing that
they strive to plucke us out of the mire, but that we rejoyce and yeeld to
their exhortation.</p>
                  <p>What is meant here by evill?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">What is meant by evill.</note> that evill one, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 18, 19. Satan, (who pretendeth to have
power over us;) and in him, all his instruments and provocations to sin.
Then secondly, the effect of temptation, which without the speciall grace
of God is extreamely evill; to wit, sin and damnation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>Is not the Devill the author of all evill?</p>
                  <p>Yes: he is the first author, but properly those evils are called his, which
in his owne person he suggesteth.</p>
                  <p>From how many kinds of evils then desire we deliverance?</p>
                  <p>From two:</p>
                  <p>1. The inward concupiscences of our hearts, which are our greatest
enemies, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>2. The outward, as the Devill and the world, which doe worke upon
us by the former; and therefore if we can subdue the outward, these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
cannot annoy us.</p>
                  <p>From what evils should we desire principally to be delivered?</p>
                  <p>Those whereunto we are most bent, and naturally inclined, or wherein
our Country especially, or our neighbours amongst whom we converse,
doe most delight. That we make the hedge highest, where Satan striveth
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55421:195"/>
most to leap over, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 28. who although he knoweth not our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
yet seeing by his subtilty and sharpnesse of discovering us even
by a beck or countenance is very great, we must desire wisdome of God,
to discerne his temptations, and power also to resist them.</p>
                  <p>Shew now briefly, as you have done in the rest, what things wee pray for
in this last Petition?</p>
                  <p>1. That seeing we cannot be tempted without the will of God,<note place="margin">What things we paray for in the sixt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</note>

would give us neither poverty nor riches, <hi>Prov</hi> 30. 8. nor any such thing
as may endanger our spirituall estate, but remove those causes away which
lead us into temptation.</p>
                  <p>2. That hee would tye up Satan, and restraine his malice and power,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. or else make us wise to know and avoid his strategems,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. and preserve us from the evill that is in the world, <hi>Ioh.
17.</hi> 15. and abate the power of the corruption that is within us, <hi>Rom.
7.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>3. That in our trialls (if he see good to prove us) hee would keep us
from charging him with any injustice, or hard measure, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 22. and that
he would give us grace to behold his holy hand therein; and to make
that holy use of them for which he hath sent them, <hi>Esa.</hi> 27. 9.</p>
                  <p>4. That hee would not take his holy Spirit from us in our trialls:
But alwayes give us sustentation in our temptations, and to keep us from
falling, and not suffer us to be overcome by the temptations, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13.
Jude verse</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>5. That leaving us at any time to our owne weaknesse for our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hee would graciously raise us up againe with encrease of spirituall
strength and courage, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 12.</p>
                  <p>6. That he would keep us from all carnall security, from despaire and
presumption of his mercies.</p>
                  <p>7. That he would put an end to all trialls, and to these dayes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
in his owne good time, treading Satan with his forces for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20.</p>
                  <p>8. That he would encrease and perfect the worke of his grace in us,
enabling us to every good worke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. and instead of temptation
to the contrary, affording us all helpes unto well-doing, and all things
that may further us in holinesse, as good company, godly example, holy
counsells, and encouragements, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Petitions: There remaineth the conclusion, containing
both a Thanks-giving, which is the second part of Prayer, and a
confirmation of the former requests: what are the words of this close

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55421:195"/>
warrant omitted by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What observe you therein?</p>
                  <p>Their Sacriledge, who steale away this Thanks-giving from prayer, as
if it were no part of it; so that it is no marvaile that in Popery all the
whole body of their Doctrine is of the salvation of men, Gods glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
buried in a deep silence.</p>
                  <p>Whence is this forme of Thanks-giving drawne?</p>
                  <p>Out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> 7. 14. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. where <hi>David</hi>
useth the like phrase of praising of God; but that which <hi>David</hi> enlargeth
there, our Saviour shortneth here; and yet comprehendeth the marrow
of all.</p>
                  <p>What is the summe thereof?</p>
                  <p>That we ground our assurance of obtaining our Prayers in God from
whom all things we aske doe come, and to whom therefore all glory must
returne.</p>
                  <p>What observe you in this?</p>
                  <p>That Christ maketh this Thanks-giving consisting in the praise of God
to be a reason of all the Petitions going before: and therefore a further
assurance of obtaining our suits: for so good men in praying for new bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
doe alwayes joyne thanks-giving for the former.</p>

which answereth to the second Petition: and therfore this reason of Gods
right and authority over all, ought to move us to pray unto him, and
to him alone, as to one that hath onely right to any thing wee have
need of.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by <hi>[power?]</hi>

                     </note> whereby he is able to doe all things, <hi>Luke

bring to passe whatsoever he will; both which concurre in God, though
not alwaies in earthly Princes: which seemeth to answer unto the third
Petition, and ought to give us encouragement to pray unto him, who is
able to effect any thing we pray for according to his will, and to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
us to any thing which in duty we ought to doe, although there be
no strength in us.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by <hi>[glory?]</hi>

                     </note> which rising from the two former of kingdome and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
doth rightly belong unto God, as following upon the concurrence
of the other two. For if whatsoever we desire be granted unto us in that
he reigneth powerfully; it is reason, that from the establishing of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and power, all glory and praise should returne unto him againe.
Therefore hereby we doe thankfully referre and returne all good things
to the honour and service of God that giveth them, <hi>Psalme</hi> 65. 1, 2. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we have no comfort of our prayers: And it answereth to the first
Petition, and ought to move us to pray unto him, and to assure us that our
prayers are granted; seeing by our prayers duely made and granted, he
is glorified: And it is one of the most powerfull reasons, that the servants
of God have grounded their confidence on, of being heard, that the name
of God therein should be glorified.</p>

                     </note> Power, and Glory, are appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto God, to whom they do belong, and all creatures excluded from

and Glory, are communicated unto some creatures, (namely Kings,

whose kingdomes, powers, and glory fade.</p>
                  <p>How is that a close of confirmation to our requests?</p>
                  <p>Because we doe not onely in generall ascribe Kingdome, Power, and

Finally, as the God of glory, is interessed in the welfare of his servants,
for the maintaining of the honour of his Name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 27. and truth of
his promise, <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. 49. Therefore there are here contained three
reasons to move God to grant our Petitions. Because,</p>
                  <p>First, he is our King, and so tyed to help us who are his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he hath power, and thereforefore is able to helpe us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the granting of our Petitions will be to his glory and praise;
whereupon we firmely beleeve, that God the mighty and everlasting
King, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17.) can, and for his owne glory will grant the
things we have thus demanded, <hi>Eph. 3. 20. Jer. 14. 7. Ezek.</hi> 36. 22.</p>
                  <p>What is understood by this last word, <hi>[Amen.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not onely, <hi>So be it,</hi> as commonly men say, but also, so it is, or shall
be,<note place="margin">What is meant by <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </note> as we have prayed, <hi>Rev,</hi> 22. 20, 21. For it is a note of confidence, and
declaration of Faith, (without which our prayers are rejected) whereby
we assure our selves, that God will grant those things which wee have
prayed to him for.</p>
                  <p>Why are we taught to conclude with this word?</p>
                  <p>There being two things required in prayer: a fervent desire, <hi>James 5.
17.</hi> and faith, <hi>James</hi> 1. 6. which is a perswasion that these things which
we truely desire, God will grant them for Christs sake. This is a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both of our earnest affection of having all those things performed,
which in this Prayer are comprehended; and the assurance of our faith to
receive our desires; at least so farre forth as God seeth good for us: And
so hereby we doe not onely testifie our earnest desire, that so it may bee,
but also expresse our full assurance that so it shall be as we have prayed,
according to the will of God: and being already let in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 8. by
the key of faithfull prayer, into the rich treasure of his mercies, wee also
set our seale, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 11. in the word of faith, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Is it lawfull to use no other forme of words, then that which is set downe
in the Lords Prayer?</p>
                  <p>We may use another forme of words,<note place="margin">Whether law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to use any other forme of Prayer.</note> but we must pray for the same
things, and with like affection as is prescribed in that Prayer.</p>
                  <p>This forme being so absolute, what need we use any other words in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
                  <p>Because as to refuse this forme, savoureth of a proud contempt of
Christs ordinance: so to confine our selves to these words alone, argueth
extreame idlenesse in this duty, wherein variety of words is required for
the powring out of our soules before the Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 3. and oftentimes
according to the occasions, some one petition is more then the rest to be
insisted on, and importuned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 44. Wherefore our blessed Saviour
hath commended this forme unto us, as an excellent coppy or lesson to be
both repeated and imitated, or at least aymed at by us his Schollers, for
which cause, both he himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 10. and his Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 24.
are recorded to have prayed in other words, which yet may be referred to
this. Finally, the liberty which the Lord affourdeth us is not to be abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
or despised, who admitteth all languages, words and formes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this patterne; whether read, rehearsed by heart, or presently concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
2 <hi>Chron. 29. 30. Psalme 90</hi> &amp; 92. in the titles, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 35, 36. so be
it we pray both with spirit, and affection, and understanding also, 1 <hi>Cor.

                  <p>May there not then besides this Prayer of the Lord, be now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
a set forme of Prayer in the Church?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, so that it be left at the liberty of the Church (not of private
men without consent of the Church) to alter it.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore is it necessary that there be a set forme of Prayer?</p>
                  <p>To help the weaker and ruder sort of people especially, and yet so as the
set forme make not men sluggish in stirring up the gift of prayer in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
according to divers occurrents, it being incident to the children of
God, to have some gift of prayer in some measure, <hi>Zach. 12. 10</hi>

                  <p>What kinds are thereof Prayer?</p>
                  <p>Prayer is either publicke or private, and both of them either ordinary

                  <p>What is publick Prayer?</p>

                  <p>It is that Prayer which is made out of the Congregation,<note place="margin">What private Prayer is.</note> and it is either
lesse private, as when the whole Family, or private friends meet in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,

No, it is required also that we pray solitarily by our selves, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 6.
For as every man hath committed speciall sins, which others in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that others have not: so in these regards it is meet that he should have
a speciall resort unto God in Confession, Petition, and Thanksgiving.</p>
                  <p>What is ordinary Prayer?</p>
                  <p>It is that prayer which is made daily upon ordinary occasions,<note place="margin">What ordinary prayer is.</note>

                  <p>What behaviour and gesture must we use in Prayer?</p>
                  <p>We must use such holy behaviour,<note place="margin">1. Gesture.</note> and comely gestures of body, as are
beseeming the Majesty of God, with whom we have to deale, and so holy
an exercise which we have in hand; namely, such as may best expresse and
encrease the reverence, humility, fervency and affiance, that ought to be in
our hearts; as the bowing of our knees, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 14. lifting up of our hands
and eyes to heaven, <hi>Lam. 3. 41. Iohn</hi> 17. 1, &amp;c. which yet are not alwayes,
or absolutely necessary, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. so our hearts be lifted up, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 1.
and 143. 8. and the knees of our conscience bowed before the Lord, <hi>Phil. 2.
10.</hi> and nothing done unbeseeming the company with whom we pray, and
the kind of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Is not the behaviour all one in every kind of prayer?</p>
                  <p>No: In private prayer it sufficeth that we use such words, gestures, &amp;c.
as may expresse our reverence and faith towards God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 2. In
publike prayer our behaviour must be such as may also witnesse our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
one with another, and desire of mutuall edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 4.
and verse 17. 40. When we pray by our selves we have more liberty of
words and gestures then in company, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 42. In extraordinary
prayers the publike must be done with open shew of the affection, either
sorrow or joy, <hi>Esa.</hi> 1. and 58. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 13. which in the private must be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

for graces received, <hi>Psal. 5. 3. Luke</hi> 2. 37. Neverthelesse ordinarily the

                  <p>Not any naturall abstinence, arising from sicknesse; nor medicinall,

                  <p>Fasting is not properly a good work, but an help, an assistance thereto,
namely, to prayer.</p>
                  <p>Whether is the outward exercise thereof a certaine marke of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>The Pharisees which fasted <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 33. came not to our Saviour Christ

it were in weaknesse) but to discredit him, namely, to make the

for a time, <hi>Joel 2. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 5. to the end thereby to humble our selves,
and to make us more apt to prayer. Or more fully: Fasting is a religious
abstinence commanded of God, whereby we forbeare not onely the use
of meat and drinke, but also of all other earthly comforts and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this life, so far as necessity and comelinesse will require, to the end
that we being humbled and afflicted in our soules by the due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our sins and punishment, may (grounded upon the promise of
God) more earnestly and fervently call upon God, either for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of some singular benefit, or speciall favour we have need of, or for
the avoiding of some speciall punishment, or notable judgement han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
over our heads, or already pressed upon us, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32.

&amp; 14. 23. 2 <hi>Chron. 20. Joel</hi> 1. &amp; 2. 12. 16.</p>
                  <p>Is there any necessity of this exercise of Fasting?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily; in that it is necessary to humble our selves under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and fearefull hand of God,; and to afflict our soules with the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and conscience of our sins, and the punishment due unto them;
unto which this outward exercise of Fasting is a good aid: for howsoever
the kingdome of God consisteth not properly in the matter of meat and
drink, whether used or forborne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. yet fasting, as an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
helpe unto the chiefe exercises of Piety, hath the warrant and
weight of a duty as well from precepts, as examples, both out of the old
Testament, (<hi>Lev. 23. 27. &amp;c. Joel 2. 22. Esa.</hi> 22. 12.) and the new, (<hi>Mat.
9. 14, 15. Acts</hi> 13. 3.) And our Saviour Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 35. doth expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that the time shall come when his Disciples shall fast: where both
by the circumstances of the persons and of the time, the necessity of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
is enforced.</p>
                  <p>How so?</p>
                  <p>By the persons, for that the Apostles themselves had need of this
helpe of Fasting for their further humiliation; and by the time, for that
even after the Ascension of our Saviour Christ, when the graces of
God were most abundant on them, they should have neede of this
exercise.</p>
                  <p>What is gathered hereof?</p>
                  <p>That it is a shamefull thing for men to say that Fasting is Iewish, or
Ceremoniall.</p>
                  <p>What do you gather, in that our Saviour would not have his Disciples to
fast till after his Ascension?</p>
                  <p>His singular kindnesse, in that hee would not suffer any great trouble,
or cause of Fast to come unto them, before they had strength to beare
them, or were prepared for them.</p>
                  <p>When is the time of Fasting?</p>
                  <p>As oft as there are urgent and extraordinary causes of Prayer,<note place="margin">Of the time of Fasting.</note> either
for the avoiding of some great evill, or notable calamity, 1 <hi>Sam. 7. 6. Est.
4.</hi> 16. or for the obtaining of some great mercy, or speciall benefit at the
hand of God, <hi>Neh. 1. 4. Acts</hi> 10. 30. For in that our Saviour Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
<hi>Luke</hi> 5. 34. that it must not be when he who is as it were the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
is with his Disciples, to furnish them with all manner of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
they had need of: we are taught, that the time is, when any great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
is hanging over us, or falne upon us, whereby the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ is taken from us; or when there is any weighty matter
to be taken in hand.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hereof?</p>
                  <p>That the fast of Popery is foolish, which is holden at set times, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the time be prosperous, or not prosperous; whether the affaires bee
common or ordinary, or whether they be speciall or extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>When then is this religious exercise of Fasting to be performed of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</p>
                  <p>When God calleth upon us for this duty by the occasions arising from
his providence, and our owne necessities, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
                  <p>What are those occasions, whereby the Lord calleth us to fasting?</p>

They are generally two, as hath been noted, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Evills, which being felt or feared, we desire to remove, or prevent
as sins, 1 <hi>Sam. 7. 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 2. and the judgement of God for sin, <hi>Est. 4.
16. Jonah 3. 7. Mat.</hi> 17. 21.</p>
                  <p>2. Good things, spirituall, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 30. or outward, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 4. which
we desire to enjoy, and therefore doe thus seek them, and prepare our
selves for the receiving of them.</p>
                  <p>When is this Fast to begin and end?</p>
                  <p>As in all holy rests, after preparation, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 54. it is to begin in the
morning of the day of the Fast, and to continue to the morning of the day
following, <hi>Marke 16. 2. Luke</hi> 24. 1.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth by this, that the Law of Fasting, will not suffer a man to sup
the night of that day when the Fast is holden?</p>
                  <p>The Fast is so long continued as hath been said; but so, as there bee
that refreshing whereby health may be preserved: for such as bee sick
or weake, are to take somewhat for their sustenance, thereby to bee
better able to serve God in the Fast, provided that they doe not abuse this
to licence of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>Is it of necessity that the Fast should alway begin in the morning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
untill morning?</p>
                  <p>No; It may be from morning to evening, <hi>Judges 20. 26. 2 Sam. 3.
35.</hi> or from evening till evening againe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 32. and according to
the greatnesse of the affliction, the Fast is to bee prolonged even to
the space of three dayes, as appeareth by the examples of the Iewes, <hi>Est.
4.</hi> 16. &amp; <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. 9.</p>
                  <p>What are the kinds of Fasting?</p>
                  <p>It is either publick,<note place="margin">Of the kindes of Fasting.</note> or private.</p>
                  <p>What is the publick Fast?</p>

                     <hi>viz.</hi> when the

not, is culpable before God and man, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 29. And it is either more
publick, when all Churches fast generally; or else lesse publick, when
some particular Churches are humbled in fasting.</p>
                  <p>What is the private Fast?</p>
                  <p>When upon the view either of publick causes,<note place="margin">Of private Fast.</note> considered of by such as
are in Authority, <hi>Ezek. 9. 4. Ezek.</hi> 13. 17. or of the like, but more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
occasions, (as domesticall or personall, &amp;c.) a Christian is moved
either with his family, or speciall friends, <hi>Zach. 12. 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. or by
himselfe solatary, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 17. to humble himselfe before the Lord: for
it is more or lesse private: lesse private, as when a particular house; more
private, when a particular person is humbled in fasting.</p>
                  <p>Is there any difference in the manner of holding of a publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Fast?</p>
                  <p>Yes: in a publike Fast the sorrow and griefe ought to be declared
openly to the view of all, which ought to be covered as much as may be
in the private Fast, wherein the more secrecy is used, the greater proofe is
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55421:199"/>
there of sincerity, and hope of blessing: wherefore our Saviour Christ
reproveth the private Fast of Hypocrites, that would outwardly appeare
to men to fast, and commandeth the contrary, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Whom doth God call to this exercise of Fasting?</p>
                  <p>All Christians enabled by understanding and grace to judg,<note place="margin">Who are to fast</note> and aright
to performe this weighty duty, <hi>Zach. 12. 12, &amp;c.</hi> unlesse any be exempted
by present debility, <hi>Matth. 12. 7. 1 Sam. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 29, 30. but differently, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the divers occasions of fasting, and the kindes thereon depending,
(whereof before hath been spoken.)</p>
                  <p>May those that are under the government of their Parents, or Masters,
fast without leave of them?</p>
                  <p>No, but in the publike all may fast.</p>
                  <p>Are all persons meet for this exercise of fasting?</p>
                  <p>By the unfitnesse of his owne Disciples for it our Saviour Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
that they that are meet for this exercise must not be Novices in the
profession of the truth; no more then hee that is accustomed with the
drinking of old wine can suddenly fall in liking of new wine, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 33.</p>
                  <p>Is it so hard a matter to abstaine from a Meales meat, and such bodily
comforts for a small time, which the youag sucking babes, and the
beasts of Nineveh did, and divers beasts are better able to performe
then any man?</p>
                  <p>No verily, but hereby appeareth that there is an inward strength of
the mind required, not onely in knowing of our behaviour in this service
of God, but also of power and ability to goe under the weight of the
things we humble our selves for, which strength if it be wanting, the fast
will be to those that are exercised in it, as a peece of new cloath sewed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an old garment, which because it is not able to beare the stresse and
strength of, hath a greater rent made into it then if there were no peece
at all.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hereof?</p>
                  <p>That it is no marvell that where there is any abstinence and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
exercise in Popery, yet that the same makes them nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but rather worse, having not so much as the knowledge of this
service of God, much lesse any spirituall strength and ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it with.</p>
                  <p>What then are the parts of a true Christian Fast?</p>
                  <p>They are partly outward,<note place="margin">Of the parts of a Christian fast.</note> partly inward. 1. Bodily exercises, serving
to the inward substances, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. An inward substance sanctifying the bodily exercise, and making it
profitable to the users.</p>
                  <p>What is the bodily exercise in fasting?</p>
                  <p>It is the forbearing of things otherwise lawfull and convenient, in
whole or in part, for the time of humiliation, so as nature be chastised, but
not disabled for service; and the delights of the sense laid aside, but yet
without annoyance and uncomelinesse.</p>
                  <p>What are those outward things that are to be forborne during the time
of fasting?</p>
                  <p>First, food, <hi>Esther 4. 16. Ionah</hi> 3. 7. from whence the whole action hath
the name of <hi>Fasting;</hi> and the word doth signifie an utter abstinence from
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:55421:199"/>
all meats and drinkes, and not a sober use of them, which ought
to be all the time of our lives: Wherefore this outward exercise is
thus described, <hi>Luke 5. 33. The Disciples of John and the Pharisees fast,
but thine eat and drinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is here to be considered?</p>
                  <p>A charge upon Popery: For the greater sort of people amongst
them, in the day of their Fast fill their bellies with bread and
drinke; and the richer sort, with all kinde of delicates, (flesh, and that
which commeth of flesh onely excepted:) So that the fasting of the one
and the other is but a fulnesse, and the latter may be more truely said to
feast then a fast.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth you make it unlawfull for those that fast to eat any thing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their fasting.</p>
                  <p>Not so: if for help of weaknesse the taking of meat be moderately and
sparingly used, as before hath been observed.</p>
                  <p>What other things are outward?</p>
                  <p>The ceasing from labour in our vocations on the day of the Fast,
<hi>Num.</hi> 29. 7. to the end wee may the better attend to the holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
used in fasting; in which respect such times are called Sabbaths,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 32. The laying aside of costly apparell, or whatsoever
ornaments of the body, and wearing of homely and courser gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Exodus 33. 4, 5. Jonah</hi> 3. 5, 6. The forbearing of Sleep, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
Mirth, Perfumes, &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 18. &amp; 10. 2, 3. And this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
is required of all that celebrate the Fast: But of married
persons there is further required a forbearance of the use of the marriage
bed, and of the company each of other, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 5. Joel</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>What is the meaning of the abstinence from these outward things?</p>
                  <p>By abstinence from meat and drinke, by wearing of courser ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
by ceasing from labour in our Callings, and by separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in married persons for the time, wee thereby professe our selves
unworthy of all the benefits of this present life, and that we are
worthy to bee as farre underneath the earth as wee are above it:
yea, that we are worthy to be cast into the bottome of hell, which the
holy Fathers in times past did signifie by putting ashes upon their heads,
the truth whereof remaineth still, although the ceremony be not used.</p>
                  <p>What is the spirituall substance of duty, whereto the bodily exercise
serveth?</p>
                  <p>It is an extraordinary endevour of humbling our souls before the Lord,
and of seeking his face and favour, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21. wherein that inward power
and strength whereof we speak is seen.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth it consist?</p>
                  <p>1. In the abasing of our selves, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 13. by examination, confession,
and hearty bewailing of our own and the common sins, <hi>Ezra 9. 3, 4. Neh.
9. 1, 2, &amp;c. Dan. 9. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In drawing near unto the Lord by faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 18, 21. and earnest
invocation of his name, <hi>Iona. 3. 8. Esa.</hi> 58. 4. The former is grounded upon
the meditation of the Law, and threats of God; the later upon the Gospel
and promises of God touching the removing of our sins, and Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon us for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:55421:200"/>
How agreeth this with the Popish Fast?</p>
                  <p>It faileth in both parts: for in stead of humbling themselves, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
their soules, they pride themselves, and lift up their mindes, in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
they deserve something at Gods hands for their fasting; which is
great abomination. Neither have they upon the dayes of their Fast any
extraordinary exercise of prayer, more then upon other dayes; of all
which it may appeare how small cause they have to boast of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
which in all the warp thereof hath not a thread which is not full of
leprosie.</p>
                  <p>What is required in our humiliation?</p>
                  <p>Anguish and grief of our hearts, conceived for our sins, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God upon us, for which we ought to be humbled in fasting: For
the effecting whereof we are to set before our eyes,</p>
                  <p>1. The glasse of Gods holy Law, with the bitter curses threatned to
the breakers thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. The examples of vengeance on the wicked.</p>
                  <p>3. The judgments now felt or feared of us.</p>
                  <p>4. The spirituall contemplation of our blessed Saviour, bleeding on
the Crosse with the wounds which our sinnes have forced upon him,
<hi>Zach. 12. 10, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is required in our drawing neare unto the Lord by Faith?</p>
                  <p>Not onely fervently and importunately to knock at the gate of his
mercy for the pardon of our sins, removall of judgements, and grant of
the graces and blessings we need, <hi>Psal. 51. 1, 2, &amp;c. vers.</hi> 14. &amp; 112. 4.
but also to make a sure Covenant with his Majesty, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 38. of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
and bettering our repentance thence forward in a more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and effectuall hatred of sinne, and love of righteousnesse, <hi>Esa. 55. 7.
Jonah</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>What fruit or successe may we look for, having thus sought the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Who knoweth whether by this meanes we may stand in the gap, and
cause the Lord to repent of the evill intended, and to spare his people?
<hi>Joel 2. 14, 18, &amp;c. Ionah</hi> 3. 9, 10. At the least for our particular we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the mark and mercy promised to such as mourne for the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
generally committed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4, 6. together with plentifull evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our salvation, and assurance of the love of God towards us,
<hi>Matth. 6. 18. Pro. 28. 13. 1 Iohn</hi> 1. 9. strength against temptations, patience
and comfort in afflictions, with all other graces plentifully vouchsafed
(especially upon such renewing of acquaintance) by him who is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of all that come unto him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. so that we need not doubt,
but that as we have sowne in teares so we shall reap in joy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 5. and
as we have sought the Lord with fasting and mourning, so he yet againe
will be sought (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37.) and found of us with holy feasting and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
rejoicing.</p>
                  <p>What is an holy feasting?</p>
                  <p>A comfortable enjoying of Gods blessings,<note place="margin">Of a holy feast.</note> to stirre us up to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and spirituall rejoicing: Or, (to describe it more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
It is a solemne Thankes-giving unto God for some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
benefit (or deliverance from some notable evill, either upon
us, or hanging over us) which hee hath bestowed upon us, especially
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55421:200"/>
after that in fasting we have begged the same at his hand, <hi>Zach. 8. 19.
Ezek. 9. ad</hi> 32. for this is a duty especially required for the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such mercies as we have by the former course obtained, <hi>Psal 30.
11,</hi> 12. &amp; 50. 15. <hi>Esther</hi> 9. 22. and so answering thereto, that from the one
the other with due reverence may be conceived.</p>
                  <p>What ought especially to be the time of this duty?</p>
                  <p>The time that is nearest unto the mercy and benefit which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<note place="margin">Of the time of feasting.</note> as we see in the story, <hi>Esther</hi> 9. where the Iewes that were in the
countrey, and in the provinces, did celebrate their feast on the 14. day of
the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> because they had overthrowne their enemies the 13.
day before: and the Iewes in <hi>Sushan,</hi> because they made not an end of the
slaughter of their enemies before the 14. day was past, they celebrated it
the 15. day. Look 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 26. and that example of <hi>Jacob,</hi> checked for
deferring the paiment of his vow at <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore ought we to take the time that is next the deliverance?</p>
                  <p>Because we being most strongly and thoroughly affected with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
we receive the first time it is bestowed upon us, especially where
there is not onely a notable benefit befallen unto us, but thereby also we
are freed from some notable evill that was upon us, or near unto us, we are
then most fit to hold a feast unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Why is the ordinance of a yearely Feast by <hi>Mordocheus</hi> rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
upon the day after the slaughter of their enemies, then the
day of the slaughter?</p>
                  <p>To set forth that rejoicing ought not to be so much for the destruction
of our enemies, as that thereby we obtaine peace to serve God in.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth this feast consist?</p>
                  <p>The scope and drift of it is,<note place="margin">In what an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feast consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth.</note> to rejoice before the Lord, and to shew
our selves thankfull for the benefit received, not onely in that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
but that we are delivered by prayer that we have made unto God,
whereby our joy encreaseth, and whereby it differeth from the joy of the
wicked, which rejoice that they are delivered as well as we.</p>
                  <p>How may that be best performed?</p>
                  <p>Partly by outward and bodily exercises, and partly by spirituall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>What are the outward exercises?</p>
                  <p>A more liberall use of the creatures, both in meat and apparell, then is
ordinary.</p>
                  <p>May we eat and drink on that day more then on others?</p>
                  <p>No: the exceeding is not in the quantity of meat and drink, but in a
more dainty and bountifull diet then ordinary, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. which yet is to
be referred to the exercise of godlinesse, and therefore ought to be used
in that moderation and sobriety, as men may be made more able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
even as the abstinence in fasting is used to further humiliation of the
mind, and affecting of the soule.</p>
                  <p>What is the exercise of godlinesse?</p>
                  <p>It is either in piety and duty unto God, or in kindnesse unto men.</p>
                  <p>What is the duty unto God?</p>
                  <p>To lift up our voice in thanksgiving unto him, as for all other his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
(whereof this benefit should cause the remembrance, as one sinne
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55421:201"/>
causeth the remembrance of others, <hi>Psalme</hi> 51.) so for that present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
and for that purpose to call to remembrance, and to compare the
former evills, which either we were in, or were neere unto, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
mercy, and every part of the one with the members of the other.</p>
                  <p>What other duty of Piety is to be performed unto God?</p>
                  <p>By a diligent meditation of the present benefit to confirme our faith
and confidence in God, that he that hath so mightily and graciously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us at this time, will also in the same, or the like dangers, deliver us
hereafter, so farre as the same shall be good for us.</p>
                  <p>What is the kindnesse we should shew towards men?</p>
                  <p>An exercise of liberality, according to our power, out of the feeling of
the bountifull hand of God towards us.</p>
                  <p>To whom must that be shewed?</p>
                  <p>To our friends in presents; and, as it were, in New-years gifts, <hi>Rev. 11.
10.</hi> and portions to be sent to the poore and needy, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p>What remaineth further of these holy Feasts?</p>
                  <p>The sorts and kindes of them which are as before we have heard of
Fasts; to which I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of Prayer, and the extraordinarie circumstances thereof, Fasting,
and Feasting: what is a Vow?</p>
                  <p>A solemne promise made unto God by fit persons of some lawfull
thing,<note place="margin">Of Vowes.</note> that is in their choise and power to performe it.</p>
                  <p>It is thought that Vowes are Ceremoniall, and not to pertaine to the times
the Gospell?</p>
                  <p>There are indeed good, yea, excellent persons that think so, which
carry so much the more a dislike of Vowes, because they have beene
abused in Popery. Howbeit, it appeareth by the fifty Psalme, verse
14, 15. that it is a constant and perpetuall service of God; as shall
appeare.</p>
                  <p>What is the proper end and use of a Vow?</p>
                  <p>It is twofold:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Gen. 28 20.</note> to strengthen and confirme our faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Iudg. 11. 30. 31.</note> to testifie our thankfulnesse unto God;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 11.</note> but no way to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
any thing at Gods hand: So that whereas the exercise of a Fast is
in adversity; and of a Feast in prosperity; the Vow may be in both.</p>
                  <p>Who are the fit persons that may vow.</p>
                  <p>Such as have knowledge,<note place="margin">Who are to vow.</note> judgement, and ability to discerne of a Vow,
and of the duties belonging to the performance of the same, <hi>Numb.
30.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Are all such bound to vow?</p>
                  <p>Not simply all; for it is no sinne not to vow, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 22. but those
onely, which either being in distresse feele a want of feeling of Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
thereby to strengthen their faith for neecessary ayde: or they
who being delivered from some necessary evill, or have received some
singular good, where no vow hath gone before, should witnesse their
thankfulnesse, <hi>Deut. 13. 21, 22. Numb.</hi> 30. 2. &amp; 6. 2. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What have we herein further to consider?</p>
                  <p>That the Vow must be of lawfull things; else it is better not to pay
the Vow, then to pay; as <hi>Herod</hi> and the forty mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:55421:201"/>
23. 14. And as the Munks, Fryers and Nunnes vow wilfull poverty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
abstinence from Marriage, and Canonicall obedience, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pilgrimage.</p>
                  <p>May we vow any thing which is lawfull to be done?</p>
                  <p>We may not vow any vile or base thing: As if a wealthy man should
vow to give to the poore some small value far under his ability; for what
either token of thankfulnesse can that be, or what comfort in his troubles
can he take of the performance thereof?</p>
                  <p>What have we secondly to consider?</p>
                  <p>That the vow must be of such things as are in our choice to performe.<note place="margin">What is to be vowed.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many wayes faile men against this?</p>
                  <p>Two wayes:</p>
                  <p>1. In vowing that which we are not able to performe.</p>
                  <p>2. In vowing that which otherwise by the Law of God we are bound
to performe.</p>
                  <p>Who be they that vow that which they cannot performe?</p>
                  <p>They are either they whose strength doth faile through the common
frailty of all men (as those that vow perpetual continency) whose lets come
from themselves; or they which cannot performe it, by reason of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto others; as wives unto their husbands, children to their parents,
servants to their Masters, &amp;c. in whose power they are to performe their
vowes, or not to performe them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Why may not a man vow such things as he is otherwise bound to doe?</p>
                  <p>For that they are due unto God without the service of a vow; and
therefore it were a dalliance with God, to make shew of some speciall
and extraordinary service, where the common and ordinary is only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as if a man would present as a gift unto his Lord the rent of his
owne house due for the occupation thereof.</p>
                  <p>What may we then lawfully vow?</p>
                  <p>An increase of Gods service; as to pray more often every day then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
is used; or to be more liberall to the poore, with some straine of our
ability, building of Colledges, Almes-houses, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What is the duty of those that have vowed?</p>
                  <p>1. To have a diligent care to performe their vowes,<note place="margin">The duty of those that have vowed.</note> 
                     <hi>Eccles. 5. 3, 4. Deut.
23.</hi> 21, 22, 23. For if it be a reproachfull thing to deale with God as with
a man, it is more reproachfull to deale worse with God, then we dare
deale with any man.</p>
                  <p>2. Not to delay the performance of it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 3. For God corrected
sharply in <hi>Jacob</hi> the deferring of the payment of his vowes, <hi>Gen. 35. 1.
1.</hi> By his daughters deflowring. 2. By the rage and murther committed
by his sonnes.</p>
                  <p>Is the necessity of performing vowes so great, that they may no wayes be
omitted?</p>
                  <p>Not so: for to the performance of a greater duty, a man may omit his
vow for a time, and after a time returne, and be not a Vow-breaker: As the
Rechabites for safety of their lives came and dwelt at Ierusalem, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
a former vow, that they would not dwell in an house, <hi>Jer. 35.
9,</hi> 10, 11. and yet God witnesseth, that the vow was not broken thereby:
so to help our neighbours in some present necessity, we may cease from
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55421:202"/>
any vowed duty at that time, and not sin; wherein the Papists greatly faile,
who having vowed unlawfully, yet thinke they may not intermit their
vowes.</p>
                  <p>If a man in vowing doth not consider sufficiently the greatnesse of the
matter, may he not break that vow that he hath not so advisedly made?</p>
                  <p>No, the vowing being otherwise lawfull, that rashnesse is to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the vow must be kept.</p>
                  <p>What have we to learne of all this?</p>
                  <p>That we be advised in that we doe, and not to enquire after we have
vowed, to find some starting hole where to goe out; but either not to vow
at all, or if we vow, to have a good remembrance of it, and a diligent care
in the due time to performe it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 25.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken of those good things which we doe give unto God: Let us
proceed to that which we doe give unto our needy Neighbour:
What is Almes?</p>
                  <p>It is a duty of Christian love, whereby such as have this worlds good,
doe freely impart to such as are in want,<note place="margin">Of Almes.</note> 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 17. 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18. Mat.
5.</hi> 42.</p>
                  <p>How can it be both a duty, and withall free?</p>
                  <p>1. That it is a duty, appeareth by many formall precepts touching this
matter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 7, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. in that it is called our justice or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
<hi>Psal. 112. 9. Matth.</hi> 6. 1. in that every man is a Steward of Gods
blessings for the benefit of others, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. Finally, in that according to
the performance or neglect even of this duty men shall be judged at the
last day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 35. 42.</p>
                  <p>2. It is free, not as being left by God unto our choice, whether we will
doe it or no, but as proceeding from an heart as<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note> freely, and as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performing this obedience to God, and reliefe of our brother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compulsion of humane Law.</p>

                  <p>Gods works not unprofitably given, although not sufficient to salvation.</p>
                  <p>Is not the knowledge of the wisedome, power and goodnesse of God, in the
Creation and government of the Heaven and Earth, with the things
that are in them, sufficient to make us wise to salvation?</p>
                  <p>No:</p>
                  <p>First, it serves rather for further condemnation without the Word,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as by and with the Word, the due meditation and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Gods works is a good help to further us in Religion, and in the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55421:204"/>
graces of Gods Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Sith then God doth not reveale the Covenant of grace,<note place="margin">Of the Church visible.</note> nor afford suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
meanes to salvation to the whole world, but onely to the Church:
explaine here what you meane by the Church.</p>
                  <p>Wee speake not here of that part of Gods Church which is trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
in glory, who being in perfect fruition have no need of these
outward meanes of communion with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22, 23. But the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
here is the Church militant: and that we consider also as visible in
the parts of it, consisting of divers assemblies and companies of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
making profession of the same common faith: Howbeit many
times by persecution forced to hide themselves from the eye of the
world,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 14.</note> and happily by the rage of the enemy so scattered, that as in the
dayes of <hi>Elias, 1 Kings</hi> 19. 10. they can hardly be knowne, or have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
between themselves, and so the exercise of the publick ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
may for a time be suspended among them.</p>
                  <p>But are none to be accounted members of this Church, but such as are true
beleevers; and so inseparably united unto Christ their head?</p>
                  <p>Truely and properly none other, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. Howbeit, because
God doth use outward meanes with the inward, for the gathering of his
Saints; and calleth them as well to outward profession among themselves,
<hi>Acts 2. 42. Cant.</hi> 1. 7. as to inward fellowship with his Son, whereby the
Church becomes visible; hence it is that so many as partake of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes, and joyne with the Church in league of visible profession;
are therefore in humane judgement accounted members of the true
Church, and Saints by calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. untill the Lord (who only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
who are his) doe make knowne the contrary, as we are taught in
the Parables of the Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 47, &amp;c. And of
the draw-net, and the threshing floore, where lyeth both good corne
and chaffe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Hath Christ then his Church visible upon earth?</p>
                  <p>Yea, throughout the world, (as we have shewne) in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
congregations of Christians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. called to the profession of the
true faith and obedience of the Gospell: In which visible assemblies,
and not else where, the true members of the true Church invisible on
earth are to be sought, <hi>Romans</hi> 11. 5. and unto which therefore all
that seek for salvation must gladly joyne themselves, <hi>Esa.</hi> 60. 4.</p>
                  <p>Doth the visible Church consist of good and bad, or of good onely?</p>
                  <p>It consisteth of good and bad, as at the beginning we may see it did
in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> whereupon our Saviour compareth the Church to a
net, in which are fishes good and bad; and to a field, which in it hath
wheat and cockle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. 47, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What are the markes and infallible notes, whereby to discerne a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church with which we may safely joyne?</p>
                  <p>First, and principally, the truth of Doctrine which is professed, and
the sincere preaching of the Word,<note place="margin">The infallible marks of a true visible Church.</note> together with the due administration
of the Sacraments, according to the commandements of Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, the right order which is kept, with sincere and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
obedience yeelded to the Word of God.</p>

                     <pb n="397" facs="tcp:55421:204"/>
Why doe you make the first to be the principall marke of visible
profession?</p>
                  <p>Because they are the onely outward meanes appointed of God for the
calling and gathering of his Saints, and which prove the Church to bee
a pillar of truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>Can the Church want this, and yet be a Church?</p>
                  <p>Yea; it may want these in the time of warre or persecution; and in
such a time we may safely joyn our selves to a company which allowes of
the publick Ministery of the Word of God, and administration of the
Sacraments; howsoever the exercise of the same by reason of these Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiles
are wanting for a time.</p>
                  <p>Are we to joyne with all Churches that have these markes?</p>
                  <p>Yea; neither must we separate from them any farther then they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from Christ, <hi>Phil. 1. 18. Cant.</hi> 1. 5. as shall be shewed.</p>
                  <p>What say you to the other notes that are commonly given of the Church?</p>
                  <p>Either they are accidentall, and in great part separable, or utterly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and forged, for the upholding of the Romish Synagogue.</p>
                  <p>But is not Antiquity a certaine note of the Church?</p>
                  <p>No; for errors are very ancient, and the Church when it began, was
a Church; yet had no antiquity.</p>
                  <p>Is not multitude a note?</p>
                  <p>No; for Christs flock is a little flock, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. and Antichrist very
great, <hi>Apoc. 13. 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 8. &amp; 18. 3.</p>
                  <p>Are not miracles a marke of the Church?</p>
                  <p>No; for beside that wicked people may worke them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23.
the Church of Christ hath been without miracles, and the comming of
Antichrist is foretold to be with all power, and signes, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
2 <hi>Thes. 2. 9. Apoc.</hi> 13. 13, 14. Such as those are whereof the
Papists brag and boast of, which are indeed no true miracles.</p>
                  <p>May the Church erre and be corrupted, or fall, and become no
Church?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Whether the Curch may erre.</note> we must distinguish of errors: some are fundamentall, such as
raze the foundation of the Church, (as the denying that Christ came
in the flesh, or the denying of the resurrection) and in these the Church
cannot erre; others are of lesse moment, and in these it may erre.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Catholick Church, considered in her true members, can
never utterly fall, <hi>Matth. 16. 18. Psalme 1. 6. 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 24. Howsoever no
Congregation be so pure, that it may bee said at any time to bee free
from all corruption, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. or so constant, but that at times it may be
shaken in the very foundation of truth, as it may appeare by the Church
of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 15. 12. 13. Gal.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Church being considered with respect of the place, God
doth not alwayes continue a succession of true beleevers within the same
limits and borders; and hence we say, that divers Churches are falne,
as those of <hi>Asia, &amp;c.</hi> Neither is any place so priviledged, but that
for sinne the Candlestick may in time be thence removed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>How may we judge of a Church corrupt, or ceasing to be a Church?</p>
                  <p>Where God utterly taking away the meanes of his Word and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46. hath apparently given the bill of divorce, <hi>Esa.</hi> 50. 1.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55421:205"/>
there are we not to acknowledge any Church at all, as at this day in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>

we are to acknowledge a Church of Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 12, 13. howsoever
more or lesse corrupt, according to the greater or lesse abuse of Gods
Word and Worship.</p>
                  <p>Since Churches may be so diversly corrupted, from which, and how farre
are we to separate?</p>
                  <p>From Churches mortally sick of heresie,<note place="margin">In what cases we may sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a corrupt Church</note> 
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11. or Idolatry, as

Howbeit whiles there is yet any life, rather from the scab or sore then
from the body; that is, from the prevailing faction, maintaining funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall

from the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not from such therein, who either
meaning well in generall, are ignorant of the depth of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 24.
or secretly dissent from the damnable corruptions, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 19. 18. with
whom, as a body yet retaining life, we desire to joine, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 18. so farre
as we may with safety from the foresaid contagion.</p>
                  <p>Are we to continue fellowship with all other Churches, not so deadly and
dangerously corrupt?</p>
                  <p>From Churches holding the foundation in substance of faith and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
though otherwise not free from blemish, we are not to separate,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 14. &amp; 22. 43. farther then in dislike and refusall of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they do apparently separate from Christ, in respect either of manners,
doctrine, or forme of publike worship.</p>
                  <p>What are the Enemies of the Church?</p>
                  <p>Besides these spirituall wickednesses which fight against our soules,<note place="margin">Of the enemies of the Church.</note>
there are outward enemies also that visibly oppose the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>How doth Christ defend his Church against those enemies?</p>
                  <p>This is partly to be done by the Civill Magistrate, to whom it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
by Civill meanes to maintaine the Church in that truth and liberty
which Christ hath given unto it: and partly by the breath of Christs own
mouth in the preaching of the Gospel, yet not perfectly but by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his comming in the latter day.</p>
                  <p>What is the estate of the Church when these enemies prevaile?</p>
                  <p>The Church is often oppressed and darkned so by them, that it doth
partly degenerate, and is partly hid, but never wholly destroyed, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
invisible.</p>
                  <p>Is not the Church alwayes visible in her parts?</p>
                  <p>The persons are alwaies visible, for Christ hath, and ever had from
the beginning, his Church visible upon earth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3, 4. that is,
some companies of Beleevers, making profession of the same common
faith: yet the persecution may be such, that the visible Church may not
appeare throughly for a time, the professors being forced thereby to hide
themselves from the eye of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. and happily by the
rage of the enemy so scattered, that as in the dayes of <hi>Elias, 1 Kings 10.
14,</hi> 18. they can hardly be knowne, or have entercourse between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and hence it is that the Church is compared to the Moon, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the full, sometimes in the wane.</p>
                  <p>What distinction is thereof the members of the visible Church?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>What is the Word?</p>

of Doctrine,<note place="margin">Of the Word. 1 Chro. 17. 7. Acts 2. 40, 41. &amp; 11. 20. 1 Cor. 4. 13. Iohn 17. 10. Ephes. 1. 23. Rom 3. 19. &amp; &amp; 7. 9, 10. Gal. 3 22. 23.

in begetting of faith.</p>
                  <p>What order is there used in the delivery of the Word for the begetting
of faith?</p>
                  <p>1. The Covenant of the Law is urged to make sin and the punishment
thereof knowne, whereupon the sting of conscience pricketh the heart
with a sense of Gods wrath, and maketh a man utterly to despaire of any
ability in himselfe to obtaine everlasting life. After this preparation, the
promises of the Gospel are propounded, whereupon the sinner conceiving
hope of pardon, sueth to God for mercy, and particularly applieth to his
own soul those comfortable promises which in the Word is propounded.</p>
                  <p>What is the inward meanes for the begetting of faith?</p>
                  <p>The holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Is it not lawfull to separate the inward meanes from the outward?</p>
                  <p>In no case: for those things which God hath joyned together no man
may separate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>How doth it appeare that God hath joyned both these meanes together?</p>
                  <p>Because hee saith by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> chap. 59. 21. that this is the
Covenant that hee will make with his people, to put his Spirit and
Word in them, and in all the posterity of the Church: The Apostle in
like manner, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 19. 20. joyneth these two together, <hi>Quench not the
Spirit,</hi> and <hi>despise not prophesying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would seem by these words of the Apostle, that the Spirit of Adoption
and Sanctification, proper to the faithfull, may be lost, whilst he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
that we should not quench the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>By no means, but as God doth assure the faithful of their continuance in
him, so he doth declare by these exhortations, that the only means wherby
we should nourish this holy fire in us, is to take heed to the preaching of
the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:55421:206"/>
Is by the word prophecying only meant the preaching of the Word?</p>
                  <p>No, but by a figurative speech, all those outward meanes whereby God
useth to give his holy Spirit; as are the Sacraments, and the discipline of
the Church, over and above the preaching of the Word; which being
principall of all, is here set downe for the rest.</p>
                  <p>Why doth the Apostle set the Spirit before the preaching of the Word,
meant by Prophecy, considering that by and after preaching of the
VVord, the Lord giveth his Spirit?</p>
                  <p>1. Because the Spirit is the chiefe of the two, the Word being but the
instrument whereby the Spirit of God worketh.</p>
                  <p>2. For that the worke of the Spirit is more generall, and reacheth to
some to whom the preaching of the Word cannot reach.</p>
                  <p>3. For that the Word is never profitable without the Spirit, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
may be profitable without the Word, as after will appeare.</p>
                  <p>What doe you learne of this, that the meanes of Gods Spirit and Word are
usually conjoyned together?</p>
                  <p>That no man is to content himselfe with this phantasie, to thinke that
he hath the Spirit, and so to neglect the Word, because they goe together.</p>
                  <p>Who are by this condemned?</p>
                  <p>The Anabaptists, Papists, &amp; Libertines, which ascribe to the Spirit that
which they like, although wickedly, seeing the Spirit doth not ordinarily
suggest any thing to us, but that which it teacheth us out of the word, <hi>Ioh.
14.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>What other sort of men are here condemned?</p>
                  <p>The Stancharists, who esteem the Word to be fit to chatechise, and to
innitiate or enter us in the rudiments of Religion: But too base to exercise
our selves continually in it; wheras the Prophets and Apostles, most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men, did notwithstanding exercise themselves in the Scriptures, <hi>Mar.
4.</hi> 1, 2, &amp;c. compared with <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 1, 2, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Are none saved without hearing of the Word?</p>
                  <p>Yes: For first children which are within the Covenant, have the Spirit of
God, without the ordinary meanes of the Word and Sacraments, <hi>Mat. 2.
Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 14. Secondly, some also of age in places where these meanes are
not to be had. Thirdly, some also which living in places where such means
are, yet have no capacity to understand them, as some naturall fooles, mad
men, or deafe borne, to shew that God is not tied to meanes.</p>
                  <p>What must we here take heed of?</p>
                  <p>That we presume not upon this, sith that notwithstanding this secret
working of God; yet it is as impossible to come to heaven, if having the
means and capacity of receiving them we contemne the means, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to have a harvest, where no seed time hath gone before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. or
to have children without the Parents seed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. seeing amongst such
the Spirit of God works faith only by the preaching of the word: Indeed
where the Lord placeth not the preaching of the VVord, there he can and
doth work faith without it; but where he hath placed it, he will not doe it
without it. In times and places where Popery hath prevailed, many were,
(and may be so at this day in Spaine and Rome) converted by the very
bare reading of the Word, yea without the reading of the VVord; but not
so among them, who have or may have it, either by going from home to
it, or fetching it home to them.</p>

How is the diverse working of Gods Spirit by the Ministry of the Word

                  <p>Are not three parts of the foure in the Church likely to be condemned by

                  <p>To understand something of the word of grace, and to give consent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same.</p>
                  <p>If they understand it, how is it that the first sort of unfruitfull hearers
are said not to understand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 19.</p>
                  <p>They have some understanding, but it is said to be none; because it is no
cleare knowledge, (whereof they can give a reason out of the Word) nor
effectuall, which ariseth from hence; for that they come without affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and goe away without care.</p>
                  <p>What are we here to learne?</p>
                  <p>1. To take heed not to deceive our selves in a bare profession, or light
knowledge of the Word; and that we come to heare it with zeale, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
with care to profit.</p>
                  <p>2. To beware also of the great subtilty of Satan, who as a swift bird,
snatcheth the Word out of the unprepared hearts, even as also doth a
thiefe, which taketh away whatsoever he findeth loose.</p>
                  <p>What observe you in the second sort, common to the godly with the wicked?</p>
                  <p>To have some kind of delight in the Word, and a glimpse of the life to
come, <hi>Mat. 13. 20. Heb.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>What difference is there between a godly joy and this?</p>
                  <p>1. This is like the blaze of the fire, and is never full and sufficient;
whereas the godly joy is above that of gold and silver.</p>
                  <p>2. The wickeds delight is for another purpose then is the godlies:
For it is only to satisfie a humour, desiring to know something more then
others; whereas the godlies joy is to know further, to the end they may
practise.</p>
                  <p>Why is it said they have no root? Mat. 13. 21.</p>
                  <p>Because, though they understand the things, yet are they not grounded
upon the reasons and testimonies of the Word; nor transformed into the
obedience of the Gospell, and therfore when persecution commeth, they
wither away.</p>
                  <p>Proceed to the third sort.</p>
                  <p>They are they which keep it (it may be with some suffering of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution)
yet the thornes of covetousnesse, or of worldly delights, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
the good seed, and make it unfruitfull.</p>
                  <p>So much of the three sorts of unfruitfull soyle, and therein, of the things
common to the godly with the wicked: What are the things proper to
the godly,<note place="margin">Things proper to godly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> signified by the good and fruitfull ground?</p>
                  <p>1. The receiving of the seed in a good heart.</p>
                  <p>2. The bringing forth of fruit with patience, <hi>Luke.</hi> 8. 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:55421:207"/>
What is there meant by receiving the seed into a good heart?</p>
                  <p>By the seed is meant the word of promise, whereby God hath said
he will be mercifull to us in Christ: By the receiving it into a good heart,
is meant the receiving it by faith in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Where it is said that the Word must be received into a good heart, it may
seeme that a man hath a good heart before he receiveth that seed?</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse, naturally they are all alike, and there is never a barrell bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
herring (as they say) but as the face answereth the face in the glasse: so
one of the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> is like another in their nativity they have by their
parents) till they be regenerated: And therefore it is called a good heart,
in respect of Gods changing of it by the ingraffed word, <hi>James</hi> 1. 21. and
by these words he putteth difference between the fruits of the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and the fruits of this last: For that there is no difference in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew of fruits; but only in regard that those fruits proceed from an
uncleane heart; and these from a heart that is cleansed.</p>
                  <p>How may we know that we have true faith, and so approve our selves that
we are good ground?</p>
                  <p>By good fruits, which are the effects of faith.</p>
                  <p>What are the effects of faith?</p>
                  <p>Reconciliation, and sanctification, <hi>Rom. 8. 1, 2, 3. Eph. 2. 6. Col.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.
the fruits of the former are set downe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. The fruits of the
latter are repentance and new obedience, which have been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p>What speciall tokens observe you out of the former, whereby we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
a justifying faith from the faith of the worldlings?</p>
                  <p>The end of our faith being the salvation of our soules,<note place="margin">How justifying faith differeth from the faith of worldlings.</note> which shall be at
the day of judgement, if we can willingly forsake father and mother, sister
and brother, wife and children, and abandon the world, and say, <hi>Come Lord
Jesus, come quickly,</hi> we may assure our selves we are in a happy case.</p>
                  <p>What speciall marks of justifying faith observe you out of the latter?</p>
                  <p>1. To be zealous of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>2. To love Gods children; for these be the speciall effects of our holy
faith.</p>
                  <p>What is the Word further compared with, and likened unto?</p>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter, 1 cap. 2. ver.</hi> 1, 2. compares it unto milke: <hi>As new borne
babes desire the sincere milke of the Word, that ye may grow thereby;</hi> teaching
us, that the VVord is not only of use for our begetting unto God; but for
our daily nourishment, that we may <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord Iesus Christ, 2 Peter</hi> 3. 18. so it is called a light, a lanthorne, and
is appointed to be our guide, our Counsellor, our Comforter, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Is this meant only of the Word preached?</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse, the blessing of God both in an especiall manner wait upon
that ordinance, when it is said; That when <hi>Christ ascended up on high, he
gave gifts to men, some Apostles,</hi> (Ephes. 4. 12.) <hi>and some Pastors and teachers,

                  </p>
                  <p>The seales of the Promises of God in Christ, wherein by certaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
signes, and sacramentall actions confirming the same, commanded
by God, and delivered by his Ministers, Christ Iesus with all his saving
graces is signified, conveyed and sealed unto the heart of a Christian.
For Sacraments are seales annexed by God to the word of the Covenant
of grace, <hi>Rom. 4. 11, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 23. to instruct, assure, and possesse us of
our part in Christ and his benefits, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3. 27. and to bind us to all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obedience unto God in him, <hi>Rom. 6</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Was not Gods Word sufficient? What need have we of Sacraments?<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of great use.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This argues our infirmity, and manifesteth Gods great love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
who for the furthering of our understanding, hath added visible
signes to his word, that our eares might not onely bee informed of the
truth, but our eyes also might more plainly see it; and for the greater
strengthning of our faith, vouchsafeth to confirme the covenant of grace
unto us, not onely by promise, but also by outward seales annexed
thereunto. The like meanes had <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe in Paradise to put him
in remembraece of Gods will: And if he in his perfection needed a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Gods favour, (which was the tree of life) how much more wee
that are corrupt and sinfull? if we were Spirits or Angels, wee should not
need these helpes; but sith God knowing our frailties, and what is best
for us, hath given us these seales to our further comfort, let us use the
receipt of so skilfull a Physitian, unlesse wee will hasten our owne
deaths.</p>
                  <p>How doth God by the Sacraments assure us of his mercies in Christ?</p>
                  <p>By the exhibiting to the worthy receiver by such outward signes,
(whether Elements, or Actions) as himselfe for the reliefe of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
hath prescribed, whole Christ, God and men, with all his
benefits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. in whom <hi>all the promises of God are yea and Amen,
2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                  <p>Doe they seale nothing else but the promise of God unto us?</p>
                  <p>Yes, they seale our promise unto God, that we take him onely for
our God and Redeemer, whom alone by faith wee rest on, and whom
we will obey.</p>
                  <p>How doe they binde us unto God?</p>
                  <p>Wee receiving them as pledges of his infinite love in Christ, doe

duties to his Majesty, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and for his sake one to another,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Describe yet more largely what a Sacrament is.</p>
                  <p>A Sacrament is an Ordinance of God,<note place="margin">What a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> wherein by giving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of outward Elements, according to his will, the promises of the

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55421:208"/>
and applyed unto us, are further signed and sealed betwixt God and
man. Or it is an action of the whole Church, wherein by certaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
signes, and outward things done according to Gods institution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things being betokened, Christ with all his benefits is both offered
unto us, and received by us: offered (I say) to all in the Church, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
onely to the faithfull, for the strengthening of their faith in the
eternall Covenant, and the bringing them more effectually to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Gods Commandements, <hi>Exod. 12. 16. Luke</hi> 1. 59. &amp; 3. 3. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.
11. 23. Mat. 26. 26. Rom.</hi> 4. 19. &amp; 6. 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>Why call you it Action?</p>
                  <p>Because it is not a bare signe alone, but a worke, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Why call you it an action of the whole Church?</p>
                  <p>Because it is a publick action, and appertaineth to the whole Church;
and therefore ought to be done in the presence of the Congregation,
by the example of <hi>John, Matth.</hi> 3. 11, 12. and commanded of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.
11.</hi> 18, 20, 22. it being a greater indignity for the Sacraments to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistered
privately, then for the civill judgement, which is open and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
That we say nothing of the sacrifices under the Law, which were
not so excellent as these; and yet it was not lawful to offer them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:
which reproveth the disorder of the Papists, who turne the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
into a private Masse, and minister the Lords Supper to one alone,
without the presence of the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>But may not the Sacraments be so administered upon necessity; as namely
to a sick man ready to depart out of this life?</p>
                  <p>There is no such necessity; for a man believing wanting that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of comming to the Lords Supper, wanteth not the effect thereof;
seeing the Lord promised by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that hee would be a Tabernacle to
his people being banished from it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 27. And therefore the want
of the Sacraments doth not hurt, when with conveniency a man cannot
enjoy them: but the contempt, or neglect of them, when they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
be come unto.</p>

                     </gap> is the fittest time and place for the administration of the
Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>The fittest time is the Lords, or some other day of publike meeting:
The most convenient place is the Church, and usuall place of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> minister the Sacrament of Circumcision in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
house?</p>
                  <p>His house was at that time the Church of God, and therefore not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
and so in the time of persecution, the godly did oft-times meet in
Barnes, and such obscure places, which were indeed publick: because
when the Church of God were there, the house or place availed nothing
to make it publick or private: even as wheresoever the Prince is, there
is the Court also said to be, though it were in a poore Cottage.</p>
                  <p>What difference is there between a Sacrament and a Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>In a Sacrifice there is an offering made to God; in a Sacrament, there
is an offer made by God to us. In the Sacrifices Christ was signified as
given for us, in the Sacraments as given to us, the Sacrifices onely signes,
the Sacraments seales also.</p>

                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:55421:208"/>
Who is the Author of a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>God alone; because he onely can bestow those graces which are sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>How doth God ordaine a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>By his Word.</p>
                  <p>How many parts of Gods Word are there, whereby he doth institute and
and ordaine a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Two.</p>
                  <p>First, a Commandement to doe it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a promise of a blessing upon the right using of it.</p>
                  <p>Was not the Rain-bow a Sacrament, being a signe ordained by God?</p>
                  <p>No; for though it were a signe, yet it was no signe of salvation by
Christ.</p>
                  <p>What is the matter and substance of every Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>One and the same Iesus Christ, although diversly communicated in
divers Sacraments; and in some more forcible then in others; because
of some elements communicating with, or taking hold of, or reaching
to more of our senses.</p>
                  <p>What things then are required in a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Three.</p>
                  <p>First, the outward signes, and Sacramentall actions concerning the
same.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the inward thing signified thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ Iesus with
his saving graces, and spirituall actions concerning the same.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a similitude betwixt them both: As in Baptisme for example,
that as water doth wash the body, so doth the bloud of Christ wash away
the spots of the soule.</p>
                  <p>What signes are used in Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>Some onely representing, as water, bread, and wine; some applying, as
washing, eating, drinking, and such like.</p>
                  <p>What are the things signified?</p>
                  <p>First, Christ Iesus and his merrits; and secondly, the applying of the
same unto us in particular.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doth the signes of the things signified differ?</p>
                  <p>1. In Nature.</p>
                  <p>2. In the manner of receiving.</p>
                  <p>3. In the parties which doe receive them.</p>
                  <p>4. In the necessity of the receiving of them.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doe they agree?</p>
                  <p>In this, that the signe doth so fitly represent the things signified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that the minde of a Christian is drawne by the signe to consider of
the things signified.</p>
                  <p>What is then the Sacramentall union betwixt the signes and the things
signified?</p>
                  <p>Such as betwixt a sealed will, and the things conveighed in the same;
From whence it is, that the names, effects, and properties of the one are
given to the other.</p>
                  <p>What is the cause that moved the Lord to grace the outward signes in
the Sacraments, with the names of the things signified?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="406" facs="tcp:55421:209"/>
The outward elements have the names of the spirituall things they set
forth, 1. Because of their fit proportion and agreement, in regard of the
resemblance and similitude of the elements and the things signified, in
which respect they are called signes. 2. To shew the inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the things signified with the signe, in the worthy receiver; in
which regard they are called Seales, as in the person of Christ his two
natures are so inseparably united, that often times the properties and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the one are attributed to the other.</p>
                  <p>What is the ground of this Sacramentall union?</p>
                  <p>In generall the institution of Christ, whereby fit things are appointed
so to be used, with a promise annexed. In speciall, the applying of that
word unto certain speciall signes with prayer; in particular, and unto me,
the ground is my reverent and worthy receiving.</p>
                  <p>What is the use of Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>God hath ordained them,<note place="margin">The use of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> to the end that by comparing and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the outward things with the inward, they might help,</p>
                  <p>1. Our understanding, in which regard they are as it were images and
glasses, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>2. Our remembrance, in which respect they are Monuments, <hi>Luk. 22.
19. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 24.</p>
                  <p>3. And especially the perswasion of our hearts, by reason whereof they
are seals and pledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. for they are appointed by God to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
us in the promises of salvation, which God hath not onely made to
us in word, but also confirmed the same by writ: and lest that we should
any wayes doubt (as naturally we are inclined) he hath set to his seales,
according to the manner of men, that nothing might be lacking which
should increase our strength.</p>
                  <p>What Doctrine is here to be gathered?</p>
                  <p>1. What root of blindnesse, of forgetfulnesse, and especially hardnesse
of heart to beleeve, is in us, that the Word and Oath of God is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to pluckup, but that we must have such aides.</p>
                  <p>2. The mercy of God, that applieth himself to our weaknesse.</p>
                  <p>3. What miserable men they are that refuse the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Repeat the principall ends for which God hath instituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments?</p>
                  <p>To help our insight as cleare glasses,<note place="margin">The ends why Sacraments are instituted.</note> to releeve our memories as lasting
monuments, and to confirme our faith as most certain seales and pledges,
from whence they become our bonds of obedience, and the markes
and badges of our profession: so the ends for which they are appointed are
these foure.</p>
                  <p>1. The clearing of our knowledge.</p>
                  <p>2. The helping of our memories.</p>
                  <p>3. The strengthening of our faith.</p>
                  <p>4. The quickning of our obedience.</p>
                  <p>How may we more clearly consider of those things which are ministred
in the Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>By considering distinctly the things given and received, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
giving and receiving.</p>
                  <p>What are the things given and received?</p>

                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:55421:209"/>
They are partly outward, and partly inward.</p>
                  <p>What are the outward?</p>
                  <p>The visible creatures, ordained for signes and figures of Christ, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the time of the Gospel, Water, Bread, and Wine.</p>
                  <p>Why hath God made choice of these creatures?</p>
                  <p>Both in respect they are for their naturall properties most fit to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the spirituall things, as also for that they are most generally used of
all Nations of the world.</p>
                  <p>What are we to learne from hence?</p>
                  <p>The wonderfull wisdome of God, that hath chosen base and common
things for so high and singular mysteries, whereas he might have chosen
things more rare, and of greater price, to set out such excellent benefits as
are offered to us in the Sacraments, wherein there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the time of the Law and of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>What are the inward things?</p>
                  <p>The invisible and spirituall graces, namely, Christ with all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
                  <p>What learne you of this?</p>
                  <p>Not to stick to the outward elements, but to lift up our hearts unto
God, accounting the elements as a Ladder whereby to climb up to those
celestiall things which they represent.</p>
                  <p>So much of the things, what are the persons?</p>
                  <p>The Giver and Receiver.<note place="margin">The persons that are actors in Sacraments, and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many Givers are there?</p>
                  <p>Two; the outward, giving the outward, and the inward, giving the
inward things.</p>
                  <p>Who is the inward giver?</p>
                  <p>God himself, even the holy Trinity, God the Father, God the Son,
and God the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>What are the actions of God in a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>They are principally two.</p>
                  <p>1. To offer and reach forth Christ and his graces.</p>
                  <p>2. To apply them to the hearts of the faithfull Communicant.</p>
                  <p>Who are the outward Givers?</p>
                  <p>The Ministers especially, representing unto us the Lord, whose Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
they are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>What is the Ministers office herein?</p>
                  <p>To consecrate the elements, and then to distribute them.</p>
                  <p>Wherein consisteth the consecration of the elements?</p>
                  <p>Partly, in declaring the institution of the Sacraments, and partly in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the Congregation in prayer unto God: First, in praising God,
who hath ordained such means for the reliefe of our weaknesse: Then in
suing to God that he would be pleased to make those meanes effectuall
for which end they were ordained.</p>
                  <p>Is not the substance changed of the elements by this consecration?</p>
                  <p>No verily; onely the use is altered, in that they are separated from a
common to a holy use; which change and alteration continueth onely
while the action is in hand.</p>
                  <p>Doth the Minister with the signe give the thing signified also?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:55421:210"/>
No, he onely dispenseth the signes, but it is God that giveth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth
the things signified, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                  <p>Is God alwayes present, to give the thing signified to all them that the
Minister giveth the signe?</p>
                  <p>No not to all, for some in receiving the signes receive together with
them their owne judgement, 1 <hi>Cor. 11</hi> 29. yet he is alwayes ready to give
the thing signified to all those that are fit to receive the Sacraments;
and to such persons the signes and things signified are alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
                  <p>Who are the persons that are to receive the Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>All Christians that are prepared thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Is there any speciall preparation required to the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily: for seeing men ought to come with preparation to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Word alone, they ought much more to come when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are administred also, wherein God doth offer himselfe more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
and visibly to us.</p>
                  <p>What is the preparation that is required in them that come to receive
the Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>There is required in those that are of yeares of discretion,<note place="margin">Of preparation to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to a worthy
participation of the Sacraments, knowledge, faith, and feeling, both in
the Law, and in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Seeing no man is able to attaine to the knowledge of the Law and the
Gospel perfectly, much lesse the simple and common people, tell me
how farre is this knowledge, faith, and feeling necessary?</p>
                  <p>First, concerning the Law, it is necessary that the receiver of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
be able to understand and beleeve the common corruption of
all men, both in the bitter root of originall sinne, and in the poysoned
fruits thereof, together with the curse of everlasting death due thereunto,
and that he be able to apply both these, that is, the sinne and wages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning the Gospel, that he be able (in some measure)
to understand the Covenant of Grace, which God in Christ hath made
with the sons of men; and then that by faith he be able (in some measure)
to apply the same to himself.</p>
                  <p>VVhat ariseth from this knowledge, faith, and feeling, to a further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
thereunto?</p>
                  <p>A true and earnest desire to be made partaker of the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 13.</note> with
a conscionable care to performe speciall duties in and after the action of
receiving.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 36.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 22. 15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVhat duties in the action of receiving are to be performed?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Duties in the action of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> a grave and reverent behaviour, befitting such holy Mysteries.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an attentive heedfulnesse in comparing the outward signes
and actions in the Sacraments, with the inward and spirituall things which
they betoken.</p>
                  <p>VVhat duties are to bee performed after the partaking of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments?</p>
                  <p>If we have a sense and feeling of the gracious work of God by them,<note place="margin">Duties after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</note>
we are to rejoice with thanksgiving; if not, we are to enter into judgment
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55421:210"/>
with our selves, and to humble our selves for our want thereof. And
though we ought to be humbled, if we feel not the work of God in us,
in or after the Sacraments, as that which argueth want of preparation
before, or attention in receiving of them, yet ought we not therefore
to be altogether dismayed: for as the sick man feeleth not the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his meat, because of his malady, and yet notwithstanding is
nourished; so it is in such faithfull ones as doe not so sensibly feel the
working of God in and by the Sacraments, through the weaknesse of
their faith, and although wee cannot feele it immediately, yet after
(by the fruites thereof) wee shall bee able to discern of our profiting
thereby.</p>
                  <p>Hath the administration of the Gospel been alwaies after the same
manner?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For substance it alwayes hath been the same, but in regard of the
manner, proper to certain times, it is distinguished into two kindes;
the Old and the New,</hi> Heb. 11. 2. 13. &amp; 13. 18. Act. 10. 43. &amp; 13. 11.
Luk. 16. 16. Joh. 1. 17. Heb. 11. &amp; 2. 8, 9, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 3. 6, 7, 8.</p>

<hi>Heb. 1. 1. &amp; 9. 10. Act. 7. 44. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 7. 11.</p>
                  <p>What are the properties of this Ministery?</p>
                  <p>First, the commandements of the Law were more largely, and the
promises of the Gospel more sparingly, and darkly propounded, the
latter being more generally and obscurely delivered, as the manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was the further off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, the promises of things to come, were shadowed with a
multitude of types and figures, which when the truth should be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
were to vanish away,</hi> Jer. 31. 31, 32, 33. Heb. 11. 13. 2 Cor. 3. 13.

                  <p>What were the chiefest states and periods of this old Ministery?</p>
                  <p>The first, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham;</hi> the second, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to
Christ.</p>
                  <p>What were the speciall properties of the last of these two periods?</p>
                  <p>First, it was more specially restrained unto a certaine Family and
Nation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it had with it solemne repetition, and declaration of the
first covenant of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, besides the ceremonies, which were greatly inlarged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

                  <p>What were the ordinary Sacraments of this Ministery?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sacrament of admission into the Church was circumcision,
instituted in the dayes of</hi> Abraham; <hi>the other of continuall preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and nourishment, the Paschall Lambe, instituted in time of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:55421:211"/>

                  <p>What are the properties thereof?</p>
                  <p>First, it is propounded indifferently to all people, whether they bee
Jewes or Gentiles, and in that respect is Catholick or universall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is full of grace and truth, bringing joyfull tydings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mankinde, that whatsoever was formerly promised of Christ, is
now accomplished, and so in stead of the ancient types and shadows,
the things themselves with a large and cleere declaration of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of the Gospel are exhibited.<note n="*" place="margin">Esa. 41. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 68. 3, 4, 5. &amp; 65. 12. &amp; 66. 12 19, 20. Joh. 16. 10. Mat. 18. 19, 20. Rom. 15. 25 26. Ephel. 3. 5, 6 8, 9. Col. 1. 5, 6. Joh. 1. 17. &amp; 14. 21. Rom. 1. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12. 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.</note>

                  <p>What bee the speciall points of the words of this ministery?</p>
                  <p>That Christ our Saviour, whom God by his Prophets had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to send into the world, is come in the flesh, and hath accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the work of our Redemption; <hi>that hee was conceived of the holy Ghost,
born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>suffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was crucified,</hi> and
dyed upon the crosse; that body and soule thus separated, his body
was laid in the grave, and remained there under the power of death,
and his Soule went into the place appointed for the soules of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
namely, Paradise the place of the blessed, that the third day
body and soule being joyned together againe, hee rose from the dead,
and after ascended into Heaven, where hee sitteth at the right hand of
his Father, untill such time as from thence hee shall come unto the

                  <p>What are the Sacraments of this Ministery?</p>
                  <p>The sacrament of admission into the Church is Baptisme, which
sealeth unto us our spirituall birth; the other the sacrament of our
continuall preservation, is the Lords Supper, which sealeth unto us
our continuall nourishment.</p>
                  <p>What Sacraments bee there of the Covenant of Grace?</p>
                  <p>They bee of two sorts; some of the Old Testament before Christs
comming: others of the New, under Christ.</p>
                  <p>What Sacraments were there of the Old Testament?</p>
                  <p>Besides divers extraordinarily given,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old Testament.</note> (1 <hi>Pet. 3. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2,

use, from their institution untill the comming of Christ, (to
which those other may bee referred) first, Circumcision for entrance
into the covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen. 17. 10. Deut.</hi> 30. 6. secondly, the

                  <p>How doe the Sacraments of the New Testament differ from those of
the Old?</p>
                  <p>In respect not of the Author,<note place="margin">How they differ from the New.</note> God; the substance, Christ; or the
receivers, the people of God; which are in both the same, (<hi>Rom. 4. 11.

11.</hi> 26.) easie performance, and efficacy; in all which those of the New
Testament have great preheminence, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.)</p>
                  <p>What Sacraments bee there of the New Testament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:55421:211"/>
Onely two; to wit, Baptisme, succeeding in the place of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and the Supper of the Lord,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> answering to the Passeover, (<hi>Rom.
4. 1. Gen. 17. 11, 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26. &amp; 28. 19.)
By the former, wee have our admission into the true Church of God;
by the latter, wee are nourished and preserved in the Church after our
admission.</p>
                  <p>How may it appeare that there bee no more then two Sacraments of the
New Testament?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">That there bee onely two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> when the number of Sacraments were most necessary, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, they had but two, wherefore wee need require no more,
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, having meat, drink, and cloathes, wee ought therewith
to bee content; (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8.) now by the Sacrament of our entrance
our spirituall cloathing is sealed unto us, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27.) and by that of our
growth is sealed our feeding, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, those two seales assure us of all Gods graces, as of our
regeneration, entrance, and ingraffing into Christ; so of our growth
and continuance in him: and therefore wee need no more, (1 <hi>Cor. 12.
13.</hi>) For there are as many Sacraments as there are things that need
to bee betokened to us about our justification. Now they bee two;
our birth in Christ, and our nourishment after wee are born: as in the
bodily life, wee see that wee need no more, but to bee born, and then
to have this life preserved. The Sacrament of Baptisme sheweth us
the first; the Sacrament of the Lords Supper the second. Therefore
those five other Sacraments, of Confirmation, Penance, Matrimony,
Orders, and extreame Unction, joyned by the Papists are superfluous,
because some of them have no warrant at all out of the Word of God,
and God hath not promised a blessing upon the using of them; others
of them, though they bee agreeable to the Word, yet are without the
nature and number of the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>What is Baptisme?</p>
                  <p>It is the first Sacrament of the New Testament,<note place="margin">Of Baptisme, and what it is.</note> by the washing of
water (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26.) representing the powerfull washing of the blood
and spirit of Christ, (1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. Heb.</hi> 10. 22.) and so sealing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
or new birth, our entrance into the Covenant of Grace,
and our ingraffing into Christ, and into the body of Christ, which is
his Church, (<hi>Joh. 3. 5. Tit. 3. 5. Act.</hi> 8. 27.) The word Baptisme in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
signifieth any kinde of washing, but here it is specially taken
for that sacramentall washing, which sealeth unto those which are
within Gods Covenant, their birth in Christ, and enterance into
Christianity.</p>
                  <p>How was this Sacrament ordained and brought into the Church in
the place of Circumcision?</p>
                  <p>At the Commandement of God (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33.) by the Ministery of
<hi>John,</hi> therefore called the Baptist, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 1. after sanctified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by our Saviour Christ himself, being baptized by <hi>John, (Mat.
3.</hi> 13.) and giving commission to his Apostles and Ministers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the same in his Church unto the end, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18.)</p>
                  <p>Why call you it the first Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Because Christ gave order to his Apostles, that after they have
taught, and men beleeve, they should baptize them, that so they might

bee enrolled amongst those of the houshold of God, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number of the Citizens &amp; Burgesses of the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What abuse doth this take away?</p>
                  <p>That which sometimes the ancient Church was infected withall,
namely, that they baptized men at their death, and let them receive the
Lords Supper twice or thrice a yeer, whereas this is the first Sacrament
of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>What are the essentiall parts of this Sacrament of Baptisme?</p>
                  <p>As of all other Sacraments, two; the outward signes, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things signified: where also is to bee considered, the proportion
and union which is between those two parts, which is as it were the
very form and inward excellency of a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>What are the outward signes in Baptisme?</p>
                  <p>They are the outward element of water, and the outward sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
actions performed about it.</p>
                  <p>What are those Sacramentall actions?</p>
                  <p>First, the Ministers blessing and consecrating the water: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the right applying it so consecrated, to the party to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>May none but a lawfull Minister baptize?</p>
                  <p>No; for baptism is a part of the publique Ministery of the Church,
and Christ hath given warrant and authority to none to baptize, but
those whom hee hath called to preach the Gospel: <hi>Goe, Preach and
Baptize, Matth.</hi> 28. 29. those onely may stand in the roome of God
himself, and Ministerially set to the seale of the Covenant. And
it is monstrous presumption for Women, or any other private persons,
(who are not called) to meddle with such high Mysteries, nor can there
bee any case of necessity to urge, as will appeare afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first action of the Minister; how is hee to blesse and
consecrate the water?</p>
                  <p>First, by opening to them that are present the Doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and the right institution and use of it, what inward mysteries
are signified and sealed up by those outward signes. So did <hi>John,</hi>
when hee baptized, hee preached the Doctrine of Repentance, and
taught the people the inward baptisme of the Spirit, signified by his
baptizing with vvater, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by acknowledging in the name of the congregation mans
naturall pollution, that vve stand in need of spirituall vvashing, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thanks to God the Father for giving his Sonne for a propitiation
for our sins, and appointing his blood to bee a fountain to the house of
<hi>Israel</hi> to wash in, and for ordaining of this service to bee a Sacrament
and seale of so great a mystery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by making profession of Faith in Gods promises in that
behalf, and praying that they may bee made good unto the party that
is to receive the seale thereof: for as every thing is sanctified by the
Word of God and prayer, so in especiall manner the Sacramentall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in baptisme is blessed and consecrated by the Word of institution,
and prayer to God for a blessing upon his own Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>What is the second Sacramentall action?</p>
                  <p>The action of washing, that is, of applying the Sacramentall water
unto the party to be baptized, diving or dipping him into it, or sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55421:212"/>
him with it,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>In the name of the Father, the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is the action of diving or dipping,<note place="margin">Whether diving or dipping bee essentiall to Baptisme.</note> materiall and essentiall to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
or is there absolute ground and warrant for sprinkling,
which is most commonly practised with us in these cold Countries?</p>
                  <p>Some there are that stand strictly for the particular action of diving
or dipping the baptized under water, as the onely action which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of this Sacrament will bear, and our Church allows no other,
except in case of the childes weaknesse, and there is exprest in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
baptisme, both his descending into the water and rising up: so
that some think our common sprinkling to bee (through ease and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse)
a stretching the liberty of the Church further then either the
Church would, or the symbolicalnesse of the outward sign with the
thing signified can safely admit, it typifying our spirituall buriall
and resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>Others conceive the action of sprinkling of water upon the face
of the baptized very warrantable, especially in young children to
whom further wetting may bee dangerous, and the grounds are these:</p>
                  <p>First, it seems that neither dipping is essentiall to the Sacrament of
Baptisme, nor sprinkling, but onely washing and applying water to
the body as a cleanser of the filth thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, then, as in the other Sacrament, a spoonfull of wine is as
significant as a whole gallon; so here, a handfull of water is as signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
as a whole river.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the action of sprinkling beares fit resemblance with the
inward grace, as well as dipping, and hath authority in the Scriptures:
read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. there is speech of the sprinkling of the
blood of Christ, and <hi>the blood of sprinkling speaks better things then the
blood of</hi> Abel.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is not unlikely that the Apostles baptized as well by
sprinkling, or powring upon, as by diving and dipping into, sith wee
read of divers baptized in houses, as well as others in rivers. However
the washing the body by water, is essentiall, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26.) though
whether way it bee done, seem not to bee essentiall, (so water bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the body for the cleansing of it.)</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Sacramentall element, and Sacramentall actions,
which are the outward part of baptism: What now is the inward part?</p>
                  <p>Those spirituall things which are signified,<note place="margin">The inward part or thing signified in Baptisme.</note> and represented, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in and by the outward element and actions: as the water signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the blood of Christ, the Ministers consecrating the water signifies
God the Fathers setting apart his Son for the expiation of the sins of
the world by his blood; the Ministers applying the water to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the baptized to cleanse it, signifieth Gods applying the blood of
his Son to cleanse the soule for justification and remission of sins: and
not onely to signifie, but to seale up unto the beleever, that the inward
part is effected as well as the outward.</p>
                  <p>How come these visible things to signifie such invisible mysteries?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The similitude between the signe and thing signified.</note> there is a naturall fitnesse and aptnesse in the outward things
to expresse the inward, as for water to bee a resemblance of the blood
of Christ; thus they agree:</p>
                  <p>First, water is a necessary element, the naturall life of man cannot be
without it, and the blood of Christ is as necessary to his spiritual life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:55421:213"/>
Secondly, water is a comfortable element: as the Hart <hi>panteth after
the water brooks, Psal.</hi> 42. 1. The thirst of the body cannot bee quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but by water; hence the heighth of misery is described <hi>by a barren
and dry ground, where no water is, Psal.</hi> 63. 1. so the thirst of the soule
cannot bee quenched but by the blood of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, water is a free element; as it is necessary, usefull, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
so it is cheap, and easie to come by without cost; so is the
blood of Christ, <hi>Esa. 55. 1. Hoe, hee that thirsteth come and drink freely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, water is a common element, none are barred from it, any
may go to the river and drink; and the blood of Christ is offered as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to all, rich and poore, high and low, bond and free, every one
may lay claim unto him, come &amp; have interest in him; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. Who
ever receiveth him, who ever beleeveth, the proposall is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
none can say, I am shut out or excepted.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, water is a copious and plentifull element, there is no lesse
in the river for thy drinking of it, there is enough for all men: so is
the blood of Christ all-sufficient, it can never bee drawn dry; of his
fulnesse wee may all receive, and yet hee bee never the more empty;
hence the Scripture speaks of plenteous redemption.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, lastly and especially, water is a cleansing and a purifying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement;
and it resembles the blood of Christ fitly in that, for 1 <hi>Joh. 1.
7. The blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we may also observe the symbolicalnesse betwen the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
action of washing, and the inward grace signified.</p>
                  <p>First, nothing is washed but that which is unclean; even so the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
washing implies our naturall pollution: whosoever submits
to this Sacrament of Baptism, doth by so doing acknowledge himself
to bee defiled; whoever brings a childe to bee baptized, doth by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
make confession of originall corruption and sinfulnesse; as <hi>Johns</hi>
hearers were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the applying of the water to the body, washeth and
cleanseth; so it is with the blood of Christ, it cleanseth not the soule,
but by being applyed to it, in the merit and efficacy of it, by the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit, of which the outward ministeriall washing is a sign and
seale, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>What is there besides the naturall fitnesse of the outward things to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the inward?</p>
                  <p>2. There is also considerable Gods divine institution, ordaining and
appointing these things to typifie to the soule Christ crucified in his
cleansing quality: for otherwise though there were never such aptnesse
in the creature, yet it hath nothing to do to meddle with a Sacrament,
unlesse the Lord do specially appropriate it to serve for such a purpose;
and then with Gods institution, there goeth a blessing and a speciall
vertue and power attends on a divine Ordinance; that which makes
the outward signs significant, is Gods Word and appointment.</p>
                  <p>But is Christ and the cleansing power of his bloud only barely signified
in the Sacrament of Baptisme?</p>
                  <p>Nay more; the inward things are really exhibited to the beleever
as well as the outward; there is that sacramentall union between them
that the one is conveyed and sealed up by the other: hence are those
phrases of <hi>being born again of water and of the holy Ghost,</hi> Joh. 3. 5. of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55421:213"/>
cleansing by the washing of water, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. so <hi>arise and be baptized, and
wash away thy sins,</hi> Acts 22. 16. so <hi>Rom. 6. 3. we are buried with Christ by
baptisme, &amp;c.</hi> the Sacraments being rightly received, doe effect that
which they doe represent.</p>
                  <p>Are all they then that are partakers of the outward washing of baptisme,
partakers also of the inward washing of the Spirit? Doth this
Sacrament seal up their spirituall ingraffing into Christ to all who
externally receive it?</p>
                  <p>Surely no; though God hath ordained these outward means for the
conveyance of the inward grace to our souls, yet there is no necessity
that we should tie the working of Gods Spirit to the Sacraments more
then to the Word; the promises of salvation, Christ and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
are preached and offered to all in the ministery of the Word, yet all
hearers have not them conveyed to their souls by the Spirit, but those
whom God hath ordained to life; so in the Sacraments, the outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
are dispensed to al who make an outward profession of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
(for in infants their being born in the bosome of the Church is in
stead of an outward profession) because man is not able to distinguish
corn from chaffe: but the inward grace of the Sacrament is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to all, but to those onely who are heirs of those promises
whereof the Sacraments are seals; for without a man have his name
in the Covenant,<note place="margin">The benefit of baptisme to a common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</note> the seal set to it confirms nothing to him.</p>
                  <p>What is the advantage then or benefit of baptisme to a common Christian?</p>
                  <p>The same as was the benefit of Circumcision to the <hi>Jew</hi> outward,
<hi>Rom. 2. 28. Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. there is a generall grace of Baptisme which all
the baptized partake of as a common favour, and that is their admission
into the visible body of the Church, their matriculation and outward
incorporating into the number of the worshippers of God by externall
communion: and so as Circumcision was not onely a seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which is by faith, but as an overplus God appointed it to be
like a wall of separation between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> so is Baptisme a
badge of an outward member of the Church, a distinction from the
common rout of Heathen; and God thereby seals a right upon the
party baptized to his ordinances, that he may use them as his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and wait for an inward blessing by them; yet this is is but the
porch, the shell, and outside; all that are outwardly received into the
visible Church, are not spiritually ingraffed into the mysticall body
of Christ. Baptisme always is attended upon by that generall grace,
but not always with this speciall.</p>
                  <p>To whom then is Baptisme effectuall to the sealing up this inward and
speciall grace?<note place="margin">To whom bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must here distinguish of persons baptized; the Church doth
not onely baptize those that are grown and of years, if any such being
bred Pagans be brought within the pale of the Church, and testifie
their competent understanding of Christianity, and professe their faith
in the Lord Jesus, and in Gods precious promises, of remission of sins
by his bloud, and their earnest desire to be sealed with Baptisme for
the strengthening of their souls in this faith: but the Church also bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth
her infants, such as being born within her bosome of beleeving
parents are within the Covenant, &amp; so have right unto the seal thereof.</p>
                  <p>Doth the inward grace always accompany the outward sign in those of
years baptized?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:55421:214"/>
No; but onely then when the profession of their faith is not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
onely and counterfeit, but sincere and hearty, they laying hold on
Christ offered in the Sacrament by a lively faith which is the hand to
receive the mercies offered, <hi>Acts 8. 37. If thou beleevest with all thy heart</hi>
thou maist be baptized, saith <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch; for it were absurd to
extend the benefit of the seal beyond the Covenant; now the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made only to the faithfull, <hi>Joh. 1. 10. Mark 16. 16. He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
and is baptized shall be saved; but he that beleeveth not,</hi> whether he be
baptized or no, shall be condemned. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (Act. 8. 13.) and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and thousands of Hypocrites and Formalists shall find no help in
the day of the Lord by the holy water of their baptisme, without it be
to encrease their Judgement.</p>
                  <p>But what say you of infants baptized that are born in the Church, doth the
inward grace in their baptism always attend upon the outward sign?</p>
                  <p>Surely no; the Sacrament of baptisme is effectuall in infants, onely
to those and to all those who belong unto the election of grace, which
thing though we (in the judgement of charity) doe judge of every
particular infant, yet we have no ground to judge so of all in generall;
or if we should judge so, yet it is not any judgement of certainty; we
may be mistaken.</p>
                  <p>Is every elect infant then actually sanctified and united unto Christ
in and by baptisme?</p>
                  <p>We must here also distinguish of elect infants baptized, whereof some
die in their infancy, and never come to the use of reason; others God
hath appointed to live &amp; enjoy the ordinary means of faith &amp; salvation.</p>
                  <p>What is to be thought of elect infants that die in their infancy, &amp; have
no other outward means of salvation but their baptisme?</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse in all those the inward grace is united to the outward
signs, and the holy Ghost doth as truly, and really, and actually apply
the merits and bloud of Christ in the justifying and sanctifying vertue
unto the soul of the elect infant, as the minister doth the water to its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the invisible grace of the Sacrament is conveyed to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means.</p>
                  <p>But how can an infant be capable of the grace of the Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Very well;<note place="margin">How infants may be capable of the grace of the Sacrament.</note> though infants be not capable of the grace of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by that way whereby the growne are, by hearing, conceiving,
beleeving; yet it followeth not that infants are not capable in and by
another way. It is easie to distinguish between the gift conveyed, and
the manner of conveying it; faith is not of absolute necessity to all
Gods elect, but only to those to whom God affords means of beleeving.
It is the application of Christs righteousnesse that justifieth us, not
our apprehending it; God can supply the defect of faith by his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirit which can doe all things on our part in the room of
faith, which faith should doe: Doe we not know that the sin of <hi>Adam</hi>
is imputed to children, and they defiled by it, though they be not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to understand it? even so the righteousnesse of Christ may be,
and is by Gods secret and unknown way to elect infants; and so to
those that are born deaf, and fools, not capable of understanding: for
though God tieth us to means, yet not himself; he that hath said of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<hi>to the belongs the kingdome of God,</hi> knows how to settle upon them
the title of the Kingdome; and we have no reason to think, but that
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55421:214"/>
even before or in, at or by the act of Baptisme the Spirit of Christ doth
unite the soul of the elect infant to Christ, and cloath it with his
righteousnesse, and impute unto it the title of a son or daughter by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
and the image of God by sanctification, and so fit it for the
state of glory.</p>
                  <p>But what is to be thought of the effect of Baptisme in those elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
whom God hath appointed to live to years of discretion?</p>
                  <p>In them we have no warrant to promise constantly an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
work to whom God intends to afford ordinary meanes;<note place="margin">What benefit elect infants that live to years have by Baptisme for the present.</note> for
though God doe sometimes sanctifie from the wombe as in <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
and <hi>John Baptist,</hi> sometime in Baptisme as he pleaseth, yet it is hard
to affirm (as some doe) that every elect infant doth ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or in Baptisme receive initiall regeneration, and the seed of
faith and grace: For if there were such a habit of grace then infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
it could not be so utterly lost or secreted as never to shew it
self but by being attained by new instruction. But we may rather
deem and judge that Baptisme is not actually effectuall to justifie
and sanctifie, untill the party doe beleeve and embrace the promises.</p>
                  <p>Is not Baptisme then for the most part a vain empty shew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of shadowes without the substance, and a signe without
the thing signified?</p>
                  <p>No; it is always an effectuall seal to all those that are heirs of
the Covenant of grace, the promises of God touching Justification,
Remission, Adoption are made and sealed in Baptisme to every elect
child of God, then to be actually enjoyed when the party baptized
shall actually lay hold upon them by faith: Thus Baptisme to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
elect infant is a seal of the righteousnesse of Christ to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
applyed by the holy Ghost, if it die in its infancy; to be
apprehended by faith, if it live to yeares of discretion. So that as
Baptisme administred to those of years is not effectuall unlesse they
beleeve, so we can make no comfortable use of our Baptisme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
in our infancy untill we beleeve. The righteousnesse of
Christ and all the promises of grace were in my Baptisme estated
upon me and sealed up unto me on Gods part; but then I come to
have the profit and benefit of them, when I come to understand
what grant God in Baptisme hath sealed unto me, and actually to
lay hold upon it by faith.</p>
                  <p>Explain this more clearly.</p>
                  <p>We know that an estate may be made unto an infant, and in his
infancy he hath right unto it, though not actuall possession of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
such years; now the time of the childs incapability, the use and
comfort of this estate is lost indeed, but the right and title is not vain
and empty, but true and reall, and stands firmely secured unto the
child to be claimed what time soever he is capable of it. Even so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
elect have Christ and all his benefits sealed up unto them in
the Sacrament of Baptisme, yet through their uncapablenesse they have
not actuall fruition of them, untill God give them actuall faith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them: Is Baptisme lost then which is administred in our
infancy? was it a vain and an empty Ceremony? no, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and an effectuall Sacrament, and Gods invisible graces were truly
sealed up under visible signs: And though the use and the comfort
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55421:215"/>
of Baptisme be not for the present enjoyed by the infant, yet by the
parent it is who beleeves Gods promises for himselfe and for his
seed, and so by the whole Congregation, and the things then done
shall be actually effectuall to the infant, when ever it shall be capable
to make use of them.</p>
                  <p>But are there not some who utterly deny the baptizing of infants to
be warrantable?<note place="margin">The lawfulness of infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes; but not to insist upon answering their peevish arguments,
sufficient and clear ground for the practise of our Church in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
may both be pickt out of that which hath been spoken before;
and further evidenced by these following arguments.</p>
                  <p>1. The first we draw from the use of Circumcision in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
which answereth to Baptisme; yet that was applied to the
infant the eight day: there can be no reason given to deprive infants
of Baptisme, but that which may be given against Circumcision, the
main whereof is their incapablenesse of the grace of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>2. To them to whom the Covenant belongs, to them belongs the
seal of the Covenant that confirms the right unto them; but to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of faithfull parents the Covenant belongs: To you and to your
children are the promises made, saith <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 39. and to them
belongs the Kingdome of God: if the thing it self, then the sign and
seal of it. And the Apostle saith, Your children are holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.
there is a foederall sanctity, or externall and visible holinesse at least in
children of beleeving parents, and they are to be judged of the true
flock of Christ untill they shew the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but it is objected that they doe not beleeve, which is in the Scripture
required of those that are to be baptized, that they make profession of
their faith?</p>
                  <p>3. The Scripture requiring faith in the party to be baptized, speaks
of grown men; when the Apostle gives a rule that none should eat
but those that labour, it were monstrous from thence to deny meat to
children or impotent persons: besides, it is not simply an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
speech to call the infant of beleeving parents a Beleever; our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
reckoneth them among Beleevers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6. he took a child and
said, Whosoever offendeth one of these little ones that beleeve in me;
what doe we deem of Christian infants? is there no difference between
them and Pagans? Certainly as it were hard to call them Infidels, so it
were not harsh to cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Beleevers. And further it is the received judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Church, that the faith of the parents (or of those that in
stead of parents present the child in the Congregation) is so far the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
as to give him right unto the Covenant. And lastly, as we have
said before, the Spirit of God in elect infants supplies the room of
faith: and however it be, <hi>Adams</hi> corruption cannot be more effectuall
to pollute the infant, then Christs bloud and innocency is to sanctifie
them; and Gods wisdome wants not means to apply it, though wee
cannot attain unto the manner.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> urge we have no rule in Scripture for bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
infants, nor example?</p>
                  <p>4. But doe we read any thing in Scripture that may infringe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Church therein? nay, doe not the Scriptures afford many
friendly proofs by consequence of it? we read of such an one baptized,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55421:215"/>
and all his houshold, the house of <hi>Lydia,</hi> of the Jaylor, of <hi>Crispus,</hi> of
<hi>Stephanus,</hi> &amp;c. why should we imagine that there were no infants
there, or that they were left out? And if the Scriptures not expressing
directly the baptizing of infants, were sufficient reason why that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be denyed them, then by the same reason the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper should be denyed to women; for (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance)
it is not expressed in all the new Testament, that any woman
did partake of it; which thing yet were senslesse to doubt of.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the lawfulnesse of infants baptisme: But is baptisme
of absolute necessity to salvation?</p>
                  <p>Baptisme,<note place="margin">Baptisme not of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> as we have seen, is a high Ordinance of God, and a means
whereby he hath appointed to communicate Christ and his benefits to
our souls; and therefore not to be neglected or sleightly esteemed, but
used with all reverence and thankfull devotion when it may be had;
yet where God denieth it either in regard of the shortnesse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
life, or by any other unavoidable necessity; there comes no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the want of the Sacraments, but only from the contempt of
them.</p>
                  <p>Who are here to be confuted?</p>
                  <p>First, the Papists, who have contrived in their own wicked brains a
room near hell which they call (<hi>Limbus infantum</hi>) a receptacle for the
souls of infants which die without Baptisme; and whereas they fain
they are deprived of Gods presence, and never partake of joy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse:
a dream not worthy the confuting, being not onely uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but impious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, many ignorant people amongst us, who for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
teaching harbour in their minds such Popish conceipts, especially
that Baptisme doth conferre grace upon all by the work done, (for
they commonly look no higher) and they conceive a kind of inherent
vertue, and Christendome (as they call it) necessarily infused into chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by having the water cast upon their faces: hence the minister is
oft posted for to baptize in a private chamber, to the dishonour of that
Ordinance: and which is more intolerable, in case of the want of a
Minister, women will undertake to be Baptizers, which is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
prophanation of so high a service.</p>
                  <p>How may these errors of opinion and practise be avoided?</p>
                  <p>They proceed from grosse ignorance, and therefore the means to
cure them is to be informed in the right nature and use of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in the extent and limitation of the necessity of them.</p>
                  <p>How may that be done?</p>
                  <p>Wee must know that Sacraments properly doe not give us any
right unto God and his Christ, but onely seale up and confirm that
right and interest which already wee have in Gods Covenant and
promise: God promised to <hi>Adam</hi> life, and then he gave him the Tree
of life to be a pledge of his promise; It was not the Tree of life that
gave <hi>Adam</hi> life, but the promise. <hi>Adam</hi> might have lived by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
without the Tree; but the Tree could doe him no good without
the promise. Thus God promiseth Christ and his benefits to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and to their seed, and then he gives us Baptisme to seale these
promises; it is not Baptisme that saves us, but the promises; it is not
water that purgeth our sins, but the bloud of the Covenant: why then
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55421:216"/>
was the Sacrament added? for our weaknesse to be a strengthening to
our faith, not to give any strength or efficacy to the Covenant made
in the bloud of Christ: Gods Word is as sure as his bond, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is as effectuall as his seal, and shall as surely be accomplished; the
Sacraments onely give strength to our faith in apprehending it.</p>
                  <p>What infer you from this?</p>
                  <p>That where God is pleased to dispense his seals and Sacraments, they
are great comforts and pledges of his love; and to despise or sleight
them were a horrible sleighting even of the Covenant it selfe. But
where he denieth means and opportunity of enjoying the signes, the
things signified are never the farther off, or lesse effectuall. It is said,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. that the uncircumcised should be cut off from Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
because he had broke the Covenant, but it is meant onely of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and wilfull refusing of Circumcision; for the people of God
in the wildernesse were forty years without the outward sign of
Circumcision, they were not without the inward grace. <hi>Davids</hi>
child died the seventh day, a day before the time appointed for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and yet both his words and his cariage expresse that he
doubted not of the salvation of it: so the theef upon the Crosse belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Christ, was received with Christ into Paradise, though he
were never baptized; hee had the inward grace of Baptisme, the
washing of the bloud of Christ, though not the outward signe:
when God affordeth means wee must wait upon him for a blessing
in them, and by them; when he doth not afford means we must not
tie the working of his grace to them: God who sanctifieth some
in the womb, knows how to sanctifie all his elect infants, and by
his Spirit apply the merits of Christ unto them without the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
water. Some have the outward signe and not the inward grace,
some have the outward sign and the inward grace, some have the
inward grace and not the outward sign; we must not commit I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
by deifying the outward element; the rule will hold, It is
not the want of the Sacraments, but the contempt or wilfull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of them that is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>What other errors of opinion and practise doe you observe about
Baptisme?</p>
                  <p>As some through ignorance and superstition have too high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of the outward signs,<note place="margin">Baptisme to be highly accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</note> so others through ignorance and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
have too mean and base an opinion of them: some there are who
esteem of Baptisme as of a meer Ecclesiasticall ceremony and Church
complement, as if there were no serious vertue or efficacy in it, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be expected by it, or had no other use, but to give the childe a
name, and there is an end, they look no further.</p>
                  <p>How doth it appear that some have so sleight an opinion of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance?</p>
                  <p>By their answerable practises,<note place="margin">That many have a slight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of this Ordinance.</note> such as these and the like: 1. Often
Baptism is deferred and that upon every trifling occasion, as if it were
a businesse of no great weight and moment, but might attend every
ones leisure, and many times through delay the child dieth without
it; which though it doth nothing prejudice the childes salvation,
yet it will lie heavy upon the parents conscience for neglecting Gods
Ordinance when he afforded opportunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:55421:216"/>
2. Often the Minister is sent for home to perform that service with few
in a private chamber, when no eminent necessity urgeth, to the dishonour
of so sacred a businesse, which ought to bee a most solemne and publike
action of the whole Congregation</p>
                  <p>3. Though the child be brought to Church, yet often some by-day is
chosen, and not the Lords Sabbath; and it is then done as if it were only
womens worke to be present at Baptisme, who have most leisure to spend
time about matters of smaller consequence.</p>
                  <p>4. If it be on the Sabbath, then the maine care and preparation is about
matters of outward pomp and state, every thing is fitted and prepared for
the purpose, but onely that which should chiefely be, <hi>viz.</hi> the hearts and
mindes of those that goe about a businesse of that nature.</p>
                  <p>5. While the Sacrament is in performing the demeanor of many, shew
that they have a slight opinion of that service, some turning their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, &amp; going out of the Church so soon as sermon is done, as if the word
was worth the minding, but not the Sacrament; others prating and talking
all the while, as if there were nothing for them to learne by, but no duty
for them to performe in that action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Lastly, infants are brought to the Sacrament of Baptisme in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
but are never by their parents taught the doctrine of Baptisme when
they come to years of understanding, Baptisme is not made use of, as
it ought, in the whole course of mens lives; these things shew that men
commonly have a meane conceit of this Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>What is the best way to reforme these irreligious practises?</p>
                  <p>A serious pondering &amp; considering of the high dignity of this divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
<note place="margin">What are the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this slight esteeme.</note> that wil cause a devout &amp; reverent demeanor in that holy busines.</p>
                  <p>1. Every one should consider that it is no customary formallity, but an
honourable ordinance instituted by the lawful authority of God himselfe,
who never imposed any service upon his Church in vain. It was honoured
by our Saviour Christ himself, who sanctified it unto us by submitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it in his owne sacred person, confirmed by his practise, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. Every one should consider, that there are infinite mercies sealed up
by it to the faithful, and to their seed. It is a visible admittance of thy child
(if thou beest a Parent) into the Congregation of Christs flock, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its interest in the heavenly Ierusalem which is above: Is this a busines
to be mumbled over in a corner? Christ came from <hi>Galile</hi> to <hi>Jordan</hi> to
be baptized; is the receiving of thy child into the bosome of the Church
in a full Congregation, no comfort unto thee? is it not mercy to see the
bloud of Christ ministerially sealed up unto thy Infant, to purge it from
that pollution which it hath brought into the world with it, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> also thou
makest confession of by presenting it to this mysteriall washing? Is it not
joy to thy heart, to heare the whole Congregation of Gods Saints pray
for thy childe; and that God hath honoured thee so much, as to count
thy very childe holy and within his Covenant? thinke on these things.</p>
                  <p>3. Every one that is present at Baptisme should consider, that that being
a publike action of the Congregation, every particular person ought reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
to joyn in it. Shal the whole Trinity be present at Baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. &amp;
we be gone? joyn ought every one in prayer to God for the Infant, joyn in
praises to God for his mercy, that we, and our children are brought forth,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55421:217"/>
and brought up within the pale of his Church, whereas the rest of the
world are like a wildernesse: and thank God for adding at the present a
member to his Church; joyn every one ought in meditation of the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of nature, of the blessed means of redemption by Christ, of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
benefits that God seals up unto us in our Baptism, even before we knew
them; of the vowes and promises which we in our child-hood made by
those who were undertakers for us, and finding our failings every time
we are present at Baptism we should renew our own Covenant with God,
and labour to get new strength to close with his promises, which in our
Baptism he made unto us. Thus if we were wise to make a right use of it
we might learn as much at a Baptisme as at a Sermon.</p>
                  <p>4. Parents should alwayes bear in mind the promises which their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have made to God by them, and they for their children, labouring
to bring them up accordingly in the instruction and information of the
Lord, teaching them (so soon as they understand) the meaning of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
unfolding unto them Gods precious promises, and their strict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.
The negligence of parents herein, is a cause of monstrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanesse
in many, they bring children t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> receive Christs badge, but bring
them up to the service of the Divell; and God hath not so much dishonour
by Heathens and Pagans, as by those who have taken upon them the name
of Christians. Lastly, Baptisme should be of continuall use thorough a
Christians whole life: it is administred but once, but it is always lasting in
the vertue and efficacy of it. Baptism loseth not its strength by time; in all
thy feares and doubts look backe to thy Baptisme, the promises of God
sealed up unto thee there, now lay hold on them by faith, and thou shalt
have the actuall comfort of thy Baptisme, and feele the effect of it,
though thou never saw it. In thy failings, slips, and revolts, to recover thy
self have recourse to thy Baptism, new Baptism shall not need, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and seale of God stands firme, he changeth not; onely renew thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
renew thy faith in those blessed promises of grace which were
sealed up unto thee in thy Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>So much for Baptisme: What is the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p>It is the second Sacrament of the new Testament,<note place="margin">Of the Lords Supper, and what it is.</note> wherein God by the
signes of bread and wine signifieth sensibly, and exhibiteth to every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
receiver the body and bloud of Christ, for his spirituall nourishment
and growth in Christ, and for so sealing unto him his continuance, with
increase in the body of Christ, which is his Church, confirmeth him in the
Covenant of grace. Or thus: It is a Sacrament of the Gospel, wherein by
the outward elements of Bread and Wine, sanctified and exhibited
by the Minister, and rightly received by the communicant, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is given to those that are ingraffed into Christ, of their continuance
in him, and receiving nourishment by him unto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Are there divers graces offered to us in Baptisme and the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p>No, the Covenant solemnly ratified in Baptisme is renewed in the
Lords Supper, between the Lord himselfe and the receiver, and the same
graces offered again, but to divers ends: In Baptisme, to the investing and
entring of us into Christianity, (for of that entrance Baptisme is a seale:)
In the Lords Supper, to the nourishing and continuance of us in
it, of which growth and continuance in Christiannity it is a
seale: And therefore as unto the Sacrament of Baptisme, so unto
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55421:217"/>
this of the Lords Supper, the Popish faigned Sacrament of confirmation
is notably injurious.</p>
                  <p>Wherein then doth Baptisme differ from the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p>1. In regard of the thing signified,<note place="margin">The difference between Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> Baptisme (as hath been said) is a seale
of our entrance into the Church of God; the Supper of the Lord of our
continuance in the same; the one of our new birth, the other of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
food: The former is ordained to this end, that being out of Christ
by nature, we might by the Sacrament of our new birth be ingraffed into
his body, <hi>Titus 3. 5. John</hi> 3. 5. the latter, that being in Christ by grace,
we might continue and increase in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. &amp; 11. 23. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>2. In regard of the outward signe; water in the one, bread and wine in
the other.</p>
                  <p>3. In regard of the Communicants: Vnto Baptisme both Infants, and
those that are of yeares of discretion are to be admitted; but unto the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord, only those of yeares of discretion.</p>
                  <p>4. In regard of the time; The Supper of the Lord is to be received as
often as the Lord shall give occasion, Baptisme but once.</p>
                  <p>VVhy is this called the Lords Supper, seeing we use not to make it a
Supper?</p>
                  <p>It is called the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. not because he appointed
it a Supper to us;<note place="margin">Why it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Supper.</note> but because our Lord Iesus Christ sitting at his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ordained it in stead of the Passeover; for in the night that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. imediately after he had eaten the Passeover with his
Disciples, he did both himselfe with them celebrate this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, &amp;c. and withall, gave charge for continuance of the same
in the Church untill his second comming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20.</p>
                  <p>What may we learne by this; that both our Saviour Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
likewise administred this Sacrament after Supper?</p>
                  <p>That we must not come unto it for our bellies, but have our minds lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up from these earthly elements to our Saviour Christ represented by
them; for men after Supper set not bread and wine, but banquetting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
upon the Table; which serveth to reprove,</p>
                  <p>1. Such prophane persons as come for a draught of VVine only.</p>
                  <p>2. Those that rest only in the outward Elements.</p>
                  <p>But doth not the example of our Saviour Christ and his Apostles tye us to
administer this Sacrament in the night time?</p>
                  <p>No; because they had speciall cause so to doe, which we have alone.</p>
                  <p>What cause had our Saviour so to doe?</p>
                  <p>He was to administer it after Supper:</p>
                  <p>First, because it was to come in lieu and stead of the Passeover, and
therefore was presently after the eating of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it might goe immediately before his passion, the better
to shew whereunto it should have relation; where also is another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
our Saviour Christs Supper representing his death, which followed
the Supper, and was to come, our Sacrament representing the death of
Christ already suffered and past.</p>
                  <p>What cause had the Apostles?</p>
                  <p>They did it in the night, because it was not safe for the Church to meet
in the day for feare of persecution: Wherefore, herein the laudable
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55421:218"/>
custome of the Church of administring it in the Morning, when our wits
and capacities are best, is to be followed: In which respect also there is
some difference between this Sacrament and the Sacrament of Baptisme,
which may without any inconvenience be administred in the afternoone.</p>
                  <p>What is the fittest day for the Administration of this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>The Lords day is the fitttest day for the administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For although our Saviour Christ did administer it on another day,
(for the reasons before declared) yet he did not bid us so to doe: But the
Apostles example, and religious practise herein is to be followed, which
did celebrate the Supper of the Lord on the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>So much of the time: Now for the nature of this Sacrament, how may it
be knowne?</p>
                  <p>First, by the matter; and secondly, by the forme of it.</p>
                  <p>What is the matter of the Supper of the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Partly outward,<note place="margin">Of the matter of the Lords Supper.</note> as the elements of bread and wine; partly inward, as
the body and bloud of Christ. For as many graines make but one loafe,
and many grapes but one cup of wine: so I beleeve that those outward
elements signifie Christ and him crucified, with all the benefits of his
death and passion, even whole Christ, with all the fruits of his mediation,
<hi>Mat. 26. 26, 27. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore did the Lord make choice of Bread and Wine for the outward
Elements of this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Because meaning to set forth our spirituall nourishment by them, they
are of all the meanes of our corporall nourishment the chiefest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.</p>
                  <p>Why did he not content himselfe with one of these only?</p>
                  <p>He tooke both, that he might hereby shew how plentifull and assured
redemption we have in Christ whom these doe represent. Wherefore it
is no marvell, that the Papists in the prohibiting of the cup, doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
teach our salvation to be neither wholly in Christ, nor assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly.</p>
                  <p>What Argument doe you observe in the institution of the Sacrament
against this Robbery?</p>
                  <p>The foreseeing Spirit of Christ, knowing the sacriledge that Popery
would bring in for the robbing of the people of the use of the Cup, hath
prepared a preservative against it, speaking here more fully of the cup
(which he did not of the bread) <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> Mat. 26. 27.</p>
                  <p>What Bread used our Saviour Christ?</p>
                  <p>Ordinary bread, such as was used at the common Table; at that time it
was indeed unleavened bread, but it was so, because no other was then
lawfull at the feast of the Passeover.</p>
                  <p>Are not the Bread and VVine changed into the body and bloud of Christ
in the Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>No;<note place="margin">That the bread and wine are not changed into the body and bloud of Christ.</note> they are not changed in nature, but in use, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. For the
words of eating and drinking doe properly belong to the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of bread and wine, and by a borrowed speech doe improperly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the body and bloud of Christ, to note unto us the communion we
have with our Saviour Christ, of whom we are as verily partakers by a
lively faith, as of the bread and wine, by eating and drinking them: And
thus we say, that these elements are changed in use; because being sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55421:218"/>
from a common use, they are consecrate to signe and seale to us
our spirituall nourishment and growth by the body and bloud of Christ
Iesus, <hi>Luke 22. 19. 1 Cor. 10</hi> 3, 4. For as the Sacrament of Baptisme
doth seale to us a spirituall regeneration; so the Lords Supper a spirituall
feeding; and even as well the body and bloud of Christ is in Baptisme
given us for cloathing, as they are given in the Lords Supper for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment:
Therefore the bread and wine are not the true body and
bloud of Christ, but the signes and tokens of them, as in Baptisme
the water was onely a signe of Christs bloud, not the bloud.</p>
                  <p>What further reason have you to overthrow the carnall presence of Christ
in the Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>1. If the bread were turned into Christ, then there should bee two
Christs, one that giveth, another that is given: for our Saviour Christ
gave the bread, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. If the bread be the very body of Christ, there should then bee no
signe of the thing signified, and so no Sacrament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Where their
miserable shift, that the whitenesse is the seale and signe, is not worthy the
answer.</p>
                  <p>3. The wicked receiver might then eate and drinke Christs body and
bloud, as well as any true beleever, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 2. 30.</p>
                  <p>4. The Minister cannot give the inward grace, but the outward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the administration of the Sacrament, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>What reason was there to move our Saviour Christ to use such a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
speech in this so great a mysterie?</p>
                  <p>Because it is ordinary and usuall in the Scripture, to give the name of
the thing signed and signified to the signe: as it is called the tree of life,
which was but a signe of life <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 9. So in the Sacraments of the old
Testament, Circumcision is called the Covenant, <hi>Gen. 17</hi> 10. that is,
the token of Covenant, <hi>verse</hi> 11. Or the Lambe, or Kid, the Passeover,
whereof it was a signe onely, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. The selfe same manner of speech
is also used in the new Testament of Baptisme called the new Birth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of sinnes, whereof it is onely a seale: So that unlesse the Lord
would in this Sacrament have departed from the wisdome of the Spirit
of God, accustomably received, he must needs here also tread in the same
steps of a borrowed and figurative speech.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, it may seem, that to have used a more proper speech would have
been more meet for him, being neare unto his death, and more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for their understanding.</p>
                  <p>He did after his last Supper use as figurative speeches, as this in the
14, 15, 16. of <hi>John,</hi> and that without all danger of darknesse of speech,
there being often times more light in a borrowed then in a proper speech:
And a Trope of force must be yeelded, when he saith, that the cup is the
new Testament.</p>
                  <p>It maketh further for the corporall presence, that our Saviour Christ
saith in his supper, that his body was then broken, and not that it
should be broken after.</p>
                  <p>That is also usuall to the Scripture, for further certainty to speak of
things to come, as of them that are present.</p>
                  <p>But there is nothing impossible unto God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:55421:219"/>
1. The question is here not of the power, but of the will of God,
what he will have done.</p>
                  <p>2. God cannot doe those things, in doing whereof he should contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himselfe: and therefore the Scripture feareth not, without dis-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to God, to say that he cannot lye, nor cannot deny himselfe, <hi>Tit. 1. 2.
2 Tim.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>Why is the cup called the cup of the New Testament?</p>
                  <p>Because it is a seale of the promise of God, touching our salvation
in Christ, which being in old time under the Law, shadowed by the
shedding of bloud of beasts, is now after a new manner accomplished in
the bloud of Christ himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the matter of this Sacrament: wherein consisteth the
forme thereof?</p>
                  <p>Partly in the outward actions both of the Minister,<note place="margin">Of the forme of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Lords Supper.</note> and of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
partly in the inward, and spirituall things signified thereby (these
outward actions being a second seale set by the Lords owne hand unto his
covenant.)</p>
                  <p>What be the Sacramentall actions of the Minister in the Lords
Supper?</p>
                  <p>Foure:<note place="margin">The Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall actions of the Minister.</note> First, to take the bread and wine into his hand, and to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it from ordinarie bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>What doth this signifie?</p>
                  <p>That God in his eternall decree hath separated Christ from all other
men to be our Mediator, and that he was set apart to that office, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from sinners, <hi>Exod. 12. 5. Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</p>
                  <p>What is the second?</p>
                  <p>To blesse and consecrate the bread and wine, by the Word and
Prayer.</p>
                  <p>What doth that signifie?</p>
                  <p>That God in his due time sent Christ into the world, and sanctified
him, furnishing him with all gifts needfull for a Mediator.</p>
                  <p>How are the Bread and Wine to be blessed and consecrated?</p>
                  <p>By doing that which at the first institution Christ did.</p>
                  <p>What is that?</p>
                  <p>1. He declared the Doctrine of the mystery of the Sacrament unto his
Apostles,<note place="margin">Of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Bread and Wine.</note> which received it, by teaching the truth of that which these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
signes did signifie.</p>
                  <p>2. He thanked his heavenly Father for that he had so loved the world,
that he gave him which was his only Son to die for it, through the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his most holy Body, and the shedding his most precious bloud.
Also he gave him thanks for that he had ordained these outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to seale our spirituall nourishment in Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. By a trope of the chiefe part of Prayer (which is Thanksgiving) for
the whole, the Evangelist giveth to understand, that our Saviour Christ
sued to God his heavenly Father, that his death in it selfe, sufficient to
save, might by the working of his holy Spirit be effectuall to the elect; and
that those outward signes of bread and wine might through the operation
of his holy Spirit be effectuall to the purposes they were ordained unto.</p>
                  <p>How shall it be knowne that he gave thanks and prayed, for these things,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55421:219"/>
seeing there is no mention of these things in the Evangelists?</p>
                  <p>1. The very matter it selfe that is handled, doth guide us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of these things.</p>
                  <p>2. The like manner of speech in other places of Scripture, where there
being no mention what words he used, yet must needs be granted, that
he gave thanks, and prayed proportionably to the prayer and thanks here
used: For taking the Barley loaves and Fishes, and giving thanks, what can
be understood, but that he giving thanks to God, that had given
those creatures for their bodily nourishment, prayed that he would blesse
them, and make them effectuall to that purpose and end? <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 14. and
15. 36. <hi>John</hi> 6. 11. And as it is not lawfull to eat and drinke the common
meat and drinke without such prayer and thanksgiving: so is it not lawfull
to communicate these elements without thanksgiving and prayer.</p>
                  <p>So much for the second Action (which the Minister indeed perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
with the Communicants, but yet as chiefe in the action.)</p>
                  <p>What is the third?</p>
                  <p>To breake the Bread, and poure out the Wine.</p>
                  <p>What doth it signifie?</p>
                  <p>The passion and sufferings of Christ, with all the torments he endured
for our sins both in body and soule; his blessed body being bruised and
crucified, his precious bloud shed (trickling and streaming downe from
him to all parts of the ground) and his righteous soule powred out unto
death, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. &amp; 10. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. That Christ himselfe of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
offered his body to be broken, and his bloud to be shed upon the
Crosse: And that as the Bread nourisheth not, if it remaine whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken;
so there is no life for us in Christ, but in as much as he died.</p>
                  <p>What is the fourth?</p>
                  <p>To give and distribute the Bread and VVine to the Receiver.</p>
                  <p>What doth that signifie?</p>
                  <p>That God giveth Christ, and Christ himselfe to us, That Christ Iesus
with all his merits is offered to all sorts of Receivers, and that God hath
given him to the faithfull Receivers to feed their soules unto eternall life,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 15. &amp; 6. 50, 51.</p>
                  <p>What be the Sacramentall Actions of the Receivers?</p>
                  <p>They be two:<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Receivers.</note> First, to take the bread and wine offered by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
                  <p>What doth that signifie?</p>
                  <p>The receiving of Christ into our soules with all his benefits by faith.
That they and only they have benefit by Christ crucified, which thus
apply Christ to themselves by a true and lively faith, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>What is the second?</p>
                  <p>To eat the bread and drinke the wine, receiving them into the body,
and digesting them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.</p>
                  <p>VVhat doth that signifie?</p>
                  <p>Our uniting to Christ, and enjoying of him, that we must with delight
apply Christ and his merits to all the necessities of our soules, spiritually
feeding upon him, and groaning by him. For the eating of the bread to
strengthen our nature, betokeneth the inward strengthening of our soules
by grace, through the merit of the breaking of Christs body for us; and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:55421:220"/>
the drinking of the wine to cherish our bodies, betokens that the bloud
of Christ shed upon the Crosse, and (as it were) drunke by faith, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
our soules: And as God doth blesse these outward elements to
preserve and strengthen the body of the receiver: so Christ apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and received by faith doth nourish him, and preserve both body and
soule unto eternall life, <hi>John 6. 50, 51. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 3. &amp; 11. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Is Christs body and bloud, together with the outward elements received
of all Communicants?</p>
                  <p>No; for howsoever they be offered by God to all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26. yet
are they received by such alone as have the hand of faith to lay hold on
Christ; and these with the bread and wine doe spiritually receive Christ
with all his saving graces: As for the wicked, and those that come without
faith; they receive onely the outward elements, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
judgement and condemnation to themselves, <hi>verse</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p>So much for the matter and forme: Shew now the speciall ends and
uses for which the Lords Supper was ordained.</p>
                  <p>1. To call to minde and renew the memory and vertue of Christs
death,<note place="margin">The ends and uses of the Lords Supper.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24.</p>
                  <p>2. To encrease our faith, begotten by the Word preached, and to
confirme unto us our nourishment, onely thereby by the means of Christs
death.</p>
                  <p>3. To encrease our love.</p>
                  <p>4. To encrease our joy in the holy Ghost, our peace of conscience our
hope of eternall life, and all other graces of God in us.</p>
                  <p>5. To stirre us up with greater boldnesse to professe Christ, then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
we had done.</p>
                  <p>6. To quicken our hearts to all holy duties.</p>
                  <p>7. To shew our thankfulnesse to God for his mercie bestowed upon
us in Christ.</p>
                  <p>8. To make a difference betwixt our selves and the enemies of Christ.</p>
                  <p>9. To knit us more neere in good will one to another.</p>
                  <p>10. To preserve the publike Ministery of the Word and Prayer in
Christian assemblies.</p>
                  <p>Who are to be partakers in this Sacrament?<note place="margin">Who are to receive the Lords Supper.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>All baptized who are of yeeres and sound judgement to discerne the
Lords body, ought to repaire to this Sacrament. But those onely come
worthily who professing the true faith, have duely examined and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
themselves, <hi>Esa. 66. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 28. whereby all not of age and
sound judgement are shut from his Sacrament; which are not alwayes
from the other of Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>May none be admitted by the Church to the Supper of the Lord, but such
as have these things in them which God requireth at their hands?</p>
                  <p>Yes; those who having knowledge doe make profession of Religion,
and are found guilty of no great error, or crime unrepented of.</p>
                  <p>What if any thrust themselves to the Lords Table, who are ignorant or
guilty of such crimes?</p>
                  <p>They are to be kept back by the discipline of the Church.</p>
                  <p>What is to be performed by every Christian, that he may worthily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:55421:220"/>
There must be a carefull preparation before the action,<note place="margin">Of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Lords Table.</note> great heed in the whole
action, and a joyfull and thankfull cloze and shutting of it: All which must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as well by the Minister as the people. For there is great difference betwixt
our Saviour Christ, the first deliverer of this Sacrament, and all other Ministers, he
having no battel of the Spirit and flesh in him, but being always prepared unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good worke, had no need of these things; but other Ministers have as much need
thereof as the people.</p>
                  <p>How are we to prepare our selves to this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>By due search and triall of our own soules, whether we can finde in our selves the
things which God doth require in worthy Communicants.</p>
                  <p>How may we performe that?</p>
                  <p>By fitting our mindes, &amp; framing our hearts thereunto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15, 16, &amp; 11. 28</p>
                  <p>How may we sit our mindes?</p>
                  <p>By examining our wisdome and knowledge, both of Gods will in generall, and
of the nature and use of this holy Sacrament in particular, whether we can give a
reason of the representation of Christ in bread and wine, and bring the resemblance
and difference of the proportion of the bread and wine with the body and bloud of
Christ, and of the eating and drinking of the elements with the partaking of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, <hi>Rom. 4. 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 3. and 4. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>How may our hearts be framed for the feeling of the vertue and power of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
                  <p>1. By weighing with our selves what need we have of it, and what benefit we
may reape by it.</p>
                  <p>2. By examining of our faith, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. and repentance, <hi>Heb. 10.
22. Iames</hi> 4. 8. attended with true love of God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. and of our brethren,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 14.</p>
                  <p>3. By servent invocation, praying for a blessing upon this Ordinance of God,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26, 26.</p>
                  <p>How may we finde what need we have of this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Partly by our wretched estate by nature, and partly by our weak estate by grace.</p>
                  <p>What may we finde by our estate by nature?</p>
                  <p>That being prone to all evill, we had need of this Sacrament to nourish and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the life of grace new begun, which otherwise by our own corruption might
dye or decay in us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                  <p>What need have we of this Sacrament for reliefe of our weak estate by grace?</p>
                  <p>That being weak in understanding and feeble in memory, we may by the signes
of Bread and Wine have our understanding bettered, and memory confirmed in the
death of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 26.</p>
                  <p>What further need may we finde of it?</p>
                  <p>That being fraile in faith, and cold in love, we may by the same creatures, as by
seales and pledges have our faith further strengthned, and our love more enflamed
to God and Gods children.</p>
                  <p>What benefit then may we reape by the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p>We see already that the benefit is great: this Sacrament being as a glasse for the
mind, a monument for the memory, a support of faith, a provocation to love, a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to obedience, and a signe and seal of all the mercies of God in Christ Iesus.</p>
                  <p>How must the heart be prepared to finde the power of this Sacrament for supply of
these wants and obteining of these benefits?</p>
                  <p>The heart must be purged by repentance and purified by faith, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 14 16. 21.
Acts</hi> 15. 9.</p>
                  <p>How may the heart be purified by faith?</p>
                  <p>If I have not only knowledge what Christ hath done for his chosen, but a full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that whatsoever he hath done, he hath done it for me as well as for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
1 <hi>Cor. 2. 2. Iohn 17. 3. Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>What gather you hence?</p>
                  <p>That they onely are to present themselves at the Lords Table, who after their
baptisme are able to make a profession of the true faith, and can finde that they truly
believe in Christ; seeing ignorant and unbelieving persons do rather eat and drink
their own judgement, than reap any benefit by this Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29, 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>How may thy heart be purged by repentance?</p>

If from my heart I do repent of my particular sins past, and judge my selfe for
them, bewailing and forsaking them, and frame the rest of my life according to
Gods will, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 30, 31. Gal.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>What learne you hence?</p>
                  <p>That it is dangerous for such as remaine in their old sins, or after the Sacrament
return unto them; once to offer themselves to the Lords Table, forasmuch as by this
means they procure the wrath of God against them, and those that belong unto
them, although not in condemnation in the world to come (which the faithfull
notwithstanding their unworthy receiving cannot come unto) yet to fearefull
plagues and judgements in this world.</p>
                  <p>It is not meet that we be free from all malice in our hearts when we come to the Lords
Supper?</p>
                  <p>Yes it is: for this Sacrament is a seal both of our conjunction with Christ, and of
our society one with another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. and we must know that true repentance
purgeth out malice, amongst other sins; and a sound faith worketh by love towards
God and out Brethren, <hi>Mat. 5. 22, 23. Iames 1. 19, 20, 21. 1 Pet. 2. 1. Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>So much for examination and preparation required before the action.</p>
                  <p>What is to be done by the communicant in the present action?</p>
                  <p>1. They are to use reverent attention, the better to apply the whole action, hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the doctrine of the Sacrament delivered by the Minister, joyning with him
in his prayers, making use of all the sacramentall actions, and so commemorating the
Lords death, for the comfort and refreshing of their own souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17. 26.</p>
                  <p>2. According as it is commanded, all must take the Bread and Wine into their
hands, contrary to the superstition of divers, which will have it thrust either into
their mouthes, or else take it with their gloves, as if the hand of a Christian, which
God hath both made and sanctified, were not as fit as the skin of a Beast, which the
Artificer hath tanned and sewed.</p>
                  <p>3. They must moreover, according to the Commandement of Christ, eat and
drink the Bread and Wine, not laying or hanging it up, or worshipping it, as the
papists doe.</p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, they must use thanksgiving, offering up themselves both souls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as a sacrifice of thanks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. in which regard this Sacrament is called
the Eucharist.</p>
                  <p>What is to be done after the action?</p>
                  <p>1. We must by and by use joyfull thanksgiving,<note place="margin">What du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after the action.</note> with prayer and meditation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so comforted in heart in the favour of God towards us, that we be ready with
a feeling joy to sing a Psalme unto the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 30.</p>
                  <p>2. We must continually endeavour to finde an increase of our faith in Christ, love
to God and all his Saints, power to subdue sin, and practice obedience, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sanctifying and saving graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. &amp; 11, 21. <hi>Col. 2 6, 7. 2 Pet. 3.
18.</hi> For a true believer shall feele in himself after the receiving of the Sacrament an
encrease of faith and sanctification, a further deading of the old man, and so a
greater measure of dying unto sin; a further strength of the new man, and so a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care to live in newnesse of life, and to walk the more strongly and steadily in the
wayes of God all the dayes of his life, this being a Sacrament not of our incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as Baptisme, but of our growth; which albeit one cannot alwayes discerne
immediately after the action, yet between that and the next Communion it may be
easily espied in our service towards God and men.</p>
                  <p>What if a man after the receiving of the Sacrament never find any such thing in himself?</p>
                  <p>He may well suspect himself whether he did ever repent or not, and therefore is to
use means to come to sound faith &amp; repentance: For the Lord is not usually want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his ordinances, if men prepare their hearts to meet him in them. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no good, no refreshment at this spirituall feast, if God send us away empty,
either it is because we have no right unto his mercies, being not in Christ, and so not
accepted; or because some secret unmortified lust remaineth in us, like <hi>Achans</hi> wedge
of gold: so some beloved sin (either not seen, or not sufficiently sorrowed for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
against) lyeth glowing in the heart, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> causeth God to frown upon our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
&amp; like a dead flye causeth the ointment to stink: &amp; therfore in this case, a man
should descend into himself, &amp; make a more strict search into his conscience, that he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55421:221"/>
may againe come before the Lord with more humilty, and better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse,
and God will reveale himself in due time to every one who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
seeketh after him in his ordinances.</p>
                  <p>So much of the Sacraments: What are the Censures?</p>
                  <p>They are the judgements of the Church for ratification of the threates
of the Gospell against the abusers of the Word and Sacraments.<note place="margin">Of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What doe these Censures profit the Church of God?</p>
                  <p>Very much; for by them the godly having strayed from the course of
sincerity, are through obedience brought home againe: But the wicked are
hardened by them through disobedience; whereof it is, that the wicked
are properly said to be punished, the godly only chastened and corrected.</p>
                  <p>But it seemeth that corrections rather belong to Magistrates then to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters?</p>
                  <p>The Magistrates by the Lawes of the Common-wealth punish some
by death, others by other torments, and some by purse, which belongeth
not to the Minister, who hath to doe only with the soule: And these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
censures are of as necessary use in the Church, both to help the godly,
and to restrain and root out the wicked out of the Church, as those penall
Lawes of the Magistrate in the Common-wealth. They therefore who
upon this pretence, that God forceth no man to come unto him, suppose
the censures to be unprofitable, are like unto children that will have no
rod in the house.</p>
                  <p>Whereby doth the necessity of Censures appeare?</p>
                  <p>Easily; for sith in the Church of God there be of all sorts, as in a net
cast into the sea, which catcheth good and bad: It is impossible (without
correction) to keep good order in the Church, especially to restraine the
wicked hypocrites from offending, and thereby slandering their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>If then there were no hypocrites, there were no use of Censures?</p>
                  <p>Not so; but the serve most of all for them that make no conscience
of their calling: For the best man that is, having some sparkes of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
corruption remaining unregenerate, may fall and offend; and therefore
must be chastened by the Church: But this is the difference, the godly
falling by infirmity, by correction doe amend, but the wicked offending
purposely, by punishment are hardened.</p>
                  <p>What is to be gathered of this?</p>
                  <p>That sith censures are as needfull in the Church; as the rod in the
house, or the Magistrates sword in the Common-wealth for offendors,
(yea and of so much more use as these are for the body, and this life, and
the other for the soule and life to come) they that set themselves against
them care not what disorder there be in the Church, but seek to exempt
themselves from punishment, that they might doe what they list, and
make the Gospel a covert for all their wickednesse, who are like to them
in the second Psalme, that would not beare the yoake of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>So much for the use and necessity of Censures: What is the doctrine of
them especially delivered?</p>
                  <p>In the 18 chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew;</hi> from the 15 verse to the 20. where
both their institution and ratification is laid downe: For first our Saviour
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55421:222"/>
declareth the degrees of the censures ordained for such as are called bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
(which are generally corrections according to the greatnesse of the
offences) and then treateth of their power and authority.</p>
                  <p>What is to be observed in the degrees of the censures?</p>
                  <p>That the censures be according to the offences;<note place="margin">Of the degrees of Censures.</note> as if the offence be
private the censure thereof must be private, wherein the censurer is to
deale circumspectly; 1. That he know the offence. 2. That he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the offender secretly. 3. That he do it in love, convincing his offence
so to be, by the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>What further duty is required of us in this case?</p>
                  <p>1. That we runne not to others to slander the offenders, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
forbiddeth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 16.</p>
                  <p>2. Not to keep the injury in minde, of purpose afterwards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it.</p>
                  <p>3. Not to deale roughly with one under pretence of seeking the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God.</p>
                  <p>4. Not to despise the offender, but by all means to seek his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Who are to be admonished openly in the Church?</p>
                  <p>Those that sin openly.</p>
                  <p>What if they will not amend by admonition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then they are by suspension to be barred for a time from some exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Religion: and if by that they will not amend, then they are by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
to be cut off from the Church, and delivered unto Satan,
as shall be declared.</p>
                  <p>How are the Censures ratified, and the authority of the Church confirmed
by our Saviour Christ?</p>
                  <p>That appeareth by his words unto his Disciples, <hi>Matth. 18. 18. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you bind on earth,</hi> (meaning according to the rule) <hi>shall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and whatsoever you loose in earth shall be loosed in heaven:</hi> which is as
much as if a Prince giving authority to one of small reputation, should bid
him execute justice, he would beare him out.</p>
                  <p>How is this further proved?</p>
                  <p>It is further confirmed in the verse following by a reason of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<hi>If two or three shall agree upon any thing, and shall aske it in my name, it
shall be granted:</hi> If Christ will ratifie the deed of two or three done in his
name, how much more then that which the whole Church shall doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why is it said,</hi> And shall aske it in my name?</p>
                  <p>To declare that by prayer unto God in the name of our Saviour Christ
all the Censures of the Church, but especially Excommunication, should
be undertaken, as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. When you are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> (that is, calling upon his name)
<hi>deliver such an one unto Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What need is there of this ratifying of the Churches authority in exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Censures?</p>
                  <p>Because some doe contemne the Censures of the Church, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from men onely, as if thereby they were no whit debarred from
the favour of God; whereas neverthelesse whom the Church
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55421:222"/>
separateth from the outward seales, them also Christ depriveth of the
inward graces, banishing them from his kingdome, whom the Church
hath given over to Satan.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That men should not slightly shake off, but with reverence esteeme
the censures of the Church, as the voice of God himselfe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be never so high and stout, yet are they to subject
themselves to the judgement of God in the Church, unlesse they will
set themselves against the Lord himself.</p>
                  <p>We have heard of the generall doctrine of censures: What are the kinds
of them?<note place="margin">Of the kindes of Censures.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are either of soveraigne medicine, <hi>Matth. 18. 15, 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 5.
or of fearfull revenge, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. Iam. 1. 14. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 14. the former
properly are corrections, the latter punishments.</p>
                  <p>What are the medicinall censures?</p>
                  <p>They are such as serve to bring men to repentance, the principall end of
the, next the glory of God, being the salvation of his soul that is censured.</p>
                  <p>What things are required of them that doe execute these censures against
any man?</p>
                  <p>Six: 1. Wisdome. 2. Freedome from the sin reproved. 3. Love.
4. Sorrow. 5. Patience, and 6. prayer for the party.</p>
                  <p>Of what sorts are the medicinall Censures?</p>
                  <p>They are either in word, or in deed.</p>
                  <p>What are they in word?</p>
                  <p>The chidings &amp; rebukes of the Church for sin w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we call Admonitions.</p>
                  <p>How many sorts of admonitions are there?</p>
                  <p>Two:<note place="margin">Private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> the first is private betwixt Brother and Brother, <hi>Levit. 19. 17.
Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16. the other publick by the Minister assisted by the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
when the private will not prevaile <hi>Mat. 18. 17. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>What are we to observe in the private admonitions?</p>
                  <p>That we should watch one another diligently, witnessing thereby our
mutuall love which God requires of us; as if any man seeing another
(whose journey he knoweth) wander out of the way, if he should not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
him he might justly be accounted unnaturall; much more we,
knowing all men think to journey towards heaven, if we see any go the
wrong waies (as by Robberies, Adulteries, Vsury, Swearing, or Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
and do not admonish them, are even guilty of their wandring, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
sith the other belongeth to the body, but this both to body &amp; soul.</p>
                  <p>But is it not sufficient for men to watch themselves, seeing every man
standeth or falleth to God?</p>
                  <p>Such was the wicked answer of <hi>Cain,</hi> and they that use it are like unto
him: but if God commanded in the law to help our enemies Oxe or Asse
having need of help, we are more bound by the law of charity to helpe
himself; and unlesse we reprove him, we are partakers of his sin, (as hath
bin said) which we ought not to be, because we have enough of our own.</p>
                  <p>What are the degrees of private admonitions?</p>
                  <p>They be two;<note place="margin">The degrees of private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> the former is most private done by one, the other is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
also, but more publick then the first, and it is done by two or three at
the most, whereof he that first admonisheth must be one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:55421:223"/>
Why hath our Saviour Christ limited us with these degrees?</p>
                  <p>By all means to win the offender, if it be possible; if not, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
may appeare to be most just, after so many warnings.</p>
                  <p>How is the first degree of private admonition expressed?</p>
                  <p>If thy brother offend against thee, or in thy knowledge onely, tell him
between thee and him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
                  <p>Are we bound to reprove all men of what profession soever?</p>
                  <p>No; but him that is of the same profession of Christianity that we be
of, whom the Scripture termeth a brother (thereby shutting forth Iewes,
Turks, Hereticks, and Atheists) except we have some particular bond, as
of a master to his servant, or father to his child, or magistrate to his subject</p>
                  <p>What learn you thereby?</p>
                  <p>1. That we observe this in our admonitions, that he be a brother whom
we admonish, and not such a one as is a scorner.</p>
                  <p>2. That we are not to make light of, or contemn the admonitions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but to accept of them, and account of them as a pretious balme.</p>
                  <p>How must we reprove our brothers fault?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">How we must reprove.</note> we must be sure that it is a fault we reprove him for, and then we
must be able to convince him thereof out of the Word of God, so that he
shall not be able to gainsay us, unlesse he doe it contemptuously; it being
better for us not to reprove him, then not to be able to convince him by
the Word, of that we have reproved him in. Lastly, we ought to doe it
with all love and mildnesse, regarding the circumstances of persons, time,
and place, not inconsiderately, nor of hatred, or to reproach him, or as one
that is glad of somewhat to hurt his good name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is meant by</hi> Tell him between thee and him? <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
                  <p>That the good name and report of another man should be so regarded
by us, that if his fault be private we are not to spread it abroad, as some
that think they be burthened, unlesse they tell it to others, which is not
the rule of Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why is this added,</hi> If he heare thee, thou hast gained thy brother?</p>
                  <p>As a notable meanes to encourage us in this duty: For if the bestowing
of a Cup of cold water shall not be unrewarded; how much more the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a soule from Satan?</p>
                  <p>What if our brother heare us not, and so we doe not gain him?</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding we lose not our labour, but our reward is laid up
with God, <hi>Esa.</hi> 49. 4. For that which is done for Gods cause, though it be
never so evilly taken or used, shall certainly be remembred of God, who
will recompence it plentifully, and lay it up among our good deeds. Also
this shall serve against him that is reproved in judgment, for refusing such
a profitable meanes.</p>
                  <p>What is the second degree of private Admonitions?</p>
                  <p>It is more publike then the former.<note place="margin">The second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of private admonition.</note> If thy brother heare thee not, take
yet with thee one or two, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. For although he heare not the first
admonition, yet love will not give him over, but as the case requireth, and
the nature and condition of the offender may be discerned to be easie or
hard to repent; the admonisher is to take with him one, or if need be
two at the most to assist him.</p>
                  <p>The first admonition not availing, may we take whom we will to the
second?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:55421:223"/>
That choice is to be made which is likeliest to take effect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may not take his enemy, or one that is not able to convince; but
we must chuse one or two such, whom either he reverenceth, or at least
favoureth, or otherwise may doe most good with him, either by graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of speech, or ability of personage, or some other gift: in a word,
such as be fittest both for gifts and authority to recover him, or whom the
Pastor may be one, as he also may be the first.</p>
                  <p>May the first admonisher substitute another in his place the second time?</p>
                  <p>No, for our Saviour Christ doth not leave it free so to doe, but will
have him that did first admonish to bee one, both for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of the former dealing with the latter, as also for keeping the fault
of the offender in as much silence and secrecy as may be.</p>
                  <p>What is gathered hereby?</p>
                  <p>That great love and care of our Saviour Christ towards him, as also
what diligence we must use, and what care for our brother.</p>
                  <p>What may not one alone deale with him the second time?</p>
                  <p>Because that by the testimony of two or three he might be brought to
reverence now, that which he would not at the first admonition: And
further, that way may be made to the publike judgment of the Church,
yea to the others, way before the Church, which under two testimonies
at least cannot proceed further against him; for <hi>in the mouth of two or three
witnesses every truth is confirmed, Matth.</hi> 18. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the private admonitions: What is the publike?</p>
                  <p>That which is done by the whole Church,<note place="margin">Publike admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.</note> or the Minister assisted by
the Congregation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. for if the second warning serve not, our
Saviour would have the offender presented to the Church, as to the
highest Court, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. not of greatest personages, but of the most
learned, and beautified with inward graces, whose presence he cannot
chuse but reverence: As in the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> a wife suspected of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
was brought unto the Priest in the house of God, that the reverence
of the place and person might strike a feare in her heart, to cause her to
confesse the truth, <hi>Num. 5. 15, 16</hi> wherein appeareth a further step and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Gods singular love and affection.</p>
                  <p>But the bringing of him to open shame seemeth rather hurtfull then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable?</p>
                  <p>Not to the godly, to whom it is prepared as a soveraigne medicine for
his disease: For as a wealthy man being sick assembleth a whole Colledg
of Physicians to consult of his disease, and the best remedy thereof, so the
whole Church in the like case, having <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is, treasures
of knowledge, should consult upon the recovery of the offender, who
therefore hearing their admonition, is to be received notwithstanding
his former obstinacy: but the hearts of the wicked by the warning are the
more hardned, to their everlasting perdition.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the corrections which are in word, what are they in deed?</p>
                  <p>Suspension, <hi>Num. 12. 14. Exod.</hi> 33. 6, 7. and Examination, <hi>Matth. 18. 17.
1 Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>What is Suspension?</p>
                  <p>A certain separation of him that will not amend by admonitions from
some holy things in the Church:<note place="margin">Of suspension.</note> as 1. the use of Sacraments: 2. some
offices in the Church.</p>

                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:55421:224"/>
What is Excommunication?</p>
                  <p>The casting of the stubborne sinner out of the Church,<note place="margin">Of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> and delivering
him unto Satan, who being thus disfranchised of all the liberties, and
deprived of all the benefits, and common society of the Church, is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
as it were, from that protection and mercy which may be looked
for at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>What is the end of this casting out?</p>
                  <p>It is two-fold:</p>
                  <p>First, in regard of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of men.</p>
                  <p>How in regard of God?</p>
                  <p>Because that his holy Name and Religion should not be evil spoken of,
by suffering wicked &amp; uncleane persons, (as blasphemers, adulterers, &amp;c.)
in the Church, which should not bee like unto a stie, but cleane from all
shew of filthinesse: for if in houses of good report, a proud person, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracter,
or lyer, (much lesse a drunkard, or filthy person) is not suffered,
much lesse ought such a one to be in the Church, which is the house
of the living God, lest the Gospell come to reproach through such: in
that godlesse persons would thereby take occasion to open their mouths
against the truth.</p>
                  <p>How in regard of men?</p>
                  <p>That likewise is two-fold, either respecting the good of the person ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
or of the rest of the Church?</p>
                  <p>What is the regard that concerneth the Church?</p>
                  <p>That they be not infected with his naughtinesse, and that they may keep
themselves from the like offence; for that if he remaine in the Church,
and be not punished,</p>
                  <p>First, either men would be provoked to commit the like sinnes: for
the Apostle comparing a sinfull man to leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. teacheth that
a little leaven will sowre the whole batch; so one wicked man will infect
the whole Church. Or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the weak would take occasion thereby of falling away
from the truth; and others yet without, would be holden from comming
unto it.</p>
                  <p>What is the regard that concerneth him that is cast out?</p>
                  <p>That he being shamed, may be brought to repent, and turne unto the
Lord, as the Apostle saith of the incestuous person, who should be cut
off for the destruction of the flesh; that is, the naturall corruption, and
for saving of the spirit, that is, the man regenerate (1 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20.)</p>
                  <p>If the severity of this sentence be such as hath been declared: how then
tendeth it to Reformation?</p>
                  <p>They that are thus censured are only delivered to Satan conditionally,
if they repent not: so it is a meanes either to bring them to Christ, or
send them to the devill: as a hand almost cut off, and hanging but by the
skin, is in danger to be lost, unlesse some skilfull Chirurgeon binde it up.</p>
                  <p>What is to be done to him if he repent?</p>
                  <p>He is to be received of the Church, whom as they loose in earth, our
Saviour Christ looseth in heaven; yet he is not by and by to be admitted
to all priviledges of the Church, but to be suspended for a time till the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55421:224"/>
fruits of repentance may better appear: for if some in the law for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pollution in a lawfull duty of burying the dead, were suspended from
the Passeover, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6. much more in the Gospell for such obstinacy.</p>
                  <p>How many sorts of suspensions then are there?</p>
                  <p>Two: one going before excommunication, and the other following
the same towards them that are penitent, both which were shadowed
in the Leviticall law in the case of Leprosie. For first, in the 13. of <hi>Levit.</hi>
we finde that upon suspition of Leprosie a man was shut up for a time, not
only from the worship of God, but also from all society of men: and
how much more may it be lawfull under the Gospell, to execute the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

is set down in the 14 of <hi>Levit.</hi> That a man cleansed from his leprosie was
brought home unto the campe, and placed in his tent, where he stayed

                  <p>So much of the medicinall censures: what is the last censure of fearfull

Where the Apostle foretelleth that there shall be a generall apostacy

                     <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it meant that the whole Church shall fall away from Christ?</p>
                  <p>No: it were impossible that a perfect head should be without a body.</p>
                  <p>Why is it then called generall?</p>
                  <p>Because the Gospell having been universally preached throughout the
world; from it, both whole Nations did fall, and the most part also
even of those Nations that kept the profession of it, howbeit still there
remained a Church, though there were no setled estate thereof.</p>
                  <p>Is it likely the Lord would barre so many Nations that lived under An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
and that so long, from the means of salvation?</p>
                  <p>Why not, and that most justly; for if the whole world of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
were rejected, when the Church was onely in <hi>Iury</hi> for some 1500
years; and seeing of the Iewes ten Tribes were rejected, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
but a few, were of the Church: with great reason might the
Lord reject those Nations and people for so many ages, seeing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Gods grace in falling away from the Gospell, which the Lord
most graciously revealed unto them, rather then to their Fathers before
them.</p>
                  <p>Is this apostasie necessarily laid upon the See of Rome?</p>
                  <p>Yes verily, as by the description may evidently appear.</p>
                  <p>What are the parts of this Apostasie?</p>
                  <p>The head and the body: for as Christ is the head of the Church
which is his body; so Antichrist is the head of the Romish Church
which is his body.</p>
                  <p>Who is that Antichrist?</p>
                  <p>He is one who under the colour of being for Christ,<note place="margin">Of Antichrist, and who he is.</note> and under title of
his Vicegerent, exalteth himselfe above and against Christ, opposing
himselfe against all his offices and ordinances both in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
bearing authority in the Church of God, ruling over that
City with seven Hils, which did bear rule over Nations, and put our
Lord to death; a Man of sinne, a Harlot, a Mother of spirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Kings and people of the Nations, a childe of perdition, a
destroyer establishing himselfe by lying miracles and false wonders: all
which marks together, do agree with none but the Pope of Rome.</p>
                  <p>How doth the Apostle 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. describe this Antichristian head
unto us?</p>
                  <p>First he describeth what he is towards others, and then what he is in
himselfe.</p>
                  <p>What is he towards others?</p>
                  <p>That is declared by two speciall titles, the Man of sinne, and Sonne
of perdition; declaring hereby not so much his own sinne and perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is exceeding great, as of those that receive his marke, whom
he causeth to sinne, and consequently to fall into perdition: as <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
who is often branded with the mark of causing <hi>Israel</hi> to sin: and he is so
much more detestable then he, by how much both his idolatry is more,
and hath drawn more Kingdomes after him then <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did Tribes.</p>
                  <p>In what respect is he called the man of sin?</p>
                  <p>In that he causeth man to sinne; and this the Pope doth in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55421:225"/>
justifying sinne, not by oversight, but by Lawes advisedly made,
not onely commanding some sinnes, which we are by our corrupt nature
prone unto, as spirituall fornication, but also (to the great profanation of
the holy name and profession of Christ) permitting and teaching for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
such as even our corrupt nature (not wholly subverted through erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
custome of sin) abhorreth: as incestuous marriages, and breaking of
faith and league, equivocating, and the like, which profane men (by the
very light of nature) doe detest.</p>
                  <p>In what sense is he called the child of perdition?</p>
                  <p>Not as the unthrift mentioned in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> neither as <hi>Judas,</hi> who is
passively called the Son of perdition;<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 12.</note> but actively, as it is other where
expounded, where he is called the destroyer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 11. because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
many: And that the Pope is such an one, some of his owne Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries
make it good, confessing that many who were well disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
before their entry into that Sea, became cursed and cruell beasts
when once they were setled in the same, as if there were some pestilent
poyson in that seat infecting those that sit therein.</p>
                  <p>What learne you of this?</p>
                  <p>That the calling of the Pope is unlawfull; for every office or calling
which the Lord doth not blesse, or wherein none occupying the place
groweth in piety, is to be esteemed for an unlawfull calling: for in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
calling some (at the least) are found in all ages profitable to the
Church or Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>What is the use of all this Doctrine?</p>
                  <p>That whosoever are partakers of the sins of <hi>Rome,</hi> are also under the
same curse; and therefore such as have lived in Popery should examine
our selves if we have truely repented us of it, first, by the change of our
understanding; as whether we have grown in the knowledg of the truth:
And secondly, by the change of our affections, as whether we hate Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and love the truth unfainedly, and so let every one judge himselfe,
that he be not judged, and that with harder judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as God hath been the longer patient towards us.</p>
                  <p>What further?</p>
                  <p>That there can be no sound agreement betwixt Popery and the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Gospel, no more then betwixt light and darknesse, falshood
and truth, God and Beliall, and therefore no reconciliation can be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
betwixt them: for if the members of Antichrist shall be destroyed,
we cannot in any sort communicate with them in their errours, unlesse we
will beare them company in their destruction also.</p>
                  <p>Doth every errour destroy the soule?</p>
                  <p>No verily:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> for as every wound killeth not a man, so every errour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth
not a man of salvation; but as the vitall parts being wounded or
infected, bring death, so those errours that destroy the fundamentall
points and heads of faith bring everlasting destruction, in which kind is
Popery, which sundry ways overthroweth the principles and grounds of
our holy faith, and therefore is tearmed an apostasie, or departing from
the faith.</p>
                  <p>Is it then impossible for a Pope to be saved?</p>
                  <p>No; it is not impossible, his sinne being not necessarily against the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55421:226"/>
holy Ghost, to which onely repentance is denyed; for some (in likelhood)
have entered into, and continued in that Sea ignorantly, and therefore
may possibly finde place to repentance. But if any be saved, it is a secret
hidden with God: for concerning any thing that appeares by the end of
any Pope, since he was lift up in the Emperours chaire, and discovered to
be the man of sin, there is no grounded hope given to perswade that any
one of them is saved.</p>
                  <p>So much of Antichrist what he is towards others: what is hee in
himselfe?</p>
                  <p>That is set downe in two points: first, in that (contrary to right, and
by meere usurpation) he seateth himselfe in the Temple of God, as if
he were Christs Vicar, being indeed his enemy, both which the word
Antichrist noteth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that he is here expressely named an adversary, and one
that is contrary to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Wherein is the Pope adversary unto Christ?</p>
                  <p>Every way, in life, and in office.</p>
                  <p>How in life?</p>
                  <p>In that Christ being most pure and holy, yea holinesse it selfe, the
Popes many of them are, and have been most filthy and abominable in
blaspheming, conjuring, murthering, covetousnesse, whoring, and
that incestuously and Sodomitically, and yet will they in their ordinary
Titles be called holy; yea holinesse it selfe, which is proper onely to
Christ.</p>
                  <p>How in Office?</p>
                  <p>First, in his Kingdome: Christs Kingdome is without all outward shew,
or pompe: But the Popes Kingdome consisteth wholly in Pompe, and
Shewes, as imitating his Predecessors the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> in his
proud, stately, and lordly offices, princely traine, and outrageous expences
in every sort.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in his Priest-hood, in raising up another Sacrifice then
Christ, another Priesthood then his, other Mediators then him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his Propheticall office, in that he teacheth cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to him; Christ taught nothing but what hee received of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The Pope setteth out his owne Canons and Decrees of councells,
and in them he teacheth such Doctrine as overthroweth the maine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of that which Christ taught.</p>
                  <p>What is the second effect?</p>
                  <p>That he is exceedingly lifted up against all that is called God.</p>
                  <p>How doth this agree to the Pope?</p>
                  <p>More fitly then to any other person; for Christ being very God aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
himselfe unto the assuming of the nature of man; the Pope a vile
man advanceth himself to the Throne of God: Christ being above all
secular power, paid tribute, and was taxed and suffered himselfe to bee
crowned with a crowne of Thornes, and beare his owne Crosse; but the
Pope being under all secular power, exalteth himselfe above all secular
powers, exacteth Tribute of Kings, setteth his foot on the neck of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
carrieth a tripple Crowne of gold, and is borne upon mens
shoulders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:55421:226"/>
But he calleth himself the servant of servants.</p>
                  <p>Though he doe, yet (by the confession of his owne Canonists) he doth
it but dissemblingly and in hypocrisie, which is double iniquity; for they
say that he doth in humility onely say so, not that hee is indeed so as he
saith.</p>
                  <p>What are the effects of this his pride?</p>
                  <p>They are two: First, he sitteth in the Church as God, for he bindeth
the consciences of men by his decrees, which no Princes Law can doe;
for though men observe not such Lawes, yet if they break them not of
contempt, they are discharged, as if they did beare the penalty prescribed
in them.</p>
                  <p>By this it seemeth that the Church of Rome is yet the Church of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
corrupt, seeing it is said that hee sitteth in the Temple of
God.</p>
                  <p>No verily; but it is so said, first, because it beareth the name of the
Church, for the Scriptures give the name to a thing according to that it
hath been, as when Christ saith, <hi>The abomination of desolation shall stand in
the holy place;</hi> he meaneth not that the Temple was then holy, which at
that time, (being no figure nor shadow of Christ and his Church) was
profaned, but that it had been holy; so we confesse that there had beene
a true Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> which is now no Church of Christ, but the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is said to sit in the Temple of God, because he exerciseth
his tyrannicall rule in the Christian world, and is most busie in those parts
where Christ had his Church, and the Gospell is professed, labouring in
all places, either by himselfe or his wicked instruments, to overthrow or
corrupt, poyson or hinder the free course of the Gospel; so that in this
regard he may be said to sit in the Temple of God, that is, to reigne and
tyrannize in the Church of God, though the City where he is be <hi>Sodome,</hi>
and the Church whereof he is head, the Synagogue of Satan.</p>
                  <p>What is the other effect of his pride?</p>
                  <p>He boasteth himselfe that he is God, as the Popes flatterers in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law call him, <hi>Our Lord God the Pope:</hi> Neither doth his pride stay
there, but also he challengeth to himself things proper to God, as the title
of Holinesse, also power to forgive sins, and to carry infinite soules to hell
without check or controlment, and to make of nothing something; yea,
to make the Scriptures to be no Scriptures, and no Scripture to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
at his pleasure, yea to make of the creature the Creator.</p>
                  <p>It should seeme to be an impossible thing that men should be carried away
from the faith of the Gospel by one so monstrous and directly opposite
to Christ.</p>
                  <p>It might seem so indeed, if at once and at a sudden he had shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in such foule colours, and therefore by certaine decrees of iniquity
he raised himselfe to his height of wickednesse, and did not at the first
shew himselfe in such a monstrous shape and likenesse.</p>
                  <p>How doth that appeare?</p>
                  <p>By the Apostle, who in the 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. unto 13. sheweth of two cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Devill held to bring this to passe; one secret and covert, before this
man of sin was revealed: the other when he was revealed and set up in his
Seat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:55421:227"/>
What were the wayes of Antichrists comming before he was revealed?</p>
                  <p>Those severall errours which were spread, partly in the Apostles time,
and partly after their time, thereby to make a way for his comming; and
in this respect this mystery of iniquity was begun to be wrought (as it
were) under ground and secretly in the Apostles time.</p>
                  <p>How was this mystery of iniquity wrought in the Apostles time?</p>
                  <p>By many ambitious spirits, (as it were) petty Antichrists, which were
desirous to be Lords over the Church, and wicked Hereticks, which then
sowed many errours and heresies, as justification by works, worshipping
of Angels, and which put Religion in meats, and condemned marriage,
which were beginnings and grounds of Popery and Antichristianisme,
3 <hi>John 9. Acts 5. 1. Gal. 1. 6, 7. &amp; 2. 6. Col. 2. 18, 21. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That those whom God hath freed from the bondage of Popery,
should strive to free themselves from all the remanents thereof, lest if they
cleave still to any of them, God in judgment bring the whole upon them
againe.</p>
                  <p>How shall Antichrists Kingdome be continued and advanced after that
he is revealed?</p>
                  <p>By the power of Satan, in lying miracles and false wonders.</p>
                  <p>What difference is there betwixt Christs miracles and theirs?</p>
                  <p>Very great every way:<note place="margin">The differences betweene Christs mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and the Popes.</note> for Christs miracles were true, whereas these
are false and lying, and by legerdemaine; Christs miracles were from
God, but theirs, where there is any strange thing, and above the common
reach of men, from the Devill; Christs miracles were for the most part
profitable to the health of man, but theirs altogether unprofitable, and
for a vain shew; Christs miracles were to confirme the truth, but theirs
to confirme falshood.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That seeing the Popes Kingdome glorieth so much in wonders, it is
most like that he is Antichrist, seeing the false Christs and the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
shall doe great wonders to deceive (if it were possible) the very
Elect, and that some of the false Prophets prophesies shall come to passe,
we should not therefore beleeve the doctrine of Popery for their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
sake, seeing the Lord thereby tryeth our faith, who hath given to
Satan great knowledge and power to work strange things, to bring those
to damnation who are appointed unto it. Moreover, whatsoever Miracles
are not profitable to some good, neither tend to confirme a truth, they are
false and lying; so that as the Lord left an evident difference between his
Miracles and the inchantments of the Egyptians, so hath he left an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
difference between the Miracles of Christ and his Apostles, and
those of the Romish Synagogue, <hi>Matth. 24. 24. Deut. 13. 12. Exod.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
                  <p>Are not miracles as necessary now, as they were in the time of the
Apostles?</p>
                  <p>No verily; for the Doctrine of the Gospell being then new unto the
world, had need to have been confirmed with miracles from heaven; but
it being once confirmed, there is no more need of miracles; and there we
keeping the same Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, must content
our selves with the confirmation which hath already been given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:55421:227"/>
What ariseth out of this?</p>
                  <p>That the Doctrine of Popery is a new Doctrine, which hath need to
to be confirmed with new miracles; and so it is not the doctrine of Christ,
neither is established by his miracles.</p>
                  <p>What force shall the Miracles of Antichrist have?</p>
                  <p>Marvellous great, to bring many men to damnation, God in the just
revenge of the contempt of the truth, sending a strong delusion among
them.</p>
                  <p>Hither to we have heard Antichrist described by his effects and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties:
<note place="margin">The seat of Antichrist.</note> now tell me here where is the place of his speciall residence?</p>
                  <p>That is the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How doth that appeare?</p>
                  <p>First, because he that letted at the time when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote was the
Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did then sit there, and must be dis-seated, (as the
learned Papists themselves grant ere the Pope could enter upon it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Rev. 17. 18. John</hi> called the City where he must sit, the Lady
of the world; which at that time agreed onely to <hi>Rome,</hi> being the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
City of the world. Thirdly, it was that City which was seated
upon seven hills, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 9. which by all ancient Records belongeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and onely to <hi>Rome.</hi> As for the occasion of the Popes placing there,
it came by the meanes of translating of the Seat of the Empire from
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from whence ensued also the parting of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
into two parts, by which division it being weakned, and after also
sundred in affection, as well as in place, was the easier to be entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and obtained by the Pope.</p>
                  <p>What doe you further gather of that the Apostle saith, that he that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
shall let?</p>
                  <p>That the Antichrist is not one particular man, as the Papists doe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
for then by the like phrase he that letteth must be one particular man,
where it cannot be that one man should live so many hundred yeeres; as
from <hi>Pauls</hi> time to the time of the translation of the Empire from <hi>Rome,</hi>
much lesse untill within two years and a half of the latter day, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the time of Antichrist: and therefore as by him that letteth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
a succession of men, and not one onely man; so in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 3. 17.
the foure beasts, and the foure Kings, doe not signifie foure particular
men, but foure governments, in every one whereof there were sundry men
that ruled: so that the argument of the Papists who upon the words [the
man of sinne] would prove that the Antichrist the Apostle speaketh of,
is one singular man, is but vaine, and hath no consequence in it.</p>
                  <p>But how can Antichrist be already come, seeing the Empire yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth?</p>
                  <p>The name of the Empire onely remaineth, the thing is gone; for he
hath neither the chiefe City, nor the Tribune, nor the Commandement
of the people; and therefore he can be no let to the Antichrists comming,
especially the <hi>Pope</hi> having gotten such an upper hand over him, as to cause
him to waite at his gate barefoot, and to hold his stirrop.</p>
                  <p>What shall be the end of this Antichrist?</p>
                  <p>God shall confound him with the breath of his mouth, that is, with
the preaching of his Word: which serveth for another argument to prove
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55421:228"/>
the Pope to be Antichrist: for whereas he had subdued Kingdomes and
Empires under his feet, he hath been of late mightily suppressed by the
Word preached, and not by outward force, as other Potentates use to be.</p>
                  <p>What learne you of this?</p>
                  <p>The marvellous power of Gods Word to suppresse whatsoever riseth
against it: for if the mightiest cannot stand before it, much lesse the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest:
and therefore it is expressed by a mighty winde, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. which
carrieth all before it; and by fire, which consumeth all, and pierceth all:
And it declareth a marvellous easie victory against the enemies, when it is
said, that with the breath of his mouth hee shall consume his enemies,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>What else shall be the overthrow of Antichrist?</p>
                  <p>The glorious appearance of the Son of God in the latter day.</p>
                  <p>What gather you of this?</p>
                  <p>That before the last day he shall not be utterly consumed, whereof
notwithstanding it followeth not that the head shall remaine till then; for
the Beast and the false Prophet shall be taken and cast into the fire before
the latter day; but some shall retaine a liking of him, and his errors, and
superstitions even till the last day.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the head of this generall Apostasie: what are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it?</p>
                  <p>They are first described by their end, even a number of people that
shall perish, which accordeth with that name and property of the head,
the Destroyer or Son of perdition, being truely verified in them in regard
of the fearefull end he shall bring them to.</p>
                  <p>What is the use of this?</p>
                  <p>That as no poyson can take away the life of an elect: so small occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
carry away such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
                  <p>How otherwise are these members of Antichrist described?</p>
                  <p>By this, that they never loved the truth, although they understood and
professed it.</p>
                  <p>How should a man love the truth?</p>
                  <p>For the truthes sake, not for vaine glory, filthy delight, or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                  <p>How appeareth it that men love the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>When they walke accordingly, and keep faith in a good Conscience,
which some losing by their wicked life, lost also their Faith, that is, their
Religion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>How is it to be understood that God giveth men up to strong delusions?</p>
                  <p>Because God is a just Iudge, which by them either punisheth or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
former sinnes, and especially the contempt of the Gospell; in
which regard even amongst us now, some are cast into the sinke of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
some into the Family of love; some become <hi>Arians,</hi> some <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
at which are (as it were) divers Gaoles and Dungeons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
hee throweth those that are cold and carelesse Professors of the
Gospell.</p>
                  <p>What learne you by this?</p>
                  <p>That they that imagine God favourable unto them notwithstanding
their sinnes, because their life, or goods, or honours are spared, are
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55421:228"/>
foully deceived; for when the Lord ceaseth to reprove any, or to strive
with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26. then doth he give them up into vanity of their
own minds to do their wicked wills, which is the greatest judgement,
and very usuall with God to doe.</p>
                  <p>What is our duty in such cases?</p>
                  <p>To pray unto the Lord to keep us from all errors; but if for our triall
and further hardning of others it please him to send errors amongst us,
that it would please him to preserve us in that danger, that we taste not of
that bait whereby Satan seeketh to catch us.</p>
                  <p>What other cause is there of sending these errors?</p>
                  <p>That those may be damned which believe not the truth: for as God
hath appointed them to damnation, so betwixt his counsell in rejecting
them and the finall effect of it, there must be sin to bring the effect justly
upon them.</p>
                  <p>What reason is annexed for their just damnation?</p>
                  <p>Because they rest in unrighteousnesse, having their eares itching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
errors, which they drink in, as the earth drinketh up water. So that
albeit they be powerfully sent of God in his judgement, yet are they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
greedily desired and affected of them.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken at large of the providence of God disposing of man in
this world; it followeth to speak of his providence concerning mankinde
in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>How doth God then deale with men after this life?<note place="margin">Of the last judgement.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He bringeth them all to judgement.</p>
                  <p>What is meant here by judgment?</p>
                  <p>The pronouncing or executing of the irrevocable sentence of absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or condemnation.</p>
                  <p>How is that done?</p>
                  <p>Partly on every man in particular at the hour of his death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27.
but fully and generally upon all men at the second comming of Christ,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. The death of every one severally goeth immediately before
the particular judgement: the generall resurrection of all goeth before
the finall judgement which shall be at the last day.</p>
                  <p>Must all men then die?</p>
                  <p>Yea all both good and bad, <hi>Psal. 49. 10. Eccl.</hi> 2. 16. save that unto
some, namely such as shall be found alive at Christs comming, a change
shall be in stead of death, as shall be shewed.</p>
                  <p>Death being the punishment of sinne,<note place="margin">Why the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dye.</note> how commeth it to passe that the
righteous dye, to whom all sinnes are forgiven?</p>
                  <p>Death indeed came on all mankinde by reason of sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.
but yet it is not in all things the same to the godly and to the wicked: for
howsoever unto both it be the enemy of nature, as the end of naturall
life, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 26. Psal.</hi> 90. 3.</p>
                  <p>Yet 1. unto the godly it is a token of Gods love, unto the wicked of
his anger, <hi>Psal. 37. 37, 38. Job</hi> 18. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>2. Vnto the godly it is a rest from labour and misery, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 13.
the last enemy being now destroyed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26. unto the wicked it
is the height of all worldly evils, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20.</p>
                  <p>3. Vnto the godly it is the utter abolishing of sin and perfection of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:55421:229"/>
mortification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. unto the wicked it is the conquest of sinne and
accomplishment of their spirituall captivity.</p>
                  <p>4. Vnto the godly it is so far from being a separation from Christ,
that even the body severed from the soule and rotting in the grave is yet
united to Christ; and the soule freed from the body is with him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
<hi>Luk. 23. 43. Phil.</hi> 2. 16. unto the wicked it is an utter cutting off
from the favourable presence and fruition of God.</p>
                  <p>5. Vnto the godly it is the beginning of heavenly glory; unto the
wicked it is the entrance into hellish and endlesse torments, <hi>Luke 16.

                  <p>How are men judged at the houre of death?<note place="margin">Of particular judgement at the houre of death.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. God at that instant pronounceth, and the conscience apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the sentence of blessing or cursing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
                  <p>2. The soule of every man accordingly is (by the power of God and
the ministery of Angels) immediately conveyed into that state of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

                  </p>
                  <p>The summoning and presenting of all both dead and living men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Devils, before the glorious throne of Christ the judge.</p>
                  <p>How shall all men both dead and living be summoned?</p>
                  <p>By the voice of Christ appeared by the ministery of Angels, and
namely by the shout and Trumpet of the Archangel, whereto the Lord
joyning his divine power (as unto the word preached for the work of the
first resurrection) shall in a moment both raise the dead with their own
bodies and every part thereof though never so dispersed,<note place="margin">Iohn 5. 28.</note> and change
the living,<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 31.</note> so that it shall be with them as if they had been a long time
dead and were now raised to life againe.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 52.</note>

                  <p>Shall there be no difference betweene the resurrection of the elect and
reprobate?</p>
                  <p>Yes; for howsoever they shall both rise by the same mighty voice
and power of Christ in the same bodies wherein they lived upon earth,
and those so altered in quality, as then they shall be able to abide for ever
in that estate whereunto they shall be judged: yet</p>
                  <p>1. The elect shall be raised as members of the body of Christ by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
derived from his resurrection: the reprobate, as Malefastors, shall be
brought forth of the prison of the grave by vertue of the judiciary power
of Christ, and of the curse of the law.</p>
                  <p>2. The elect shall come forth to everlasting life, which is called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of life: the reprobate to shame and perpetuall contempt, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the resurrection of condemnation.</p>
                  <p>3. The bodies of the elect shall be spirituall, that is, glorious, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
nimble, impatible: but the bodies of the reprobate shall be full
of uncomelinesse and horror,<note place="margin">Phil 3. 21.</note> agreeable to the guiltinesse and terror of
their consciences, and liable to extreame torment.</p>
                  <p>How shall all men be presented before the throne of Christ?</p>
                  <p>The elect being gathered by the Angels, shall with great joy be caught
up into the aire to meet the Lord, <hi>Luke 21. 28. 1 Thess.</hi> 4. 17.</p>

<hi>Rev. 20. 12. viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The severall books of mens consciences, which then by the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
illumination of Christ, the Sunne of righteousnesse, shining in his full
strength, shall be so enlightned, that men shall perfectly remember what

by Christ, which decree shall then at length be made known to all.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the preparation to judgement, what are we to consider in

                  <p>The act of judgment,<note place="margin">The act of judgment, and how perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> wherein the Elect shal first be acquitted, that they

                  <p>How shall the act of judgement be performed?</p>
                  <p>1. By examination:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 12.</note> 2. By pronouncing sentence. The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall be according to the Law of God, which hath been revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, whether it be the Law of nature onely, which is the remainder of
the morall Law written in the hearts of our first parents, and conveyed by
the power of God unto all men, to leave them without excuse; or that
written Word of God, vouchsafed unto the Church in the Scriptures,
first of the old, and after also of the new Testament, as the rule of faith
and life.</p>
                  <p>2. By the evidence of every mans conscience, bringing all his works,
whether good or evill,<note place="margin">Matth 12. 27, 41, 42.</note> to light, bearing witnesse with him or against him,
together with the testimony of such, who either by doctrine, company,
or example, have approved or condemned him.</p>
                  <p>Shall there be no difference in the examination of the Elect and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate?</p>
                  <p>Yes:<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 22.</note> for, 1. The Elect shall not have their sinnes, for which Christ sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 17.</note> but onely their good works remembred.</p>
                  <p>2. Being in Christ, they and their works shall not undergoe the strict
triall of the Law simply in it self, but as the obedience thereof doth prove
them to be true partakers of the grace of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Shall there be any such reasoning at the last judgement, as seemeth
<hi>Matth. 7. &amp; 25?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No: but the consciences of men being then enlightned by Christ, shall
cleare all those doubts, and reject those objections and excuses, which
they seem now to apprehend.</p>
                  <p>How shall the sentence be pronounced?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:55421:230"/>
By the Iudge himselfe, our Lord Iesus Christ, who according to the
evidence and verdict of conscience touching workes, shall adjudge the
Elect unto the blessing of the kingdome of God his Father: and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
with the Devill and his Angels, unto the curse of everlasting
fire.</p>
                  <p>Shall men then bee judged to salvation or damnation for their workes
sake?</p>
                  <p>1. The wicked shall be condemned for the merit of their workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being perfectly evill, they deserve the wages of damnation.</p>
                  <p>2. The godly shall be pronounced just, because their workes, though
imperfect,<note place="margin">Iames 2. 18.</note> doe prove their faith (whereby they lay hold on Christ and
his meritorious righteousnesse) to be a true faith,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> as working by love in

                  </p>
                  <p>What use may we make of this Doctrine, concerning this generall end,
and finall judgement?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:55421:231"/>
First, it serveth to confute, not onely heathen Philosophers; who, as
in other things,<note place="margin">The use of this doctrine concerning the last judgment.</note> so in this, concerning the worlds continuance, became
vaine in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was full of darknesse,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. being destitute of the Word of God to guide them;<note place="margin">Rev. 17.</note> but also to
confute many prophane Atheists, in the Church of God, who doe not
believe in their hearts those Articles of the Resurrection and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
judgement: it is much indeed that there should bee Atheists in the
Church of God, and none in hell, that any should deny, or doubt of that
which the devills feare and tremble at. But sure the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
is fulfilled, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. there shall come in the last dayes scoffers,
walking after their owne lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his
comming? for since the fathers dyed, all things continue alike from the
beginning of the creation: and (as they would perswade themselves)
so they shall for ever: And answerable their lives are to such conceits,
<hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 9. But if neither the light of reason (it being impossible that the
truth and goodnesse and justice of God should take effect, if there were
not after this life a doom and recompence, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6.) Nor secondly,
the light of Conscience, which doubtlesse with <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 25. makes
them tremble in the midst of their obstinate gain-saying; Nor thirdly,
the light of Scripture can convince and perswade men of this truth, then
we must leave them to be confuted and taught by woefull experience, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the feeling of those flames, which they will not beleeve to bee
any other then fancies; and by seeing the Lord Iesus come in the Clouds,
when all nations shall weep before him;<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> and these Atheists especially, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their obstinate infidelity with ever dropping teares, and ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
misery.</p>
                  <p>And this Doctrine may be terrour to all gracelesse and wicked livers,
to consider that the wrath of God shall be revealed from heaven against
all ungodlinesse and unrighteousnesse of men, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6. when all the
sweetnesse of their sinfull pleasures shal be turned into gall, and bitternesse
for ever, <hi>Wis.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>How may the consideration of this Doctrine, touching the end of the
world, and the day of Judgement be usefull to the godly?</p>
                  <p>First, it should teach us, not to seek for happinesse in this world, or se
our affections on things below; for this world passeth away, and the
things thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is a fountaine of Christian comfort, and a ground of
Christian patience in all troubles, that there shall be an end, and a Saints
hope shall not be cut off. If in this life onely we had hope, we were of
all men most miserable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. But here is the comfort and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Saints, they wait for another world, and they know it is a
just thing with God, to give them rest after their labours, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9.
and a Crowne after their Combate, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. and after their long pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
an everlasting habitation, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1, Be patient,</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole)
<hi>and settle your hearts, for the comming of the Lord draweth neere, 2 Pet.
2.</hi> 9. when they that <hi>have sowne in teares shall reap in joy, James 5. 7.
Heb.</hi> 10. 36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, from this Doctrine, excellent arguments may be drawne
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55421:231"/>
to presse Christians to a holy life,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11. Seeing then all these things
must be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and godlinesse? <hi>And verse</hi> 14. Wherefore seeing yee look for such
things, give diligence that you may be found of him in peace: <hi>We should

Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who
hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
all the ends of the earth? What is his name,
and what is his <hi>SONS</hi> name, if thou canst tell?
<hi>To help us herein, the</hi> SON <hi>Himself did tell us, when hee was
here upon earth, that</hi>

hee appeared of old to <hi>Manoah,</hi> his <hi>name</hi> was <hi>Wonderfull,</hi> and hee did
wonderously, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 18, 19. But that, and all the wonders that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and in respect thereof cease to bee wonderfull: for of this work that
may bee verifyed, which is spoken of those wonderfull judgements,
that God brought upon <hi>Aegypt;</hi> when hee would<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 9. 16.</note> shew his power,

                  </p>
                  <p>The untying of this knot dependeth upon the right understanding
of the wonderfull conjunction of the divine and humane Nature in
the unity of the Person of our Redeemer. For by reason of the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this personall union, whatsoever may bee verifyed of either
of those Natures, the same may bee truely spoken of the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
from whethersoever of the Natures it bee denominated. For the
clearer conceiving whereof, wee may call to minde that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
hath taught us touching our Saviour.<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>In him dwelleth all the
fulnesse of the Godhead bodily,</hi> that is to say, by such a personall and
reall union, as doth inseparably and everlastingly conjoyn that infinite
Godhead with his finite Manhood in the unity of the self-same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
Person.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee</hi> in whom that fulnesse dwelleth, is the <hi>PERSON: that</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which so doth dwell in him, is the <hi>NATVRE.</hi> Now there
dwelleth in him not onely the fulnesse of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> but the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the <hi>Manhood</hi> also. For wee beleeve him to bee both perfect
God, begotten of the substance of his Father before all worlds; and
perfect Man, made of the substance of his Mother in the fulnesse of
time. And therefore wee must hold, that there are two distinct <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
in him: and two so distinct, that they doe not make one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
nature; but still remain uncompounded and unconfounded
together. But <hi>Hee</hi> in whom the fulnesse of the Manhood dwelleth is
not one, and hee in whom the fulnesse of the Godhead, another: but
hee in whom the fulnesse of both those natures dwelleth, is one and
the same <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and consequently it must bee beleeved as firmly,
that hee is but one <hi>Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here wee must consider, that the divine Nature did not assume
an humane Person, but the divine Person did assume an humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and that of the three divine Persons, it was neither the first nor
the third that did assume this Nature; but it was the middle Person,
who was to bee the middle one, that must undertake this mediation
betwixt God and us, which was otherwise also most requisite, as well
for the better preservation of the integrity of the blessed Trinity in
the Godhead, as for the higher advancement of Mankinde by means
of that relation which the second Person the Mediator did beare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Father. For if the fulnesse of the Godhead should have thus
dwelt in any humane person, there should then a fourth Person ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
have been added unto the Godhead: and if any of the three
Persons, beside the second, had been born of a woman; there should
have been two Sons in the Trinity. Whereas now the Son of God
and the Son of the blessed Virgin, being but one Person, is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
but one Son; and so no alteration at all made in the relations
of the Persons of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in respect of us, the Apostle sheweth, that for this

                     <hi>God sent his own SON made of a Woman; that WE might

<hi>Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a SON, and if a

that what relation Christ hath unto God by Nature, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>the

purchased for us; that<note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>as many as received him, to them hee gave
power,</hi> or priviledge, <hi>to become the Sons of God,</hi> even <hi>to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
on his Name.</hi> For although hee reserve to himselfe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence,
which is due unto him in a<note n="*" place="margin">Propter quod unum quod<expan>

                     <hi>Israel is my Son,

serve mee: and if thou refuse to let him goe; behold, I will slay thy son,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>thy first born.</hi> And the whole <hi>Israel</hi> of God, consisting of Jew and
Gentile, is in the same sort described by the Apostle to bee<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

took upon him, not an humane <hi>Person,</hi> but an humane <hi>Nature:</hi> so it
was not requisite hee should take upon him any <hi>Personall</hi> infirmities,
such as are, madnesse, blindenesse, lamenesse, and particular kindes
of diseases, which are incident to some onely and not to all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;

                  <p>Wee are further here also to observe in this our<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 7. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> that
as he had no <hi>Mother</hi> in regard of one of his natures, so he was to have
no <hi>Father</hi> in regard of the other; but must bee born of a pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Virgin, without the help of any man: according to that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55421:242"/>
which is writen.<note n="y" place="margin">Jer. 31. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth: A
woman shall compasse a man.</hi> And this also was most requisite, as for
other respects, so for the exemption of the assumed nature from the
imputation and pollution of <hi>Adams</hi> sin. For<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> sin having by that one
man entred into the world; every Father becommeth an <hi>Adam</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his childe, and conveyeth the corruption of his nature unto all
those whom hee doth beget. Therefore our Saviour assuming the
substance of our nature, but not by the ordinary way of naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
is thereby freed from all the touch and taint of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our flesh; which by that means onely is propagated from
the first man unto his posterity. Whereupon, hee being made <hi>of</hi> man
but not <hi>by</hi> man, and so becomming the immediate fruit of the <hi>womb,</hi>
and not of the <hi>loyns,</hi> must of necessity bee acknowledged to be<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 1. 35.</note> that
<hi>HOLY THING,</hi> which so was born of so blessed a Mother. Who
although shee were but the passive and materiall principle of which

yet cannot the man Christ Jesus thereby bee made the <hi>Son</hi>
of his<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 9.</note> own Spirit. Because Fathers doe beget their children out
of their own substance: the holy Ghost did not so, but framed the
flesh of him, from whom himself proceeded, out of the creature of
them both,<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 1. 38. 48.</note>

                  <p>That blessed womb of hers was the Bride-chamber, wherein the

so must God still bee) remaining that which hee was, whereby it

(vers. 14.) II. That <hi>we have not an high Priest which cannot be touched

with our flesh and bloud, that he might be tenderly affected

                     <hi>boldly</hi> come to him, <hi>and find grace

                     <hi>Advocate,</hi> to plead full <hi>satisfaction</hi> made by himself, as our
<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 7. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>surety,</hi> unto all the debt wherewith we any way stood chargeable.
Now the <hi>satisfaction</hi> which our surety bound himself to perform
in our behalfe, was of a double <hi>debt:</hi> the principall, and the
accessorie. The principall debt is obedience to Gods most holy
Law: which man was bound to pay as a perpetuall tribute to his
Creator, although he had never sinned; but, being now by his own
default become bankrupt, is not able to discharge in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
His surety therefore being to satisfie in his stead, none will
bee found fit to undertake such a payment, but he who is both God
and Man.</p>
                  <p>Man it is fit he should bee, because Man was the party that by
the articles of the first Covenant was tyed to this obedience; and
it was requisite that,<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> as by one mans disobedience many were
made sinners, so by the obedience of one man likewise many should
be made righteous. Again, if our Mediatour were onely God, he
could have performed no obedience (the Godhead being free from
all manner of subjection:) and if he were a bare man, although he
had been as perfect as <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, or the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
yet being left unto himselfe amidst all the temptations of
Satan and this wicked world, he should be subject to fall, as they
were: or if he should hold out, as<note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>the elect Angels</hi> did; that must
have been ascribed to the <hi>grace</hi> and favour of an other: whereas the
giving of strict satisfaction to Gods <hi>justice</hi> was the thing required in
this behalf. But now being God, as well as Man, he by his own<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Spirit</hi> preserved himself without spot: presenting a far more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
obedience unto God, then could have possibly been performed
by <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity.</p>
                  <p>For, beside the infinite difference that was betwixt both their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
which maketh the actions of the one beyond all comparison
to exceed the worth and value of the other: we know that <hi>Adam</hi> was
not able to make himselfe holy; but what holinesse he had, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from him who created him according to his owne image:
so that whatsoever obedience <hi>Adam</hi> had performed, God should
have<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7.</note> eaten but of the fruit of the vineyard which himselfe had
planted; and<note n="o" place="margin">1 Chronic. 29. 14. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>of his own</hi> would all that have been, which could be
given unto him. But Christ did himself sanctifie that humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which he assumed; according to his own saying, <hi>Joh. 17. 19.
For their sakes I sanctifie my self:</hi> and so out of his own peculiar store
did he bring forth those precious treasures of holy obedience, which
for the satisfaction of our debt he was pleased to tender unto his
Father. Againe, if <hi>Adam</hi> had<note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 17. 10.</note> done all things which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, hee must for all that have said: <hi>I am an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
servant; I have done that which was my duty to doe:</hi> whereas
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55421:245"/>
in the voluntary obedience, which Christ subjected himself unto, the
case stood far otherwise.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that if we respect him in his humane nature,<note n="q" place="margin">Joh. 14. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>his Father
is greater then he;</hi> and he is his Fathers<note n="r" place="margin">Esa. 53. 11. Mat. 12. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>servant:</hi> yet in that he said,
and most truly said, <hi>that God was his Father,</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Joh. 5. 18.</note> the Jews did rightly infer
from thence, that he thereby <hi>made himself equall with God;</hi> and<note n="t" place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note> the
Lord of Hosts himselfe hath proclaimed him to bee <hi>the man</hi> that
is <hi>his fellow.</hi> Being such a man therefore, and so highly born; by
the priviledge of his birth-right, hee might have claimed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from the ordinary service whereunto all other men are
tyed: and by being<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 17. 25, 26.</note> the Kings Son, have freed himself from the
payment of that tribute which was to be exacted at the hands of
Strangers. When<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> the Father brought this his first-begotten into
the world, he said; <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him:</hi> and at the
very instant wherein the Son advanced our nature into the highest
pitch of dignitie, by admitting it into the unity of his sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that nature so assumed was worthy to be crowned with all
glory and honour: and he in that nature might then have set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
down<note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> at the right hand of the throne of God; tyed to no
other subjection then now he is, or hereafter shall be; when after
the end of this world he shall have delivered up the kingdome to
God the Father. For then also, in regard of his assumed nature, he<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>shall
be subject unto him that put all</hi> other <hi>things under him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Son of God, if he had minded onely his own things,
might at the very first have attained unto the joy that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: but<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 2. vers. 4, 5, 7, 8.</note> looking <hi>on the things of others,</hi> he chose rather to
come by a tedious way and wearisome journey unto it, not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
the priviledge of a Son, but taking upon him <hi>the form of a</hi>

                     <hi>made under the Law:</hi> yea, so farre, that as he was
sent<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>in the likenesse of sinfull flesh,</hi> so he disdained not to subject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto that Law, which properly did concern <hi>sinfull flesh.</hi> And
therefore howsoever <hi>Circumcision</hi> was by right appliable onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <hi>dead in their sins, and the uncircumcision of their flesh;</hi>
yet he, in whom there was <hi>no body of the sins of the flesh</hi> to be put off,
submitted himself notwithstanding thereunto: not onely to testifie
his communion with the Fathers of the old Testament; but also by
this means to tender unto his Father a bond, signed with his own
bloud, whereby he made himself in our behalf a debtor unto the
whole Law. <hi>For I testifie</hi> (saith<note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> the Apostle) <hi>to every man that is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
that he is a debtor to the whole Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner <hi>Baptisme</hi> appertained properly unto such as were
defiled, and had need to have their<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 22. 16.</note> sins washed away: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when all the land of <hi>Judea</hi> and they of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> went out
unto <hi>John,</hi> they<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 3. 6. Mark 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>were all baptized of him in the river</hi> Jordan, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55421:245"/>
their sinnes.</hi> Among the rest came our Saviour also: but
the <hi>Baptist</hi> considering that he had need to be baptized by Christ,
and Christ no need at all to be baptized by him, refused to
give way unto that action; as altogether unbefitting the state
of that immaculate Lambe of God, who was to take away the
sinne of the World. Yet did our Mediatour submit himself to
that ordinance of God also: not onely to testifie his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Christians of the new Testaments; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
(which is the reason yeelded by himselfe) because<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>it
became him thus to fulfill all righteousnesse.</hi> And so having fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all righteousnesse, whereunto the meanest man was tyed, in
the days of his pilgrimage (which was more then he needed to
have undergone, if he had respected only himself:) the works
which he performed were truly workes of <hi>supererogation,</hi> which
might be put upon the account of them whose debt hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to discharge; and being performed by the Person of the
Son of God, must in that respect not onely be equivalent, but
infinitely over-value the obedience of <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
although they had remained in their integrity, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
untill this houre, instantly serving God day and night.
And thus for our main and principall debt of Obedience, hath
our Mediatour given satisfaction unto the Justice of his Father;
with<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 6. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running
over.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beside this, we were lyable unto another debt; which
wee have incurred by our default, and drawne upon our selves
by way of forfeiture and <hi>nomine poenae.</hi> For as<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 17. 10. Rom. 8. 12. Gal. 5. 3.</note> Obedience is a
due <hi>debt,</hi> and Gods servants in regard thereof are truly <hi>debters:</hi>
so likewise is sinne a<note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 6. 12. compared with Luk. 11. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>debt,</hi> and sinners<note n="m" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Luk. 13. 4. Mat. 13. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>debters,</hi> in regard of
the penalty due for the default. And as the payment of the debt
which commeth <hi>nomine poenae,</hi> dischargeth not the tenant after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
from paying his yearly rent; which of it self would have
been due, although no default had been committed: so the due
payment of the yearly rent, after the default hath been made,
is no sufficient satisfaction for the penalty already incurred.
Therefore our surety, who standeth chargeable with all our
debts, as he maketh payment for the one by his <hi>Active,</hi> so must
he make amends for the other by his <hi>Passive</hi> obedience: he must
first<note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> suffer, and then enter into his glory.<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>For it became him,
for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing
many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect</hi>
(that is, a perfect accomplisher of the worke which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken)
<hi>through sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Godhead is of that infinite perfection, that it cannot
possibly be subject to any passion. He therefore that had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature but the Godhead, could not pay such a debt as this;
the discharge whereof consisted in suffering and dying. It was
also fit, that Gods justice should have been satisfied in that
nature which had transgressed; and that the same nature should
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55421:246"/>
suffer the punishment, that had committed the offence.<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
then as the children were partakers of flesh and bloud, he also
himself likewise took part of the same: that through death he might
destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil; and
deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to bondage.</hi> Such and so great was the love of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
toward us,<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>he spared not his own Sonne, but delivered
him up for us all:</hi> and so transcendent was the love of the Son
of God toward the sons of men, that he desired not to be spared;
but rather then they should lie under the power of death, was
of himself most willing to suffer death for them: which seeing
in that infinite nature, which by eternall generation hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from his Father, he could not doe, he resolved in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time to take unto himselfe a Mother, and out of her
substance to have a body framed unto himself, wherein he might
<note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>become obedient unto death, even the death of the crosse,</hi> for our
redemption. And therefore<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 10. 5. 7.</note> when hee commeth into the world,
he saith unto his Father, <hi>A body hast thou fitted me; Lo, I come
to doe thy will O God.</hi> By the which will (saith the<note n="t" place="margin">Ib. ver. 9, 10.</note> Apostle)
<hi>wee are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
once for all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see it was necessary for the satisfaction of this debt,
that our Mediatour should be Man: but he that had no more
in him then a Man, could never be able to goe through with
so great a work. For if there should be found a Man as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as <hi>Adam</hi> was at his first creation, who would be content to
suffer for the offence of others: his suffering possibly might serve
for the redemption of one soul; it could be no sufficient ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for those<note n="u" place="margin">Rev. 7. 9.</note> innumerable multitudes that were to be<note n="x" place="margin">Rev. 5. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
to God out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and
nation.</hi> Neither could any Man or Angel be able to hold out,
if a punishment equivalent to the endlesse sufferings of all the
sinners in the world should at once bee laid upon him. Yea,
the very powers of Christ himself, upon whom<note n="y" place="margin">Esa. 11. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the spirit of
might did rest,</hi> were so shaken in this sharp encounter; that he,
who was the most accomplisht pattern of all fortitude, stood
<note n="z" place="margin">Mark 14. 33. Luk. 22. 44.</note> 
                     <hi>sore amazed,</hi> and<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>with strong crying and tears</hi> prayed that,<note n="b" place="margin">Mark 14, 35. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>if
it were possible, the houre might passe from him.</hi>

                     <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 10. 12.</note> This man therefore being to offer one sacrifice for sins for
ever; to the burning of that sacrifice he must not onely bring
the<note n="d" place="margin">Cant. 8. 6.</note> coals of his love as strong as death, and as ardent as the
fire which hath a most vehement flame, but he must add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
those<note n="e" place="margin">Esa. 33. 14.</note> everlasting burnings also, even the flames of his

                     <hi>through the eternall Spirit</hi>
must he <hi>offer himself without spot unto God;</hi> that hereby he might

                     <hi>tenne
thousand</hi> of themselves: how shall we then value of<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 22. 43, 44.</note>

Lord;</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 15. Rev. 19. 16.</note> who is <hi>the blessed and onely Potentate, the King of kings,
and Lord of lords?</hi> It was indeed our nature that suffered; but he
that suffered in that nature,<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>is over all, God blessed for ever:</hi> and
for such a Person to have suffered but one houre, was more then
if all other persons had suffered ten thousand millions of years.</p>
                  <p>But put case also, that the life of any other singular man
might be equivalent to all the lives of whole mankind: yet the
laying down of that life would not be sufficient to doe the deed,
unlesse he that had power to lay it down had power likewise
to take it up again. For, to be detained always in that <hi>prison</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 5. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>from
whence there is no comming out before the payment of the uttermost
farthing;</hi> is to lie always under execution, and to quit the plea
of that full payment of the debt wherein our surety stood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for us. And therefore the Apostle upon that ground
doth rightly conclude; that<note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>if Christ be not raised, our faith is
vaine, we are yet in our sinnes:</hi> and consequently, that as he
must be<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>delivered</hi> to death <hi>for our offences,</hi> so he must be <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
again for our justification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, our Saviour himself, knowing full well what he was
to undergoe for our sakes, told us before-hand, that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi>
whom hee would send unto us, should<note n="u" place="margin">Joh. 16. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>convince the
world,</hi> that is, fully satisfie the consciences of the sons of men,
concerning that<note n="x" place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> everlasting <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> which was to bee
brought in by him, upon this very ground: <hi>Because I goe to
my Father, and ye see mee no more.</hi> For if he had broken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and made an escape, the payment of the debt, which as
our surety he took upon himself, being not yet satisfied; he
should have been seen here again: Heaven would not have held
him, more then Paradise did <hi>Adam,</hi> after hee had fallen into
Gods debt and danger. But our Saviour raising himselfe from
the dead, presenting himself in Heaven before him unto whom
the debt was owing, and maintaining his standing there, hath
hereby given good proof, that he is now a free man, and hath
fully discharged that debt of ours for vvhich he stood commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And this is the evidence we have to shew of that <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi>
whereby we stand justified in Gods sight: according
to that of the Apostle.<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
elect? It is God that justifieth: who is he that condemneth? It is
Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again; who is even at the
right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although an ordinary man may easily part with his life;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55421:247"/>
yet doth it not lie in his power to resume it again at his own will
and pleasure. But he that must doe the turn for us, must be able
to say as our JESUS did,<note n="z" place="margin">Joh. 10. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>I lay down my life that I might take it
again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self: I
have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again:</hi> and in
another place;<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 2. 19. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise
it up;</hi> saith he unto the Jews, <hi>speaking of the Temple of his body.</hi> An
humane nature then he must have had, which might be subject
to dissolution: but being once dissolved, hee could not by his
own strength (which was the thing here necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
raise it up again; unlesse he had<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>declared</hi> himselfe <hi>to be
the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the dead.</hi> The
<hi>Manhood</hi> could suffer, but not overcome the sharpnesse of death:
the <hi>Godhead</hi> could suffer nothing, but overcome any thing. He
therefore that was both to suffer and to overcome death for us,
must be partaker of both natures: that<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>being put to death in the flesh,</hi>
he might be able also to <hi>quicken</hi> himself by his own Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And now are wee come to that part of Christs mediation,
which concerneth the conveyance of<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>the redemption of</hi> this <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
possession</hi> unto the sons of men. A dear purchase indeed,
which was to be redeemed with no lesse price then the bloud
of the Son of God: but what should the purchase of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
have been to us? or what should we have been the better
for all this; if we could not derive our descent from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser,
or raise some good title whereby we might estate our
selves in his purchase? Now this was the manner in former
time in <hi>Israel,</hi> concerning redemptions: that unto him who was
the next of kinne belonged the right of being<note n="e" place="margin">Ruth. 3. 12. &amp; 4. ver. 1. 3, 4. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Goël,</hi> or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi>
And <hi>Job</hi> had before that left this glorious profession
of his faith unto the perpetuall memory of all posterity.<note n="f" place="margin">Job 19. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>I
know that my Goël</hi> or <hi>Redeemer liveth, and at the last shall arise
upon the dust</hi> (or, <hi>stand upon the earth.) And after this my skin
is spent; yet in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for my
self, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another</hi> for me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may easily understand, that his and our Redeemer was
to be the invisible God; and yet in his assumed flesh made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
even to the bodily eyes of those whom he redeemed. For
if he had not thus assumed our <hi>flesh;</hi> how should we have been
of his bloud, or claimed any kindred to him? and unlesse the
<hi>Godhead</hi> had by a personall union been unseparably conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto that flesh; how could he therein have been accounted
our <hi>next</hi> of kinne?</p>
                  <p>For the better clearing of which last reason; we may call to
minde that sentence of the Apostle.<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>The first man is of the earth
earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.</hi> Where, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
there were many millions of men in the world betwixt
these two; yet we see our Redeemer reckoned <hi>the second man:</hi>
and why? but because these two were the only men who could
be accounted the prime fountains from whence all the rest of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55421:247"/>
mankind did derive their existence and beeing. For as all men in the
world by mean descents doe draw their first originall <hi>from the first
man:</hi> so in respect of a more immediate influence of efficiency
and operation doe they owe their beeing unto <hi>the second man,</hi> as
he is <hi>the Lord from heaven.</hi> This is Gods own language unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>

us, but more neere unto us then our very next progenitours;
and in that regard justly to be accounted our <hi>next</hi> of kinne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before them also.</p>
                  <p>Yet is not this sufficient neither: but there is an other kind
of generation required, for which we must be beholding unto
<hi>the second man, the Lord from heaven;</hi> before we can have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in this purchased <hi>Redemption.</hi> For as the guilt of the <hi>first
mans</hi> transgression is derived unto us by the meanes of carnall
generation: so must the benefit of the <hi>second mans</hi> obedience be
conveyed unto us by spirituall regeneration. And this must be
laid down as a most undoubted verity; that,<note n="p" place="margin">Joh. 3. 3.</note>

of the Adoption of Sons, which he hath procured for us,
<note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 2. 11.</note> is not ashamed to call us <hi>Brethren:</hi> so in respect of this nevv

                  <p>For the further opening of which mystery (which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

                     <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though a <hi>master of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>)
wee are to consider; that in every perfect generation, the
creature produced receiveth two things from him that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it: <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Likenesse.</hi> A curious limmer draweth his own
sons pourtraicture to the life (as we say:) yet because there is
no true life in it, but a likenesse onely; he can not be said to be
the begetter of his picture, as he is of his Son. And some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
there be that are bred out of mud or other putrid matter:
which although they have life, yet because they have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
in likenesse unto the principle from whence they
were derived, are therefore accounted to have but an improper
and equivocall generation. Whereas in the right and proper
course of generation (others being esteemed but monstrous births
that swarve from that rule) every creature begetteth his like:
<q>
                        <l>—nec imbellem feroces</l>
                        <l>Progenerant aquilae columbam.</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now touching our spirituall death and life, these sayings of
the Apostle would be thought upon.</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</note> We thus judge, that if one
died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they
which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him
which died for them and rose again.<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 2. 4, 5.</note> God who is rich in mercy,
for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead
in sins, hath quickned us together with Christ.<note n="f" place="margin">Col. 2. 13.</note> And you being dead
in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickned
together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.<note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
with Christ. Neverthelesse I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth
in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith
of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. <hi>From all
which we may easily gather, that if by the obedience and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of a bare man, though never so perfect, the most sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
medicine that could be thought upon should have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the curing of our wounds: yet all would be to no
purpose, we being found dead, when the medicine did come to
be applyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Physitian therefore must not onely be able to restore us
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55421:248"/>
unto health, but unto life it selfe: which none can doe but the
Father, Son, and holy Ghost; one God, blessed for ever. To
which purpose, these passages of our Saviour also are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
<note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 5. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>As the Father hath life in himself: so hath he given to
the Son to have life in himself.</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Joh. 6. 57.</note> 
                     <hi>As the living Father hath sent me,
and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live
by me.</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the living bread, which came down from heaven; if
any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that
I will give, is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi>
The substance whereof is briefly comprehended in this saying
of the Apostle:<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45.</note> 
                     <hi>The last</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickening spirit.</hi>
An <hi>Adam</hi> therefore and perfect Man must he have been; that
his flesh, given for us upon the Crosse, might bee made the
conduict to convey life unto the world: and <hi>a quickening spirit</hi>
he could not have been, unlesse hee were <hi>God,</hi> able to make
that flesh an effectuall instrument of life by the operation of his
blessed Spirit. For, as himself hath declared,<note n="m" place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note> 
                     <hi>It is the Spirit
that quickneth;</hi> without it, <hi>the flesh would profit nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the point of similitude and likenesse: we read of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>after his fall, that he</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 5. 3.</note> begat <hi>a son</hi> in his own likenesse, after
his image: <hi>and generally, as well touching the carnall as the
spirituall generation, our Saviour hath taught us this lesson,</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Joh. 3. 6.</note> That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of
the Spirit, is spirit. <hi>Whereupon the Apostle maketh this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
betwixt those who are born of that first man, who is
of the earth earthy, and of the second man, who is the Lord
from heaven.</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 48, 49.</note> As is the earthy, such are they that are earthy; and
as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly: and as wee
have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of
the heavenly. <hi>We shall indeed hereafter bear it in full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
when</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> the Lord Jesus Christ shall change our base body,
that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body; according to the
working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
<hi>Yet in the mean time also, such a conformity is required in us
unto that heavenly man, that</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 20.</note> our conversation must be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whence we look for <hi>this</hi> Saviour: <hi>and that we must</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24.</note> put off,
concerning the former conversation, that old man, which is corrupt
according to the deceitfull lusts, and be renued in the spirit of our
mind; and put on the new man, which after God is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
and true holinesse. <hi>For as in one particular point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall
authority,</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 7.</note> the Man <hi>is said to be</hi> the image and glory
of God, <hi>and the</hi> Woman the glory of the Man: <hi>so in a more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
manner is</hi> Christ <hi>said to bee</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> the image of God, <hi>even</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> the brightnesse of his glory, and the expresse image of his person; <hi>and
we</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> to be conformed to his image, that he might be the first-born among
<hi>those</hi> many brethren, <hi>who in that respect are accounted</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 23.</note> the glory of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>We read in the holy story, that God<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 11. 17. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>took of the spirit which
was upon</hi> Moses, <hi>and gave it unto the seventy Elders;</hi> that they might
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55421:249"/>
bear the burden of the people with him, and that hee might not
bear it, as before hee had done, himself alone. It may bee, his
burden being thus lightned, the abilities that were left him for
government were not altogether so great, as the necessity of his
former imployment required them to have been: and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
vvhat vvas given to his assistants, might perhaps bee said
to bee taken from him. But wee are sure the case was otherwise
in him of whom now wee speak: unto whom<note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 3. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>God did not</hi> thus
<hi>give the Spirit by measure.</hi> And therefore although so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of beleevers doe continually receive this<note n="c" place="margin">Philip. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>supply of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Jesus Christ;</hi> yet neither is that fountain any way exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
nor the plenitude of that well-spring of grace any whit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
or diminished: it being Gods pleasure,<note n="d" place="margin">Col. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>That in him should
all fulnesse dwell;</hi> and that<note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>of his fulnesse all wee should receive,
grace for grace.</hi> That as in the naturall generation there is such a
correspondence in all parts betwixt the begetter and the Infant
begotten; that there is no member to bee seen in the Father, but
there is the like answerably to bee found in the Childe, although
in a farre lesse proportion; so it falleth out in this spirituall,
that for every grace which in a most eminent manner is found in
Christ, a like grace will appeare in Gods Childe, although in a far
inferiour degree; similitudes and likenesses being defined by the
Logicians to bee comparisons made in <hi>quality,</hi> and not in <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee are yet further to take it into our consideration, that by
thus enlivening and fashioning us according to his own image,
Christs purpose was not to raise a seed unto himself dispersedly
and distractedly, but to<note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 11. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>gather together in one, the Children of

                     <hi>bring all unto one head

                     <hi>the vail divided between

                  </p>
                  <p>The bond of this mysticall union betwixt Christ and us (as
<note n="l" place="margin">Sermon to the Commons house of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ann. 1620</hi>

                     <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> which being in him as the Head, is from thence
diffused to the spirituall animation of all his Members: and on
our part<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. &amp; 5. 5. &amp; 3. 11. Ephes. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the prime act of life wrought in those
who are capable of understanding by that same Spirit. Both
whereof must bee acknowledged to bee of so high a nature, that
none could possibly by such ligatures knit up so admirable a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but hee that was God Almighty. And therefore although
wee did suppose such a man might bee found who should perform
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55421:249"/>
the Law for us, suffer the death that was due to our offence and
overcome it; yea, and whose obedience and sufferings should be
of such value, that it were <hi>sufficient</hi> for the redemption of the
whole world: yet could it not be <hi>efficient</hi> to make us live by faith,
unlesse that Man had been able to send Gods Spirit to apply the
same unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which as no bare Man or any other Creature whasoever can

                     <note n="o" place="margin">Col. 2. 12. 2 Thess. 1. 11.</note> Paul, <hi>that it is the</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God, <hi>and a</hi> work of <hi>his</hi> power, <hi>even of that same power
wherewith Christ himself was raised from the dead. Which is
the ground of that prayer of his, that the</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 19, 20. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>eyes of our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
being enlightned, wee might know</hi> what is the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his power to us-ward who beleeve; according to the working of
his mighty power, which hee wrought in Christ when hee raised him
from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and every
Name that is named not onely in this World, but also in that to come:
and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to bee head over
all things to the Church, which is his body, the fulnesse of him that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all in all.</p>
                  <p>Yet was it fit also, that this <hi>Head</hi> should bee of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the <hi>Body</hi> which is knit unto it: and therefore that hee
should so bee God, as that hee might partake of our Flesh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
<note n="q" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>For wee are members of his body,</hi> saith the same Apostle;

by this mysticall and supernaturall union, wee are as truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with him, as the meate and drink wee take is with us;
when by the ordinary work of Nature, it is converted into our
own substance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this conjunction is immediately

                  <p>Upon this ground it is, that the Apostle telleth us, that wee

that is to say, his flesh.</hi> That as in the Tabernacle, there was no
passing from the Holy to the most Holy place, but by the vaile:
so now there is no passage to bee looked for from the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant

                     <hi>to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable

of the New Testament:</hi> who as the Head of the Church hath
power to<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>send forth all those ministring spirits, to minister for them
who shall bee Heirs of salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, wee are to take into our consideration, that as in things
concerning God, the main execution of our Saviours <hi>Priesthood</hi>
doth consist; so in things concerning man, hee exerciseth both his
<hi>Propheticall</hi> Office, whereby hee openeth the will of his Father
unto us, and his <hi>Kingly,</hi> whereby hee ruleth and protecteth us.
It was indeed a part of<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 33. 10. Hagg. 2. 11. Mal. 2. 7.</note> the <hi>Priests</hi> office in the Old Testament,

<note n="g" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Prophets</hi> as well as <hi>Apostles,</hi> are made a different degree from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

                     <hi>in sundry parts
and in sundry manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
hath in these last dayes spoken unto us by his Son</hi> Christ Jesus:
whom therefore hee stileth<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 3. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the Apostle,</hi> as vvell as <hi>the High Priest
of our profession; who was faithfull to him that appointed him, even
as</hi> Moses <hi>was in all his house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now</hi> Moses, <hi>wee know, had a singular preheminence above all
the rest of the Prophets: according to that ample testimony which
God himself giveth of him.</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Num. 12. 6, 7, 8.</note> If there bee a Prophet among you,
I the Lord will make my self known unto him in a vision, and will
speak unto him in a dream. My servant <hi>Moses</hi> is not so, who is
faithfull in all mine house: with him will I speak mouth to mouth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
aparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the
Lord shall he behold. <hi>And therefore wee finde, that our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in the execution of his Propheticall office is in a more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
manner likened unto</hi> Moses: <hi>which hee himself also did thus
foretell.</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 18. 15, 16, &amp;c. Act. 3. 22, 23.</note> The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from
the midst of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto mee; unto him yee shall
hearken. According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in
<hi>Horeb,</hi> in the day of the assembly, saying, Let mee not heare again
the voyce of the Lord my God; neither let mee see this great fire any
more, that I dye not. And the Lord said unto mee, They have well
spoken, that which they have spoken. I will raise them up a Prophet
from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55421:250"/>
his mouth, and hee shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
And it shall come to passe, that whosoever will not hearken unto my
words, which hee shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Prophet</hi> therefore must bee a Man raised from among his
Brethren the <hi>Israelites,</hi> (<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>of whom, as concerning the flesh,</hi> hee
came) who was to perform unto us, that which the Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
of <hi>Moses:</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 20. 19. Deut. 5. 25. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Speak thou to us, and wee will heare; but let
not God speak with us, lest wee die.</hi> And yet (that in this also wee
may see, how our Mediatour had the preheminence)<note n="p" place="margin">Exod. 34. 30, 32, 33.</note> when <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and all the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were to receive from the mouth
of <hi>Moses</hi> all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount, <hi>Sinai,
they were afraid to come nigh him,</hi> by reason of the glory of his shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
countenance: so that hee was fain to put a <hi>vaile</hi> over his
face, while hee spake unto them that which hee was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
But that which for a time was thus<note n="q" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7, 10 11, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>made glorious, had no
glory in respect of the glory that excelleth;</hi> and both the <hi>glory</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and the <hi>vaile</hi> which covered it, are now abolished in <hi>Christ:</hi>
the vaile of whose flesh doth so overshadow<note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>the brightnesse of his
glory,</hi> that yet under it wee may<note n="s" place="margin">Joh. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>behold his glory, as the glory of the
onely begotten of the Father;</hi> yea; and<note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>wee all with open face, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as in a glasse the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image,
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is daily effected by the power of the Ministery of the
Gospel, instituted by the authority, and seconded by the power,
of this our great Prophet: whose transcendent excellency beyond
<hi>Moses,</hi> (unto whom, in the execution of that function, hee was
otherwise likened) is thus set forth by the Apostle.<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> Hee is <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy of more glory then</hi> Moses, <hi>in as much as hee who hath buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the house hath more honour then the house. For every house is
builded by some one: but hee that built all things is God. And</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>verily was faithfull in all his house, as a servant, for a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those things which were to bee spoken after: but Christ, as the Son,
over his own house.</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> This house of God is no other then <hi>the Church
of the living God:</hi> whereof as hee is the onely <hi>Lord,</hi> so is hee also
properly the onely <hi>Builder.</hi> Christ therefore being both the <hi>Lord</hi>
and the<note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Builder</hi> of his Church, must bee God as well as Man:
which is the cause, why wee finde all the severall mansions of
this<note n="z" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>great house</hi> to carry the title indifferently of the<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Churches of
God,</hi> and the<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 16. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Churches of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, that there are other ministeriall <hi>builders,</hi> whom Christ
employeth in that service: this being not the least of those gifts
which hee bestowed upon men at his Triumphant Ascension into
Heaven, that<note n="c" place="margin">Ephe. 4. 11, 12.</note> hee gave not onely ordinary <hi>Pastours</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi>
but <hi>Apostles</hi> likewise, and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Evangelists;</hi> for the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministery, for the edifying
of the body of Christ.</hi> Which, what great power it required, hee
himself doth fully expresse in passing the graunt of this high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
unto his Apostles.<note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>All power is given unto mee in Heaven
and in Earth. Goe yee therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55421:251"/>
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded
you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the World.</hi>
Amen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>professeth of himself, that hee</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10,</note> laboured more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then all <hi>the rest of the Apostles:</hi> yet not I, <hi>saith hee,</hi> but the grace
of God which was with mee. <hi>And therefore although</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 9, 10</note> according to
that grace of God which was given unto him, <hi>hee denyeth not but
that,</hi> as a wise Master-builder, hee had laid the foundation; <hi>yet hee
acknowledgeth that they upon whom hee had wrought, were</hi> Gods
building, <hi>as well as</hi> Gods husbandry. <hi>For</hi> who, <hi>saith</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 5, 6, 7</note> 
                     <hi>hee,</hi> is <hi>Paul,</hi>
and who is <hi>Apollo,</hi> but Ministers by whom you beleeved, even as the
Lord gave to every man? I have planted, <hi>Apollo</hi> watered: but God
gave the increase. So then, neither is hee that planteth any thing, neither
hee that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two things therefore wee finde in our great</hi> Prophet, <hi>which doe
farre exceed the ability of any bare Man; and so doe difference him
from all the</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 1. 70.</note> Holy Prophets, which have been since the World began.
<hi>For</hi> first, <hi>wee are taught; that</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 11. 27.</note> no man knoweth the Father, save
the Son, and hee to whomsoever the Son will reveale him: <hi>and that</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Joh. 1. 18.</note> no man hath seen God at any time; <hi>but</hi> the only begotten Son, which
is in the bosome of the Father, hee bath declared him. <hi>Being in his</hi>
bosome, <hi>hee is become conscious of his secrets, and so out of his
own immediate knowledge, inabled to discover the whole will of
his Father unto us. Whereas alother Prophets and Apostles receive
their revelations at the second hand, and according to the grace
given unto them by the Spirit of Christ. Witnesse that place of
S.</hi> Peter, <hi>for the Prophets:</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 10, 11</note> Of which salvation the Prophets have
enquired, and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that
should come unto you; searching what or what manner of time <hi>THE SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT
OF CHRIST WHICH WAS IN THEM</hi> did signifie,
when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
should follow. <hi>And for the Apostles, those heavenly words which
our Saviour himself uttered unto them, whilst hee was among
them.</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Joh. 16. 13, 14, 15.</note> When the Spirit of Truth is come, hee will guide you into
all truth: for hee shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever hee shall
hear, that shall hee speak; and hee will shew you things to come. Hee shall
glorifie mee: for hee shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you. All things
that the Father hath, are mine: therefore said I, that hee shall take of
mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> all other Prophets and Apostles can doe no more (as
hath been said) but plant and water; onely <hi>God</hi> can give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease:
they may teach indeed and baptize; but unlesse Christ
were with them by the powerfull presence of his Spirit, they would
not bee able to save one soule by that Ministery of theirs. <hi>Wee,</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>as
lively stones, are built up a spirituall house:</hi> but,<note n="o" place="margin">Psalm. 127. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>except the Lord do
build this house, they labour in vaine that build it.</hi> For who is able
to breathe the Spirit of life into those dead stones, but hee, of whom
it is writen;<note n="p" place="margin">Joh. 5. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>The houre is comming, and now is, when the dead shall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55421:251"/>
hear the voyce of the Son of God; and they that heare it shall live.</hi> And
again:<note n="q" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead; and Christ
shall give thee light.</hi> Who can awake us out of this dead sleep,
and give light unto these blinde eyes of ours; but the Lord our
God, unto whom wee pray, that hee would<note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 13. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>lighten our eyes, lest
wee sleep</hi> the sleep <hi>of death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as a blinde man is not able to conceive the distinction of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
although the skilfullest man alive should use all the art hee
had to teach him; because hee wanteth the sense whereby that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is discernible: so<note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>the naturall man perceiveth not the things of
the Spirit of God (for they are foolishnesse unto him;) neither can hee
know</hi> them, <hi>because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> Whereupon the
Apostle concludeth, concerning himself and all his fellow-labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
that<note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>God who commanded the light to shine out of darknesse,
hath shined in our hearts;</hi> to give <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, in the face of Jesus Christ: but wee have this treasure in
earthen vessels; that the excellency of the power may bee of God, and not
of us.</hi> Our Mediatour therefore (who must<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>bee able to save them
to the uttermost that come unto God by him</hi>) may not want <hi>the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the power,</hi> whereby hee may make us capable of this high
knowledge of the things of God, propounded unto us by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of his servants: and consequently, in this respect also, must
bee <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There remaineth the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of our Redeemer: described thus
by the Prophet</hi> Isaiah.<note n="x" place="margin">Esa. 9. 7.</note> Of the increase of his government and peace
<hi>there shall bee</hi> no end, upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and upon his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
to order it, and to establish it with judgement and with justice,
from henceforth even for ever. <hi>And by Daniel:</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Dan. 7. 13, 14.</note> Behold, <hi>one</hi> like
the Son of man came with the clouds of Heaven, and came to the Ancient

him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations, and
Languages should serve him: His dominion is an everlasting domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which shall not passe away; and his kingdome <hi>that</hi> which shall not
be destroyed. <hi>And by the Angel</hi> Gabriel, <hi>in his ambassage to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                     <note n="z" place="margin">Luk. 1. 31, 32, 33.</note> Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth

                  <p>This is that new<note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 30. 9. Hos. 3. 5. Ezek. 34. 23. &amp; 37. 24.</note>
