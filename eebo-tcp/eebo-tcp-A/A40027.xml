            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> our red Regiment, of
the Train'd Bands marched into the new Artillery
ground, and from thence that night wee marched to
<hi>Brainford,</hi> and came thither about one a clocke in the
morning; from whence the next day many of our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
who ſeemed very forward and willing at the
firſt to march with us, yet upon ſome pretences and faire excuſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home againe hiring others to goe in their roome; others retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home againe the ſame night before they came to <hi>Brainford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Friday the 25 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wee advanced from <hi>Brainford</hi> to <hi>Vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
where our Regiments were Quartered there that night, and
marched away the next morning.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 26 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we advanced to a Towne 6 miles beyond
<hi>Vxbridge</hi> called <hi>Chaffan,</hi> where wee were quartered that night; at this
towne a ſouldier belonging to Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Tompſon</hi> was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
ſlaine by ſhooting off a musket by one of his fellow Souldiers
though at a great diſtance from him, yet ſhot him in the head where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee died.</p>
            <p>Sabbath day 27 <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we advanced from Chaffan neere to a village
called Cheſſun; this day the Blew Regiment of the Trained Bands,
and the three Regiments of the Auxiliary forces met us upon a great
Common about three miles from Cheſſun. our whole Regiment was
quartered at one Mr. Cheyneys houſe an Eſquire, where we were well
accommodated for Beere having great plenty, two or three hundred
of us this night-lay in one Barne.</p>
            <p>Monday the 28 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we advanced from thence to a towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Aſſon-Clinton</hi> a little village 3 miles from <hi>Aleſbury,</hi> wee continued
here one day and two nights.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 30 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wee advanced from thence to a village
<pb facs="tcp:54028:3"/>
called Clayden; this day the Lord Generalls Army and our Regiments
of the Trained Band, together with the Auxiliarie forces met at
<hi>Aleſbury;</hi> the great Guns were fired at every Fort about the Towne,
as the Lord Generall paſſed by: This was the Faſt day: our Regiment
was quartered this night at Sir <hi>Ralph Verneys</hi> Houſe a Parliament
man; his Father the Kings Standart-bearer was ſlain at Edge hill.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 31 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wee advanced from thence to a village
called <hi>Stretton-Araley;</hi> this night all our Brigade conſiſting of ſix Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments;
<hi>viz:</hi> Colonell <hi>Manwarings</hi> Red Regiment, two Regiments
of Trained Bands, and three of the Auxiliary, were all quartered at
this little village, it is conceived wee were in all of this Brigade about
5000. here was little proviſion either for Officers or ſouldiers, the night
before we came hither, the Cavaliers were at <hi>Biſter</hi> two miles from this
village and 6 miles from <hi>Oxford</hi> but were beaten out of it by our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and the Lord Generall with his army quartered there this night.</p>
            <p>Friday the 1 day of <hi>September,</hi> wee advanced from hence to a place
called <hi>Bayards-greene</hi> in <hi>Oxford ſhire,</hi> being three miles diſtant from
<hi>Brackley,</hi> and eight miles from <hi>Banbury,</hi> where our Brigade met my
Lord Generall with his whole Army; whereat was great ſhouting and
Triumph as he paſſed by to take a view of our Regiments the whole
Army being drawne up in their ſeverall Regiments, continued there
about an houre and then we marched away: It was a goodly and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſight to ſee the whole Army of Horſe and foot together; it is
conceived by thoſe that viewed our Army well that wee did conſiſt of
(to ſpeake of the leaſt) 15000 horſe and foot, ſome ſpeak of many more.
This day good newes was brought to us concerning <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter.</hi>
From hence we marched this day to a village called <hi>Souldern,</hi> foure
miles from <hi>Banbury,</hi> where our ſix Regiments that came from <hi>London</hi>
were Quartered, and my Lord Generall and the reſt of the Army were
Quartered about a little mile from us, at a Market town called <hi>Ano</hi> on
the hill; we were very much ſcanted of Victualls in this place.</p>
            <p>Saterday 2 <hi>Septem.</hi> wee advanced from hence to <hi>Hooknorton,</hi> 25 miles
from <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> at which Village our whole Brigade was quartered.
This day the Lord Generals Troops had ſome skirmiſh with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers;
it is reported there was eight ſlaine of the enemies party and
one on ours. From hence we marched away the next morning.</p>
            <p>Sabbath day 3 <hi>Septemb.</hi> wee advanced from hence to a little Village
called <hi>Addington</hi> about a mile from <hi>Stew</hi> the Old, the hithermoſt own
in Gloceſter-ſhire, and about 20 miles from Gloceſter; where
in our march this day, wee againe met the Lord Generalls Army,
upon a great common about halfe a mile from <hi>Chippingnorton;</hi> at
which place alſo our five Regiments departed from his Army; and
<pb facs="tcp:54028:3"/>
marched to the Village aforeſaid. The blew Regiment of the
Train'd bands marched in the van and tooke up the firſt quarter
in the town; the other 3 Regiments of the Auxiliary forces, were
quartered at the adjacent villages; whereupon our red Regiment
of the Trained Band was conſtrained to march halfe a mile fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to get quarter we were now in the Van of the whole Army,
having not ſo much as one Troope of Horſe quartered neer us:
but we were no ſooner in our quarters, and ſet downe our armes,
intending a little to refreſh our ſelves; but preſently there was an
Alarme beat up; and wee being the frontier Regiment neereſt
the enemy, were preſently all drawn up into a Body, and ſtood
upon our guard all that night, we were in great diſtraction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not any horſe to ſend out as Scouts, to give us any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
my Lord Generall with his Army lay at <hi>Chippingnorton,</hi>
about three miles behind us; who had an Alarm there given by
the enemy the ſame night alſo: Our Regiment ſtood in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
field all night, having neither bread nor water to refreſh our
ſelves, having alſo marched the day before without any ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
neither durſt we kindle any fire though it was a very cold
night.</p>
            <p>Munday 3 <hi>Septemb.</hi> we got ſome refreſhment for our ſouldiers,
which was no ſooner done, but news was brought to us, that the
enemy was within halfe a mile of the Town which proved to be
true, for preſently one rid downe to us having his horſe ſhot in
the neck all bloody, and told us the enemy was at the towns end;
alſo one Trooper ſlaine a quarter of a mile above the town, one
of our ſouldiers ſtript him, and brought his clothes to us: It was
a little open Village, the enemy might have come in upon us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way; therfore we conceiving it not ſafe to abide in the town,
drew up our Regiment preſently into a body, and marched into
a broad open field to the top of the hil, the blew Regiment of the
train'd Bands were quartered within leſſe than half a mile of us,
but came not up to us: Being come into the field we ſaw about
4 or <gap reason="illegible: blurred" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the enemies horſe ſurrounding of us, one rid poſt to
my Lord Generall to informe him of it One great body of their
horſe ſtood facing of us upon the top of the hill at our townes
end, within leſſe then a quarter of a mile from us, another great
body of their horſe was in the valley, upon our right flank as we
ſtood; and a third great ſquadron of their horſe were going up to
the top of a hill, in the reere of us; by all which it appeares, they
had an intent to have ſurrounded our City Regiments, and to
have cut us off; we ſtood and faced one another for the ſpace of
<pb facs="tcp:54028:4"/>
halfe an houre, then 6, or 7. of our men who had horſes, rod up
to them, and came within leſſe then musket ſhot, floriſhing their
ſwords, daring them, and one or two of our men fired upon their
forlorne hope: we had lyned the hedges with musketeers, which
they perceiving did not move towards our body, but only ſtood
and faced us. Then ſome of the Auxiliary forces came up to us, at
whoſe coming we gave a great ſhout: and then by and by after
we ſaw my Lord Generals forces comming down the hill about
a mile and halfe behind us: my Lord drevv out the forlorn hope
upon the hil as they came dovvn; who fired 3. or 4. Drakes againſt
the enemies horſe that were neer themon the top of the hil, that
were coming upon the reer of us, and made them retreat to the
reſt of the body, their intent was to have compaſted us in on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſide, but the <hi>Lord</hi> prevented them, they might have ſpoiled our
whole Regiment, had they in the morning come down upon us
when we were taking a little food to refreſh our ſelves, the enemy
being then but half a mile off; a great many of the Cavaliers lay
all night, within leſſe then a mile of us, which we perceived in our
march the next day, I hope the mercy of that day, wil not bee
forgotten.</p>
            <p>When this was done, my L. Generals forces marched up to our
Brigade: when they were come we drew forth our <hi>Forlorn hope,</hi> and
marched up to the body of their Horſe that ſtood facing us on
the top of the hill: we fired ſome Drakes at them, they retreated:
then the Lord Generall drew up his great Guns, they faced us
againe, we fired two great Peeces of Ordnance at them, and then
they retreated up to the Towne of Stow, and drew up all their
horſe into a body, and ſtood upon the ſide of the hill facing us:
then we let flye two or three of our greateſt Ordnance at them;
they all fled, and wee purſued them and followed them three
miles: Then they ſtood and faced the Lord Generall againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the going downe of the Sun, we fired at them a great while,
marching up towards them five or ſixe Regiments together, all
in a body, about 800 or 1000 abreſt, ſixe deep, we having roome
enough, it being a brave champian country: which goodly ſhew
did ſo much the more daunt the enemy, that (as it is reported)
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſwore, hee thought <hi>all the Round-heads in England
were there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Skirmiſh we loſt but one man, who was flaine by
our owne Cannon through his owne negligence, and another
ſore burnt and hurt by the ſame Peece. When we came to Stow,
the Cavaleers reported that they had killed twenty of our men,
<pb facs="tcp:54028:4"/>
and we two of theirs; but we heare there were ſixe of their men
ſlaine, ſome horſes killed, and five priſoners taken. Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi>
was there, and ſome ſay the Lord of <hi>Holland</hi> alſo. Our men
purſuing them skirmiſhed till nine of the clocke at night; wee
marched after them till twelve of the clocke at night: we lay all
in the open field, upon the plowd-land, without ſtraw, having
neither bread nor water, yet God enabled our Souldiers to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
it cheerfully, there was not one feeble ſicke perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, but was able to march with us the day following.</p>
            <p>Tuſeday <hi>September</hi> 25. we advanced from that field neare to a
Towne called Preſtbury, within ſight of Gloceſter, about ſeven
miles from it: This day the whole Army marching together, it
fell to our red Regiment of the Trained-bands to march in the
Reare of the Waggons, and had charge of them: about ſixe of
the clocke the Lord Generall comming to the top of a high
mountaine or hill, called Presbury-hill, where we might ſee the
City of Gloceſter, he commanded foure or five great Peeces of
Ordnance to be fired: ſome ſay it was againſt the Cavaleers who
were about a mile off, in the Towne below the hill: others ſay
it was to give intelligence to Gloceſter of our approaching to
their reliefe. The Army marched downe the hill, and haſtened
to the adjacent Villages for <hi>Quarter,</hi> but before the Waggons
could come to the top of the hill, night drawing on it began to
be very darke, ſo that our Waggons and Carriages could not get
downe the hill, many of them were overthrowne and broken, it
being a very craggy ſteep and dangerous hill, ſo that the reſt of
the Waggons durſt not adventure to goe downe, but ſtayed all
night there: ſixe or ſeven horſes lay dead there the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that were killed by the overthrow of the Waggons: our
red Regiment having charge of the Waggons, were conſtrained
to lye all night upon the top of this mountaine, it being a moſt
terrible tempeſtuous night of winde and raine, as ever men lay
out in, we having neither hedge nor tree for ſhelter, nor any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance
of food, or fire: we had by this time marched ſixe daies
with very little proviſion; for no place where we came was able
to releeve our Army, we leaving the Rode all the way, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
through poore little villages: our ſouldiers in their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this day would run halfe a mile or a mile before, where
they heard any water was ſuch ſtraits and hardſhip our Citizens
formerly knew not; yet the Lord that called us out to doe his
worke, enabled us to undergoe ſuch hardneſſe as hee brought us
to. This evening the Lord Generall was faine to fight for his
<pb facs="tcp:54028:5"/>
Quarter, and beat the enemy out of it, at a market-Towne called
Cheltnam, five miles from Gloceſter, and two miles from this
hill; about midnight we had two Alarms upon this hill, in the
midſt of all the ſtorme and raine, which together with the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the night made it ſo much the more dreadfull, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
cauſed a great diſtraction among our Souldiers, every one
ſtanding upon his guard, and fearing his fellow Souldier to bee
his enemy. Many other particular ſad ſtories of this tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtormy night I leave to the relation of others: one young
man of the Colonels company was ſhot in this confuſion upon
this hill, whoſe death will be much lamented by his Parents and
Friends, from whom he received a Letter but a few dayes before
to returne home.</p>
            <p>The next morning being Wedneſday <hi>Sept.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. our Souldiers
came downe from that hill into the village aforeſaid, being wet
to the very skin, but could get little or no refreſhing every houſe
being ſo full of Souldiers: The Cavaleers were in the Towne
but the day before. Wee ſtayed here but two or three houres
that morning, and then wee had an Alarm that the Cavaleers
were neere the Towne with a great body of horſe: We were all
preſently drawne up into a body in the field; our ſouldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to complaine pitifully, being even worn out and quite ſpent
for want of ſome refreſhing, ſome complaining they had not eat
or drunke in two dayes, ſome longer time. Yeſterday the enemy
raiſed their ſiege from before Gloceſter: this day our two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Trained Bands marched to a little village called
Norton, three miles wide of Gloceſter, and foure miles from
Teuxbury, where our Souldiers had ſome reaſonable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and refreſhment: in this village wee had many Alarms:
we continued here two dayes and two nights.</p>
            <p>Thurſday <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. the Kings forces fell upon ſome of our troops
of horſe at Winſcombe, they being ſecure, the enemy killed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, and tooke many priſoners, and ſome Colours: the
Regiments of our horſe there did belong to Col. <hi>Vere</hi> and Col.
<hi>Goodwin.</hi> The Auxiliary Regiments were quartered within two
miles where this was done. This night about ſeven of the clock
there came a comand for our Regiments of the Trained-bands
to march five miles back againe in the night but it being a very
darke night, and our men worne out and ſpent with their former
marching, they refuſed to goe; but next morning being Friday
<hi>Sept.</hi> 8. we did. The Lord Generall with the whole Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
into Gloceſter this day.
<pb facs="tcp:54028:5"/>
The Citie was exceeding full of horſe and foote: the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
this Towne a full moneth and three dayes. They had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtrong aſſaults againſt it, and battered ſome of their workes;
&amp; in two or three places they had begun to undermine the gates,
and out-workes, but were met with by the Citie forces, who did
undermine within to meet them: without they ſhott many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes
of great weight, which when they fell in the Citie were
red as fire; yet bleſſed be God, kild not one man therewith; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tore up the ground as if a Beare had been rooting up the earth:
The Inhabitants in the Citie report that the enemy ſhot 140 ſhot
great and ſmall in one day, and yet killed neither man woman nor
childe; they loſt but about thirtie in this Citie during the time of
this ſiege; moſt of which, as is reported, were ſhot in the head, in
peeping through ſome holes at the enemy; wee found very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reſpect and entertainment in this Citie, they being very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of our coming; wee abode here fryday-night and Saturday,
and marched away on Sabbath day-morning: the Lord Generall
left in this Citie three great pieces of Ordnance, as alſo many
ſcore barrells of powder, with match and bullet proportionable,
furniſhing them to their hearts deſire.</p>
            <p>Sabbath day <hi>Septemb.</hi> 10. the whole army advanced from <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
to <hi>Tewksburie,</hi> where wee abode foure dayes and five nights,
till <hi>Gloceſter</hi> had provided themſelves of come and other proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the enemy had cut off from the Citie all their pipes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and burnt their Mills: My Lord Generall ſummoned this
Towne of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> and demanded the twentieth part of their
eſtates for the reliefe of <hi>Glocester.</hi> Wee were at this Towne five
dayes, from Sabbath day till fryday <hi>Septemb.</hi> 15. On thurſday-dayesnight the enemy did fall upon ſome of our troopes of horſe, who
were quartered about three miles from <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
belonging to Sir <hi>James Ramſey,</hi> they ſlew many of our men,
and took many others priſoners. Wee took foure of them priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
but the greateſt loſſe was ſuſtained on our ſide. Before wee
marched from this Towne, the Lord Generall gave order for the
making of a bridge over the River <hi>Severne</hi> neere <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> as if
our intention had been to march with our army over there to
<hi>Worceſter;</hi> which cauſed the enemy to draw their forces thither,
as a place of refuge: The wiſdome and policie of the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and Counſell of warre, as alſo their great care for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our Army, is highly to be commended and never to be
forgotten; and may ſerve to ſtop the mouths of all ſuch as ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:54028:6"/>
hereafter be opened againſt him: for had the enemy knowne
which way we had marched, they might have had us at a great
advantage, by gaining the hills; wee being now in the vale of
<hi>Eſum,</hi> and all our great Ordnance and Carriages to be drawn up
thoſe hills, they might have kept us there all this winter, &amp; ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our army: but bleſſed be God, we all marched away with
ſafetie. One that was preſent at <hi>Eſum,</hi> where the King with his
Army lay, affirmes that when tydings came to the King that wee
were marched from <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> they did ſtamp and ſwear and
curſe their Scouts exceedingly, that they gave them no better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of our departure. And the ſame day we marched from
<hi>Tewksbury</hi> the King with his Army and traine of Artillery mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
from <hi>Eſum</hi> after us, as will appeare in the enſuing matter.</p>
            <p>Fryday <hi>Septemb.</hi> 15. our whole Army advanced from <hi>Tewks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
to <hi>Ciceter,</hi> alias <hi>Cirenciſter</hi> 17 miles we marched all night, and
ſate down before it about three aclock in the morning: when we
came thither Sir <hi>Robert Pye</hi> marched up to the Towne, and with
ſome Muskettiers he gave fire upon the Centinells, killed one of
them, and wounded the other; Sir <hi>Robert</hi> himſelf received a ſhot
in the arme: the Cavaliers yeelded the town and deſired quarter:
wee took 225. priſoners, whereof 10. were Commanders, we ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them two and two together with Match, and brought them
along with us: we took alſo 27 waggon-load of proviſion, which
the Cavaliers had provided for the reliefe of their own Army:
they had taken the School-houſe, belonging to the Towne, and
made it their ſtore-houſe, to lay in ſuch proviſion as they made
the Countrey to bring in: they ſlew one man of ours, who was
piſtold by one that took him priſoner: we killed 2. or 3. of them.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>Septemb.</hi> 16. we advanced from <hi>Ciceter</hi> five miles to a
village called <hi>Letton,</hi> where our <hi>London</hi>-Briggade was quartered
that night; the Lord Generall with his Army quartered a mile
further at a Market-towne in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> called <hi>Cricklet;</hi> at the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
aforeſaid were ten cart-load of Cavaliers, who were ſick and
lame, and brought thither to be quartred, who when they heard
we were marching to this place, they then found their leggs and
run away: this day we had a wet march, and in the night a falſe
alarm.</p>
            <p>Sabbath day <hi>Septemb.</hi> 17. we marched from <hi>Cricklet</hi> to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-towne
called <hi>Swindowne</hi> 8. miles. This morning newes was
brought that the Cavaliers were come to <hi>Ciceter,</hi> and had taken
and kild many of our men, who ſtayed behind drinking and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
<pb facs="tcp:54028:6"/>
to march with their Colours: who are not much to be
pittied: this day we drove along with our army about 1000 ſheep
and 60 head of Cattell, which were taken from Malignants and
Papiſts in the Country for the maintenance of our army: 87 ſheep
was allotted for our red Regiment, but wee afterwards loſt them
all, when we came to fight; it being every mans care then to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himſelfe, and to ſee to the ſafetie of the Army: this night our
<hi>London</hi>-Briggade was quartred 2 miles beyond the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls
quarters at a little poore village called <hi>Chizelton,</hi> where wee
could get no accommodation either for meat or drink, but what
we brought with us in our ſnapſacks: moſt of us quartred in the
open feild, it being a very cold froſty night, wee marched away
hence the next morning.</p>
            <p>Munday <hi>Septemb.</hi> 18. we advanced from this village about two
miles to a place called <hi>Abern-chaſe,</hi> where newes was brought to
the Lord Generall, that the enemy was coming upon us with a
great body of horſe, which cauſed the Lord Generall to make a
ſtand, our whole Army being in a deep valley, and the enemy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hills on our left flank, we drewup all our Army into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the top of the hill, where we had a full view of the enemy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
againſt us: there appeared a great body of their horſe; if was
conceived there was 7 or 8000 but no foot that we could diſcerne;
we ſtood a while and faced them; then one ſmall body of horſe as
a forlorn hope marched up the hill to them, and fired upon them,
and then retreated to their main body in the valley; the enemy
followed our horſe in their retreat, firing at them all the way very
feircely; then we fired ſome Drakes at their horſe, but did little
execution; then our body of foot was drawne downe from this
hill to the top of another high hill, where we ſtood and faced the
enemy, having a full view of all that was don between our horſe
and theirs: our foot were not ingaged at all in this fight, except
two Regiments onely: Then Collonell <hi>Meldrams</hi> and Colonell
<hi>Harvies</hi> troops drew up in a body &amp; gave the enemy a very feirce
charge, which was performed with as brave courage and valour
as ever men did, and then wheeled about to a Regiment of our
foot that ſtood in the reer of them, the enemy purſued them in
their retreat, skirmiſhing one at another all the way: what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was ſlain in this fight is not yet known: here Cap. <hi>Willet</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a ſhot from the enemy, of which wound he is ſince dead: we
loſt no other man of note in this fight: one man of great note
and eſteem of the enemies partie was here ſlaine, Marqueſſe <hi>de la
<pb facs="tcp:54028:7"/>
Veel,</hi> his father is Lord high Marſhall of <hi>France,</hi> and chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in the feild: we took up his body and carried it to <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerford;</hi>
I viewed his wounds, he received three ſhot in his body
from us, one in his right pap, another in the ſhoulder, and a third
in the face: from this place all their horſe gathered into a body
when it begun to be dark, and ſo ours likewiſe, and wee marched
away that night to <hi>Hungerford</hi> 5 miles: our red Regiment with
ſome other Regiments were quartred a mile on this ſide <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
at a little village called <hi>Shelton;</hi> thoſe that marched in the
reer of the Army, were marching this 5 miles all night: we were
much diſtreſſed for want of ſleep, as alſo for all other ſuſtenance;
it was a night of much raine, we were wet to the skin: this day
we took 25 Cavaliers at <hi>Hungerford,</hi> whereof one was ſlaine.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 19. we advanced from <hi>Hungerford</hi> to a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Embry,</hi> about a mile and halfe from <hi>Nubury:</hi> the Lord
Generall had intent to have quartered at <hi>Nubury</hi> that night, but
the King got into the Town that day before, and ſo we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
This morning a Trumpetter came from the King to the
Lord Generall, to deſire that Chyrurgions and Doctors might
have free acceſſe from them to the Marqueſſe that we had taken.
But the Meſſenger came to late: for the Marqueſſe was paſt their
cure. The Lord Generall told him, if they pleaſed to ſend for his
body, they might have it. The death of this Marqueſſe hath
much inraged the enemy, being one whom they did highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.
This night our whole Army quartered in the open field;
we had no proviſion but what little every one had in his Snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack.
We had now marched many dayes and nights with little
food, or any ſuſtenance, and little ſleep. This night the King
ſent a challenge to the Lord Generall, to give him battell the next
morning, which accordingly was performed; and in the night
our enemies gained the hills where they intended to give us bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
they planted their Ordnance, got all advantages they could
deſire, before our Army marched up to them: Yet now wee ſee
there is neither wiſedome, nor policie, nor ſtrength, againſt the
Lord; yea, had not the Lord himſelfe been on our ſide, they had
ſwallowed us up quick, ſo great was their rage and fury ſtirred
up againſt us, they being confident of the victory before we came
to fight: But let not him that puts on his harneſſe boaſt as he that
puts it off. For it was not our owne arme that ſaved us, but the
right hand of the Lord became glorious in that day, to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a glorious name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54028:7"/>
The next morning, <hi>Septem.</hi> 20. very early before day, we had
drawn up all our Army in their ſeverall Regiments, and marched
away by break of day; and then advancing towards the enemy
with moſt cheerfull and couragious ſpirits: The Lord <hi>Roberts</hi>
ſouldiers had begun to skirmiſh with them before we came up to
the enemy; which we hearing, put us to a running march till wee
ſweat again, haſtening to their reliefe and ſuccour. When wee
were come up into the field, our two Regiments of the trained
Bands were placed in open Campania upon the right wing of the
whole Army. The enemy had there planted 8 pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and ſtood in a great body of Horſe and Foot, wee being
placed right oppoſite againſt them, and far leſſe then twice Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
ſhot diſtance from them. They began their battery againſt us
with their great Guns, above halfe an houre before we could get
any of our Guns up to us; our Gunner dealt very ill with us, delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to come up to us: our noble Colonell <hi>Tucker</hi> fired one peece
of Ordnance againſt the enemy, and aiming to give fire the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, was ſhot in the head with a Cannon bullet from the
enemy. The blew Regiment of the trained Bands ſtood upon
our right wing, and behaved themſelves moſt gallantly. Two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of the Kings Horſe which ſtood upon their right flanke
a far off, came fiercely upon them, and charged them two or three
times, but were beat back with their Muskettiers, who gave them
a moſt deſperate charge, and made them flie. This day our whole
Army wore green boughes in their hats, to diſtinguiſh us from
our enemies; which they perceiving, one regiment of their Horſe
had got green boughes, &amp; rid up to our regiments crying, Friends,
friends; but we let flie at them, and made many of them and their
horſes tumble, making them flie with a vengeance. The enemies
Canon did play moſt againſt the red Regiment of trained Bands,
they did ſome execution amongſt us at the firſt, and were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dreadfull when mens bowels and brains flew in our faces:
But bleſſed bee God that gave us courage, ſo that we kept our
ground, and after a while feared them not, our Ordnance did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good execution upon them: for we ſtood at ſo neer a diſtance
upon a plain field, that we could not lightly miſſe one another:
We were not much above halfe our Regiments in this place; for
we had 60 Files of Muskettiers drawn off for the forlorn hope,
who were ingaged againſt the enemy in the field upon our left
Fank. Where moſt of the Regiments of the Army were in fight,
they had ſome ſmall ſhelter of the hedges and bankes, yet had a
<pb facs="tcp:54028:8"/>
very hot fight with the enemy, &amp; did good execution, an <gap reason="illegible: blurred" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to it as bravely as ever men did. When our two regiments of the
trained Bands had thus plaied againſt the enemy for the ſpace of
three hours, or thereabout, our red Regiment joyned to the Blew
which ſtood a little diſtance from us upon our left Flank, where
we gained the advantage of a little hill, which we maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemy halfe an hour: two Regiments of the enemies
foot fought againſt us all this while to gain the hill, but could not.
Then two regiments of the enemies horſe, which ſtood upon our
right Flank came fiercely upon us, and ſo ſurrounded us, that wee
were forced to charge upon them in the front and reere, and both
Flanks, which was performed by us with a great deal of courage
and undauntedneſſe of ſpirit, inſomuch that wee made a great
ſlaughter among them, and forced them to retreat; but preſently
the two regiments of the enemies foot in this time gained the hill,
and came upon us before wee could well recover our ſelves, that
we were glad to retreat a little way into the field, till we had ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
up our men, and put them into their former poſture, and then
came on again. If I ſhould ſpeak any thing in the praiſe and high
commendations of theſe two regiments of the trained Bands, I
ſhould rather obſcure and darken the glory of that courage and
valour God gave unto them this day, they ſtood like ſo many
ſtakes againſt the ſhot of the Cannon, quitting themſelves like
men of undaunted ſpirits, even our enemies themſelves being
judges. It might be expected that ſomething ſhould be ſpoken of
the noble and valiant ſervice performed by the reſt of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Army both horſe and foot; but their courage &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
it ſelf ſpeaks, which was performed by them that day, our
men fighting like Lions in every place, the great ſlaughter made
amongſt the enemies teſtifies. My noble and valiant Captaine
<hi>George Maſſie,</hi> who was with the forlorn hope, received a ſhot in
the back from the enemy, of which wound he is ſince dead. This
26. of <hi>September (hinc illae lachrymae)</hi> we loſt about 60 or 70 men in
our red Regiment of the trained Bands, beſides wounded men,
we having the hotteſt charge from the enemies Cannon of any
regiment in the Army. Alſo that worthy and valint Gentleman
Capt. <hi>Hunt</hi> was ſlain in this battell, whoſe death is much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Theſe two poore regiments were the very objects of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
battery that day, and they have ſince made their boaſt of it.
It is conjectured by moſt, that the enemy loſt four for one: 70.
chief Commanders were ſlain on their ſide. This is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb facs="tcp:54028:8"/>
that they did acknowledge themſelves to be beaten. It is credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by thoſe that were this day in the Kings army, that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
brought up a regiment of Foot and another of horſe into the field, and
gave fire to two peeces of Ordnance, riding up and down all that day in a
ſouldiers gray coat. The next day I viewed the dead bodies: there lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
100 ſtript naked in that field where our 2 regiments ſtood in battalia.
This night the enemy conveyed away about 30. cart load of maimed and
dead men, as the towne-people credibly reported to us, and I think they
might have carried away 20 cart load more of their dead men the next
morning; they buried 30 in one pit, 14 lay dead in one ditch: this battaile
continued long; it begun about ſix aclock in the morning, and continued
till paſt 12 aclock at night: in the night the enemy retreated to the towne
of <hi>Newbury,</hi> and drew away all their Ordnance; we were in great diſtreſſe
for water, or any accommodation to refreſh our poore Souldiers, yet the
Lord himſelfe ſuſtained us that we did not faint under it; we were right
glad to drink in the ſame water where our horſes did drink, wandering up
and downe to ſeek for it. Our word this day was <hi>Religion,</hi> theirs was <hi>Queen
Mary in the field:</hi> The great goodneſſe of God, in giving us victory this day
is ſo much the more remarkable from theſe three conſiderations: Firſt, that
great diſadvantage we had this day, in caſe we had been beat by the enemy,
we having no place of retreat for ſafety neerer then <hi>Glocester,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
30 miles: whereas our enemies had poſſeſſion of <hi>Newbury,</hi> and in a
manner of the whole Countrey round about: ſecondly, we had great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of proviſion for our Army, having marched many dayes and nights
with little food or ſleep, or any refreſhment; had not God fed us with the
bread of our enemies which we took at <hi>Ciceter,</hi> we could not without a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
providence of God have been able to ſubſiſt, whereas our enemies had
the town of <hi>Newbury,</hi> and the Country all about for their relief. Thirdly, we
had a great diſadvantage by giving battell in that place the enemy had
made choice of their ground, planted their Ordnance, gained all advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
they could deſire. Beſide many other diſadvantages on our part, which
I forbeare to relate; yet God gave us the victory, and made our enemies
flie before us, that we kept the field all night. The Lord Generall deſerves
perpetuall honor by his wiſe, valiant, and worthy managing of this dayes
battle, as alſo no leſſe praiſe and commendation to the reſt of the councel of
war. Many more particular paſſages might here be inſerted, but I proceed.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, <hi>Sept.</hi> 21. after we had buried our dead, we marched fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this field
with our whole army to a town called the <hi>Veal,</hi> 11 miles, and 4 miles from
<hi>Redding;</hi> where in our march this day, our enemy purſuing of us, fell upo our
reer in a narrow lane about a mile and halfe from a village called <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſon,</hi>
they came upon us with a great body of foot and horſe: our <hi>London</hi>
Briggade marched in the reer, and a forlorn hope of 600 Muskettiers in the
<pb facs="tcp:54028:9"/>
reere of them, beſides a great number of cur horſe: but our horſe which
brought up our reere, durſt not ſtand to charge the enemy, but fled, running
into the narrow lane, routed our own foot, trampling many of them under
their horſe feet, crying out to them, <hi>Away, away, every man ſhift for his life,
you are all dead men;</hi> which cauſed a moſt ſtrange confuſion amongſt us.
We fired 10 or 12 Drakes at the enemy, but they came upon us very feirce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
having theirfoot on the other ſide of the hedges; many of our waggons
were overthrowne and broken: others cut their traces and horſe-harneſſe,
and run away with their horſes, leaving their waggons &amp; carriages behind
them: our foot fired upon the enemies horſe very bravely, and ſlew many
of them; ſome report above 100 and not 10 of ours: ſome that we took pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners

together with the Aldermen of the Citie met us at Temple-barr, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

God for our ſafe returne: Thus God that called us forth to doe his worke,
brought us through many ſtraits, dilivered us from the rage and inſolency
of our adverſaries, made them turne their backes with ſhame, giving us
victory, and cauſing us to return home joyfully.</p>
