         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Giuing therefore Fooles leaue to blatter against Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
(as if Gods reason in his <hi>Works,</hi> should be against
the reason of his <hi>Word,)</hi> let mee proceed.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Argus</hi> they attributed 100. eyes; as to <hi>Briaceus</hi>
100. handes: not properly, but figuratiuely (euen as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
saying:<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The heart of a wise man is at his right

implying, that the Prophane (with <hi>Argus)</hi> need many
eyes or watchmen, for securing such a skittish companion,
as was <hi>Samsons</hi> Heifer: as also, that Combaters with
Diuine powers, haue need of many hands to helpe them.
But all in vaine, seeing the eyes of the first, will be put out;
and the hands of the second, wilbe broken: much like to
the iudgement which <hi>Zechary</hi> signifieth to come vpon
the Idol-shepheard,<note place="margin">Zech. 11. 7.</note> namely, a Sword vpon his right Eye
and Arme; insomuch as his Arme shalbe dried vp, and
his right Eye darkned. In the assurance whereof, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my opposition to fanatique, phrenetike spirits.</p>
            <p>The Gentile-artists, did many times vnto men, giue
the title of <hi>God,</hi> (as the Scriptures giue vnto Statesmen)
and so they did vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> for his 12. famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts;
which may be reduced to two kindes: First, for
his conquering of deuowring Beastes; which indeed were
Men as sauage as Beastes, tyrannicall Vsurpers: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for his sweeping away of much Doung with a Torrent;
which was, an expulsion of euill Manners and Customes,
by the clearenesse of good Counsaile and holsome Lawes.
Many we haue, that will say, how by their place they be
<hi>Gods:</hi> but very few that shew themselues gracious and
<pb facs="tcp:8445:3"/>
beneficial to Church &amp; Common-wealth, as Gods should;

rise vp against such in iudgement.</p>
            <p>The office of <hi>Priesthood</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was of
such great respect, as oftentimes the Kingdome was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto it:<note n="*" place="margin">Fenestella ex Virgil.</note>

When Famine pinched the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> to the forcing
of all sortes, to set sale of all for Bread-corne, there was
due prouision made for the Priestes. For these that there
doe turne <hi>Cohanim</hi> Princes, doe it (in my iudgement)
not onely against the very heart of the words proprietie,
but against the consonance of all Storie. And were the
Heathen, euen by <hi>Nature</hi> so led, to preferre their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie?
The doctrine of <hi>Grace,</hi> doth teach it much more.
But a number, as if they were not onely deuoyde of Grace,
but also depriued of good Nature, do so cast their cardes,
as if any starue, the Minister shall: and if any amongest
Clunchpokes and Swaggerers, be thrust downe to the
tayle of the Table, it must be the Minister. But as the
Heathen in this point also, shall arise vp in iudgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such: so, I pray you, from whence ariseth this euill?
<hi>Sat scio,</hi> and let me speake plainely.</p>
            <p>This euill ariseth sometimes from our selues, when the
greater hath small respect of the lesser:<note place="margin">From whence the contempt of Ministers ariseth.</note> for that noted of
the vulgar, is as a document for hauing such in lesser esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Secondly, this base estimate of Ministers, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
also, from the consideration of their pouertie; and
their pouertie is the more, by reason some Nouelistes haue
<pb facs="tcp:8445:4"/>
taught Ciuill Gouernours, to spoyle Mother-church of her
Dowrie, saying; that the same is an Idolothyte and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
            <p>And hereupon it was, that the <hi>Separists</hi> did
at first in their secret Conuenticles, appoynt their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
to stand at the Chamber dore, at the peoples out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
with their Hats in hand (much like after the fashion
of a Play-house) into the which they put their <hi>voluntary.</hi>
But comming beyonde seas, where a man might haue
seauen Doyts for a penny, it fell out, howsoeuer their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
(at the casting in) did make a great clangor, the
<hi>Summa totalis</hi> ouer seene, the maisters of the Play, came
to haue but a few pence to their share. Whereupon, a broad
Dish (reasonable flat) was placed in the middest of their
conuention, that when the voluntarie was cast in, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might obserue the quantitie. But this way serued not
the turne, for a few doyts rushing in vpon the sodaine,
could not easily be obserued, of what quantity it might be.
Vpon this, the Pastor gaue out, that if (besides giftes
from others abroad) they would not make him<note n="*" place="margin">Who was Micahs Leuit now?</note> 
               <hi>Tenne
pounds</hi> yearely at least, he would leaue them, as vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Gospell. Then they stickle, for feare of a fall;
and <hi>Holder</hi> the Glouer must giue sixe Styuers a weeke
for his part: <hi>George Cl.</hi> the Bricklayer, more Styuers
for his part, by reason that he had good doinges: and so
others accordingly. The Glouer complaines of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Cesse, and therefore sayd; that hee would for
<hi>England. &amp;c.</hi> But to leaue their giddie deuises: At

would bee very holy, when they may haue it wholy.

            <p>A third cause of the Ministers contempt, hath
arisen from our <hi>Syncerians,</hi> who haue made it a very
small matter, to preach vpon the Scriptures: holding
euery howers talke, a Sermon: Insomuch as, a number
would not goe to meate (if a few were present of their

Preaching,) did exceedingly dislike it; saying of that,
and of some Pin-sellers and Pedlers that then were put

            <q>—Hinc, hinc procul ite Prophani.</q>
            <p>And heere let me remember a triuiall Obiection cast in
by the <hi>Brownist</hi> and such other. They first affirme, that
these materiall Churches (in their phraze, <hi>Synagogues)</hi>
were originally, euen from the very foundation, deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Idolatrie: and therfore, in the second place (from
their vnderstanding of <hi>Deut. 12. 1. &amp;c.</hi>) they conclude
them to be Idolothytes; and so our duties to pull them
downe. Some others of them haue taught that they may
be conuerted for ciuill vse, to Barnes, or Stables. Nor is
this latter opinion, otherwise then (wel-ny) vniuersall
amongst them.</p>
            <p>I might answere them thus: First, agree flatly on the
poynt your selues, and then I will shape an answere.
Secondly, seeing the most &amp; principall of you do hold,
that they may be conuerted to Ciuill vses (whereupon at
<hi>Campin</hi> and <hi>Narden</hi> in <hi>Netherland,</hi> you were contented
to dwell in <hi>Monasteries,</hi> and so did) I might demaunde,
how that standeth good, with <hi>Deut.</hi> 12? Yea, I could
thirdly say, they themselues are one in opinion, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in action; for in such Monasteries (raysed vp in far
more corrupt times, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were the Churches) themselues
did conuene weekely, for acting their publique Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Yet I must needes confesse, that old <hi>Abbot</hi> (who
was of opinion, that the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure,
and had by such course sent a Diuell among the
<pb facs="tcp:8445:10"/>
               <hi>Brownists,</hi> for stirring vp amongst them all cutthroate
contentions) he would neither enter such place for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
exercise, nor any other ciuill respect.</p>
            <p>But alas sillie soules, the Commaundement in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.
for <hi>Israels</hi> pulling downe all Idolatrous places, was not
meerely Morall and perpetuall; but stood in force for
the time, wherein one house (as Tabernacle or Temple)
was alotted to the Lords spirituall worship. For they
were pulled downe, for teaching and driuing all people,
to that <hi>One place,</hi> where God put his name. As God gaue
no such Commaundement to his people, before he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
<hi>One</hi> such publique place to be repayred vnto;
so, neither after the Lord abolished that one place, was
the other Commaundement enforced. Nay, the Apostle
vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> (as opposing to that) sayth; that now, <hi>It

               <hi>Peter</hi> then preached (and that was<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 4. Math. 7. 24.</note> Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
hee would builde his Church; against which,
Hel-gates should not preuaile, cannot be vnderstood,
that hee speakes of this or that particular Church,
but of the Catholique body, whereto himselfe is the
<note n="*" place="margin">Coloss. 1. 18.</note> Head.</p>
            <p>For the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was chased away from
that seat, many yeares togeather, by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales;</hi>
witnesse the Stories which cannot be gainesayd.
And no maruaile, for from that place, not onely procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the power, whereby Christ was crucified; but also,
whereby the great persecutions flowed, for the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christianitie. Vpon which foresight, no doubt
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> hath left that Citie vnder the deepest curse, in his
Booke of Reuelation.</p>
            <p>For the 7. Churches of <hi>Asia-minor,</hi> which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saw
to be as Starres in Christes right hand (a priuiledge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
giuen to <hi>Rome</hi>) they quickly vanished. Which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other reasons) doubtles was, for keeping vs, from
tying faith to any particular place or person. And if
God spared not his owne peculiar people the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but
rooted them out for their sinnes sake, what reason is
there, that he should spare any wilde branches, inserted
in the place of that naturall Oliue?</p>
            <p>That promise therefore in <hi>Math.</hi> 16. must (euen by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Consequent) be vnderstood of the Catholique
Church, which howsoeuer it might be beat downe in
some part, yet should continue in some other. Euen as
the Moone, whereto she is compared, might to some
part of the Earth be eclipsed, when to some other part,
she shyned brightly. This I note against the <hi>Romanist,</hi>
which would not only tye the Church to some one
place; but also conclude that the Church hath beene
to this part of the world alwayes visibly glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8445:14"/>
Besides, I conclude the Euer-visibilitie of the Church,
(though in such defectiue manner) for conuincing of
some, who haue not knowne how to answere the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi>
otherwise then by denying all visibilitie, through
some misunderstanding of some Scriptures, in 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.
as also in the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> Whereas indeed, a great depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was to be made from the Fayth; but yet meane time,
it should not cease to be Gods Temple, though the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
vsurped a chiefe place in it:<note place="margin">Reuel. 7.</note> for (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw)
some Trees should keepe greene in the Lordes
court, hauing the sauing Seale of Gods Grace printed
vpon them. And were it not so, how should sauing
Grace be conueyed vnto vs, without new Apostles, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
extraordinarily from heauen? And how should
we come by Gods Booke (contayning his written will)
if the Lord reserued not a Remnant,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> the Church being
onely the <hi>Piller</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of that trueth?</p>
            <p>The veritie of all which, was typed out in the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church before Christ came in the flesh. Before the
Flood, for 1656. yeares, the Church remayned in some
few Families. After the Flood, in a few Families, till the
guift of the Law at Mount <hi>Horeb</hi> or <hi>Sinaj.</hi> Then the
Church began to be more visible, and of more glorious
constitution; first, in the Wildernesse; then after, in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
till the time of <hi>Salomons</hi> sonne <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> Then ten
Trybes schisme from the two; leauing the two in some
orderly state; but betaking themselues to grieuous Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie:
Yet during the times of such Idolatrie, God did
not leaue them, but stirred vp many excellent Prophets
among them; as <hi>Elias, Elisha, Ionah, Amos,</hi> and others, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with excellent Schooles of Prophets, as at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi>
and <hi>Iericho;</hi> till such time, as <hi>Assur</hi> caried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
captiue. In meane time, the case stood farre better
with the Church in <hi>Iudah,</hi> till the Lord for their sinnes
<pb facs="tcp:8445:14"/>
sake, suffred <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> to carry them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to <hi>Babel.</hi> There they continued 70. yeares, without
exercise of Sacrifice. At the 70. yeares end, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the next Monarchist to repaire home for
building the sacramentall Citie and Temple.<note place="margin">Three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies (as Chaldea, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, &amp; Grecia) and a Duar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chj, a parted gouernment.</note> But some
seauen seauens of yeares (euen 49 yeares, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
<hi>Daniel</hi>) it was, ere that worke could be finished.
From that time, they continued vnder the gouernment,
first of the <hi>Medes &amp; Persians</hi> (represented by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netsars</hi>
siluery Breast and Armes.) Then vnder the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

<hi>Duarchie</hi> of <hi>Egipt</hi> and <hi>Syria;</hi> the first, South from <hi>Iudeà;</hi>
the second, North; as <hi>Daniel</hi> plainely foretold them.
And so they reach to Christ, that Stone cut from the
Mountaine, who dashed that Image of <hi>Nebuchaanetsars</hi>
to powder. When Christ came, we finde the Church (as
for some 600. yeares it had been) quite out of order, and
very few of them, that could brooke the Lord of life, or
his sauing Gospell. Principall Starres for this Storie, <hi>S.

            <p>From which holy typicall Storie, I conclude; first, an
<hi>Euer visibilitie</hi> of the Church. Secondly, but such a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
as inow was more, inow lesse: inow glorious,
inow the glory eclipsed: inow in constitution, inow
shaken asunder. Nor can it be thought strange, that the
Daughter (I meane the Christian Church, brought
foorth of mother <hi>Zion,</hi> should be subiect to such muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
and change, when as she hath not been inferiour
to her Mother for sinne; and therefore as capable of

harsh, that Christes Diademe in the earth should be at

not, to thy Seeds, as speaking of many; but, and to thy
Seed, as of one; which is <hi>CHRIST.</hi> Besides, of them
were the Prophets; and to them was the adoption and
the glory, and couenants; and the gift of the Law, and
the seruice of God, and the promises. Of whom were
the Fathers, and of whom (concerning the flesh) Christ
came, who is God ouer all, blessed for euer, Amen. So
<pb facs="tcp:8445:15"/>
that the Iewes were as <hi>Salomons</hi> seruantes, standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, as in his chamber of presence, hauing all means
to make them truely blessed. An easie matter therefore
for them (had not wilfull pieuishnesse hindred them) to
haue become true visible Christians.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were (as the Apostle tels the<note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 12.</note>

that God would raise vp a Seed (euen Christ) out of his

tongue turned to English, runnes thus: No Workes, either Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
or Morall, are the cause why any man is iust before God: For
Workes are not the cause, that man is iust, but the execution and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of his iustice; because no man is iustified with God by his
Worke, but by the habite of Fayth infused.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Romanist</hi> wrangle (in the abuse of Distinction)
so long as they shall, euen through <hi>their</hi> Church (as they
will haue it) it hath through all ages passed for vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
trueth, that vnto Iustification with God, no one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Worke whatsoeuer (no not of Baptisme or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision)
hath once been required, for essentiall to the
sauing-being of a Christian, but <hi>Sola fides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Fayth onely;
which is internall, and the guift of God also. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian visible vnto others, there is required
such outward Workes (as fruites) whereby we may be
well perswaded of the Fayth that is inward, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
life of the tree; which is vnseeable otherwise then
in the fruites flowing from it. The first fruite of which
Fayth to vs-ward, is, a free <hi>Confession,</hi> that the heart so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note>
               <hi>For</hi> (sayth the Apostle) <hi>with the heart man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vnto righteousnesse, and with the mouth man confesseth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
saluation.</hi> The second speciall Worke is, subiection to
<hi>Baptisme</hi> (the seale of their iustification, annexed to the
<pb facs="tcp:8445:18"/>
word of beleefe) and therefore the Apostles commission
ran thus; First Preach, and then Baptize. Nor would
the <hi>Eunuch</hi> so instantly haue craued Baptisme, had not
<hi>Philip</hi> taught the necessitie thereof. True it is, that it is
not necessarie to saluation <hi>simply,</hi> but <hi>conditionally,</hi> as it
may be conueniently had. But <hi>Contempt,</hi> or wilfull <hi>Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
is as damnable, as <hi>Esaus</hi> base thought of <hi>Canaan;</hi>

stand in need of a <hi>Signe.</hi> For how can a soule haue true
respect to Gods <hi>Word,</hi> when it shall thinke lightly or
vilely of that <hi>Seale</hi> which is suffixed to that Word? A
third Worke flowing from true Fayth, is a <hi>Desire</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further informed in the mysterie of the Gospell,
which the Angels themselues desire to peire into,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 12.</note> whom
(notwithstanding) it so much concernes not. And who
will not desire to know the full of their Fathers Will?
The fourth fruite issuing from true Fayth, is, to <hi>Loue God
aboue all, and our Neighbour as our selfe;</hi> and to testifie the
trueth of such loue, in all duties of <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> as
from Gods word shalbe manifest. Such a soule, so belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
&amp; working, is to vs-ward, a true visible Christian.</p>
            <p>2 A companie of such gathered togeather, are a true

them, finding them in some<note n="*" place="margin">So Origen on Rom. 16. So Theophilact thereon, &amp; on 1. Cor. 16. So Haymo on Ep. to Philemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Ambrose, and others.</note> house) a Church of God

            <p>THE auncient Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> had constituted
vnto it, two sortes of Ministers, <hi>Priestes</hi> &amp; <hi>Leuites.</hi>
The Priestes againe were deuided into 2. sortes;
first, in that one was to be <hi>Hy-priest</hi> (not onely for
a yeare, as was the corruption at last, but for the whole
tearme of life) and he onely might enter into the <hi>Sanctum
sanctorum,</hi> and in other businesses was principall. In the
second place, were many other Priestes, attending the
dayly Sacrifice; which after by <hi>Dauid,</hi> were for better
order, distributed into<note n="*" place="margin">1. Chro. 24. 7. &amp;c.</note> 24. <hi>Classios.</hi> Of the <hi>Leuites</hi> (sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
so called, for otherwise the Priestes were of <hi>Leuj)</hi>
they were deuided into two rankes, each knowing what
partes of the Tabernacle he was to wind vp and carry:
the one sort of them called <hi>Gershomites,</hi> the other <hi>Mera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
as all the Priestes were called <hi>Kohathites,</hi> according
to the Heads of the Families they came of. But when
<hi>Dauid</hi> prepared for a Standing house vnto the Lord, he
distributed them into other Orders, for other purposes;
as in 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 25. and this by no particular precept from
the Lord, otherwise then from the generall rule (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Naturall reason leadeth) namely, <hi>That all in the Church
should be done with comlynesse and order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another sort of Ministers God prouided for that
Church, and these were the Prophets and Prophetisses,
stirred vp out of what tribe soeuer. These were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
<pb facs="tcp:8445:19"/>
to the Tabernacle or Temples businesses, but
raysed vp of God (besides any ordinarie forme of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
specially, for calling Priest and people into order,
when they erred from the commandement. And as their
calling (for forme sake) was extraordinarie; so, they
were furnished with guifes extraordinarie; both for
knowledge and strange workes working. The Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ministrie therfore, constituted to the Church, were

had their calling immediatly from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and

            <p>The ordinarie ministerie, were <hi>Bishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons;</hi> the

<hi>The Angel of the congregation:</hi> and very fitly for his place,

the onely Arch-bishop of our soules. <hi>Answere:</hi> So in
<hi>Math.</hi> 23. himselfe sayth, <hi>One is your Doctor, one is your
Father;</hi> and that <hi>Doctor</hi> himselfe sayth, is Christ; and
that one <hi>Father,</hi> is in heauen; and therefore no one in the
earth, (teacheth Christ) is to be called Father &amp; Doctor.
When the Doctor of schisme hath opened Christs mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
let him but put the same key vnto his owne Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
and the spring flies so open, that bad eyed <hi>Leah</hi>
running by, will easily discouer his follie.</p>
            <p>¶The other Presbyter or Elder (for the Greeke word
<hi>Presbiter</hi> is, Elder in English) he is as the Ordinarie Priest
vnto the Hy-priest, imployed in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
also. And therefore in <hi>Act. 20. 17. 18 &amp;c.</hi> one and
the same persons be indifferently called Elders &amp; Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers:
or as the Greeke words sound, Presbiters and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
For that in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. it is to be read thus: <hi>The
Elders that gouerne well, are worthy double honour, specially they
which</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Copiôntes <hi>&amp; Copos,</hi> is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risomenesse with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as befell the Apostles often. &amp;c. Zuingl. vpon his 62. article.</note> 
               <hi>wearie themselues in the word and doctrine:</hi> where
the comparison is not betweene Elders, some Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
some teaching; but betweene Elders labouring
more or lesse: which caused <hi>Zuinghus</hi> (at the first start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp of such Lay-eldership) in his expounding of the
former verse, to oppose vnto all Eldership, sauing the
<hi>Teaching.</hi> Nor could <hi>Gualter</hi> see any vse of such sole
Gouernours, where the ciuill Magistrate hath his place.
Before God added the Ciuill Gouernour to the Church,
there might happily haue been some vse of such Lay-elders
(yet I see no Scripture for proofe of it) but God
<pb facs="tcp:8445:20"/>
giuing once Kinges and Princes to be of the Church,
the weaker gouernment might giue place. And indeed,
the peruerse holding of a Lay-eldership, as a setled
function of Christes, it hath ministred occasion to the
Anabaptistes, of thrusting the Magistrate out of the
Church, as hauing no vse of his sword within.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Deacons</hi> are called to assist the Presbiters, as
Euangelistes did the Apostles: and as in the Temple of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> the Common Leuites attended the Priestes:
Seauen such were ordained to the Church in <hi>Ierushalem;</hi>
but vpon the persecution of <hi>Stephen</hi> (one of the seauen)
the Church being scattered,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 12 &amp; 15. 39. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Philip</hi> one of the Deacons,
comes to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and there not onely preacheth, but
also baptiseth. Vnto whom, some of the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred,
conferring vpon the Christians, the guiftes of
the Holy Ghost. After that time, <hi>Philip</hi> might well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an <hi>Euangelist,</hi> and so be assistant vnto the Apostles,
(as <hi>Iohn Marke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was to <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to <hi>Paul;)</hi> but
before that, he was but a plaine Deacon, and as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Deacon, he so preached and baptised; euen else
where, then in <hi>Ierushalems</hi> Church, whereto he was at
first ordayned.</p>
            <p>Now, leauing to contend about wordes (which the
Apostle forbids to <hi>Timothj)</hi> what difference of ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is there betweene Apostles, Prophets, Euangelistes,

1. 1. where the salutations from the Apostle, runnes
thus; <hi>To the Saintes of Philippj</hi> (meaning the body of the
people) <hi>with the Bishops and Deacons,</hi> intending the whole
Ministerie in them two words: What difference (I say)
is there, in the matter of their ministerie? <hi>Apostle,</hi> is in
English, <hi>One that is sent:</hi> Whereto? to minister the word
and both Sacraments; and so doth the Bishop, Presbiter
or Pastor. All the rest minister the same word; and
preaching must also of necessitie minister Baptisme.
For the Deacon doing that (as before,) and he being the
least, it followes that the greater had no lesse power to
doe that: specially, seeing not onely in the Commission
<hi>(Math. 28. 19.)</hi> Preaching and Baptisme be conioyned:
but also, for that the Apostle euidently maketh Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greater, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. and necessarily it must be so,
seeing the <hi>Word</hi> is greater then the <hi>Seale,</hi> for that by the
word of Fayth, some soule can be saued without the
Seale, as afore; but none by the Seale, without the Word.
As for the Sacrament of <hi>Communion,</hi> it can onely be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to a Communion of people; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be fitly administred, but by him that is <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
to such a Communion of people. And that is by
the Apostle that ruleth ouer the <hi>Whole,</hi> or the Pastor that
ruleth ouer a <hi>Part.</hi> Yet seeing Prophets and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes
were to assist the Apostle, and Deacons to assist
the Pastor, it cannot follow otherwise, but the Maisters
of the worke calling for the helpe of their Ministers,
they might also follow in the administration of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sacrament, though not goe before as Presidentes.
And as the Scriptures intend all this, so God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
the true footesteps of it, through all ages in the
Churches, which none but fantasticke <hi>Nouelistes,</hi> can
but admit with Reuerence. And the not admittance
<pb facs="tcp:8445:21"/>
hereof, what hath it bgeot in the Factions? Euen so
many crosse opinions and vnresolued positions, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Callinges, and duetie of Called, as themselues begin
to stinke in the nosethrilles of their owne Disciples.
Which sadly also obserued, will cause the Ingenuous
minded hereafter, not so easily to blot and blurre the
lines of Antiquitie.</p>
            <p>As for the Widowes mentioned in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. they are
not to be counted with Church-officers. Once, for that
neither they, nor any other Woman, was to speake in
the Congregation. Besides, for that the greatnes of their
yeares, being threescore, before they might be receiued;
as also their impotencie of outward meanes considered,
ere they might be admitted; do argue that they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in, not so much to minister, as to be ministred vnto.

a true <hi>Micro-cosmos.</hi> The translation (<hi>Modest</hi>) doth not
fully expresse it. And in this word, there may be refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the description of <hi>Leui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to be mutilate, bursten, &amp;c. For <hi>Oiconomie,</hi> he must
be abled to gouerne in his owne house. &amp;c. In a word,
he must be vnreprooueable, vncheckable; not onely
of these that be within (that is of the Church) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
of these that be without.</p>
            <p>Mee thinkes, now I heare the Schismatique euoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Obiection. True, he must be such a one; but
no Minister in <hi>England</hi> is such a one, therefore no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>England,</hi> a true minister.</p>
            <p>I answere, first by <hi>Retortion;</hi> but no minister of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme,
Brownisme, Smithisme, &amp;c. is such a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
therefore no true Minister of them. Secondly, I
answere by <hi>Explication,</hi> thus: In English wee vse the
words <hi>Must</hi> and <hi>Ought,</hi> indifferently for the same; yet,
somtimes, we (by the word <hi>Must</hi>) do inioyne a thing of
absolute necessitie; when as againe, by the word <hi>Ought,</hi>
wee intend a duetie owing, but not of absolute necessity
to be done. The Greeke word <hi>Dêj,</hi> (a word of one
<pb facs="tcp:8445:22"/>
Syllable) hath as large vse, wherevpon some haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Apostle setteth out, what a man the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<hi>ought</hi> to bee; not what he needes <hi>must</hi> bee. But
this answere seemes vnto mee, ouer-weake to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop
a crazie-conscience. The impersonall <hi>Dêj,</hi> as it
comes of <hi>Dêo</hi> to bind; so in this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it importeth that
whereto the Minister is bound and tyed, by the very
law of God himselfe. For as our Sauiour enioyneth
(in <hi>Math.</hi> 5.) euery Christian to be perfect, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father is perfect: (and yet so perfect, none in the
militant Church can be; no, not in that one particular
of <hi>louing an enemie,</hi> which there is pressed) so here the
like for a Christian Minister. The consideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
caused the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to cry out, and say: <hi>Who is
sufficient for these thinges?</hi> Christian, and Christian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
therefore in this case, are continually to runne vnto
Christ;<note place="margin">Hieromy. ad Ocean. cals it, Speculum sacerdotij.</note> and in him, to seeke vp their perfection. <hi>Ierome</hi>
therefore (very iudiciously and truely) calleth it: <hi>The
Priestes Looking-glasse;</hi> which beholding, thereby shalbe
occasioned (<hi>Dolere ad deformitatem, gaudere ad pulchritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem</hi>)
to sorrow for wantes, as also to reioyce in graces
proportionable.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it necessarily followeth, that as in a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Christian, we considerd what was <hi>Essentially</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the true being thereof; so must we as necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider, what tendeth to the <hi>Very being,</hi> of a <hi>true Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Minister.</hi> That is done in a very few wordes. For as
there must first be in him that, which makes him a true
Christian; so secondly, there must be in him somewhat
besides, whereby hee becommeth also, a true Minister:
And that is, these two thinges; <hi>Calling,</hi> and <hi>Aptnesse to
teach.</hi> For the <hi>Calling,</hi> (seeing he is but an ordinarie Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister)
an ordinarie forme of Calling sufficeth: and that
can onely be had of the Church. To such a calling ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth;

the chosen are confirmed, as being by the hand of God

they shall fulfill, He is continually in all temptations to be present

<pb facs="tcp:8445:23"/>
The Choosers also are</hi> (thereby) <hi>informed, that they receiue
the man by the hand of God, &amp; that to him they must be subiect.</hi>
Nor must it be slipped ouer, that this of M. <hi>Fenners,</hi> was
M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> also: which well may bee pressed, for
curbing some their followers, that now are come to
make Pastors and Doctors, without any <hi>Imposition of
hands:</hi> for so was <hi>Fr. Iohnson,</hi> and M. <hi>Greenwood</hi> made of
some in <hi>London.</hi> True it is, that about some fiue or sixe
yeares after, <hi>Fr. Iohnson</hi> comming to <hi>Amsterdame,</hi> had
handes there imposed by the lay people, his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(they know who then writ against it) contrarie to
the Apostles Canon;<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 7.</note> which runnes thus: <hi>Without all
contradiction, the Lesser is blessed of the Greater.</hi> And so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all contradiction, the Father asked the Children
blessing; and so his (or any the like ordination) more
Antichristian, and more crosse to the Canon, then any
Ordination issuing from the <hi>Pope</hi> euer hath been.</p>
            <p>I know, they will for them selues plead thus. In the
beginning of a Church, the case is changed: For seeing
there is no other Minister to ordaine, the people may
doe it, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. The <hi>Israelites</hi> lay hands vpon the
<hi>Leuites.</hi> I answere.</p>
            <p>1. First, it can neuer be prooued by Scripture, that of
Christians there ought to be such a <hi>Replantation,</hi> though
a <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Second, hee after so many yeares comming by
his Ordination, it must follow, that before, hee was no
Pastor, but a priuate man; and so a prophaner of Gods
ordinaunce.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Israelites</hi> did that they did, vpon a direct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
from God; so did not the Lay people in this: For
as the Ministerie of the New Testament, begun without
all <hi>Lay-ordination,</hi> (Christ himselfe installing the first,
and they installing others) so, neither to the Lay people
<pb facs="tcp:8445:24"/>
was left any such necessitie, seeing there should alwayes
be a stretcht out line of <hi>Imposition,</hi> so well as of <hi>Baptisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, the <hi>Israelites</hi> doe not there Ordaine the
<hi>Leuites:</hi> for neither any <hi>Leuite</hi> might, nor yet durst he
come vnto the Alter, vpon that laying on of handes.
Their laying on handes, was but their Approbation (as
sometimes holding vp of hands, and scrutinie of voyces
be) for the Ordination came after that (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>
well obserueth) when as <hi>Aaron</hi> (the Hy-priest) takes
them at the handes of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Pet. Mart. on 1. Sam. 7. &amp; in his common places, Class. 4. sect. 19. of Plaic. 1.</note> and then with his
handes, shaketh them before the Lord, and to the Lord
giues them. And thus the <hi>Separist</hi> is to seeke for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
notwithstanding whatsoeuer is sayd of <hi>H. l.</hi> for
the lacke of that Ceremonie.</p>
            <p>Vnto the sayd <hi>Laying on of handes,</hi> it is not of absolute
necessitie, to haue moe or fewer handes. And therefore
it is, that sometimes all the Apostles doe it; as in <hi>Act.</hi> 7.
(for in <hi>Act.</hi> 1. we read not of the Ceremonie, and yet well
may be, it was vsed, so well as in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3.) &amp; so sundry
of them, tearmed a <hi>Presbyterie</hi> in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. Sometimes
againe, it is performed by two; as in <hi>Act.</hi> 14. by <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas.</hi> Sometimes by one (there being no other to
assist;) as by <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> in their places. The equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
whereof was deliuered by <hi>Moses,</hi> when as <hi>Aaron

did <hi>seruice,</hi> not onely to the people in case of
Meate and Money; but also, to the Bishops in the case
of Doctrine and Sacrament. And hereof we are further
assured, in that all Antiquitie puts no other kind of
Deacons into our hands, and for such respect doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
times call them <hi>Leuites.</hi> And thus the old and new
Testament, is still more harmonious.</p>
            <p>If since the Ten grieuous Persecutions, the Ministers
of the one and other Order, haue come in the world to
greater estate in outward thinges (a grieuous thing to
soare eyes) what wonder is it, when for 300. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ, the Church was vnder the gouernment of
Heathen Tyrants, enemies to Christianitie? Soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
300. yeares, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, became Christian;
by whose example and motiue, many inferiour Kinges
became Christians also. Whereupon followed, freedome
of the Fayth, and peace and plentie in all Churches.
Then our Fathers counted it an holy duetie, to builde
materiall Churches, and to endowe the Spirituall with
euery good thing wanting. True it is, that such tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie
blessinges haue since that time, been foulely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned.
What then? So hath Heauen and Earth, and
all their continentes; shall we therefore spurne at the
creature? Indeed, while some so spurne, others sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
snatch to themselues all. To the Minister it should
be but an Idolathite; but to my Church-robber, it is a
<pb facs="tcp:8445:25"/>
very good commoditie. The Fathers giuing (they say)
did sinne, and the Sonnes snatching all away (it may be,
to maintaine a Hound &amp; an Whore) they must be sayd,
to commit a vertue. But while I liue, let me imitate <hi>that
supposed vice</hi> of my Father, rather then this <hi>vncouth vertue</hi>
of my Brother.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Word</hi> whereabout the Minister is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
is that Booke called <hi>Bible</hi> (of the Greeke
word <hi>Biblos,</hi> a Booke) as being the peculiar Booke,
aduanced aboue all; as <hi>Israel</hi> aboue the Nations.
This Booke is distinguished into two partes, <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New.</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> part contayneth (not all the wordes that
God spoke to the Fathers and Prophets) but, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce
of all which he spake vnto them, till the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Messiah</hi> came. The <hi>New</hi> part (commonly called the
New Testament) it contayneth likewise, a substaunce
of all Gods Will, deliuered thencefoorth by Christ and
his Apostles or neare followers. The <hi>Old</hi> part, was
written in <hi>Adams</hi> tongue, the language of succeeding
<hi>Israel.</hi> The <hi>New</hi> part, was written in the tongue of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan,</hi>
the fourth Sonne of <hi>Iaphet;</hi> it beeing in Christes

            <p>The Minister out of this Booke, is to take knowledge
of Gods Will for workes of holynesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and afterwardes deliuer the same vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
specially euery such day, as <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> calleth the
<hi>Lordes day.</hi> But because no Minister (since the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
writers, that is, since the Prophets and Apostles)
hath attayned to perfect knowledge in the former sayd
two Tongues; as also, for that in euery Minister is some
remnant of naturall dulnesse of heart (as was in the

               <hi>Emauites</hi> for vnderstanding all that is written) it so
comes to passe (for we but see in part, and prophecie in

all) the Minister aberreth from the<note n="*" place="margin">Of the word Canon, the Scriptures be called Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, that is. Regular.</note> Canon; that is,

that no one vniuersall consent, could euer be had, for

then hearken what absurdities follow.</p>

life vnseperable. And then the next turne will be, to
turne (not so good as Turke, but) plaine Atheist.</p>
            <p>4. Then will follow, that neither such an excepter
against such Subscription, can presse his people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
for trueth, any his Prayers, sermons, or prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Orders; seeing he also is a man, and subiect to
errour so well as others.</p>
            <p>5. Then will follow, that neuer we can haue assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
of Fayth: till either God speake thereof vnto vs
audibly from Heauen; or stirre vp some miraculous
Ministers, that may draw vs a new Bible in our owne
Language. For if they should draw it into another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

the <hi>Old.</hi> And let it be thought off as it shall, sure I am,
that the base esteeme of it, doth cause the Ministers to
be the more basely esteemed) the sayd Sacraments be
two; <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lordes Supper. Baptisme</hi> commeth
in place of <hi>Circumcision;</hi> and both of them the <hi>Seale of that
Righteousnesse which is by Fayth;</hi> and therefore the second
as communicable to Infants, as the first: and through
the mercie of our Lord, to old &amp; young, farre more easie.
The <hi>Lordes Supper</hi> commeth in roome of the <hi>Pas-ouer,</hi>
and exhibiteth accordingly, Christ Iesus crucified, for
feeding of our soules. As the Fathers vnder the Law
were made partakers of him, by Fayth; so are wee. As
herein they were led thereto by <hi>Externall signes;</hi> so are
<pb facs="tcp:8445:27"/>
we. And as we read not of any one amongst them (no
not in the Idolatrous times) that euer dreamed of eating
the <hi>Promised seed</hi> corporally; so, it should be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
shame, to seeke vnion with Christ in such a Caniball
manner, farre dissenting from the nature of Fayth. Such
a fleshly eating, if euer it had been fitting, had rather
been adapted to their times, wherein (as Children) they
were informed by most palpaple rudiments; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called much rather, to worship God in Spirit and
spiritually. And so the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Testament doe (as

as for the doing, or not doing whereof, we

by some generall rule, we are led to vse our Christian
Reason, for examining whether the doing or vsing such
a thing, may stand with Gods glory, &amp; our neighbours
good. The Rule was giuen by the Apostle in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.

and hauing set downe some particular Rules of
Order, he leaueth the rest vnto Christian discretion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this generall rule; <hi>Let all thinges be done (Euschemónôs,

            <p>The Generall rule so commaunding <hi>Decorum</hi> &amp; <hi>Order,</hi>
and the particulars thereunto belonging, being not of
God in his written-word expressed; it so necessarily
followeth, that our owne Christian reason herein must
be the Determiner. And the same particulars so conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<hi>I haue no commaundement of the Lord; but I giue mine aduice.</hi>
And vpon this rule it was, that the Apostle <hi>became all

thinges of an indifferent nature (neither simply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

himselfe; vsing, or not vsing; doing, or not doing the

that there is a reasonable spirit, that put a case of such

(or sinner) the Lord enioyneth, first, priuate brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admonishment (specially in a case priuate;) And not
so preuayling, then by communicating the case to one
or two moe; which neither preuayling, then to bring it
to the Church. And if the Church cannot preuaile for
bringing the sinner to repentance, he is thencefoorth
while he so continues impenitent, to be held as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
person, and as a Puplicane. As a meere heathen
man might not enter into the Temple, there to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with <hi>Israel;</hi> so neither must this impenitent soule
be admitted to the Churches communion in prayer and
Sacraments. But as an heathen might for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion
heare the Prophets preach; so these may pertake in a
Sermon seuered from the ordinarie Communion. As a
Publicane likewise he is to be held, that is; not easily to
be admitted to our fellowship for eating and drinking,
as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church walked towardes the Publicane;
who, in all probabilitie was a<note n="*" place="margin">1.

            <p>By all which it is euident, that vpon an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his fault, with promise to forsake it, mercy and
forgiuenesse was preached vnto him. But contemning
finally the Churches motherly admonishment, he was
to haue the dore of Mercie shut against him. Which
latter censure, the Apostle in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. calleth, <hi>A giuing

If the sinner should not onely, not repent, but
proceed to a <hi>Not louing Christ Iesus,</hi> (which I take to be

            <p>THE Greeke word <hi>Leîtourgia</hi> (signifying general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

the Angels are called Leitourgizing spirits) it in

this forme contayneth <hi>Prayers, Lections</hi> of Scripture and
<hi>Psalme-singing,</hi> framed vnto seuerall occasions. The
Auncient mother <hi>Zion,</hi> ouer and besides the Priestes
preaching, and the Prophets prophecying, had a set
forme for all their Seruice (as appeareth through <hi>Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>

the time of their non-age. To the Church of Christ,
there is giuen a larger Body of Scripture; <hi>out</hi> of the
which, and sutable <hi>to</hi> which, the Church is to draw her
forme of Leitourgie; collecting such Scriptures for
common Lections, as may be held most fitting such a
purpose. And for the sanctification of all, intermixing
such kinds of Prayers, as also may be fitted to ordinarie
and extraordinarie occasions. If any one man thinke he
can doe this well of him selfe, I thinke it can be better
done of many, conuening and concluding vpon such a
forme of Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8445:32"/>
And as for our publique Forme of Seruice (reiected
of some in part, for that some part of it hath before been
in vse among Papistes; as if God or the Ghospell, or
good wordes were therefore to be reiected) it was of the
holy Martyr, <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> of loue he bore vnto it, after
due ouersight, turned into Latine, for vse of all that
should vnderstand Latine.</p>
            <p>Against this Leitourgie, two sortes of Aduersaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surge.
One of them (as the <hi>Brownist,</hi> and the like) doth
condemne all set forme of Prayer, saying; that nothing
is to be brought into the Church, sauing the Canonicall
Scriptures, and the Liuely voyce of Gods graces. Now,
by Liuely voyce, they meane <hi>Conceiued</hi> preaching, and
present <hi>Conceiued</hi> prayer. And herevpon it is, that they
hold the Lordes Prayer in <hi>Math. 6. Not to be Prayer,</hi> but
Doctrine of Prayer. I answere, it is <hi>both</hi> Prayer, and
Doctrine of Prayer. <hi>Doctrine</hi> it is, for that thereby we
are <hi>Taught</hi> how to pray: For Doctrine is Teaching.
And <hi>Prayer</hi> it is, when a faythfull soule, breathes it vp
vnto God, <hi>Mentally</hi> or <hi>Vocally</hi> also. That Repetition of
wordes vsed before (euen the selfe same wordes) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
still Prayer, consider it not onely, in the Apostles
Prayer inculcate in seuerall Epistles (namely,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 3. 2. Cor. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Grace be
with you and peace from God our father, &amp;c.</hi>) but also, in our
Sauiours practise; who in the time of his agonie, when
most effectuall Prayer was to be vsed, is sayd of <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
(in <hi>chap.</hi> 26. 44.) to haue Praied the third time, saying
the same wordes; euen the selfe-same wordes which he
had vsed twise before. And the reason lieth in this, that
Prayer receaueth not his <hi>Forme</hi> from wordes, old or
new (for one may Pray without any wordes at all,) but
from the Spirit of Christ, aduancing our Spirit to God
in Fayth, whether with words, or without. Which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Apostle to say in <hi>Rom. 8. We know not what to pray
<pb facs="tcp:8445:33"/>
as we ought, but the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs, with
sighes vnexpressable.</hi> And yet I could round some Separist
in the eare, and tell him true of Teacher, and Teached,
that haue ordinarily vsed a set forme of Prayer: that I
speake nothing of him, who in his Prayer concluded
(till by mee he was better informed) thus; <hi>To whom, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with thee and the sanctified Spirit, be all glory, &amp;c.</hi> But
let that frantique <hi>Ieronymo</hi> goe by.</p>
            <p>The other Aduersarie is at home: who graunting
the lawfull &amp; necessarie vse of a <hi>Leitourgie,</hi> doth insurge
against some what in Ours, as not well fitting his fancie.
His obiection ariseth, first, against <hi>Methode:</hi> secondly,
against <hi>Matter.</hi> For <hi>Methode,</hi> take this his maine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.
In the beginning of our Seruice, a Confession
of sinne is vsed by the Minister, in the name of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and that before the Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be present.
I answere; first, it may be a ranke lye that the Obiector
propoundeth: for, some Congregation may be present
Before, though not euery member of the Congregation;
no more then some-times at their Conuenticles. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
though their <hi>Tom</hi> and <hi>Sib</hi> be present, yet happily
<hi>lynkin</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> may be absent. Secondly, our Minister
taking his fittest time, doth desire such as be present,
(not absent) to ioyne in that Confession with him.
Thirdly, if any be absent, that should and might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
it is their sinne, not the Ministers; much lesse the
Bookes: seeing Confession of sinne, is exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
in the <hi>Exordium</hi> of our deuotions. And that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>
and <hi>Daniel</hi> had well learned,<note place="margin">Nehe. 1. 5. &amp;c. Dan. 9.</note> when they begun
their Deuotions, with the Confession of their sinnes and
the sinnes of the people.</p>
            <p>For exception against <hi>Matter,</hi> it is fourefold. First,
for <hi>Omission:</hi> Secondly, for <hi>Addition:</hi> Thirdly, for <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi>
Fourthly, for certaine <hi>Capital-letters.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8445:33"/>
1. For <hi>Omission;</hi> as in passing by the Psalmes Titles.
I answere; first, it is not repugnant vnto Gods word,
that some Scripture be read, and othersome omitted in
the Common seruice; seeing neither all Scripture is <hi>Then</hi>
to be read (witnesse the seuerall <hi>Leitourgies</hi> of their owne
drawing) nor is our Minister debarred to handle any
Scripture. Secondly, the <hi>Lections</hi> in a <hi>Leitourgie,</hi> require
the playnest scriptures; because (generally) for the vse of
the common people. But that the Psalmes-titles be not a
plaine Scripture, will appeare thus: The Hebrew word
<hi>Lame natséach,</hi> is turned, <hi>To him that excelleth.</hi> Yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Septuagint, who should best vnderstand it, it
is turned by that, which (as in auncient Latine translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
valueth <hi>Vnto,</hi> or, <hi>Vpon the end.</hi> By <hi>Targum,</hi> and some
other Latines otherwise.<note place="margin">Frater Faelix in sua trans. Psa. ex haebreo in Psal. 4.</note> Hereupon Frier <hi>Faelix</hi> vnto

<hi>quod quidem verbum, cum a nomine nessach descendat, velè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerso,

who should best vnderstand it, being at no vnitie in this
poynt amongst themselues (nor <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, nor <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Church, nor others, daring to determine of it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily,
as beseemeth in cases of Fayth) what sauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is it not, in this poynt to taxe our Church, when
the Taxers themselues can (at best) but guesse how
the Title may be translated? Againe, we haue in some
Translation, to him that excelleth on <hi>Negínóth,</hi> or on
<hi>Nechílóth.</hi> Who can assuredly determine, whether these
were Instruments, or Tunes, or what? If the Minister
will preach vpon it, he may: But to be ioyned with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
Lections, I see no necessitie, howsoeuer it may
be lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8445:34"/>
2. For <hi>Addition,</hi> there be in the 14. Psalme, three Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
moe in our Common-seruice Booke, then be in the
<hi>Hebrew;</hi> namely, the 5. 6. and 7. verses, the whole so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deuided into eleauen verses. I ingeniously confesse,
that once I conceiued, how that Exception of <hi>Addition,</hi>
had risen against the three last Verses, as it lieth in our
ordinarie Bibles, where the whole (besides the Title) be
but seauen. But now it is cleare, that they meane the
three Verses inserted into the Psalme, immediatly vpon
the fourth, beginning thus: <hi>Their throate is an open sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.
&amp;c.</hi> Hereto I answere: It is not repugnant to Gods
word, that these Verses be there read in our Common
seruice; once, for that the same Verses are Scripture, &amp;
so alleadged by <hi>S. Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Secondly, for that they
be inserted, where for the argument, they be as fitting, as
they were in the other place for the Apostles purpose.</p>
            <p>3. As for <hi>Traslation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vbi autem addita est Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiua parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula, vix duos codices potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus reperire. Aug. in huuc locum.</note> they excerpe sundry places.
Two principall be fetcht from the 105. &amp; 106. Psalmes.
From the 105. 18. this, <hi>Vèlô marû aeth debárau,</hi> word for
word thus; <hi>And they bittered not his word;</hi> or <hi>They bittered
not at his word.</hi> Now, as it is questionable, who be
<hi>They</hi> there spoken of (whether the Commissioners or
the People;) so the phrase, <hi>bittering not his word</hi> (as not
prouoking the word) or, <hi>bittering not at his word</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not prouoked by his word) is so doubtfull a phrase,
as no temporate spirit (specially, of no greater guiftes
then the Obiectors) will easily dare to oppose in this
poynt (or the like) to the body of an whole Church.
In Psal. 106. 30. we read, <hi>Phyneas stood vp &amp; prayed.</hi> They
say, it should be turned, <hi>Hee executed judgement.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,

            <p>4. Touching their exception at Capitall letters (an
exception now very vulgare) the case standes thus:
There be in the Common-seruice Booke, certaine great
Letters, within whose Circumference, the Grauer of
these Letters, hath sometimes put certaine Pictures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
<hi>Triton, Hercules,</hi> &amp;c. For which, diuers doe
charge the Booke, for an vpholder of Idolatrie. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
it is nothing to the Matter; because not of the
Bookes matter: Nor is the Matter a pinne the worse,
though the Manner of conuaying it, be not so sutable as
may be. If there be a fault in the Fashion, blame the
Taylor, not the Wearer. These Spirites by like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
may rayle vpon euery Bible, as an vpholder of
Corruption: Why? for that euery Printer wilbe found
to haue fayled in something; as in mistaking a Letter,
displacing a Poynt &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if they so stumble at the Pictures of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that haue been idolatrized, why not also at the
Picture of a Rose,<note place="margin">Gerard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(sweete sweat) of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> (a sweete
sweatie Prophet) vpon which superstitious conceites,
the Rose may not (forsooth) fall to the ground. And
why with as good reason doe they not reiect the two
Capitall letters T and X: the first, hauing been idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized
as the <hi>Crosse of Christ:</hi> &amp; the other, as the <hi>Crosse of S.
Andrew?</hi> Or, why contend they not about the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
I, which being the fashion of a Piller; vnder which
forme,<note place="margin">Clem. in l. 1. strom.</note> it is sayd (of <hi>Clemens Alexandrine</hi>) the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did
worship God? they might also entitle it, a Monument
of Idolatrie. The Apostle forbids men to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Wordes; and these hold it a vertue, to make warre
about Letters: yea, about the very Ornament of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I perceiue that they will play small play, ere they
sit out for wranglers.</p>
            <p>Though it be not alwayes of <hi>Absolute</hi> necessitie, that
there be a Leitourgie, yet <hi>respectiuely,</hi> times may bring
with them a deepe necessitie thereof. And if any times,
then these times: for if no forme be concluded of, but
euery one left to his owne discretion herein (as the
Apostles iustly were, they being filled with spirit of
Discretion) not one Congregation wil be like another.
But as among the <hi>Romanistes,</hi> the multiplicitie of Monc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie
begot multiplicitie of Differences; euery one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
so his owne Order, as therewithall grew a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the other: so, this Church would so affect this
Forme, and that Church that Forme; and a third, a third
forme, &amp;c. as therewithall would arise such praysinges,
dispray singes, likinges, dislikinges, as no one Parioch
would be at quiet with another; nor any possible vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
among the Teachers. Let it remaine then for Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall,
not onely, that such a Leitourgie is lawfull, but
<pb facs="tcp:8445:35"/>
also for begetting and continuing vnitie, that such an
vniforme Leitourgie is very expedient and needfull.
With the Apostle to the <hi>Corinths</hi> (he there handling also
matters of Order in the Church) I thus conclude:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 16.</note>

            <p>THE word (<hi>Ghospell</hi> the contract of Godspell) is a
Saxon word, valuing in our language (the same
which the Greeke word <hi>Euangell</hi> doth, namely)
<hi>Glad-tydinges.</hi> In large sense, wee call all the
Doctrine (contayned in the Booke of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
by the name of <hi>Ghospell;</hi> because the mayne and
substaunce of that Booke, is doctrine of Gladtidinges:
otherwise, who is ignoraunt, that the <hi>Law</hi> is mingled
with the discourse of the Ghospell; not for perfecting
the Ghospell (for it is not of that nature) but for leading
people to Christ, as <hi>Moses</hi> led the people to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> who
onely could bring them to the Land of Rest, a type of
heauens Eternall rest.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Ghospell is sometimes taken for the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Christ, penned by <hi>S. Mathew, S. Marke, S. Luke, S.
Iohn;</hi> whereupon they be called, <hi>The foure Euangelistes,</hi> as
hauing in a speciall sort dilated vpon Christ, the subiect
of the Glad-tydinges.</p>
            <p>But in this dispute, I take it in that strict essentiall
sense that <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth, when he sayth to the Galatians;<note place="margin">

               <hi>The Scripture foreseeing that God would iustifie the Gentiles
through Fayth, preached before, the Ghospell vnto Abraham,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8445:41"/>
(saying) <hi>In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed:</hi> afterwardes
declaring by what meanes, namely by <hi>a Seede</hi> (not seeds)
<hi>which is Christ.</hi> This Ghospell is <hi>the same</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and to vs after; neither is there any other name
(then the name Iesus) by which we are to be saued; nor
any other meanes, whereby to be vnited with Iesus, then
by Fayth. For as <hi>S. Peter</hi> could say, touching the Cripple
healed at the gate of the Temple, that <hi>Iesus</hi> (whom ye
haue crucified <hi>(His name hath made this man sound:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 16.</note> euen
so, I may as truly say, that by Fayth onely in Christ, we
are to be saued. Externall discipline may alter with
time and place, as all externall workes may, but the
Euangell, Ghospell, Gladtydings is still one &amp; the same;
that is, <hi>Beleeue, and liue:</hi> whereas the Law sayth; <hi>Doe, and
liue.</hi> And in not doing all the things of the Law, a soule
becomes subiect to all the Curses in the Law. By <hi>Doing</hi>
then, no flesh can be iustified: but by <hi>Beleefe</hi> in Christ
Iesus, any soule may be iustified. The Law therfore
but sendes to Christ; and Christ castes none away that
comes so vnto him.</p>
            <p>The Law indeed, was written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to <hi>Doe,<note place="margin">Quod Lex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum minando imperat, hoc Lex Fidei cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat Anshelm. in 4. cap. Rom.</note> and liue:</hi> and he might haue done his
workes and liued: but conspiring with the Diuell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the holy rule of the Law; the Law is so against
Man, execrating and cursing him; whereby man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to fly from himselfe, to another; and that is
to Christ, who (with his armes readie to imbrace vs) cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out, <hi>Come vnto mee all you that be weary and laden, and I
will ease you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth our wilfull Banckrupt estate, lessen the
debt owing to God: for though we be vnable to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Law, it is iust with him to call for satisfying the
Law, and to clap vs vp in Hell, for <hi>Non-satisfaction.</hi>
Able we were set out of his handes; the fault therefore
<pb facs="tcp:8445:41"/>
in our selues; and therewith let euery mouth be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p>But, ô the free-mercie of God! that when we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

first, for satisfying our debt: secondly, for raising vs vp
to greater Glory. The <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is the <hi>Death of Christ:</hi>
and our <hi>Exaltation,</hi> is his <hi>Humiliation:</hi> for, hee became
poore, to make many rich. Thus, not our worke, but his
worke: not our satisfaction, but his satisfaction: not
our merit, but his merit, is cause and sole cause of our

owne workes, but in the onely mercy and goodnesse of God.</hi> So
great is this trueth, and therefore must preuaile, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their distinction (some workes be Legall,
some Euangelicall) seeing the Free fauour of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
all our workes (howsoeuer tearmed) for iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng
onely Christes merit-worke, for our iustification.
<hi>Obiection:</hi> Fayth is a worke, &amp; being iustified by Fayth,
we are so iustified by a worke. <hi>Answere:</hi> It is a worke <hi>in</hi>
vs, but not <hi>of</hi> vs; for Fayth (as the Holy Ghost witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth)
is the<note n="*" place="margin">Philp. 1. 29.</note> Guift of God, and so our iustification to
saluation, the free guift of God, and not of our selues
<hi>onely,</hi> nor <hi>also:</hi> For if we will plant our thresholds by his
thresholds, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> will proclaime it an abhomination.
<pb facs="tcp:8445:42"/>
And because Christ doth not onely begin the worke,
but also perfect it, the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> calles him,
<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Author and finisher of our Fayth.</hi> The premisses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
(and sound in the iudgment of a <hi>Romanist,</hi> were
he to die the death for his Fayth against the <hi>Turke,</hi> and
not to maintaine a sworne opposition against vs) let me
put downe the following Positions.</p>
            <p>1. First, these Schismatikes be most hereticall, that
by reason our outward forme of Discipline likes them
not, do affirme (as some chiefe of them haue in my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> neither holdeth nor
teacheth, the Ghospell of Christ. And yet the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
holdeth no other Ghospel, then heere they receiued:
except they make their Lay-eldership their Ghospell,
or some of their outward workes, to giue <hi>beeing</hi> to the
Ghospell. And then they fall vpon the Rocke of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,
which they would seeme to sayle so farre from:
establishing not onely a Iustification with God by
Fayth onely at first; but after that, a second iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God by works also. Nor indeed is it better with
them, if themselues will vnderstand themselues: Which
easily cannot be done, God hauing put vpon them, the
spirit of slumber.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, I doe faythfully belieue, that in the
Romish-church (since the first plantation of it) there
hath been, and still is, a true Christian people, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the maine<note n="*" place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Foundation</hi> layd in Christes blood;
howsoeuer (sometimes) they build vpon it Hay, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the like; euen as in the thronge of the Tares,
the Lord had his Wheate, and Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And in <hi>Babel</hi> (euen after the Returnes to <hi>Iudah,</hi>
by <hi>Zerubbabel, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah)</hi> God there had his
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and others also with him. God forbid, that their
malice against vs reforming the Church, should beget
<pb facs="tcp:8445:42"/>
in vs a deniall of any Grace, which God continues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst
them, notwithstanding their abode in lamentable
Confusion. Nor is this trueth of Christianitie, which I
beleeue to be amongst them, onely an inuisible Grace,
(according to secret election) as some Scismatikes make
it, but in the profession visible, witnesse not onely many
their<note n="*" place="margin">See Trigs true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique in the chap. of Iustifi.</note> Writings, but also many their Sermons there at
home, as these can witnesse, that haue trauailed amongst
them: not to speake any thing of such, as <hi>dayly</hi> do offer
vp their blood amongst them, in testimony against their
false Ghospell.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, I do verily belieue, that a maine cause,
why the Apostle handleth so largely Iustification by
Fayth onely, in that Epistle to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> was this; for
that he foresaw, how that Church would quickly be
drawing away from that Pillar, for establishing a iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of their owne in the roome thereof. That they
haue made a foule departure from that Fayth of the
Ghospell, and that we in that poynt, haue recouered our
standing, let themselues iudge (being vnpossessed of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie)
reading but the first eight Chapters soberly
ouer (or but the first foure) accordingly as they be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in their <hi>Rhemish Testament.</hi> And will they be so
bewitched, as to giue more crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the writing of any
one among them, then to the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> enforming
their first Christian people? Let them labour to bring
their opinion to the Epistle, and not wrest the Epistle to
their opinion: holding it true Antiquitie, to be one with
the Apostle and that golden Epistle; and not to reiect
them, for entertayning a Nouelty, couered with colour
of Antiquity. He that teacheth any other Ghospell,
then that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> taught, we are (though he were
an Angell from heauen) to hold him accursed, yea, twise
accursed; as the same Apostle teacheth. <hi>Galath.</hi> 1. 8. 9.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:8445:43"/>So much of the Ghospell preached to the Fathers,

doth signifie one <hi>Opposite to Christ,</hi> it is
out of all question. But wherein he is
to be opposite (in Fayth, or Manners;
wholly, or in part: and if in part, then
in what part) is a mightie Question.
Besides, that there should be such an Aduersarie, is out
of all question: but who that Aduersarie (or whether
One, or Many) and from whence he should arise, is
much in question.</p>
            <p>The Fathers take the word, sometimes very largely,
(as they thinke S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth in his 1. Epistle) sometimes
strictly, as of one and the same person, as they thinke <hi>S.

            <p>But passing by these more curious Diuinations (as
whom time yet hath not sufficiently matured) it is
graunted of all, that He which vnder the name of Christ
shall oppose to Christ, is for that, an Antichrist And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his opposition must be against Christ, rather then
against God (though Christ be also God) he is called
<hi>Anti-christos,</hi> not <hi>Anti-theos.</hi> If he should be <hi>Anti-pater,</hi>
then we should consider some speciall thing in God
the Father: if <hi>Anti-pneuma,</hi> then some speciall thing in
the Holy Ghost; but by the word <hi>Antichrist,</hi> we must
consider something in the Sonne, to whom this Sonne
of perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is secretly to oppose: And that resteth in his
suborning a <hi>False Ghospell</hi> for the true. In which respect
he beares in his Armes a Lambe, but (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> paintes
him) a Lamberising from the Earth, not from Heauen:
in appearance a Lambe, but in working a Wolfe.</p>
            <p>And because he was to be opposite to the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Ghospell (and what that is, was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

the layer of an opposite foundation.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 9.</note> And when

them <hi>Antichristoi polloj,</hi> Many Antichristes. Antichrists
be so Antikeimenists; and Antikeimenists be such as
lay an opposite foundation to Fayth; and that is, in stead
of iustification by Fayth in Christ, to stablish a Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by humaine workes and ordinaunces; but yet
<pb facs="tcp:8445:45"/>
not apertly nor plainely, but by faire painted iuglinges,
able to beguile (as our Sauiour sayth) the very chosen,
if it were possible.</p>
            <p>And what (I pray you) can seeme sounder then this,
to say Christ Iesus hath made Fayth in him alone suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for Saluation, insomuch as he that dieth vpon that
Apprehensió at first, is vndoubtedly saued? But, (marke
this But) such a soule liuing longer, he hath in him from
Christ, such a power to worke well, as by his workes
he is to be saued. And these workes must not be called
workes of the Law, but workes of Fayth, although but
such workes as man deuiseth. Yea, the <hi>Romanist</hi> goeth
further, and sayth: that a man may doe more good
workes then he is necessarily tyed vnto; and so by them
doth <hi>supererogate,</hi> and may giue of these his workes to
his Brother that needeth, for helping out his saluation.
Not to graunt this, say they, is to make Christ idle in vs.
To such effect speake many; and flesh and blood holds
it very reasonable.</p>

               <hi>Externall workes</hi> (of his owne collection) by the which
a soule must be saued. And both he and the Apostaticall
<hi>Popes,</hi> haue agreed further in this, to hold the Bibles
scripture vnsufficient to saluation; whereupon they
haue deuised, either side of them, such Canons and Rules
of obedience, as the doing of them haue more attributed
vnto them, then the obedience of Fayth: When as in
very deed, all such their inuentions may be sayd, as in
<hi>Reuel.</hi> 9. but to come out of a bottomlesse Pit, hauing a
reasonable face (as from man) but in the tayle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
they sting like a Scorpion; for neuer can soule
finde true rest, in flying any part from Christ, vnto their
<pb facs="tcp:8445:45"/>
owne worke. The sense whereof vpon the death-bed,
hath forced many a <hi>Romanist</hi> then to fly altogeather
from his owne Workes, to Christs Merit-worke only:
dying so no true Papist, howsoeuer in other thinges
popish. And here let me repeat a pretty Story, acted in
the Clink-prison in Southwarke at London, before the
stayall of the last great Plague.</p>
            <p>A certaine Romish-priest being there to Prison new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
committed, and not accustomed to bonds, became
exceeding pensiue, he was aduised to take a pipe of
<hi>Tobacco,</hi> and to let the world slide a. He doth so: but
whether for that the <hi>Tobaccoes</hi> smoake encreased Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
or guilt of conscience in respect of some trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or whatsoeuer the cause might be, downe he falles;
and the Keeper <hi>Dauison,</hi> and some others about him,
thought verily he would haue died. They will him to
call vpon God. He doth so, desiring him for Christes
sake, to pardon al his sinnes. After diuers times he had so
prayed, he comes to be reasonably well: whereupon the
Keeper puts vpon him this speach: I pray you sir, how
comes it about, that your breathren haue still suggested
vnto me, that I should goe to God by Saints; and not
directly by Christ; whereas I perceiue, that you in this
agonie, neuer prayed to Saint, but went to God directly
by Christ? To whom the Priest returned such answere.
I pray you be content, I had no leasure to pray vnto
Saints, for I looked but presently to die. <hi>So farre the story.</hi>
Now I pray you, had it not been better for him to haue
died in the former case, then to haue returned to health,
and so to his vomite againe? But say they what they
shall, for maintayning Antichristes opposition against
vs, many of them in their agonies, are glad to turne
Protestant; and for quiet of soule, to betake themselues
to the Fayth of the Ghospell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8445:46"/>
The Ghospell so essentially considered, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
opposition so remembred, let me put downe
the insuing conclusions.</p>
            <p>1. No euill, seuered from such an opposite foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as is iustification with God <hi>by Workes)</hi> can properly
be tearmed <hi>Antichristianit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e;</hi> no more then euery euill,
against Gods good spirit, can properly be tearmed, <hi>The
sinne against the Holy Ghost.</hi> And therefore our Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
calling euery thing they like not, <hi>Antichristianitie,</hi>
shew themselues vntollerably ignorant. For if euery euil
be Antichristianity, then (which is most absurde) euery
soule liuing is Antichristian. And if they will not say
the last, then let them be ashamed of the first.</p>
            <p>2. Then also followeth vngaine sayably, that no
outward forme of discipline is properly Antichristian,
howsoeuer it may be tainted with euill: seeing no such
Discipline can be called an opposite or false Ghospell.</p>
            <p>3. A Church setled vpon a false Ghospel, is (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the best Discipline can he had) a false
Church and Antichristian. The reason is, Discipline is
not an essentiall marke of a true Church: For one and
the same Discipline or outward forme of Gouernment,
can be applyed to Christ or Antichrist. And so on the
other side, a people setled in the true Fayth of the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
is alwayes in such estate, a true Church of God,
notwithstanding a thousand imperfections in Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
For as <hi>Iob</hi> is a true man (and so <hi>Lazarus)</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
much vnsoundnesse in their members: so, a
people may be a true Church, though much vnsound.
The reason is, because the spirit of life still moueth in
their members. And as we know that the spirit of life is

(sayth <hi>S. Paul) man confesseth to saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Then also followeth, that our Nouelistes haue
spunne a faire threed (a plaine Cobweb, for snaring
weake simple Flyes) who haue all this while striuen, not
about the Babe Iesus himselfe, but about his Swathing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and after what manner he is to be swathed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by bringing the Band <hi>crosse</hi> ouer him, or of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fashion. Or, to vse another <hi>Simile;</hi> they haue neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the Garden, and all this while foughten about the
fashion of the Hedge; and where the Stile should stand,
on their side or ours. They that haue so bad eyes, to
iudge of the Garden, are in no wise fit, to be trusted with
the Fence.</p>
            <p>Let me draw to an ende with the wordes of <hi>Ferus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ferus on Math. 24. here is Christ, there is Christ.</note>
(whose speach might awake his Papistes) <hi>Doe the false

preach righteousnesse, sanctification, forgiuenesse of sinnes, and
redemption. For Christ is become all these thinges vnto vs. And
these thinges the false Prophets preach, how we may obtaine
righteousness and redemption. But they teach not, that we must

an Harlot (which tearme properly is giuen to such a

wrought. And to merit at Gods hands by such sleighty
workes doing, it was so toothsome to flesh and blood,
as the Kinges of the Nations did readily receiue it: and
they drinking of that cup, their people followed, till the
Harlots cup of Abhominations made them generally
drunken. So this opposite Ghospell begun; so it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,

that the former Kinges shall in time, arise against the
Harlot (or Malignant Church) wherevpon in chap. 18.
he seeth <hi>Babeis</hi> fall. How this is effected, he telles in the
19 chapter, when he attributes it there to him that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

<hi>The Word of God; the King of Kinges, and the Lord of Lordes.</hi>
And <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> calling the former Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
a Man of Sinne, a Sonne of Perdition, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Man (because they be all one in an opposition to
<pb facs="tcp:8445:49"/>
Christ and his free-grace) he declares, that the Lord
shall consume him with the spirit of his mouth; that is,
by the power of his Ghospell. For as the rising was, by
propounding humaine Fables, and leaden Legendes;
the Ghospell meane time wrapped vp in an vnknowen
Tongue: so, the fall of it wilbe, by preaching Christes
Ghospell in euery Tongue; as vnto such purpose, to
the Apostles were giuen, all sortes of Tongues.</p>
            <p>And that the walles of <hi>Babel,</hi> haue been a falling in

            <p>Tut, say the <hi>Romanistes,</hi> the Opposers haue been (till

            <p>And that the walles of this <hi>Babylon</hi> will quickly fall

Christes birth to <hi>Ierushalems</hi> last ruine, 73. yeares: and
from thence to Antichrists fall, 1260. yeares: the whole
from Christ to <hi>Babels</hi> fall, be 1333. yeares. In which

that so he may not deceiue the people any more.
That this should be for 1000. yeares next after Christ,
or his Apostles, is against experience it selfe; for in that
thousand yeares, the contrary hath falne out. He is shut
vp, not from euery euill, but from deceiuing the people
as afore. Before, he aduaunced a false Ghospell in midst
of the Church, which brought with it 1000. other euils;
but <hi>Babel</hi> once falling, the Angell goes to chayning:
and as the Essentiall euill decreaseth, the linkes of the

            <p>And if we marke it, we shall finde, that <hi>Satan</hi> was

            <head type="sub">Touching a certaine description of the Church
in Reuel. 21. and 22.</head>
            <p>FInally, after the vniuersall day of Doome, <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
draweth an excellent Mappe of the Church: but
whether of the Church tryumphing after iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or of the Church militant heere before iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it is seene by the eye of Fayth; it is not a litle
questionable.</p>
            <p>Many haue taken it for the Church Tryumphant,
not onely for his description in the last place (for that
will not necessarily conclude, seeing somewhat in the
last place, may be but an expositiue Commentary of
that which went before) but for that it is sayd of this
people,<note place="margin">Reuel. 21. 4.</note> that <hi>All teares are wipe away from their eyes, &amp;c.</hi>
Which in proper sense accordeth to the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.</p>
            <p>Some againe do take it for the Church heere<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>So doth</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prouinc. Senosense in decreto 1. <hi>with many others.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;</hi>
not onely for that the Apostle in <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. doth stile
the Christian Church heere, by the name of <hi>Ierushalem
from aboue;</hi> but also for that in this Church, there be
certaine Leaues of a Tree, wherewith the Nations were
to be healed;<note place="margin">Ch. 21. 24. 26. &amp; 22. 2.</note> and after this life, there is no healing of
any errour; much lesse, of the Gentile-kinges bringing
their glory vnto the Triumphant Church.</p>
            <p>And I haue<note n="*" place="margin">As may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in my Bibles Briefe, in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the Reuelation.</note> long suspected, that it is a description
of that part of the Church Militant, which should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> vpon the vniuersall addition of the
<pb facs="tcp:8445:55"/>
               <hi>Iewes,</hi> or rather of all <hi>Israel.</hi> For as, we neuer read of the
ten Tribes vnited againe with <hi>Iudah</hi> (howsoeuer it be
plainely foretyped twyse ouer in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. and there
spoken of, next before the Warres of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>)
so, <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayth, that after the fulnesse of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be
come in, <hi>All Israel shalbe saued (Rom.</hi> 11. 25. 26.) And so, <hi>S.
Iohn</hi> seeth, not onely thousandes of <hi>Iudah, Benjamin,</hi> and
<hi>Leuj,</hi> sealed in the forehead to Godward; but also of
other Tribes (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 7.) following the Lambe, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Moses</hi> his song of Deliuerance: of whom it is sayd,
that there was no guile in their mouth, and that they
were without spot before the Throne of God (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.
1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which is the state of all, to whom sinne is not
imputed. Herewith I haue marked, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> doth
heere keepe the same methode, as did <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> for <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
presently after the downefall of <hi>Gog-magog,</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the New Temple, and distinguish a new, the
<hi>Israelites</hi> portions in <hi>Canaan;</hi> all one (in effect) with this
description of <hi>S. Iohn: Ezekiel</hi> ending with <hi>Iehouah
Shammah,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> with this, that in this new Citie,
<hi>The Lord is there.</hi> But, let it be at the first hand, that it is
a Description of Christes mysticall Body heere, whose
heartes <hi>are purified by Fayth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note> yet, at the second hand, it
may (as a Type) giue vs a resemblaunce of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
finall glory; and that the rather, for that to their
glory, there shalbe after the destruction of all by Fire,
<hi>A new Heauen,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 12. 13.</note> and a new Earth; wherein shall dwell Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
as S. <hi>Peter</hi> plainely teacheth.</p>
            <p>Heere I know, that some vnderstand not according
to sobrietie; but, as if they were Prophets of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
spirit, they boldly determine of thinges yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
As the light of the Righteous encreaseth till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
so, the light of Gods Spirit shalbe enlarged vpon
<pb facs="tcp:8445:55"/>
his Church. But euery age, brings not with it all things;
and let vs be contented with our present measure.
Meane time, the meditation of the Glory to come, will
effect in vs patience vnder present tentations: because,
<hi>The Afflictions of this present life,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> are not worthy of the Glory,
which shall be shewed vnto vs.</hi>

            <l>Angels and Saints be there our Neighbours sweete:</l>

such as themselues hold most
woorthy to be listened vnto. And to
deale otherwise, were to make the Plea, partiall.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Rome,</hi> the Talmudistes dealt wittily, when
not onely one sayth, he saw <hi>Messiah</hi> amongst poore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,
without <hi>Romes</hi> Gates: but also, when (by way of
parable) they teach, that what time <hi>Salomon</hi> matched
with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> pitched a
Reed in the Sea, which grew to a Rocke (a Reedish-rocke)
whereupon <hi>Rome</hi> was built. Old Idolatry ouerturned old
<hi>Rome</hi> (howsoeuer, some Chappels may yet stand there)
and new Idolatrie (doubtlesse) will quickly ouerturne the
New. For faythfull is he, that by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> hath spoken it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Nouelistes,</hi> who count euery passage to a
new faction, for grouth in the fayth (which is indeed, but
the multiplying of a scab into a scurfe) <hi>Iotham</hi> in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

their destinie. The fire shall come out of their sides,
and consume their corporations as Stubble: For the
Plant which God hath not planted, must be pulled vp by
the Rootes.</p>
            <p>When I had an irregular Conceit of our Churches
<hi>Discipline</hi> (as for the <hi>Fayth,</hi> I held it close, and somuch
<hi>Communion</hi> with the Church, as my trauailes then
<pb facs="tcp:8445:58"/>
could well afforde) I then did perceiue in the <hi>Nouelistes</hi>
(not onely some Absurdities of <hi>Opinion,</hi> but also) a flat
<hi>Opposition</hi> betweene their <hi>Fayth</hi> and <hi>Practise.</hi> As
for whith cause, the Archbishop <hi>Whitguift</hi> could some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
say; <hi>If I were of</hi> Cartwrights <hi>opinion, I would
be of the</hi> Brownistes <hi>Practise:</hi> so, the like caused mee in
wordes and writinges, still to be taxing of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
I found them (no lesse then the <hi>Romanist</hi>) iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
implacable. Which as it continued to the time of
that <hi>Conference,</hi> which was to be held at <hi>Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
before the King; so then, after bragges of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
Champions, I was braued by them in the Citie
of <hi>London,</hi> as one that should haue no part in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Prey, because of yore I had not playde their prize.
<hi>Sed apagè, vah,</hi> I shame to thinke, how they there fomed
out their owne shame. But more I blush, that they should
in hugger-mugger still striue to vphold their Gyant of
Straw, hauing broken off his hands and feete so lately,
in presence of the Arke of Testimonie. He may feare
litle Birds at the first; but no doubt, they will ere long
sit vpon his pate, and picke Strawes out of his nose. In the
hope whereof, I so cease this speach.</p>
