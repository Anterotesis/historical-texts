            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOurs I Receiv'd, bearing Date the 3d of
the laſt Month, by which I find you
ſeem to be much afflicted to ſee the
Trade of the Nation Ruin'd, and your Native
Countrey brought into ſo great Calamity as now
it is; and deſire me to give you ſome account,
if poſſible, How, and by what means, all theſe
Evils have been brought upon the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which I ſhall endeavour to do, in as brief
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60395:3"/>
a manner as I can, and in order to it ſhall relate
to you ſome publick Tranſactions in relation to
the Late War, and then leave you and all Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Men to Judge who it is has been the Grand
Inſtruments of bringing all theſe Evils upon us.</p>
            <p>For the Scituation of our Countrey and the
Conſtitution of our Government, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been eſteem'd the Happieſt Nation in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
And no People in the Univerſe ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a longer ſeries of Peace and Plenty than
we have done. Yet during the time of the
Late War, we have ſeen the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(ſome Ages araiſing) almoſt totally ruin'd;
and a general Poverty and Diſtreſs brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole Kingdom, and that in the Reign
even of the beſt of Princes.</p>
            <p>Trade has ever been the Univerſal Miſtriſs
of Mankind, Courted and Carreſt by all Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
Nations, many Bloody Wars having been
carryed on by thoſe that have been Rivals for
her favour, for ſhe never fails to beſtow unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Bleſſings upon her admirers, being always
attended with Riches, Honour, Power, and all
other Earthly Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60395:3"/>
Thoſe Nations that obtained her favour, and
have not had the Wiſdom and Prudence to retain
her, we ſee have grown Weak and Depiſeable,
and Laine expoſed a Prey to other Nations,
which appears to be the preſent Caſe of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Forefathers enjoyed a large ſhare of her
favour, which they carefully handed down to us,
but we like unthrifty and undutiful Children
have been ſo far from following their Footſteps,
that we have been (as appears by our Actions)
great Enemies to Trade, and uſed all manner of
Violence to make her fly the Nation, wherein
ſhe had long Cohabited with us, and ſeem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to depart, till our continual Acts of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
were ſuch as they grew inſupportable;
So that ſhe has now taken her flight into the
Neighbouring Nations, <hi>Viz. Holland</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Dutch</hi> having grown Rich by the Late War, and improved themſelves 8 Millions; they are a wiſe People and (among themſelves) ſtrict obſervers of Juſtice, never ſuffering any to grow great out of the Ruins of the Publick; as Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> well obſerves in his Memoirs, and which is the true cauſe of the flouriſhing condition of their State.</note> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by whom ſhe is highly Carreſt, and not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60395:4"/>
like to return in haſte; and unleſs ſhe do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
we can expect no other than to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
People (Land it ſelf having a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon Trade, and Riſes or Falls as that
ebbs or flows).</p>
            <p>But before we can expect that, it's neceſſary
to be known what way and means it was we
took to make her deſert us; Unleſs we do ſo,
we can never expect her Return; for ſhe is Coy
and Nice, and will not bear the leaſt Affront, but
cleave to thoſe who treat her beſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt ill uſage Trade appears to have met
withal from us, was at the breaking out of the
Late War. Ever ſince all manner of Perſons,
Things or Matters, that have had relation to,
or were intereſſed in Trade, have been evil
treated by thoſe whoſe immediate Duty it was
to have encouraged and protected them.</p>
            <p>It's well known our Ships (under God) are
our greateſt Security and the Glory of our Iſle,
and the Saylors our <hi>Mirmidons,</hi> whom we ought
to cheriſh as the Apple of our Eye; yet all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60395:4"/>
time of the Late War, they were moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
treated, even as if they had not been of
the Race of Mankind, but a ſort of Vermine
fit to be rooted out; for what by their evil
treatment on board Ship, and frequent turning
over without Pay, the unjuſt pricking them
<hi>Run,</hi> and being harraſt with the uncertainty of
Payments, many thouſands of theſe poor Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and their Families have been deſtroy'd, and
great Numbers conſtrain'd to leave their Native
Countrey, and betake themſelves to Foreign
Service, or (which is worſe) turn Pyrates.</p>
            <p>This evil treatment of the poor Saylors,
tho in it ſelf highly Wicked, ſeems to have
been one of the Leaſt of the Crimes committed
in the Government, tending to the deſtruction of
Trade<note n="*" place="bottom">For the firſt five years of the War it appears we were ſeldom free from an Embargo upon Shipping; few or no Ships were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad to ſail till they got Protections and Permits, to the great Charge of the Merchants, and damage to Trade in general; as Little Care was taken to protect our Shipping, not any one perſon having been ſo much as appointed to examine Sea-Commanders Journals, all the time of the Late War; but they were left to their own Genius to act and do as they pleas'd; and thus by the Lords of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty's, and Commiſſioners of the Navys Wiſe Conduct, and Prudent Management of Affairs, we Loſt above 100 Ships of War, with many Hundreds of Merchantmen, to the great Honour of the Nation.</note>; for it appears there was Articles
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60395:5"/>
brought into the Houſe of Peers (the Higheſt
Court of Judicature in the Nation againſt the
Lords of the Admiralty, the Commiſſioners of
the Navy, and the Commiſſioners for the Sick
and Wounded Seamen, by one Mr. <hi>Crosfield,</hi> in
the year 1694.</p>
            <p>Upon which their Lordſhips Examin'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Witneſſes at the Bar of the Houſe, and
were very Zealous in the Matter; but it ſeems
the Articles were drawn out of the Houſe by
the <hi>Commiſſioners for ſtating the Publick Accounts,</hi>
who never proceeded therein, though their
Lordſhips iſſued out two ſucceſſive Orders for
them ſo to do; but for your better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that Poſterity may ſee the Wickedneſs
of the Age, I here give you a true Copy of
thoſe Articles, and which are as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60395:5"/>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> 1. That the preſent Commiſſioners for Sick and Wounded
Seamen, and Exchanging Priſoners at War, depending on the
Admiralty) not regarding Inſtructions, or the Good of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
have committed groſs Ennormities; as Holding or
Conniving at an unlawful Correſpondence with the <hi>French,</hi> and
Wronging both the King and Subject in their Accompts, with
other great Miſcarriages: All which has been about a Year ſince
laid in Writing before the Secretary of State by one Mr. <hi>Baſton,</hi>
and by the King's Command examin'd before the Lords of the
Admiralty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it will appear, that the ſaid Commiſſion
has been very injurious to the poor Sailors in particular, and
very detrimental to the Government in general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> 2. That the Lords of the Admiralty, and Commiſſioners
of the Navy, have acted contrary to the Publick Good, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing,
ſupporting, and preferring Criminals; and on the
contrary, perſecuting the Diſcoverers, and turning juſt Men
out of their Offices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> 3. That their Lordſhips have had great Diſcoveries laid
before them of Embezlements, and other great Frauds commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the King's Yards, attended with Forgery and Perjury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> 4. That it is manifeſt ſome of the Commiſſioners of the
Navy have in that Office advanced themſelves from Salaries of
30l. <hi>per Annum</hi> to vaſt Eſtates, having paſſed great Frauds,
and totally diſcouraged the Diſcovery of embezled Stores, to the
great waſte of the Publick Treaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ar.</hi> 5. That it has been a long Practice in the Navy to make
out Falſe Tickets and Powers, ſuſpending and delaying the poor
Saylors in their Juſt Payments, to the general Diſcouragement
of them, and Starving their Families.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60395:6"/>
The <hi>Commiſſioners of the Poſt-Office</hi> appear to
have as much contributed towards the Ruin of
their Countrey, as any perſons living, having all
along ſupported their Officers in all their Evil
Actions, as Correſponding with known Papiſts
and others diſaffected to the Government, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the King's Mail, breaking open Perſons of
Qualities Letters, all along Countenancing and
Supporting a ſmugling Trade, by bringing in the
Mail, and other ways vaſt quantities of <hi>Flanders</hi>
Lace,<note n="*" place="bottom">Indeed theſe Gentlemen have ſince been very Inſtrumental in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Late Act to be made, the better to prevent the bringing in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bone-Lace; as likewiſe have been the Lords of the Admiralty, and Commiſſioners of the Navy, in procuring an Act to prevent the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezlement, and ſtealing his Majeſty's Naval-Stores; and therein they have done wiſely, <hi>When the Steed's ſtol'n to ſhut the Stable-door.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being reſolved, it ſeems, to make as
plentiful an Harveſt as they could, ſo long as the
War laſted. Withal they were not wanting to
uſe all indirect means to Ruin ſuch of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
or others, that detected the Crimes.</p>
            <p>All theſe Matters relating to the foregoing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Poſt-Office,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60395:6"/>
were long ſince published in Print, by divers
hands, wherein a more large and ample account
has been given of them; and they were Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Preſented to our late Repreſentatives in
Parliament, who took no more notice thereof
than if theſe things had been acted and done in
the Great <hi>Moguls</hi> Country.</p>
            <p>Moreover there appears to have been laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Late Repreſentatives, many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the greateſt Importance. 1 <hi>ſt.</hi> In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the <hi>Touloun Squadron</hi> getting into <hi>Breſt.</hi>
It having been declar'd by the Houſe, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
had timely notice given whereby the
ſaid <hi>Fleet</hi> might have been intercepted. <hi>2dly.</hi>
In Relation to the <hi>Mint,</hi> it did appear to the
Houſe the Monyers in the <hi>Tower</hi> had committed
foul Crimes, and that ſeveral Dies had been
Convey'd away for Coyning falſe Mony abroad.
<hi>3dly.</hi> In reference to the Disbanded Troopers
that ſerv'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> who by their
Petition appear to have been moſt Barbarouſly

of the Commiſſioners of the Victualling Office.

               <hi>5thly.</hi> In relation to the 27 Sail of Victuallers
being taken by the <hi>Dunkerkers,</hi> the Houſe having
declar'd, the Lords of the Admiralty had timely
notice given them, whereby they might have
prevented their falling into the Enemies hand.</p>
            <p>Theſe with a Multitude of other matters that
lay before the Houſe, were dropt by our Late
Repreſentatives, who took no manner of Care
to do the People Juſtice<note n="*" place="bottom">Sad it is to conſider how all Complaints af Abuſes done in the Government, have been ſtifled for want of a Committee of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (according to our ancient Laws and Cuſtoms) to be ſitting during the Seſſion of Parliament, to hear the Grievances of the People; which is plain was not done all the time of the late War.</note>; Indeed the Houſe

Yet all they did therein, was to take care how to
waſh them white; and while the War was on
foot, our late Repreſentatives ſeem'd to be very
zealous for an Act to be made againſt the buying
and ſelling of Employments; but when once we
had obtain'd an Honourable Peace, they ſoon
dropt the Matter, as conceiving the People then
better able to bear their Pack<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Englands</hi> Calamities diſcover'd, ſold by—<hi>Fox</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> &amp;c.</note> than they were

King has been wrong'd ſeveral Thouſand Pounds,
that was deſign'd to have been laid before the
Late Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> but the Gentleman
who intended to have done it, was diſwaded
from doing it by a Member of the Houſe; who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60395:8"/>
plainly told him of all their Members, they
could not make above 100, or 110 at moſt in

by what means, and by whom the Trade

by the Conſequence of which many Thouſands

their Evils have riſen. Theſe things are very

            <p>We find King <hi>David</hi> Complain'd he could not

who has had ſo many Sons of <hi>Zur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah</hi>

ſeveral Corporations, and how they were able
thereby to ſupport one another in whatever they
ſhould act or do, and put it out of the Power of
any (even the King himſelf) to call them to an
account for their Actions. It's evident ours is a
mixt Government, wherein the People have a
large ſhare, and if we will not Act our Part (in

By this we may ſee what a great Duty there

as I conceive, to have been the true Cauſe all
the Blood and Treaſure ſpent in the late War, for

Water ſpilt on the ground.</p>
            <p>Our Trade being in great meaſure Ruin'd,
