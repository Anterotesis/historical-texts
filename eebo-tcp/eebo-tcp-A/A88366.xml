            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe turbulent times, when opinions grow variable, and the diverſity of doubtfull reports more voluble than the ruſhing winde; yet have I adventured (like to an old practicioner, in Proſe, Poeſie, and unparalelled peregrination) to caſt in my Myte of known Experience, upon the Brazen faces of ignorant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders, that with the knowledge of my quotidian inſpection, I may either enlighten their blindeſſe, or give truth the glory of a juſt deſerving. And why? becauſe now too too many calumnious Criticks, being more prone to cenſure other mens labours, then to do any thing themſelves worthie of cenſure, yet dare to upbraid that which hardly their ſiniſtruous judgement can rightly conſtruct. The world being turned to ſuch a crabbed and crooked condition, that either they will approve what they conceive, though never ſo erronious, or otherwiſe diſprove that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113088:3"/>
which they affect not, though never ſo illuſtrious. Wherefore damnifying the one, and villifying the other I come to court my preſent purpoſe; and thus I begin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <lg>
               <l>This long croſs'd labour, now it comes to light,</l>

               <l>Which reaſon craved; for where can truth prevaile,</l>
               <l>But where ſound judgement may it countervaile.</l>
               <l>For what ſeek I? in what theſe times afford,</l>
               <l>But of my Countries praiſe, a just record,</l>
               <l>Which God allows; and what can contraires bring,</l>
               <l>But man for men, the light of truth may ſing,</l>
               <l>Elſe after ages would be borne as blinde,</l>
               <l>As though our time, had come their time behinde:</l>
               <l>For curious Penmen, and the Paper Scroule,</l>
               <l>They are of memorie, the life and ſoule.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>After our firſt Army (levyed in the hollow time of Winter, 1644 and led by the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> Lord General) had with certain oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions recourſed over <hi>Tyne,</hi> and thence falling downe to <hi>Sunderland,</hi> ſituate upon the River <hi>Weir (Durhams</hi> dallying and circulating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort) after, I ſay, they had beene provoked by the Lord <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and Lieutenant Generall <hi>King,</hi> upon the Sabboth day, to give them Battell; it was skirmiſhed and fought two dayes together at <hi>Bowdon</hi> Hill, March 20, 21. 1644. whereby the great mercy of the divine Providence, that laudable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Victory fell to our Armie, and the enemie in a retyring way flying for <hi>Durham,</hi> fled ſhortly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in a confuſed march unto <hi>York.</hi> To which place (their refuge) his Excellence with our Army mainly advancing, beleagured the greater halfe of the Towne; the Earle <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> envyroning the reſt.</p>
            <p>Where diverſe weeks and dayes being ſpent, in advancing their Works, their atchievements, and other approaches, there fell out (<hi>interim</hi>) certaine accidentall Skirmiſhes and countermatching aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113088:3"/>
In one of which, that mirrour of <hi>Mars</hi> and manhood, Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lonell <hi>Ballantine</hi> was deadly wounded, whereof he dyed: A large ſubject have I here to handle, if time might ſuffer me, but true it is, hee was a Cavalier of ſuch extraordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (being onely 28 years of age at his laſt <hi>vale</hi>) that in <hi>Germany, Ireland,</hi> and twice in <hi>England,</hi> hee became exceeding auſpicuous in Martiall affaires, though indeed he was beſt underſtood under the name of Major <hi>Ballantine.</hi> All which diſcourſe, and this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizd memoriall, I purpoſely abandon till a fitter time; and ſo I returne to my former Commentary, and thus:</p>
            <p>This Siege of <hi>Yorke</hi> continuing ſtill with many fortunate and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate adventures, at laſt our ſeverall Armies were enforced to incorporate themſelves in one maine body, and that on Long-<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> Moore. Where the day following Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> imbracing their left field: our Armie upon advertiſement thereof, were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make a ſpeedy returne, for rancountring the enemie, and to recover that ground which formerly they had freely forſaken: Which in the end, amongſt many difficulties and mighty oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, they both adventerouſly and advantagiouſly obtained, to the enemies abſolute overthrow, and their own victorious ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſummarie whereof, I now involue in theſe following lynes, as unwilling to imbarke my ſelfe within the liſts of intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated paſſages, or too peremptory and punctuall particulars; and why? becauſe I was not there an occular Teſtator, and ſo to build upon the wings of flying report were meerly erronious, (the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities whereof being already innumerable and incredible) but only done by way of introduction, to bring me the more facily upon the face of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> or otherwiſe more properly, to enlighten memorie for preſent and future times. And thus,</p>

            <p>The day following our aforeſaid armie accoaſted <hi>Lumley</hi> Caſtle, where ſojourning certaine dayes, the Lord <hi>Calendar,</hi> with a number of horſe and foot (in this time) ſet face for <hi>Hatlepoole</hi> and <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun.</hi> Where, when come, and after a promiſcuous parleye, ſeaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon both townes, he left garriſons there, and governours to overrule them. Whence returning to the reſidue of his armye, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Lumleye,</hi> he ſet forward to <hi>Oſworth.</hi> From which place my Lord <hi>Calendar,</hi> ſending ſome horſe and foote to clear the way for the <hi>Gateſyde,</hi> they were rancountred with the enemye, at the tope of the wynd mill hill, where being prevented by night, and thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye ſtronger than they, they were conſtrained to turne back. Whereupon the next day the Lieutennant Generall himſelfe, came up with the reſidue of his armye, and fiercelie facing the enemy,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113088:6"/>
beat them from the hill, chaſed them downe the <hi>Gateſyde,</hi> and huſhing them along the bridge, cloſed them within the towne. Hereupon he forthwith commanded the <hi>Gateſyde,</hi> and then the next day he begunne to diſpute for the enjoying of the bridge, with the fierie ſervice of Cannon and Musket, which indeed was manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded, and as couragiouſly defended. Yet at laſt, in deſpight of the enemy he gained the better halfe of the Bridge, and with much adoe fortified the ſame with earthen Rampiers, and Artile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which ſtill ſo defenſively continued, untill the Towne was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in by Storme. This being regardfully done, he cauſed to erect five Batteries, along the Bankhead, and juſt oppoſite to the Town, from whence the Cannon did continually extreame good ſervice, not onely againſt the walls and batteries, but alſo againſt particular places, and particular perſons: Beſides the frequent ſhooting of Potpieces, and other fireworkes of great importance, which daily annoyed the Inhabitants within Towne: At the moſt of which firie imployments the Lord <hi>Calendar</hi> himſelf was ever perſonally directing them, to the which dexterity of charge, I was often both an eye witneſſe and obſerver.</p>
            <p>By this time, or there about, his Excellence arryving here from <hi>York,</hi> and accoaſting the <hi>Tyne,</hi> he cauſed immediatly build a Bridge over the River of Keill boats, over the which his Armie having ſafely and peaceably paſt, he cauſed lay downe their ſeverall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with great promptitude and expedition: And ſo beleaguring the Weſt and Northweſt parts of the Town, they incloſed all that circuit, till they joyned with the Lord <hi>Sinclairs</hi> Regiment; <hi>Sheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Fort (belonging to the Town) only dividing them: And ſo this rebellious Town was mainly blocked up on all quarters. Now, and at this time alſo, the Earle <hi>Calendar</hi> recroſſing <hi>Tyne,</hi> tooke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in <hi>Sandgate,</hi> the one end whereof ſtanding contiguat with the Towne wals. Where ſetting ſundrie Regiments there, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that place, he forthwith cauſed to conſtruct a ſtrong Bridge of Keill boats over <hi>Tyne</hi> (and within his quarters) for the paſſing and repaſſing of his forces to both ſides, and fixed the ſame a pretty
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113088:6"/>
way below the Glaſſe-houſe. This advantagious paſſage became very ſteedable, not onely for the Souldiers, but alſo for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people, that brought in daily proviſion for the Armie. The Bridge it ſelf (being daily guarded with my Lord <hi>Kenmoores</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at both ends, and a ſtrong Centrie ſet at each of them within two Redoubts) had alſo three watrie guards of Keill boats, tyed with cable ropes, from banke to banke, to ſecure it from any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>Now as for the manner of the common Souldiers lying here in their ſeverall Leagures, and in all parts about the Towne, their Manſions or Domiciles, I meane their Houts are compoſed, of Turff, Clay, Straw, and Watles. Where their Halls, Chambers, Kitchines and Cellars are all one: And yet the better ſort (I mean their Officers) are overſhadowed with circulating Pavillions, more ready to receive the bluſtring winde than the ſinking raine. Then at laſt, all things being orderly done, and their batteries at ſundrie advantages erected; then (I ſay) begun they to play with Cannon and Musket at others faces, and often alſo tempering their naked ſwords in others bloudy bodies: where courage caſſieting deſpair, and valour deſirous of Honour, they expoſed themſelves unto all hazards and dangerous attempts: Neither did they feare death (I meane our owne) more then an auſpicuous fortune, for being clad with conſorts, each provoked another to the uttermoſt of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; and ſome of them eſteeming of the good Cauſe, more than of their owne lives, reſerved the one, and loſt the other. So alſo the inveterate enemie, making now and then diverſe ſallies from Towne (iſſuing at Poſterne gates) upon our flanking trenches, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged themſelves into great jeopardies, and our Souldiers to as deſperata defence. Where indeed they both often taſted of mutuall fatalitie; till in end, the Lord <hi>Sinclairs</hi> Regiment, deſygned theſe debording hyrelings a narrower precinct; which was, to keepe their falling bodies more ſafely within their ſheltring walls, which indeed they conſtrainedly obſerved. For the enemy within, were more affrayed of the Lord <hi>Sinclairs</hi> Souldiers without, then of any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113088:7"/>
one Regiment of the Army lying about, and they had juſt reaſon, recogitating ſeriouſly their ſanguine blowes and fatall rancounters, which they diſdainfully felt.</p>
            <p>And now before I go any further, I thinke it beſt to ſhew the unacquainted Reader how the Towne is ſituate, from whence ſuch mortalitie proceeded; and thus, it ſtandeth mainly upon the deval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling face of a continuing hill, falling downe ſteep to the bordering River, where one narrow ſtreet runneth along from <hi>Sandgate</hi> to <hi>Cloſſegate.</hi> The <hi>Sandhill</hi> (from which the Bridge bendeth over to <hi>Gateſide</hi>) being the pryme market place, whence the two aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding paſſages, court diſtinctly High ſtreet, and Pilgrime ſtreet, the two chiefeſt ſtreets of the Towne; to the bowels of which, there bee other three market places annexed. Now beſides theſe there are other two back ſtreets, with five or ſix <hi>Contrades,</hi> and a number of narrow devalling lanes. The walles about the Town are both high and ſtrong, built both within and without with <hi>ſaxo quadrato;</hi> and maynely fenced with dungeon Towres, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded alſo with Turrets, and alongſt with them a large and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive battlement, having eight ſundry ports, and four parochiall Churches: The which walles, the defendants within, had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilouſly fortifyed, rampiering them about, at moſt eminent parts, with interlynings and mountaynes of earth. The ſtreets that were anſwerable to their barrocaded Ports, and in frequent paſſages, were alſo caſten up with defenſive breaſtworks, and planted with Demi-culverines of irone: And above all other workes, the towne Caſtle it ſelf, was ſeriouſly enlarged, with diverſe curious fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, beſides breaſtworks, Redoubts, and terrenniat <hi>Demilunes;</hi> and withall three diſtinctive Horne-workes, two of which exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly are ſtrongly palloſaded, and of great bounds. Nay, the very Capſtone of the battlements round about the Towne, were ſurged and underpropd with little ſtones; that in caſe of ſcalleting, they might have tumbled them over upon the Aſſailants: Which indeed for the facility of the action, Schoole boyes might have performed. Yea, and all the gapes of the battlements, were ſhut up
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113088:7"/>
with lime and ſtone, having a narrow ſlit in each of them, through which they might murther our Souldiers; and ſecure themſelves from a juſt revenge. The graffe about and without, was digged deeper, and the exteriour root of the walls, were ſteeply lyned with clay-mixt earth, to intercept any footing for Leddars, or climbing thereon: All the Ports about were cloſed with lyme and ſtone, and ſtrongly barrocaded within, having no paſſage ſave at little poſterne doores, where they had their quotidian inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
            <p>The Townes maine conſtructure ryſing upwards, divides it ſelfe in two corners, the one North at <hi>Weavers</hi> Tower, the other South weſt at <hi>Hatmakers</hi> Tower, decyphering two Hornes, like unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrian</hi> Females with their bogling busks; but indeed more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Novacaſtrians</hi> themſelves, that retrogradingly adorne their Cuckolds fronteſpices, with the large dimenſion of <hi>Acteons</hi> mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous-made hornes. Vpon the Townes Northeaſt ſide, and a little without, there was a fortreſſe erected, called <hi>Sheiffield</hi> Fort, ſtanding on a moderate height, and Champion-like commanding the fields; the modell thus: It ſtandeth ſquarely quadrangled, with a foure cornerd Baſtion at every angle, and all of them thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drat, they are compoſed of earth and watles; having the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt ſide of one bulwarke palloſaded, the reſt not, ſave along the top of the worke about, they had laid Maſts of Ships to beat down the aſſailants with their tumbling force. At the entrie whereof there is a wooden draw-bridge, and within it two Courts <hi>du guard,</hi> the graffe without is dry and of ſmall importance, ſave onely that repugnancie of the Defendants within, which commonly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of three hundred men.</p>
            <p>And now to cloſe this <hi>Topographicall</hi> deſcription, the invention, policie, nor wit of man, could have done more, than they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without for their own ſafetye, either for military diſcipline, or manly proueſſes, in their owne deſperat defence. Of whom our owne Countrey-men, were the cheeffeſt actors, both for the one and for the other; and the onely cauſe of ſo much bloodſhed, and

a pretended formalitye, than the ſavage <hi>Sabuneks</hi> with whom I leave them here engroſſed: And now forſaking this preſent intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I come backe to my continewing diſcourſe. The ſiege growing dayly more and more hotter and hotter, at all quarters, and in all places, as wele in the one ſide, as in the other; then, and at which tyme (I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe) that theſe indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable pains my Lord <hi>Calendar</hi> took, were more than praiſe worthy, for late and early, and at all times, he was extraordinary carefull, paynefull, and diligent, in overſeeing here and there his Mynes, in directing his batteryes, in managing privat and prudent ends for a publick good, in diſpatching of meſſingers and meſſages, and in ordering of his ſouldiers atchievements, by night or by day as they were imployed; inſomuch that his induſtrious, and vigilant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, became a merveilous amazement; to all theſe that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his paynes, and for my part, to ſhunne ingratitude, worthy of deſerved memorie.</p>
            <p>The chief Cannoneirs, that were upon his five batteryes in the <hi>Gateſyde,</hi> were <hi>William Hunter</hi> Captain of the trayne of Artillerie, <hi>Iames Scot, Robert Spenſe,</hi> and <hi>William Wallace,</hi> men of ſingular skill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many moe, which I purpoſely (to avoyd prolixitie) omit: And now from here and hence, the Lievtennant Generall traverſing hourely the river to his other batteryes, and workes at <hi>Sandgate</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely two, he was ever in a faſtidious action; One of which batteries, beat downe the top, face, and upmoſt parts of <hi>Carpenters</hi> Tower unto the duſt. The other batterie had been newly erected for repulſing the enemy from intercepting our Mines. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof the <hi>Nullifidians</hi> within, diſcovered the loweſt Myne next to the river ſyde: The which my Lord <hi>Calendar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving, and thruſting a pyke with his own hand, through the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diviſion, and to prevent the drowning thereof, gave preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order that the next morning it ſhould be ſprung: Which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done, it tumbled over the <hi>demi-hornewark,</hi> diſſapointed the enemye, and became a ſhelterage to our encroaching ſouldiers.

            <p>About this ſame time. <hi>September.</hi> 29. the Lord Lieutennant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Baillie</hi> upon the Townes north ſyde, and near to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church, gave order (for their his batterie lay) to braſh downe a part of the Towne wall, which in three hours ſpace was fortunatly accompliſhed; where the wall fell down, within half a yard of the roote, and ſo large that ten men might have marched through it in a front. This tryall gave indeed a great encouragement to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye; and why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe then our Commanders, were aſſured, that if their Mynes ſhould be diſſapointed, the braſhing of the walls ſhould be their laſt advantage. And yet this breach was never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, in regard the enemie under the ſhaddow of a blynd of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſe, reenforced, or barrocaded it with traſh and timber.

Whereat the enemie growing inſolent, gave order for ringing of bells all night, to conſolate (as it were) the diſtreſſed mindes of the ſtarving communaltie, who rather fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on violent neceſſitie, than any other kinde of cheriſhing or comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reliefe: Being whiles flattered with impoſſibilities, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiles tyrannized over, by the malicious malignitie of the mercileſſe, and now miſerable Maior.</p>
            <p>For true it is, that this Sir <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marley</hi> their Governour, an oeconomick Polititian, more wilfull than skillfull, did ſo inveigle, and blindfold the common multitude, that theſe letters which hee ſent to our Lord Generall, were all read by him in publike to them, being too peremptorie and impertinent: but for the anſwer of his Excellence that came to him, he concealed them all, making them to believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would admit of no condition, nor grant any ſafety longer than the revenging ſword, might overreach their necks.</p>
            <p>All which being falſly and perfidiouſly ſpoken, was onely to irritate their doubtfull diſpoſitions, and to incenſe their deſperate condition, with the deceit of a treacherous deſpaire, to make them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113088:9"/>
bolder for their dreadfull defence: for indeed there was an order condeſcended upon, by the Committee, ſome five weeks before their ruine approached, which was, that if they ſhould render in time, and prevent the greater effuſion of bloud, they ſhould have faire and free quarters, and all theſe liberall conditions, that people in the like caſe, could either look for, or require. But all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers or offers, were by the Maior vilified, and by him concealed from the people, till their day of deſolation was declared. And now the coppies of theſe intercourſing letters being lately publiſhed to the vulgar world, and ſtriving to relinquiſh unneceſſary particulars, or any obvious rancounter of ſmall conſequence, I come to the maine point: and thus,</p>
            <p>After ten weeks ſiege and odde dayes, with many diſaſtruous affronts, following on all hands, there was a parley appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fryday October 18. where in the forenoone our three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, the Lord <hi>Humbie,</hi> the Laird of <hi>Wedderburne,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rutherfurd</hi> Proveſt of <hi>Iedbrugh,</hi> went in (the three Hoſtages from the Towne being formerly come forth) ours, I ſay, accoaſting the Maiors preſence, there were diverſe propoſitions and anſwers by both parties delivered, but to no purpoſe nor effect. The Maior ever dallying with drifts and delayes to procraſtinate time, till they had diſcovered our two chiefe Mines, which indeed were very near the point: yet nevertheleſſe (in a jeering way) our Commiſſioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmiſſed after five houres conference, and their Pledges return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the next morning early the untimely preventing Maior, ſent forth a Drummer, to the Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi> with two Letters; the contents of one was thus, <hi>My Lord, I have received diverſe Letters and warrants ſubſcribed by the name of</hi> Leven, <hi>but of late can heare of none that have ſeen ſuch a man; beſides, there is a strong report hee is dead: Therefore to remove all ſcruples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deſire our Drummer, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver one Letter to himſelfe; Thus wiſhing you could thinke on ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe to compoſe the differences of theſe ſad diſtracted Kingdomes, than by battering</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>and annoying us who never wronged any of you, for if you ſeriouſly conſider, you will finde that theſe courſes will</hi>

            <p>Now let the judicious Reader obſerve, how deteſtable a thing it was to ſee this improvident man brought to ſuch extremity, (that he could neither pitie himſelfe nor yet a populous Towne) when he was juſt upon the point of life or death to wryte thus: for indeed long before night (for all his baſe deriſion) he knew his Excellence to be alive, and found deſervingly the ſmart of it: And now not to forget any maine circumſtance, the Maior, the former night, recalled the Souldiers from <hi>Sheeffield</hi> Fort, to ſtrengthen the Defendants within Towne; but ere they left the fortreſſe, they deſpightfully burned their two Courts <hi>du guard</hi> to the ground, and ſo retired: Now the ſequell day come, being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, October 19. (and that day which from age to age New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle ſhould never forget) there were certaine commanded men, from every Regiment drawne up, The Officers, I ſay, having firſt in their owne quarters throwne the dyce, who ſhould goe in the adventure (feweſt blacks deſtinated thereto) they marched away to all their ſeverall ſtands about the walls, againe ten of the clocke in the forenoone. Meanewhile the night before was the Earle of <hi>Calendars</hi> Cannon carried about, to ſupply and ſtrengthen the four batteries that were to braſh the wals, where with the reſt they did exceeding good ſervice.</p>
            <p>Now the Mynes being ready to ſpring, and the batteries brought to their greateſt perfection, about three a clock in the afternoone, the two moſt available Mynes were ſprung, one at the Whytefriers Tower Weſtward, and the other, neare Carres Fort, or <hi>Sandgate</hi> Eaſtward; (notwithſtanding there were other two ſprung here, one of which miſcarried) ſo alſo, I ſay, the breaches of the walles by the batteries being made open and paſſable, and leddars ſet to at diverſe parts for ſcalleting: Then entred mainely and manfully all the Regiments of our commanded men at all quarters, but more facily and leſſe dangerous where the Mynes ſprung: The greateſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113088:10"/>
difficultie, and mightieſt oppoſition, nay, and the foreſt ſlaughter we received, was at the climbing up of theſe ſteep &amp; ſtay breaches, where truely, and too truely, the enemie did more harme with hand <hi>garnads,</hi> then either with Musket, Pyke, or <hi>Herculean</hi> clubs: This Club hath a long iron-banded ſtaffe, with a round falling head (like to a Pomegranate) and that is ſet with ſharpe iron pikes, to ſlay or ſtrike with; the forehead whereof being ſet with a long poynted pyke of iron; it grimely looketh like to the pale face of murther. The firſt of the foure breaches, was neare to Weavers Tower, where Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Henderſon</hi> a Reformeir, and Major <hi>Mophet</hi> were killed, with many others of ſpeciall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon note. The ſecond batterie was conjoyned with black <hi>Beſsies</hi> Tower, where Major <hi>Hepburne,</hi> Captaine <hi>Corbet,</hi> Captaine <hi>Iohn Home</hi> an <hi>Edinburgenſen,</hi> and that renowned Officer Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Home</hi> were ſlaine.

            </lg>
            <p>The third batterie was contiguat with that dungeon of <hi>Weſtgate;</hi> where theſe two Captaines <hi>Iohn, and Thomas Hammiltons</hi> were ſlaine, with ſundrie other of our <hi>Cliddiſdale</hi> Regiment. The fourth and laſt was low by <hi>Cloſsegate,</hi> where the Earle <hi>Buckcleughs</hi> and <hi>Lowdons</hi>

Regiments entred, both at their batteries and with ſcalleting leddars; whereupon their fell a fierce conflict and the falling enemye repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both with the courage and reſolution of our ſouldiers: And yet we receaved there but ſmall loſſe either of Officers or others, albeit one had been too many, the divyne pleaſure and providence excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Now our men being enterd, and fighting for enterye at all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters round about, Let me pauſe a while and conſider! How grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous? And how dreadfull hot, that cruell conflict was for a long houres ſpace: That truelie it was more than admirable! to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the deſperat courage both of the Aſſailants and Defendants: The thundering Cannon roaring from our batteries without, and theirs rebounding from the Caſtle within; the thouſands of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket balls flyeing at others faces, Like to the droving hayleſtones from ſeptentrion blaſts; the clangour and carving Of naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed ſwords; the puſhing of brangling Pykes, crying for blood; and the pittyfull clamour, of heart-fainting woemen, imploring for mercie to their husbands, themſelves, and their children. That me thought (when now ſeriouſly pondered) their reverberating ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes piercing the clouds; that terrible noyſe of fyrie incenſed <hi>Martialists,</hi> and that loathſome inſpection upon the brazen faces of deſperation; had conjured (I ſay) the Heavens to confound and diſſolve the earth; the earth to overwhelme the infernall Pit, the Carkaſes of men to lye like dead dogges upon the groaning ſtreets: and man againſt man to become the object of homicidious and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cruelty; O! loathſome ſight of deſpayre. Neither was this all, for our people in this ſelfe tyme ſet a houſe on fire at <hi>Cloſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> whereon there fell a meritorious deſtruction. So had the whole Towne beene ſerved (and a ſmall revenge although it had beene ſo) if it had not beene ſpeedily prevented by the relenting pittie of the Earle <hi>Calendar.</hi> So was there likewiſe at this preſent combuſtion, a Ballenger Boat ſet floting on the flood, full of flaming fire, (by Captaine <hi>Andrew Abirnethie</hi>) to have burned the keye-lockt ſhips lay there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:113088:11"/>Inſomuch that there was no policie left undone, for the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deſtroy deſtruction, nor for a ſpeedy revenge, to bring the ruines of ruine to nothing: Yet now returning to obſerve my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall order; in this moſt dreadfull conflict, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Brigade of that renowned Commander the Lord <hi>Calendar,</hi> had breaſted and overpaſſed, that blowneup Myne, connexed with <hi>Carres</hi> fort (where Captaine <hi>Sinclair</hi> and other two of leſſer note loſt their lives) then I ſay, they marched celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly along to the <hi>Sandhill,</hi> with flyeing collours and roaring Drummes: Meane while and at this inſtant, the Lieutennant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Calendar</hi> entering the Towne, diſpatched and directed, the Lord <hi>Levingſton,</hi> and <hi>Killhead,</hi> the earle of <hi>Quensberryes</hi> brother, with their two Regiments to poſſeſſe the walls and to beat the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie off, all along, betwixt and their paſſages unto the next brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches northweſtward, which was accordingly done: So, and at this tyme, the aforeſaid Brigade having attained to the <hi>Sandhill,</hi> where rancountering the exaſperate enemie with a bloodie ſalutation, the reſt of our weſterne and northern Brigads, purſuing hotely theſe ſhrinking fugitives from the walles, to the choaking Market place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where being diſtreſſed (as it were) betweene <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> they preſentlie called for quarters, and laying downe their Armes without aſſurance, ſome were taken, ſome were ſhaken, ſome ſtood ſtill, and ſome fled away to hyde their bleeding bodyes in ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſhelter, yea; ſome ſate downe by their fathers fire ſyde, as though they had caryed no armes.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſurrender (the Major being formerly fled to the Caſtle, with ſome others of greater and leſſer note) they cauſed quickly pull downe the red flag on the Caſtle tope, and ſet up the whyte flag of peace, ſignifying ſubjection. This done, the earle <hi>Calendar,</hi> having formerly entered the Towne; with great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave preſently order for quieſcing of tumults, and managing diſorders, after a conſiderable way, returned that ſame night to the <hi>Gateſyde.</hi> So, as he was the firſt lay downe before the Towne, ſo he was duely the firſt that entred it; and that to the great comfort
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113088:12"/>
of the Inhabitants, becauſe of that unſpeakable favour, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved mercy, they then ſuddenly received, far beyond their merit and our expectation.</p>
            <p>Then begun the whole Armie, commanded, and uncommanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (obſerving King <hi>Davids</hi> ancient rule, that they who ſtayd with the Baggage, and they that fought in the field, ſhould ſhare the booties alike) to plunder, I ſay, for twenty foure houres time, being an act, of permiſſion, although to no great purpoſe. And why? becauſe the common ſouldiers being onely able to plunder the common people (although they might have juſtly ſtretched their hands fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) had for the greateſt part of them but ſmall benefite, excepting only houſhold ſtuff, as bed-cloaths, linnings, Tanned leather, calve skins, men and womens apparell, pans, pots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and plates, and ſuch like common things. But our prime Officers, I ſay, and others of that nature, by infringing the common ſouldiers, infringd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſpoyled both their fortunes: for they inveſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the richeſt Malignants and papiſted houſes, by way of ſafeguard, had but ſmall compoſitions for all their protection, and compelled Centries; where otherwiſe they might have juſtly and lawfully ſeazed upon all their enjoyments: But this ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb holdeth good here, <hi>That Scottiſhmen are aye wiſe behinde the hand,</hi> and ſo were they: And as they abuſed their Victorie in ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Towne, with too much undeſerved mercy, ſo they as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely and imprudently overreached themſelves in plundering the towne, with an ignorant negligence, and careleſſe ommiſſion. And as they thus defrauded themſelves, with a whiſtle in their mouths, ſo they pitifully prejudged, by this their inveigled courſe, the common ſouldiers of their juſt due, and dear bought advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>For by your leave, if a ſouldiers induſtrie be not quickned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated with bountifull rewards, hee hath leſſe will to performe any part of martiall ſervice, than a dead coarſe hath power to ariſe out of the grave: For what can bee more precious to man, than his bloud? being the fountaine and nurſe of his vitall ſpirits, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113088:12"/>
the ground of his bodily ſubſtance, which no free nor ingenious nature will looſe for nothing. And whoſoever ſhall argument or diſcourſe upon ſound reaſon, and infallible experience, may eaſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prove and perceive, that theſe Commanders have ever beſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which have moſt liberally maintained and had in ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard militarie Arts and Souldiers. Otherwiſe the honourable minde would account it a great deale better to have death without life, than life without reward: Yea, and the noble Commander, deſiring rather to want, than to ſuffer true worth unrecompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>I could inſtance here many examples of ingratitude in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that by their too much wretchedneſſe to Souldiers, have firſt loſt themſelves, and then their Kingdomes, and Principalities; but I deſiſt, onely lamenting what I ſaw here, the recitation of which (<hi>amoris patriae</hi>) I forbear to touch. And as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Nella bocca ſerrada non ci entra las muſcas;</hi> that is, When the mouth is ſhut, the flees cannot enter in the throat; ſo ſaith the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> to this ſame purpoſe, <hi>Aſſaiſa, che nòſa, chi ſia,</hi> hee knoweth enough that can misknow, the thing he knoweth: And the Poetick Proverb is thus,</p>

            <p>And now cloſing theſe compariſons, I proceed to my methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcourſe. As for the number of our ſouldiers, that were loſt at the ſtorming of this obſtinate and unhappie Towne (not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fatalitie of other times) they extended to three hundred lacking one, of whom there were thirtie eight Officers of ſix di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive kindes, beſides ſeven or eight hundred, that were diverſe wayes ill hurt, of which wounds, ſome have lately dyed ſince that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now I recall, that theſe three ſieges of <hi>Breda, York,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:113088:13"/>
and now <hi>Newcastle,</hi> were all of one dyet, though not at one time, and did each of them ſo nearly ſympathize one with another, in the computation of ten weekes and odde dayes, that they may all three reſt now contented, to live under the ſubſtant ſhadow of an honeſt and honourable ſubjection. Yet when I conſider here the malicious obſtinacie of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and thereupon the ſtorming of it, I am raviſhed with admiration to behold, how in the heat of bloud, and goaring ſlaughter, they got ſo ſoon mercie and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that me thinketh there was not the like mercie ſhowne in ſuch a caſe, ſince the deluge of the World. Nay, and (alas) ſhowne unto an impenitent and pernicious people: When contrariwiſe, the lives and goods of man, wife and child, within that refractarie Towne, (for their railing <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And to inſtance heere the contrary example, you ſhall ſee, and that within theſe twenty years paſt, how the populous and once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of <hi>Madenburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> (being all Proteſtants) was beleagured with the imperiall forces. Whereafter diverſe parleyes, and ſubtile drifts, the enemie on a ſudden ſtormed the Town, where forthwith they ſlew eleven thouſands, of men, woemen, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and the next morning, their diveliſh deſpight, growing wearie of that murdering ſlaughter, unnaturally, and unmercifully, threw headlong eighteene thouſands of them in the River: So that none eſcaped in the whole City of young or old, ſave onely foure hundred that fled into a Church. And ſtriping theſe ſtarke naked, ſent them away, and plundering all the goods of the Towne, at laſt razed it to the ground,</p>
            <p>By which crueltie this famous Univerſitie, as it was firſt ſacked, and then burned with fire, ſo the people were both ſlayne with the ſword, and drowned with the watter; O pittifull deſtruction. And that river which formerly had brought them profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was then ſuddenly become their death and ſepulture.</p>

               <l>A treachrous foe, when friends beſiegd the ſame.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And I may not forget here, how a deſpightfull jeſt, was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revolved in ſad earneſt, that even when, the Towne was a ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was a childe baptized, and a number of thirty perſons at the baptiſme feaſt; I meane in <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> And making merrie with the beſt cheare they had, they begunne to drink a health about the Table; and that was, to the confuſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> rebells, and knew of no danger, till a doſſon of our ſouldiers came in upon them (to digeſt their confuſed health) with drawn ſwordes and Piſtolls. At which, the rayling and jeering Tablers, falling downe beneath the boord (as it were) diſtracted of their wits: our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers fell a plundering their pockets, leaving the greateſt part of them ſtript of their apparrell, and the houſe utterlie ſpoyled of domeſtick furniture, and with this <hi>ſalve,</hi> they ſolmnized their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick feaſt: Being (I ſay) a juſt reward, for ſuch a malicious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard.</p>
            <p>Now the Towne being ours, upon Sunday morning, October. 20. 1644. his ever happy and anſpicuous excellence, entered the Towne, a triumphant Victor, and repairing to S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church accompanyed with the Earle of <hi>Calendar,</hi> Lieutennant generall <hi>Baillie,</hi> and the generall of <hi>Artillerie,</hi> with a few others (for it was not a day for men of fortune to dalleye with time) there was than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113088:15"/>
given to God (by that reverend Paſtor Maſter <hi>Robert Dowglas</hi>) for that our famous, and renowned Victorie. And now to ſeale up all, the clouds fell impetuouſly a weeping three dayes together, for that great fatalitye (as I may ſay) of ſo many brave <hi>Cavaliers</hi> as we loſt. And with this ſame deluge, the two Keill bridges, above, and below, were broke downe, and diſſenabled for paſſage, with the violent rapt of <hi>Tynes</hi> debording ſtreame: But happye it was that the greateſt part of our armie got then ſhelterage within the Town, otherwiſe they had found by this diſſoluing rayne ſommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed quarters.</p>
            <p>Vpon the fourth day after the towne was ſtormed, there iſſued from the Caſtle, three ſcore twelve Officers, Ingeniers, and prime Souldiers, under the cuſtodie of our Perforce; and were incarcerat within the Towne, as many of their kinde were ſerved ſo before. The Maior, and ſome of our noble Countreymen, were alſo then diſmiſſed from the Caſtle, but not enlarged, and the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (being Wedneſday) the Maior was returned from his houſe, unto a Dungeon trance within the Caſtle: Where now that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Governour remaineth, till the Hangman ſalute his neck with a blow of <hi>Straffords</hi> courteſie; where now I leave him till he enjoy his merit.</p>
            <p>As for the number of the enemie, either ſouldiers or Towneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that carried armes during the ſiege, indeed it is no part of my intention to medle with them, although they medled too much with us, neither with their hungrie Troupers, and far worſe their hungred Horſes. Yet nevertheleſſe (as I was informed) they were but eight hundred of the Traind Band, and ſome nine hundred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, of Voluntiers, preſt-men, Coliers, Keill-men, and poore tradeſ-men; with ſome few experimented Officers to overtop them, which were at laſt overtopped themſelves.</p>
            <p>And now meanewhile we found great penurie and ſcarcitie of victuals, amunition, and other neceſſaries within this dejected Towne; ſo that they could not have holden out ten dayes longer, unleſſe the one halfe had devoured the other. And now the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching

Winter, commanding expedition, our Armie was ſent to their Garriſons abroad (reſerving onely a proper Garriſon for <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>) ſome to <hi>Darnton, Haulkland, Durham, Cheſter, Morpet, Exome,</hi> and other near adjacent places. Yet nevertheleſſe the plague was raging in <hi>Gateſyde, Sandgate, Sunderland,</hi> and many countrey Villages about. Vpon the eight day after the taking in of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the Lord Generall rode downe to <hi>Tinmouth</hi> Caſtle; where after a ſhort parley, young Sir <hi>Thomas Riddell</hi> Governour thereof, ſurrendred it upon eaſie conditions. The occaſion why? was thus, the Peſtilence having been five weeks amongſt them with a great mortalitie, they were glad to yeeld, and to ſcatter themſelvs abroad; but to the great undoing and infecting of the Countrye about, as it hath contagiouſly begun.</p>
            <p>And now before I draw to Finis.

               <l>Yet there's compunction, and reuenge to uſe</l>

               <l>Makes foes, more loath to flie, than forcd to ſtand.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And now to cloſe the ſummary of this tragicall diſcourſe, I heartily beſeech Almightie God, to preſerve and proſper our Armie; and to be their guard, guide, and Governour, whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go, and to imprint the feare of his holy Name in their hearts. And now moſt good and gracious Lord, bleſſe ſo and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the hearts of their chief Commanders and Leaders, with wiſedome, courage, and magnanimity of minde; that they never decline, neither to the right nor to the left hand; but keeping a ſtraight courſe, in Honour, honeſty, and holineſſe; they may ever in all their proceedings, have the glory of thy great and glorious Name before their eyes, that the life and light of Peace and Truth may in all true beleevers abound.
