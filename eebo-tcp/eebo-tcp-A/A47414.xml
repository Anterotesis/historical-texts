            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Yet not long since, <hi>This very Day,</hi> recorded in bloody Letters, was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the first Day in our unhappy Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar: A Day of <hi>Liberty and Restauration</hi> to the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold Joy and Gladness,</hi> (as it follows in the Prophet) <hi>slaying Oxen, and killing</hi>

            <p>May I not too truly apply to <hi>This Day,</hi> the words of <hi>Hezekiah? This is a Day of Trouble, of Rebuke, and of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Esa. 37. 3.</note> Trouble to the whole Nation,

Eternal Rebuke to the Actors, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Reproach to the Protestant Religion, so stained by the Fact wrought on it, that all the Waters which envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron our Island can never wash it out: For where was it ever known, that such a <hi>King</hi> was Murthered by the Sword of Justice, and Pretence of Religion gave aim to the Assasinates Blow? when Those, who by their Office were to Preach <hi>Peace,</hi> became the Trumpets of Rebellion; when every Pulpit was made a Sconse, from whence no Platform shot more frequent Fire than their <hi>Tongues did bitter Words,</hi> against the <hi>Church,</hi> and <note place="margin">Psal. 64. 3.</note> against Him who was the <hi>Nursing Father of It.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Cause, so much of our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as can be spared from our greater Obsequies, may be allowed to lament this Scandal to the best Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> when we find those Men acting by their sharp Principles, who desir'd to be accounted most opposite to Them: Both assuming the Title of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes</hi>

Yet need we not much wonder, since in all Ages no Rebellion brake out, which had not the stamp of Religion to make it currant. <hi>Florus</hi> tells us, the Civil Disturbances of <hi>Rome</hi> borrowed from hence their Colour, and had their Flamens (who were their Priests) to blow them up. In our own Kingdome, <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and <hi>Jack Straw</hi> had one <hi>Ball</hi> a Priest, to plead for their Rising, in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Littestar,</hi> the Dyar of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who took upon Him the Title of <hi>King of Commons</hi> (Supprest and Hang'd by <hi>Spenser</hi> the noble Bishop there) had his Chaplains too.</p>
            <p>The French History tells us the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crys of <hi>Boucher, Guarren, Fruardent,</hi> with others, (Thirteen in number) All Chaplains to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in all their Pulpits tearmed <hi>Charls</hi> the Ninth, their King, a Tyrant, and Favourer of Hereticks: Insomuch that the seduced <hi>Parisians</hi> changed their wonted Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of <hi>God save the King,</hi> to <hi>God save the Guise,</hi> Head of the Catholick

League, and Patron of Religion: The Tragical issue whereof was the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre of so many Protestants, and shortly after, the Death of the King. A sad Glass to shew the Rise of our late Distempers here; where praying for the King was prohibited by Order: And, (I speak upon knowledge) in some places, none admitted to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion but those who fought against Him.</p>
            <p>Not to trouble you further, <hi>John Knox,</hi> and others, were Chaplains in the <hi>Scottish</hi> Rebellion, in which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop was murther'd, the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished, and the Queen forced to fly.</p>
            <p>And if any doubt who were the Chaplains to make our People stumble in their Duties, to sollicit our own and the Churches troubles; If nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears under <hi>Smictymnus</hi> his Mask, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> and <hi>Lemuel Tuke</hi> (who acted open faced without their Vizors) may suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare: The one whereof Preach'd it <hi>lawful to resist the King; The other to kill Him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50332:5"/>
These, and many more like these, were the Prologue to that cruel Tragedy on <hi>this Day</hi> acted: And Chaplains to that general Mischief which the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then groaned under.</p>
            <p>And I dare boldly affirm, upon what Clod of Earth, in what Field soever, the sharp Battels were fought, the Sparring Blows were made in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>If this Repetition be unpleasing, I beg pardon; it so little pleases me, That from my Soul I wish there never had been cause to give it mention, or make it any part in the luckless Subject of our History.</p>
            <p>Yet since our Saviour excus'd the <hi>Ointment</hi> expended on Him by the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 12, 13.</note> and would not have it forgot, as being <hi>done, to bury Him;</hi> I hope I may have leave to reflect a little upon those <hi>Dead flies,</hi> whose onely aim was to <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the sweet Ointment</hi> of our <hi>Josiah's</hi> Name, which is like <hi>Ointment poured out,</hi> perfuming all places, with the Example and Memory of his Virtues.</p>

            <p>That the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did no

            </p>

            <p>What Lamentations for <hi>Josiah</hi> these are I dispute not: Some believe They were not those extant in the end of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies</hi> Prophecy, at least not all of them, but fram'd purposely for him, though lost by the injury of Time, or neglect of such who ought to have preserved them.</p>
            <p>Sure I am we can never want matter of Lamentation for <hi>our unparallel'd Josiah:</hi> Our Annual Sorrow, not apt to grow barren by continuance, will prompt us to New forms suitable to their Argument.</p>
            <p>First, whil'st we consider the <hi>Person,</hi> Endowed with all the Vertues and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which might adorn a Prince.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when we reflect not onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Loss, but upon the manner of it, and the Circumstances of his Death, sufficient to wring out Tears from Marble.</p>
            <p>Whil'st we consider his Vertues, I may truely pronounce, Never did any sit upon the English Throne, who could in all perfections match <hi>Him,</hi>
            </p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I cannot recount all his Vertues, and without praevarication I dare omit none which I know.</p>
            <p>His Religion was so constant in the practice of it, That not all the Glories of the Court, exhibited in their most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Revels and Masques, could divert, nor His Journies of Recreation, when He came home wet and weary, could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it: I am able to give signal instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in both.</p>
            <p>His Temperance never stained by any excess of Meat or Drink</p>
            <p>His Chastity never tempted to those Wandrings which Beauty invites.</p>
            <p>Let his profession made to some of his Royal Branches, the Night before his <note place="margin">Jan. 29. 1648.</note> Death, witness that.</p>
            <p>His strength of Reason and Acuteness of Judgment the Conference in the Ile of <hi>Wight</hi> testifies, which was manag'd Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by himself against all the Knot of Divines (so they are call'd) there combin'd to oppose him; who, when They neither had Ingenuity to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

to his Reasons, nor any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their own to convince Him, Those weak Opponents left Him with this Complement,—That they wished such a Pen, in the hand of such Abilities, might ever be imploy'd in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worthy of it.</p>
            <p>The same was evidenced before in his Entercourse at <hi>New-Castle</hi> with Mr. <hi>Hinderson;</hi> who of an Antagonist in Dispute prov'd a Convert, and upon His Death-bed, not only confessed the rare Endowments of his Royal Master, but left it as a Legatory Charge to his Countrey-men, That they should value Him as a Jewel whose worth they hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to understood not. Withall professing, That he believed him no whit inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Best of all the <hi>Kings in Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, I dare be bold to affirm, without Partiality or Assentation, That all the vertues which singly adorned Every one of them were United and Conjoined in Him.

            </p>
            <p>This was the sence of that Reverend Praesidents speech in this Case, though contrary to <hi>Pilate's,</hi> who was the Praesident and Praefect of <hi>Judaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me proceed in my Parallel; If the <hi>Mocks and Derisions</hi> of the Souldiers <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 29.</note>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:50332:21"/>
added to the <hi>sufferings of Christ,</hi> Ours did the same to Their King, using Acts of the highest Scorn, even to the Interrupting his private Devotions, and words (if possible) worse than their Actions;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spitting in his face,</hi> as in <hi>His Masters,</hi> from rotten unwholsome mouths not <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 67.</note> worthy to be named here.</p>
            <p>Nay, upon the Day when that fatal Sentence was pronounced, To sever the Wisest and Best Head in His Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes from His Body, a wretched mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant, whose best education was from the Dray-cart, then sitting as one of the Judges (in which ungratious Pack there were few of better breeding) had the Impudence to say unto him, <hi>Now Stroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cure thy self:</hi> Alluding to those <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Cures</hi> performed by the <hi>Regal-Touch,</hi> which mock was equivalent to that of the <hi>Jews:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He saved others Himself He could not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 42. Luk. 23. 33.</note> 
               <hi>save.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have but one more, Their Obstinacy and Impenitence for the Murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; which appears, when it was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50332:22"/>
moved in the House wherein they sate, that the Names of all those Regicides, who had the confidence <hi>to condemn their Soveraign,</hi> might in all places for which They serv'd be engraven in Plates of Brass, that Posterity might never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get such renowned <hi>Patriotts.</hi> Poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Men! As if that sinful Act of theirs were not, like the <hi>Sin of Judah, engraven with a Pen of Iron,</hi> to be recorded <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 1.</note> at their Final Account.</p>
            <p>I beseech you now judge, what doth this Impudence of Theirs differ from the Cry of the Impoenitent <hi>Jews, His Blood be upon us, and upon our Children.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, I speak it with much Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Sorrow; It hath been observed, That not <hi>One of those Men who Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Him,</hi> at the time of his Execution did express the least poenitent Remorse for the Bloody Fact by Them committed.</p>
            <p>VVhether then our <hi>Jewish Sanedrim, Our High Court of Justice,</hi> did not in all particulars, at least match the <hi>Jews,</hi> if not exceed them, Let the VVorld judge.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed know I any thing which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50332:22"/>
might conclude them <hi>Not Jews,</hi> But that They wanted the <hi>Seal of their Cursed Covenant,</hi> I mean That <hi>Circumcission,</hi> which the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Law of the Land appoints for such horrid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</p>
            <p>Think not, I beseech you, That I come to whet the Sword of Justice, or shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Ax, my Office is rather to blunt it.</p>
            <p>My intent of coming to this place is to invite <hi>Mourners</hi> fit for such a <hi>Funeral;</hi> as all <hi>Judah and Jerusalem for the first Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> so <hi>The whole Kingdom and the City,</hi> for the Celebration of our <hi>Own Josiah</hi>'s exequies.</p>
            <p>For All are involved in the misery of this Day; In one kind or other all were Contributors unto it, Not only Those who voted in the Cursed sentence, But Those who voted their Commission to Sit. All Those who by their Raised Forces abetted the Bloody Fact; All Those who approv'd it when it was Done; All Those who did not endeavour to hinder it, if they had Power: Lastly, All Those who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50332:23"/>
do not heartily detest the Bloody Fact, and bewail the <hi>Person</hi> taken from us, with a Lamentation worthy so Irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Loss.</p>
            <p>VVell may I say to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as <hi>Christ</hi> to the VVomen who followed Him Lamenting to his Cross, <hi>Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your selves.</hi> So may I bid <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 28.</note> the Sons and <hi>Daughters of our Jerusalem, weep,</hi> not so much for <hi>Him,</hi> as for your <hi>selves and for your Children;</hi> VVho All, more or less, were instrumental in the Tragedy of this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Ages, Old</hi> and <hi>Young:</hi> VVith sorrow must we remember the time when Old men, who needed a Staff to under prop them, Ty'd to their Swords, with feeble Knees knocking one against the other faster than the Drum beat, to shew their good will to the Cause, went tottering about the Streets: Nay, <hi>Young Boys,</hi> as if they had been taught to suck in Their Parents Rebellion with their Milk, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch'd up and down in a warlike manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Conditions and Professions,</hi> whether
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50332:23"/>
of <hi>Law or Gospel:</hi> VVhat the First did too many can well remember: And what the Last did, This whole City yet rings of. Nay, in that Sphere where I am plac'd, I dare affirm, no Romance yields Example of more Lunatick prancks than some play'd, who transform'd themselvs from Ministers to Captains and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</p>
            <p>A strange Metamorphosis! We read in <hi>Esay</hi> of <hi>Swords converted into Plow-Shares</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Esa. 2. 4.</note> and <hi>Spears into Sithes:</hi> But, till of late, never heard of <hi>Ink-horns</hi> converted into <hi>Bandileres,</hi> and <hi>Pens</hi> into <hi>Pistols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as all <hi>Conditions,</hi> so <hi>all Sexes,</hi> concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the production of this mischief.</p>
            <p>We had a Maiden Troop rais'd and maintained by their Contribution who went under that Style: Nay, in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which my self have best reason to know, A Band of Women led by One, who took upon Her the Office and Title of a Captain, with Drums beating, and Colours flying, marched daily through the Streets.</p>
            <p>And to shew, This <hi>Sex</hi> is almost as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50332:24"/>
good for Fortification as for Fight, at that time when in These very Streets the Drum, by a Ridiculous and Scandalous Beat, call'd together Men of the Spade and Mattock, to go dig in the Works cast up to keep out their King; some La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to express their Zeal to the <hi>Cause,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd upon the Ramparts, and set their hands, not accustomed to such Tasks, unto the Spade.</p>
            <p>That vertuous Woman, whom <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in his Character describes, dealeth in <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 13. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Wool and Flax,</hi> not <hi>Iron;</hi> And layes <hi>Her hand to the Distaff, not the Spade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore upon this occasion I cannot but remember, that when our <hi>Late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> was told divers Ladies wish'd ill to his Cause; He reply'd, He was confident no VVoman of Vertue and Honour would be against Him.</p>
            <p>I do not summon <hi>These Daughters of Jerusalem</hi> to weep at this Funeral; Tears Dropt from such Eyes upon this Glorious Dust would dishonour it: Nor am I so skilful an Herald as to tell where, to Rank these Ladies for the Cause, unless
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50332:24"/>
with the Chaplains for the Covenant: <hi>Let them weep together,</hi> and lament the several Scandals, by either of them brought, by the One upon Their Sex, by the Other upon their Function.</p>
            <p>I come hither (in the Prophet <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Zephaniah 3. 18.</note> Phrase) <hi>To gather them that are Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful for the Solemn Assemblies,</hi> The <hi>Fasts</hi> and <hi>long winded Exercises</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to draw on That Mischief which we <hi>This Day bewail,</hi> And unto <hi>whom the Reproach of these Transactions is a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such as These whom I have mentioned have work enough <hi>To weep for Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> As indeed we all have, and To <hi>Cover the Altar with our Tears.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it our Duty to <hi>weep</hi> only, but to <hi>Pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet bids us come <hi>with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Supplications.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the first to Lament our own Sins which were contributors to this Irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loss: In the Last to Deprecate the future Miseries which, upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>His Blood,</hi> hang over this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50332:25"/>
When the <hi>Lamenter</hi> cries <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lam. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Crown is Fallen,</hi> He goes on, <hi>Wo unto us for we have Sinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis True that, sometimes <hi>Plectun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Achivi,</hi> The People are punished for the Princes fault: As at <hi>Davids Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the People,</hi> The Sheep died for the Shepherds Offence: <hi>Quid Oves istae?</hi> cryes <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Samuel</hi> tells <hi>Israel,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12. 14.</note> had given them a <hi>King, If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Their Obedience, not rebelling against his Command,</hi> They should Enjoy their King: <hi>But if ye shall do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vers. 25.</note> 
               <hi>ye shall be consumed both ye and your King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can therefore impute to None but our selves, The Loss of <hi>Our King.</hi> For Those many Crying Sins of the Land, was <hi>Our Glorious Sun</hi> Darkned at the Height of His Lifes Noon, and His Spreading Beams quenched in His own Blood. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Threat from God by His Prophet <hi>Amos: I will cause the Sun to go down at Noon, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Amos 8. 9.</note>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50332:25"/>
               <hi>Darken the Earth in the Clear Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVe have therefore Just Cause to <hi>Pray,</hi> that the <hi>Happy Light</hi> sprang from the Loins of our Late <hi>Buried Sun</hi> may long continue His Lustre, not lessened by our unthankfulness, nor darkned by Our Sins.</p>
            <p>That, according to the Example of so <hi>unparallel'd a Parent,</hi> He may continue a <hi>Patron of the Protestant Religion,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour of the Liberties of His Subjects;</hi> As, Blessed be God, <hi>He</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That as He happily <hi>Inherits His Kingdoms,</hi> so <hi>He may Inherit His Vertues too:</hi> But that those Vertues may never be put to that Cruel Bloody Test unto which the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>His Martyr'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> were, this Day sixteen years, <hi>Put:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God, who hath Power to grant, and Will to assent, when He is faithfully sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, Accept our humble Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for His Beloved Son's sake our Gratious Intercessour.</p>
