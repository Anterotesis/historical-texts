            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Archy</hi> (sometimes Iester to his Maiesty) was upon a night being prostrated upon his bed, (to take naturall rest,) very much troubled by meditating of the Arch Bishop <hi>Lauds,</hi> unlawfull actions. First by thinking how hee being a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy man, delighted in nothing but exactions and then anon of the unheard of mallice, hee bore against him; thus long time tumbling, and tossing, upon his unquiet bed, at length, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> with his leaden maule arrested him, and then for a time was he still. But not long so, but he was disturbed in his sleep, and dreamed after this manner.</p>

               <p>How that he was placed, on a pinnacle which reached farre above <hi>Phoebe's</hi> diocesse and a little below him, he saw a poore Scholler, which was delivering of a petition to one of the Starrs, which so soone as shee received it, caught a fall and so lost the Petition, upon which the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler was forst to descend for another petition, which he thought was presently done, but by that time he was lifted up into <hi>Phoebus</hi> his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, by the reason of which splendour, he could soone perceive any terrestiall creatures. But yet he could deceive the poore scholler, as any as high as <hi>Phoebus,</hi> to whom he delivered his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and shee to <hi>Phaebus,</hi> who tooke it, and read it, the contents were these.</p>
               <p>I the most unfortunate of the whole tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> by spirituall assistance, have had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
<pb facs="tcp:93859:4"/>
to declare my grievances which are these.</p>
               <p>First we are abused by such a flat cap citizen, who if he perceive one of us at one side of the way, hee will be sure to crosse over, on purpose to take the wall of him. Calling the scholler sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy rascall, if he but offer to withstand him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, those which are able to buy great personages, have them, although they have had never any nurture in an Academy, except out of a library of notes, borrowed of some old clarke, or other, which he in former time had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at severall places.</p>
               <p>Thirdly if we be not made of cannon proofe, wee are in danger of Episcopall censure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, vve must not preach more then the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury, William Laud,</hi> will allovv off. For feare of the forfeiture of our eares. From these and the like greevances, we most humbly desire great Iove to deliver us.</p>
               <p>Which Petition was no sooner read, But <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was presented to my view, who looked more like a spirit come out of purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then one ready, to receive the Papall diadem me thought I was straight, descended from Heaven to Hell, where I saw blind <hi>Bonner,</hi> and <hi>Woolsey</hi> dancing a galliard, whipt forward by a company of Hellish haggs, the three furies danced for females, Pluto set to see the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, be hind whom set a company of men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king chayres, who as fast as they made chayres they were filled, only on was set by for whom
<pb facs="tcp:93859:4"/>
I asked, they answered for <hi>Laud;</hi> against he came thither all, which time were the three Arch-Priests dancing, but anon, I saw a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people which preferred bills against <hi>Canterbury,</hi> why <hi>Rhadamant</hi> had the perusing, who passed his iudgement thus upon him say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>It is but fit that he against whom that bil was preferred, should be for ever banished <hi>Elizium</hi> because the law for his hainous offences did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same, at which poore <hi>Canterbury</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and trembled; like a leafe ready to drop downe in <hi>Antumne:</hi> upon whom <hi>Cerberus</hi> lookt very wishly that he might know when he saw him again, by and by me thought a troop of the chiefe Regents servants took him and bound him hand and foot, and so threw him into <hi>,<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> boate, which the followers of <hi>Pluto,</hi> made such an horrible noise, which awaked mee: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding for a time I lay speachlesse, not knowing where I was, at length I came to my selfe, and so soone as I arose, I went to a noble friend of mine, and told him my dreame, who said to me, (that the day before) <hi>Canterbury</hi> was carried into the Towre.</p>
               <p>For which <hi>Archy</hi> said he was very sorry, but could not cry: by this may a man perceive that though a man be never so Honorable, Puissant, Rich or Learned, yet if his vices Obnubilate his vertues, he shall not be respected, but farre more contemned and abhorred then if hee had never had such guifts bestowed upon him.
<pb facs="tcp:93859:5"/>
Why there is at this time scarce a child in the street, but dares speake against him, which not long since no man durst speak a sillable against, but that it should have beene esteemed as pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie treason.</p>
               <p>But now the times are changed, and his pompe altered, and hee now waites for a tryall which heretofore tryed so many.</p>
