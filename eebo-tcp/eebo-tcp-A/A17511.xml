         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I meane the generall Counſelles and
olde Doctours (which he and his mayn
tayners affirme to bee all togyther on
their part.) The author of this Treatiſe
a man of great antiquitie was archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Theſſalonia, and ſucceſſour to
the holy apoſtle Saint Paule, who firſt
traded the Theſſalonians in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
fayth, and to the confirmation ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, wrote an epiſtle to them, whiche we
haue at this tymered in our churches,

archybſhop lyued not longe after
the dayes of Charles the great, aboute
whoſe tyme the ſeuenth Synode was
helde at Nice: whereof the authour in

He wrote (as we may gather by conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures)
about the yere of our lord. 787.

Archbiſhop of Theſſalonia.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He adherentes of
the Romiſhe churche
affirme,</p>
            <p>Fyrſt, that S. Peter
was made chiefe of
thapoſtles by Chriſt
hym ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had the keies of heauen worthily
deliuered vnto hym: and that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
was buylded on hym, agaynſt the
whiche the gates of hell ſhulde not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
foraſmuche as Chriſt had praied
for his faith, and had commanded him
bothe to ſtrengthen his bretherne, and
alſo to feede his ſhepe. They heape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
alſo muche more, wherby they
thynke that the primacie of Peter may
be proued.</p>
            <p>Secondarily they hold, that the Pope
is Peters ſucceſſour, and that he hath
by ſucceſſion all his preeminence, and
therfore may doo in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all thynges after lyke ſorte and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
as he might haue doone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7808:10"/>
And therfore they ſaye, that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the Pope to falle frome the
true faith, for if that ſhuld happen, the
chriſten religion and the whole church
whyche is buylded vppon hym, muſte
needes periſſhe. To the proſe whereof
they alledge a teſtimonie of their own,
out of Pope Agathon, whiche in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Epiſtle affirmeth, that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
of Rome was neuer entangled
with any erroure, neyther hathe any
tyme ſwarued frome the true waie of
veritie. And therfore they ſay, that the
Pope hath had his ſupremacy always
ſence the Apoſtles tyme.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Alſo they ſaye lykewyſe, that other
Metropolitanes and Archebyſhoppes
are ſubiecte to hym in lyke maner, as
the Byſhoppes and Prelates, whyche
are vnder the Arcebyſhop of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,
are ſubiect to the ſayd archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Theu they ſaye, that the Pope hathe
appellation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> They affirme moreouer, that he may
iudge all menne, and that none maye
iudge hym, neyther in his manners,
neyther in faythe, or doctrine.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:7808:10"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
Beſydes this, they hold that the pope
is byſhop of no certayne place, neither
is he ſo called as other are, but ſimply
without circumſcription, he is named
a Biſhoppe. To the profe wherof, they
brynge the Pope hymſelfe to wytnes:
who neuer in his letters, termeth hym
ſelfe Byſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Alſo they affyrme, that Rome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hathe been called the ſea Apoſtolike,
becauſe that Peter the Apoſtle, bothe
ledde his lyfe there a longe tyme, and
alſo dyed there.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Item they affirme, that the Pope on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath authoritie to call a counſell.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Their laſt aſſertion is, that no lawe
can be made without the conſent of the
pope, neither any thynge ordeyned in
the churche. Then they conclude that
the Pope hath all the aforeſayde righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and priuiledges of Peter, and that
therfore, all men owe hym obedience,
and no man ought to gayneſay any of
his commandementes.</p>
            <p>All theſe thynges the adherentes of
the Romyſſhe churche, alledge for the
mayntenaunce of the popes domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and authoritie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7808:11"/>
Vnto the whiche aſſertions of theirs,
I nothynge doubte what to aunſwere,
but afore whom I may pleade. For yf
I ſhould make anſwere before the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins
themſelues, and adherentes of the
Romiſhe church, what rightful iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
myght I loke for, in ſubmyttyng

But yf I ſhuld pleade afore our

iuſte cauſe to complayne of me, where
as I make the <hi>Grecians,</hi> iudges ouer
them, whom they thinke to be their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries,
in matters Eccleſiaſticall.
What then muſt we doo?<note place="margin">Gods word muſte not be hidde.</note> verily Gods

to ſpeake, freely, hauynge good confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and wiſhing that thoſe to whom

more than the truthe. For ſurely ſuche
as fauour the truthe, ſhall hereby alſo
profyte ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>FYRST therfore, concernyng the
primacy of Peter, after what ſorte he
was chiefe of that holy congregation,
or what priuilege was geuen or ought
vnto hym: I thinke it not now ſo nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:7808:11"/>
to be reaſoned of. For be it after ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ſorte, and ſo great, yea as it lyketh
any man to deuyſe: yet neuer truely
ſhall it therby be proued, that the Pope
hath ſuche right of Peter, where by he
may rule all other byſhops, whiche is
our aduerſaries ſeconde poſition.</p>
            <p>For, concernyng the Pope, two thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
muſt be conſydered: the one, That
he is Byſhop of Rome, by the whyche

            <p>The other, that he would be chiefe and

primacie, he hath of certayne fathers
and kynges, whiche for deſyre of good
order, gaue it hym many yeares after
thapoſtles tyme. And to proue this to
be true, I wyll bryng forth wytneſſes
not two or three, or twiſe ſo many, but
ſire hundred and thirty, yea and choſe
holy fathers.</p>
            <p>Rede the xxviii. Canon of the fourth
holy Synode or councell of <hi>Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
where are theſe woordes: We fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowyng
the decrees of the fathers, and
waying the Canon euen now reherſed
<pb facs="tcp:7808:12"/>
of the. 150. Byſhoppes gathered togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the ſame alſo
doo we ordeyne &amp; decree, concernyng
the honoures and prerogatiues of the
ſaid church of Conſtantinople, or new
Rome. For vnto the ſea of old Rome,
the Fathers gaue worthyly the chiefe
honour and primacy, bycauſe that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
then ruled all the worlde, the ſame
cauſe moued the. 150. foreſayd byſhops
to geue the lyke honoure and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to the ſea of new Rome, iudgyng
it reaſonable, that this Citie condeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the empire, and ſenate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
and equal in dignitie with the old
imperiall ſeate, ſhould as muche excell
in matters eccleſiaſticall, ſeyng that it
is the next vnto it. Then what may we
lerne hereby? Verily nothyng els, but
that the Superioritie ouer other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
was geuen to the pope, not by the
Apoſtles,<note place="margin">The Pope hathe not his prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</note> but by the fathers, and that
for no greater or iuſter cauſe, then that
the citie of Rome, at that tyme had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
ouer the whole world. For the
Canon ſayeth playnely, That the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie
<pb facs="tcp:7808:12"/>
or ſuperiour dygnitie was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the ſea of Rome by the fathers.
So that the pope hath therfore the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie
geuen hym of the Fathers,
bycauſe in tymes paſte, the Citie of
Rome had the Empire. Then he hath
it not as Peters ſucceſſour, neither as
geuen hym of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But for the more apparaunt truthe,
let vs reade the hundreth newe decree
of Iuſtinian to the ende, that it maye
appeare, that the truthe hath wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
on euery ſyde. We ordeyne, ſayth
he, accordynge to the Decrees of the
Synodes, that the moſte holy Byſhop
of olde Rome, is the chiefe of all prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,
and that the moſte bleſſed byſhop
of Conſtantinople, or newe Rome,
is nexte vnto hym, and aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Do you not heare that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure
ſayeth, That the primacye of
the Pope of Rome, is gyuen hym by
the Decree of holye Councelles? If
that the Pope dooe holde his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye
onely by the Decree of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,
I beſeeche, you howe may it be

that he hath it by ſucceſſion of Peter.

But for the more euident truthe, lette
vs brynge toorthe an other teſtimonye
out of the oration of the holy Synode
to the Emperour: We remoue, ſayth
the Synode, frome the lymittes of the
churche, and worthyly accurſe all new
and vayne ſermes, with theyr inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſuche as are, eſpecially, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Pharanites, Sergius, Paule,
Pirrhus, and Peter, who ſometyme
ruled this churche of Conſtantinople,
and alſo <hi>Cirus</hi> the prieſte of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and <hi>Honorius</hi> biſhop of Rome. If that
<hi>Honorius</hi> biſhop of Rome were an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,
poſſible it is then,<note place="margin">The Pope maye be an heretike.</note> that the pope
may faile in veritie of doctrine: neither
ſhall the wordes of the Lorde be vayne

of hell ſhulde not preuayle agaynſt
it,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> for the true doctrine is preſerued in
other byſhops and doctours.</p>
            <p>Here alſo we may playnly ſee, that it
was not ſayde of the ſea of Rome, that
the church of God was theron builded
For that were to hard and not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the ſeruilitie and bondage of
<pb facs="tcp:7808:15"/>
the Iewes, to bynde the congregation
of God to Rome. For Chriſt buylded
his churche himſelfe vpon the doctrine
and confeſſion of Peter,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the churche.</note> and all thoſe
that kepe and mayntaine the lyke faith
and profeſſion that Peter dydde. And
where as pope Agathon boaſteth,<note place="margin">Pope Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</note> that
his church neuer went from the truth,
it is no meruayle, conſyderynge what
face ſuche men haue. But lette ſuche
honeſt men take it for a warnyng, that
they wreſt not the truthe of the matter,
to their owne talke, but rather let them
tempre their tonges to the truth of the
matter. And percaſe Pope Agathon
was moued ſo to write, either bicauſe
the ſtate of his matter dyd ſo require,
as it hapned ofttymes that he ſo wrote,
orels bycauſe the churche of Rome in
dede hath not often departed from the
truth. Otherwyſe, if that without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and condition it were ſymply
true: howe coulde that ſayeng be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
All are gone aſtraye, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
wycked, there is none that dothe
good, no not one. Beſyde that, we may
well ſaye,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 13.</note> that Agathon ſpake of the
tyme paſt, becauſe the church of Rome
<pb facs="tcp:7808:16"/>
hath not erred afore tyme, and not of
the tyme to come, as thoughe it were
vnpoſſible, that it ſhould euer be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Certainely Agathon wrote that
before the .vi. Synode, neyther dyd he
yet vnderſtand the thynges wherof the
Synode entreated. Alſo it wer no mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayle yf that holye ſynode, wherein ſo

ſhulde eſpye and ſee that, whiche
he beyng but one man, could not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
perceaue. And that theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are true, it may wel be gathered by
an Epiſtle of Pope Leo, who ſucceded
next after Agathon, and alowed the vi.
ſynode. For ſo ſayth Leo in his epiſtle,
written to the Emperor, conceruynge
the ſaid ſinode. Alſo we holde accurſed

               <pb facs="tcp:7808:16"/>
In the fourth place, where as our ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſaries
ſay, that the pope is after the
ſame ſort and faſhion ſuperiour to the
Biſhop of Conſtantinople, as the ſaide
Biſhop is to the Byſhop of Ceſaria, or
to any other Byſhop vnder hym: that
truelye as it is manifeſtelye falſe, ſo
maye it in no wiſe be ſuffered: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly
the Biſhop of Rome is therfore called
firſt, becauſe the Biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
in reſpect to hym is ſecond
in order and worthyneſſe. But the byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Conſtantinople, in reſpecte of

as though he were alone, he hath none
adioyned to hym, that maye in anye
poynt as ſeconde in degree be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with him in worthines. The biſhop
of Ceſarea, is not called ſeconde,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of the which one is ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to
<pb facs="tcp:7808:17"/>
hym, another thirde, an other fourth.
And that the primacye of the biſhop of
Rome is not loſe and free, as though it
were a monarchye, but vnited with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as the dignities of felowes in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
are conioyned togyther betweene
them ſelues: yet may be eaſily proued.
For the xxxvi. Canon of the foreſayd
Synode hath theſe wordes: Renuyng
the decrees of the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred and fifty ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fathers, who helde a counſell in this
imperiall Citie preſerued of God: And
of the vi hundred and thirty gathered
togyther at Calcedonia, we doo ordeyn
and conſtitute, that the ſea of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinople,
haue equall dignitie with the
ſea of olde Rome, &amp; haue as much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iledge
in matters eccleſiaſticall, as
the ſayd ſea, ſeynge that it is nexte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and next to Conſtantinople, lette
the biſhop of the great citie Alexandria
haue place, and after him let the biſhop
of Hieruſalem be placed. If ſo be that
the Pope doo therfore chalenge to him
dominion ouer other, bicauſe he is firſt
named, and hath the fyrſt degree in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he muſt lykewiſe grant the ſame
power to the byſſhop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:7808:17"/>
(bycauſe he is named ſeconde) ouer
them that in order folowe hym, the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and others. And alſo
to the biſhop of Alexandria, who is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thirde, authoritie ouer the biſhop
of Antioche, and to the byſhop of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche,
who is fourthe, power ouer the
byſhop of Ieruſalem, who hath the .v.
place in noumber and order. But this
were neyther iuſte, neyther any thyng
els but a diſturbance of the churche of
God. And hereby maye we perceyue,
that the byſhop of Rome is not ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the byſhop of Conſtantinople,
in lyke ſorte as the ſayd byſhop is to the
byſhop of Ceſarea, for aſmuche as the
biſhoppe of Conſtantinople ordeyneth
bothe the biſh. of Ceſarea, and al other
ſubiecte to hym. But the byſhoppe of
Rome ordeyneth neyther the byſhop of
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople, neyther any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan.
But that it may more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
apere, that the Pope hath no po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer
ouer all other byſhops, let vs rede
the .vi. canon of the Nicen cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, wher
it is playnly commanded, that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Alexandria, ſhulde rule ſomme
churches, the byſhop of Rome other,
<pb facs="tcp:7808:18"/>
and other the byſhop of Antioche. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

lette the primacie, hyghneſſe,
dignttie and authoritie of the churches

that the canon of Nice, commaundeth
the olde cuſtome to be kept, and al men
to be content therwith: whiche cuſtom
dothe attribute and preſerue to euery
churche his owne worthineſſe, ſo that
the churche of Alexandria ſhoulde rule
ſome, the churche of Antioche other,
that is to ſay, thoſe, whiche are in bothe
Syrias. The churche of Rome other,
and other the Churche of Ieruſalem,
euen thoſe (as the ſeuenth Cannon of
the Synoda appoynteth, whiche are
Phenicia, Paleſtina, and Arabia, and
to Conſtantinople, by the .xxviii. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

<pb facs="tcp:7808:18"/>
all Metropolitanes, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente

the decree, the lawe, and ordinance.</p>
            <p>And yf any manne not contente with
his owne, deſyrethe an nothers, he

holye Fathers, for as muche as the
decree of Nice, doothe ſtraightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydde
it, and wylleth the olde vſage
herein to bee folowed. If the Canon
hadde deuyded the worlde, betweene
other Metropolites, and hadde geuen
nothynge vnto the Byſſhoppe of
Rome, but onely haue ſayde, That he
oughte to rule the reſte, then myghte
a manne of lykelyhoode haue geſſed,
that he oughte all togyther to rule all

and that all other, as welle Byſhops
as Metropolitanes are vaſſalles and
ſubiecte vnto hym, euen as to the
Byſſhoppe of Conſtantinople, other
Byſſhoppes of his prouynce, that ar
his inferiours. Nowe ſeeynge that
ſundrye countreyes are appoynted to
the Byſſhoppe of Rome, other to the
Byſſhoppe of Alexandria, and other
<pb facs="tcp:7808:19"/>
to the byſſhop of Conſtantinople: no
more are they ſubiect to hym, then he
is to theym.</p>
            <p>Then our aduersaries ſay, that the
Pope hathe prouocation in matters
eccleſiaſticall, and that therefore he is
chiefe of all other. The ſame prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
hathe the byſhop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and yet therby hath he neyther au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
neither iurisdiction of other
Metropolitans. Therefore neyther the
Pope oughte to let or hynder the iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of other Metropolites. And
that it may appeare, that I haue ſayde
truely, that the byſhop of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople
hath prouocation, I wyl alleged
the .ix. canon of the .iiii. Synode or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell
of Calcedonia. If one clerke haue
an action againſt an other, let hym not
leaue his owne byſſhop, and runne to
the ſecular iudge, but lette the matter
be fyrſt debated afore his owne biſhop,
or at the leaſt by thaduiſe of their owne
byſhop, let theim take ſuche a iudge as
bothe the parties ſhall bee contented
with. If any doo otherwiſe he ſhall bee
in daunger of the decree. If any clerke
haue an action agaynſte his owne by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb facs="tcp:7808:19"/>
or any other, lette the matter bee
tried afore the Synode of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uince.
And yf any byſhoppe or clerke
haue a complaynte agaynſt the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane,
let hym go to the magiſtrate
of the dioceſſe, or elles to the ſea of the
chiefe citie Conſtantinople, and there
lette hym be iudged. So alſo ſayth the
xvii. decree of the ſayd Synode. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the .xx. and .xxxvi. canon of the .vi.
Synode, gyueth in all poyntes as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

as to the other, as muche to the ſea of
Conſtantinople as to the ſea of Rome,
wherby they declare that prouocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

vnderſtande, that in the Churche of
Rome, in the Decree of Orders, it
is appoynted, That who ſo euer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the orders of a prieſte or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
ſhall fyrſte profeſſe, That they
haue no copulatione with theyr wyues:
Wee folowynge the olde Canon and
conſtitutions of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Preſtes ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage lauful by the old canon and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the apoſtles.</note> wylle
and decree, that the lawfull matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of holy menne ſhall be auaylable,
and that theyr copulation with theyr
wyues, ſhall by no meanes be broken,
neyther that one depriue the other of
familiaritie in tyme conuenient. Then
the canon makynge the ſentence more
plain and manifeſt, ſaith moreouer: If
any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſume contrary to the rules
of the apoſtles to depriue any prieſte or
deacon, of the contract or felowſhyp of
his laufull wyfe, let hym bee depoſed.
Lykewyſe yf a Prieſt or Deacon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his wyfe, for relygions ſake, let
hym be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate: and if he ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
lette hym bee depoſed. The .lv.
Canon of the ſayde Synode wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the ſame. The words ar theſe: For
aſmuch as we vnderſtand, that certain
<pb facs="tcp:7808:21"/>
in the citie of Rome, contrarye to the
receyued cuſtome of the churche, doo
faſt in the Saboths in the tyme of lent:
it ſemeth good to this holye Synode to
bynde the churche of Rome by all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to the canon whiche ſayth: If any
clerke be found to faſt on the ſonday or
ſabboth day, one ſabboth day onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
let hym be depoſed. If any laie
man be founde ſo doynge, lette hym be
excommunicate.</p>
            <p>Hereby it playnly appereth that the
byſhoppe of Rome may and ought to
be iudged, as well in controuerſies of
doctrine, as in all other his dedes and
matters, if he commytte any thynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
ryght and equitie.<note place="margin">The Pope as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</note> And that the
pope is not aboue the degree of a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
as ſome men peruerſely thynke
hym to be, it may be plainly proued, by
this that we haue ſaid. For how myght
it be, if he were in dignitie aboue a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
that he ſhoulde be iudged of byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in the counſell, and be compelled
to render vnto them an accompt of his
dedes. It is manyfeſte that the fathers
when they write vnto hym, call hym a
byſhoppe: truely he is ordeyned of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb facs="tcp:7808:21"/>
whiche veryly myght not be ſo,
yf his dignitie were more then a byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
For no manne can gyue that to
an other whiche fyrſt he hath not hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe.<note place="margin">Note the pope brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth order eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note>
And what els I pray you meane
they, that ſo ſaye, but to breake and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the order eccleſiaſtical. For Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius
who lyued in the apoſtles tyme,
deuideth the regimente eccleſiaſticall,
into deacons, prieſtes, and byſhoppes,
neyther maye we by ſuſpition gather
out of his writynges, that there is any
dignitie in the churche, aboue a biſhop,
neyther may it be ſayde by any lykely<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hode,
that Dionyſius eyther was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that there was any ſuch digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the churche: eyther that he of ſet
purpoſe, dyd diſſemble it, ſeyng that he
profeſſeth, that he hath written fully of
all the Eccleſiaſticall regyment. But
ſuppoſe this to be true (may our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
ſay) yet I pray you ſhew vs with
what face ye dare alledge the canons
of the .vi. Synode, ſithe that Synode
hathe made no decree at all, but thoſe
wherin the two natures of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
are agreed on agaynſt the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites:
to that I aunſwere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:7808:22"/>
the canons which I haue euen
nowe alledged, were not true, neyther
the very decrees of the .vi. Synode: yee
our purpoſe, that the Pope is not grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
then other byſhoppes, neyther free
from the iudgement of others, may be
manifeſtely proued by other thynges
therof dependynge. For yf there be no
dignitie aboue a byſhops, then is no bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
greatter than an other, in aſmuch
as he is a byſhop. For Dionyſius ſaith
that all biſhoppes are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is to ſaye, of one order and
dignitie. Therfore ſeyng the Pope is a
byſhop, he ought to bee lyke other byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and ſubiecte to all lawes, that
other are bounde vnto. And truely ſo
many ar the byſhoply lawes, or lawes
of byſhoppes, and ſo greate care hadde
the holye Synodes in makynge them,
whoſe authoritie no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande,
that to reherſe them all, it wold
be very harde. Beſyde that I may well
aunſwere, that that is knowen to all
men, that are but meanely conuerſant
in matters eccleſiaſticall, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd
Canons be the decrees of the ſixte
Synode, and alſo that they oughte to
<pb facs="tcp:7808:22"/>
bee reputed and taken of firme and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
authoritie, as they are in deede.
For when as neyther the .v. Synode
neyther the ſyxte, at the begynnynge
hadde any regarde of theſe conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſtreyght after, the .vi. Synode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
renewed, fynyſſhed that whiche
before was neglected. For as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dydde only handle matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
leauyng and omittyng all other
matters, ſo the .vi. Synode beyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
agayne, or renewed, touched
lyghtly matters of doctrine, and made
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutions only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the churche, and other matters
eccleſiaſticall. And that this is the very
ſame vniuerſal ſinode iterate or begun
again, it appereth firſt by the hiſtory of
Baſilius biſhop of Gortines in Candy
who ſupplied the rome of the Pope in
the ſaid ſinode. Moreouer it is manifeſt
in that the ſinode calleth it ſelfe alwais
vniuerſall. And it had not ben true, ſo
great a company of biſhops wold haue
feared to be taken in a manyfeſte lye.
Beſides that the .vii. holy ſynode ſayth
in the firſt decree therof: We willingly
&amp; gladly imbrace the godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb facs="tcp:7808:23"/>
and we confirme their ſtedfaſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defyled
authoritie: as thoſe that the
trumpettes of the holy ghoſte hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned,
that is to ſaye the apoſtles and
holy fathers, that haue bene gathered
togither in dyuers places, for the ſelfe
ſame purpoſe. For they inſpired with
the ſpirite of god decreed thoſe thynges
that they thought profytable. Whome
they accurſed we accurſe alſo: whome
they haue ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, we ſuſpend, whom
they haue depoſed we depoſe: And to be
ſhort, when they by any other meanes
dydde punyſhe, we alſo doo taxe in lyke
maner. Sainct Paule who was taken
vp into the thyrd heauen,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> and to whom
thoſe thynges were reueled, that are
not laufull to bee ſpoken of, cryeth out
that the maners of the holye, ought to
be farre from all couetouſnes, and that
they ſhulde be content with their owne
eſtate and condition. Therfore ſeynge
that neyther the .vi. Synode at the firſt
comyng togyther, neither the ſeuenth
hath meddled with the conſtitutions of
the apoſtles, and the names of the .vi.
vniuerſall ſynodes, but the ſayd ſixthe
ſynode being iterate and renewed hath
<pb facs="tcp:7808:23"/>
ſupplied the defecte therof, it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that the .vii. Synode ſpeaketh of
the canons of the ſaid .vi. counſel. More
ouer where as the Synode accurſethe
thoſe that regarde not the authoritie of
the decrees, Is it not a terrible thyng,
yea is it not ynough to moue any ſtony
hart? Beſides that the biſhop of Rome
hym ſelfe ſo long as he agreed with the
churches of the eaſt, dyd ſo muche ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
and allow the decrees of this ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node
that Adrian the fyrſt, wrytyng to

with great admiration co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth

theſe decrees, Whiche may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere
by the very wordes of his epiſtle,
whiche forth with I wyll alledge. We
doo perceaue, ſayth he, by the ſynodall
epiſtle, how earneſt your profeſſion is
in the right faith, and how great a zele ye
haue towardes the holy congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the .vi. holy Synodes, and
towardes the venerable and ſacred I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
whyche ſurely is wonderfull,
and wrothy great admiration. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is playnely to be ſeene, that in the
laudable godly and right canons of the
<pb facs="tcp:7808:24"/>
ſixte ſynode, that worſhipful picture is
allowed in which the lambe ſhewed by
demonſtration, with the finger of the
precurſor, is liuelie expreſſed which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
receued of vs, as a figure of grace
doth repreſent vnto vs the true lambe
by the lawe, that is to wete, Chriſt him
ſelfe. Therfore we receauyng the olde
fygures, ſygnes, and ſhadowes, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of the truthe, and markes geuen
to the churche, dooe acknowledge the
grace and truth, as they that thynke it
to be the fulnes of the law. To the end
therfore, that that image may in liuely
coloures he expreſſed to all mens eyes,
whiche repreſenteth in manhoode the
lambe that taketh away the ſynnes of
the worlde, that is to ſay our God, we
thynke good, that from henſefoorth in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtede
of the olde lambe, there be a newe
erected, in the churches of God, to the
intent that we maye conſyder, the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge
vp of the baſenes of gods word,
and he put in mynde of that common
welthe, wherein he lyued in the fleſſhe,
and alſo be led as it were by the hande,
to the contemplation of his Paſſion,
and moſte wholſome deathe, by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:7808:24"/>
the freedome of the worlde was
purchaſed. That therfore this cannon
was alowed of Pope Adrian, and that
it is the .lxxiii. of the ſynode, now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned,
the autenticall bookes do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
But no man can ſufficiently mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
at the vnſtedfaſtneſſe and lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Popes adherentes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that they nowe hate and deteſte
the holye generall counſelles, whyche
ſommetyme they allowed, but alſo
that the Popes theym ſelues are at
varyaunce one with an other.<note place="margin">The Popes ar togither by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> For as
wee reade euen nowe Pope Adrian
meruaylouſely commendethe theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
but Innocentius or ſome other
reiecteth theym. If any manne wyll
affirme, that the Pope is not ſubiecte
to the lawes and rules of the Fathers,
he trewelye in no wyſe is to bee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For that were moſte vnwoorthy,
that the Pope ſhoulde not eſteeme the
Fathers, by whome he hathe obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that dygnytie of prehemynence,
whereof we ſpake beefore.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, yf the Pope contempne
decrees, he deſpiſeth his owne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for he hymſelfe hathe made many,
<pb facs="tcp:7808:25"/>
and ſo by the teſtimonye of Paule, he
maketh hymſelfe an offender. But we
haue ſhewed and declared, that he is
bounde to gyue accompte bothe of his
doctrine, and alſo of his other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and regiment eccleſiaſticall: ſo
that he is of neceſſitie ſubiecte to the
conſtitutions of the fathers and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
Certainly it were not right, that
any man ſhuld reuerence the Pope as
a Father,<note place="margin">The Pope is not to be eſtemed.</note> ſeyng that he hymſelfe regar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth
nought ſo many holy Fathers.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Popes adherentes ſaye,
that he is not byſhop of any one place,
but that he is ſymply a Byſhop, that is
to ſay, Byſhop of all the world. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
truely they ſpeake againſt the truth.
For fyrſt we haue proued already, that
he is of one degree with other biſhops,
and as a man woulde ſay in one order
with theym. Beſyde that, the ſynodes
when by occaſion they make mention
of hym, as it oftetymes happeneth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
they call hym Byſhop of Rome.
So that yf he be byſhop of Rome, he is
out of doubt a biſhop of ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
place,<note place="margin">The Pope byſhop of no place.</note> onleſſe perhappes any man
deny Rome to be a certayne place: but
<pb facs="tcp:7808:25"/>
per aduenture ſome man wyll ſay, that
the Pope, when he writeth to other, ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
not hymſelfe byſſhop of Rome:
but ſymply a byſhop, wherby he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
hym ſelfe to bee byſhop of no one
certayne place, but of all the worlde.
To whom we may anſwer, that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth
to proue matters of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce
with ouer lyght (I wyll not
ſay triflyng) reaſons. Whiche kynde
of profe, yf we would vſe, we myghte
more eaſily ouerthrowe the Popes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie,
then they eſtablyſhe the ſame.</p>
            <p>For where as he nameth hymſelfe by
the vſed name of the common dignitie,<note place="margin">The Pope ouercome vvith his owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note>
a byſhop, and not Pope, neyther chiefe
of all prieſtes (with the whiche and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lyke titles his adherentes flatter
hym) it is a taken that the Pope hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
acknowledgeth his owne eſtate,
and teſtifieth the ſame foorthewith by
his title. But neyther we mynde to
ſtriue with ſuche ſtronge reaſons in ſo
weighty a matter, agaynſt the Pope,
neither he in vſyng theſe argumentes,
doth any more preuayl,<note place="margin">The Pope attempteth to make a rope of ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</note> then if he ſhuld
attempt to wrethe a rope of ſande. For
if there wer ſo great force in this kynd
<pb facs="tcp:7808:26"/>
of reaſonyng, then Cyrillus alſo ſhuld
haue ſuch highnes in honor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhuld
be byſhop of all the worlde, yea that ſo
much the ſooner then the Pope, in that
he is oftte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>imes not of himſelf only, but
of other called a byſhop, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any place. For we reade, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius
the moſte glorious conqueror,
and always moſte valyant, greteth the
byſhop Cirillus, without any mention
of the place, wherof he was byſſhop.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe whiche
leaue out the title of a Byſhop, and vſe
onely their owne proper names? Shall
we ſaye that they are no byſhoppes, or
that they haue a greatter dignitie then
an vniuerſall byſhoprike? for as muche
as the Pope of Rome wyll be an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
byſhop, bycauſe the place is not
named whereof he is biſhoppe. There
may many ſuche inſcriptions and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
be broughte out of bokes of
authoritie, wherin the name of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is plainly omitted.</p>
            <p>Furthermore our aduerſaries affirm
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of apoſtolike agreeth only
to the Pope, whiche ſurely is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru.
For it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to other with him
<pb facs="tcp:7808:26"/>
as it appeareth by the .xi. ſeſſion of the

            <p>Here ye maye playnely ſee,<note place="margin">The ſea of Rome only is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</note> that not
onely the ſea of Rome, but alſo the ſeas

Wherfore if we weigh the matter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

eſteeme all thoſe ſeas and churches,
whyche as we haue declared, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

ſo muche of Rome, for this title, ſeyng
that it is not onelye propre vnto that
churche But what ſhal we ſay to that,
where Chryſoſtome writynge to one,
affirmeth that al the prieſts of the new
<pb facs="tcp:7808:27"/>
teſtament ſyt in Chriſtes chayre lyke
as they of the olde teſtament ſat in the
chaire of Moyſes: yea he ſayeth, that
they haue a greater dignitie then than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and archangels, ſo that there can
be no excellency, in that he boaſteth the
ſea Apoſtolike, ſeyng that all byſhops
ſytte in the chayre of Chriſte, and haue
a more ample dignitie, then thangels
themſelues.</p>
            <p>Agayne the Popes ſecte holde, that
it perteyneth by ryght to the Pope on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to call togyther generall councels,
wherin they ſtriue agaynſt a manyfeſt
truthe. It is a wonder to ſee, that the
Pope is not aſhamed to aduance hym
ſelfe, and to lyfte vp his combe in the
churche, for a matter wherof Kynges
myght boaſt them ſelues. I ſpeake not
this, as thoughe I eſteemed not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Kynges. For vnto them we
owe bothe honour and obedience. But
bycauſe the eccleſiaſticall dignitie, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
at naughte all earthly glorye and

            <p>Therefore I wylle proue, that this
right pertayneth rather to kyngs, then
<pb facs="tcp:7808:28"/>
to biſhops. For ſo hath the Actes of the

and holdyng a great and holy ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node
at Nice, ſendeth gretyng. For as
much as vnto vs that are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther
oute of dyuers cities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
by the grace of God, &amp; our moſt
godly prince Conſtantine. &amp;c. Alſo in

To the moſte holy emperours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued

moſt mighty and victorius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours,

The holy great and vniuerſal Synode
aſſembled, by the grace of God and the

your clemency, that accordyng
to byſhop Flauians booke, ye vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to commande a prouinciall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
to be aſſembled in Italy. If it moue
any man that Peter ended his lyfe at
Rome, he ought muche more to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with that the Sonne of God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at Ieruſalem his paſſion, moſt hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
to mankynde. But peraduenture
ſomme manne wyll ſaye, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dydde attribute muche vnto the
Churche of Rome,<note place="margin">VVhy the fathers did attribute ſo much to the ſea of Rome.</note> I aunſwere they
dydde it not becauſe they thought, that
God gaue any greate prerogatiue to
that ſea: but partelye for the deſyre of
<pb facs="tcp:7808:29"/>
good order (the ſtrengthe and profyte
wherof is great. For by order thynges
bothe in heauen and earthe are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and maynteyned) and partely as
deſyrous to obſerue goddes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes,
preuent one an other in ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing
honor. &amp;c. orels bicauſe they ende<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uored
to imitate thexample of humili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
profeſſed by Chriſt, to his diſciples
in waſhing their fete, and ſuch lyke no
table counſels and holſome examples
lefte vnto vs. S Paule writinge to the
Corinthians, calleth him ſelfe their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte
for Chriſtes ſake, yea the Pope
in the beginninge of all his letters, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him ſelfe a ſeruaunt of ſeruauntes.
What meruayle is it thenne, yf the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſome what debaſed themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hym, and graunt hym as we haue
declared, the chiefe degree in honour.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, our aduerſaries ſay, that
no decree may be made in the Church,
without the Popes conſente, whyche
in dede they may very well lay againſt
vs, but we ſhall repaye oure aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with the ſame meaſure. For ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Pope, yf wee beleeue the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the apoſtles, maye conſtitute
<pb facs="tcp:7808:29"/>
any thyng in the Churche, without the
aduiſe of other. For ſo ſayth the .xxxiii.
Canon of the Apoſtles. The byſſhops
of euerye nation muſte knowe who is
chiefe amonge them, and count hym in
manner as theyr heade, neyther maye
they doo any newe thynge without his
conſente, lette euery man handell ſuche
matters by hym ſelfe, as appertayn and
belonge to his Dioceſſe, and the places
vndernethe hym: neyther may he that
is chiefe amonge theim doo any thynge
without the conſent of the reſte. For ſo
ſhall concorde be mayntayned, and god
ſhall be glorified through our Lorde in
the holy ghoſte. If our aduerſaries ſay,
that the Canons of the Apoſtles ar not
theyrs, neither of authoritie ſufficiente,
but Apocriphe: we may lay vnto them
agayne the authoritie of the fathers in
the firſte, thirde, fourthe, ſixthe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
ſynode, whiche defend the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Apoſtles cannons. For the
fyrſte Synode in the fyfth cannon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
maketh mention of two of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
cannons, the .xii. and the .xxxii.</p>
            <p>Alſo the ſame Synode, in the .xv. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
ſpeaketh of the .xv. canon of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.
<pb facs="tcp:7808:30"/>
The thirde Synode or Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine
councell, writyng to Theodoſius
maketh mencion of the .lxxiii. canon of
the apoſtles, wherwith the ſayd ſynode
was armed agynſte Neſtorius, and
condempned hym, lyke as the fowerth
ſynode with the ſame condemned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorus.
Moreouer the ſame fourthe
ſynode, in the .v. canon thereof, wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in this wyſe worde for woorde, of
the .xii. xiij .xiiij. and .xv. Canon of the
Apoſtles. As for ſuche byſſhoppes as
wander from one citie to an other, and
often chaunge theyr myniſtery, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good to this Synode, that they
ſhall be in daunger and punyſſhed, by
the Canons of the Apoſtles. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
the Decrees of the ſyxte Synode
doo ſhewe the full number of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
canons. For ſo hathe the ſeconde
Decree of the ſayde Synode. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to this holy Synode, that it were
moſt expedient, that the .lxxxv. canons
in the Apoſtles name receaued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the holye Fathers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
to vs by tradition, ſhoulde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

for dyuers dyſeaſes in the
