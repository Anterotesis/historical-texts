            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO All the ſeverall Societies of people, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Churches, in the <hi>Presbyterian, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant,</hi> or any other forme of Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the ſervice of God.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rethren, and fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Mankinde; This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing declaration of the word of Life was a free gift to me from the Father himſelfe; And I received it not from men; when I had writ it, I was moved to ſend it to you immediately; but I delayed it by almoſt a fortnight, and thought not of it; then one night as I waked out of ſleep, the voyce was in my very heart and mouth, ready to come forth; goe ſend it to the Churches; Thereupon I was filled with great Love to you, my heart panting with love towards you, pittying your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in that there is a great ſtriving, as
<pb facs="tcp:100449:3"/>
it were for life among you, and yet you lie under the power of death and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and knowes not, or at leaſt doth not actually hold forth that you know, that ſpirit which in words you ſeeme to profeſſe.</p>
            <p>You ſpeake and preach of the life of Love; But you have not the power of it; your verball profeſſion, without the pure righteous action, ſhews you gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be outlandiſh men, of ſeverall Nations, under the government of darkneſſe, and that you are not yet the true Inhabitants of the Land of Love. Before you live you muſt die, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you be bound up into one univerſall body, all your particular bodies and ſocieties muſt be torne to pieces; for the true Light is comming now once more, not onely to ſhake the Earth, that is, <hi>Moſes</hi> worſhip, but Heaven alſo; That which you call Goſpell-worſhip, and the Kingdome without ſhall fall, that ſo the Kingdome within may be eſtabliſhed; for all your particular Churches are like
<pb facs="tcp:100449:3"/>
the incloſures of Land which hedges in ſome to be heires of Life, and hedges out others; one ſaying Chriſt is here with them; Another ſaying no: but he is there with them; but truly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you ſhall ſee and finde, that Chriſt who is the univerſall power of Love is not confined to parties, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate chambers; but he is the power of Life, Light, and Truth, now riſing up to fill the Earth, Mankinde with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Well, I have obeyed the voyce; and I have ſent this to you, with a heart free and full of love towards you; Some of you will receive this with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; others will be offended; To ſome it will be refreſhing, but others will ſtorme, and prepare warre againſt it; And the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> they will ſcoffe; but be it ſo: yet my Armour is tryed, I am ſure it will keep off the blow.</p>
            <p>You ſhall finde I ſpeake of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden,</hi> which is the ſpirit of man, not the ſpirit of Beaſts. And in
<pb facs="tcp:100449:4"/>
that Garden there are weeds and hearbs. The weeds are theſe. Selfe-Love, Pride, Envie; Covetouſneſſe after riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pleaſures, Imagination, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cannot live in peace, unleſſe he enjoy this or that outward object; And ſometimes the joy of envie when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines his end; and ſometime the ſorrow of Covetouſneſſe when he is croſt, rules as King in the Garden. And the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weeds over-ſpreads the ſweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and hearbs, which are the lights of the ſpirit of truth.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe the moſt venemous weed called Hypocriſie, attended with evill ſurmiſing, grudgings, ſpeaking and promiſing, nay, ſwearing one thing, yet doing another, inventing much ſhew of holineſſe to compaſſe his ſelfiſh ends; and while he rules King, as he doth rule at this day; he is aſſiſted with vain glory, feare of being diſthroned, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſing others, unmercifull; careleſſe of former promiſes and engagements; perſecuting thoſe who doth ſuch things
<pb facs="tcp:100449:4"/>
as he promiſed and vowed to doe, whilſt he was a ſervant, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>And as you may call thoſe by the name of weeds; ſo likewiſe you may call them outlandiſh men; for they are not the true native Inhabitants of the heart, but ſtrangers to the righreous ſpirit. And all theſe with their fellowes make up but one power of darkneſſe, Devill, or Father of lies. And this power is the night time of mankinde, or the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sonne of righteouſneſſe from the heart. This power is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate which the word of life hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, this ſhall never enter into true reſt; this is the wicked man, or Dragon in you, which cauſes all warres and ſortowes; and the ſonne that cauſes ſhame; the ſonne of bondage, which muſt not abide in the heart for ever, but muſt be caſt out.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſo long as you labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſelfiſh, darke, imaginary power, you are ſtrangers to the Sonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; If this darke power bear ſway
<pb facs="tcp:100449:5"/>
in you; it is he whom you profeſſe, and it is he whom you call God, and Chriſt; for that power that you hold forth in your actions, is the ſpirit you profeſſe; If your actions be full of ſelfe love, as you may know it by your haſtie anger, when your Religion is queſtioned, and by your ſnappiſh bitterneſſe againſt thoſe that differs from you; then this darke power is he you worſhip.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe in the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> (mans heart) ſweet flowers and hearbs; As Joy, Peace, Love, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſelfe-denyall, patience, ſincerity, truth, or equitie. Theſe are the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in the righteous Land; and all theſe make up but one power, or body, which is the ſeed or Tree of Life in you. And this power is the day-time of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, or the preſence of the Sonne of righteouſneſſe in the heart; This power is the Elect, the Sonne of the Father in whom he delights; this Sonne ſhall live for ever in reſt, peace, and in the power of eternall life; This is the righteous
<pb facs="tcp:100449:5"/>
man, this is <hi>Michaell,</hi> the Seed Chriſt, or bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Therefore, conſider what ſpirit you profeſſe, and live not in darkneſſe any longer; Babes and ſucklings doe ſee, and can ſay, that in your eſtabliſhed formes you worſhip, and profeſſe you know not what; you ſay one thing and doe another; you make God and Chriſt a very cheat to the world, as if he were all words and no deeds; Indeed your king Hypocriſie is ſo; But the King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which your eſtabliſhed formes hath, and doe diſhonour before the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not ſo; and you all muſt and ſhall be torne in pieces, and ſcattered, and ſhamed; for your exceſſive pride, covetouſneſſe, hardneſſe of heart, ſelfe-love, and hypocriſie, and your verball profeſſion ſhall be loathed by all, and be caſt out, as ſtinking, imaginary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ung of falſe-hearted ones, who profeſſes Love in words, and in actions deny Love; but lifts up the Devill and covetouſneſſe and bondage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100449:6"/>If you truly owne Chriſt, you will cheerefully hold forth the reſtoring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in your actions; Chriſt the Anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit doth not enſlave any, but comes to ſet all free; he comes not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy but to ſave; he comes not to put ſackcloath and mourning weeds upon mankinde, but to pull them off and to wipe away all teares.</p>
            <p>So long as the Earth is intangled, and appropriated into particular hands, and kept there by the power of the ſword; as it is, and your profeſſion holds it up, ſo long the Creation lies under bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; And the Devill, who is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of covetouſneſſe, or murderer, doth rule, and is the God, whom you gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally profeſſe; for you acknowledge Chriſt in words, and the Dragon in your actions; and ſo hypocriſie reignes King in the Earth at this very day.</p>
            <p>But if any of you will truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt, now in the end of your dayes, come joyne hands and hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſet the Earth free; nothing
<pb facs="tcp:100449:6"/>
now ſtands in the way of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>; but inward covetouſneſſe; Be not like the Rats and Miſe, that drawes the treaſures of the Earth into your holes to looke upon, whil'ſt your fellow-members, to whom it belongs as well as to you, by the Law of Creation doe ſtarve for want; But you have no warrant from the Law of Righteouſneſſe ſo to doe; whenſoever you lock up the treaſure of the Earth, and deſires more then food and rayment, you doe evill.</p>
            <p>When you know the Sonne within, as you can talke much of him without, then the Sonne will ſet you free; and truly he is comming on a maine, to breake downe all your pinfoulds, and to lay all open to the Common; the rough wayes he will make ſmooth, and crooked wayes ſtrait; and levell moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and valleys.</p>
            <p>And covetous, proud ſelfe-Love, and ruling and teaching hypocriſie ſhall tye up, or reſtraine his ſpirit no longer; for the voyce is gone out, freedome, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:100449:7"/>
freedome: he that hath eares to heare, let him heare, he that is filthie, let him be filthy ſtill, till he be caſt out as dung and unſavory ſalt; And ſo I leave this with you, as I was commanded, and bid you farewell.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100449:9"/>And this God, or almighty Ruler, is univerſall Love ſtrength and life,; And as he begets and brings forth every thing, in their degree and kinde: ſo he is the Reſtorer of all things, from that defilement, death and ſorrow, which they fall into, and the alone deliverer from the oppreſſing power, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every one in peace; Therefore he is called the Lord God, Almighty; for he is the onely, and alone living ſpirit, which dwells every where, and can doe, what he will.</p>
               <p>And of all thoſe bodies, that are called Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or the clothing of God, Mankinde is the chief. And becauſe the Father or ſpirit of all things, manifeſts himſelfe in mankinde, in life ſtrength, and wiſdome more then in any other creature, therefore mankinde is made the Lord of all; And the whole Earth is this: The Lords.</p>
               <p>For when all things were produced, and appeared very good in the liking, and content of the creating ſpirit: The word of Command, was to whole mankinde (not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For as the great Earth, and the inferiour creatures therein are as the Commons Forreſts, and delights of God in the out Coaſts of the Creation; Even ſo Mankind, The living Earth is the very Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein that ſpirit of Love, did walke, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100449:9"/>
delight himſelfe principally, as being the Head and Lord of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>In this Garden are five Rivers. Hearing, Seeing, Taſting, Smelling, Feeling; which we in our age of the world, call five Senſes; And theſe five water ſprings, doe refreſh and preſerve the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both of the out coaſts, and of the Garden.</p>
               <p>In this Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mankind, and in every branch of him, there is a Tree of knowledge, of good and evill, called Imagination; and the Tree of Life, called univerſall Love, or pure knowledge in the power.</p>
               <p>When Mankinde, or the living ſoule feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or delights himſelfe in the fruit of that tree of good and evill, which is ſelfiſh, unwarranted, and unexperienced Imagination, which is his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſeaſe: then he looſes his honour and ſtrength, and falls from his dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lordſhip, and becomes like the Beaſts of the field, void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; For the Lord of ſo great and vaſt a body as the Creation is, muſt know all things cleerely, as they be, and not by blinde Imagination, that leads mankind ſometimes aſtray, as well as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the right way.</p>
               <p>When mankind is guided by Imagination, he runs a great hazard upon life and death; This power is he, that calls good evill, and evill good. This knowes not the crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100449:10"/>And while Mankinde eates of this Tree, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights himſelfe here, he is driven out of the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Imagination is he that fills you with feares, doubts, troubles, evill ſurmiſings and grudges, he it is that ſtirs up warres and diviſions; he makes you luſt after every thing you ſee, or heare of, and promiſes delight to you, in the enjoyment; as in riches, places of Government, pleaſures, ſocietie of ſtrange women: and when you have all theſe, which you thinke or imagine to have content in, preſently troubles follow the heeles thereof; and you ſee your ſelfe naked and are aſhamed.</p>
               <p>So that the ſelfiſh imaginary power within you, is the power of darkneſſe; The father of lies, the deceiver, the deſtroyer, and the Serpent that twiſts about every thing within your ſelfe, and ſo leads you aſtray from the right way of life and peace. And the whole world of mankinde, generally at this day, through all the nations of the world, is eating of this Tree of knowledge, of good and evill, and are caſt out of themſelves, and knowe not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with his imaginary power of darkneſſe in teaching, and ruling: therefore it is that fulneſſe of time, in which the Reſtorer of all things will come, to deliver, the Creation from that bondage and curſe, and draw up all things to live in him, who is the true life, reſt, and Light of all things.</p>
               <p>For in the midſt of this Garden likewiſe, there is the Tree of Life, who is this bleſſing, or reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring power, called univerſall Love, or pure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which when mankinde by experience begins to eat thereof, or to delight himſelfe herein, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Kingdome and Law within, which is Chriſt, before the Kingdome and Law, that lies in objects without, which is the devill:</p>
               <p>Then man is drawne up into himſelfe againe; or new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is the ſpirit of truth, comes downe to Earth, to fetch Earth up to live in that life, that is a life above objects; even to live in the enjoyment of Chriſt, the righteous ſpirit within himſelfe, and to tread the earthly life, that lies in objects without, under foot; This is the life, that will bring in true community; and deſtroy murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propriety. Now mankinde enters into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Gods reſt, and lives for ever, he enjoyes his Kingdome, and the word within himſelfe he knowes ſinne and ſorrow no more; for all teares now, which blind Imagination brought upon him, are wiped away; And man is in peace.</p>
               <p>This Tree of Life I ſay, is univerſall Love, which our age calls righteous Conſcience, or pure Reaſon; or the Seed of life that lies under the clods
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100449:11"/>
of Earth, which in his time is now riſing up to bruiſe the Serpents head, and to caſt that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry murderer out of the Creation.</p>
               <p>This Seed is he, that leads mankinde into Truth, making every one to ſeeke the preſervation and peace of others, as of themſelves; This teaches man inwardly to know the nature and neceſſity of every body, and to adminiſter to every body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. This was the Father in Jeſus Chriſt, who let him ſee what was in man; This was that God-head that dwelt bodily in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelfe, and ſo making peace: when this almighty power of Life rules King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe within; then Satan, or outward objects, ſhall finde nothing in you to cloſe with him, when he temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This power is not a ſelfe-Lover; But the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Lover; This will have all ſaved, that is, will have all live in peace and reſt. This Tree of life is full of humility, ſincerity, patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tenderneſſe, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

                  </gap>e Joy, Peace, Liberty, yea full of the well ſprings of ſweet life.</p>
               <p>This is the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the promiſed Seed, that remaines within, as a ſervant for a time, times, and dividing of time; then he is to ariſe and caſt out the Dragon, and to purge out that droſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100449:11"/>
imaginary power, that is crept in to defile the Creation; And ſo properly he is called the reſtorer, Saviour, Redeemer, yea and the true and faithfull Leveller.</p>
               <p>And when this tree of Life is fed upon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, (by the five Sences, which is the Creation, Mankind, or the living Soule.) Then theſe five Rivers are called pure Rivers of the waters of life; for the life of truth and peace is in them, and they are the ſweet conveyers of the waters, or breathings of life, from one to another through the whole body: and ſo bringing all into a onenes, to be of one heart and one minde; And there is but one God and King in all, and among all, who is <hi>Michael</hi> our Prince of peace.</p>
               <p>And the whole Creation now, will laugh in righteouſneſſe, for there will be no murmuring or complaining heard in all the mountaine of the Lord.</p>
               <p>For this I can ſay, when this tree of Life begins to rule within a particular heart; he caſts out ſorrow, feares, inward preſſſures; he ſubdues muttering, ſurmiſing, heart riſing; he kills Envie, pride, vaine-glory, uncleane luſt; in one word, he caſts the wicked man out, and takes poſſeſſion of his owne houſe and Temple himſelfe.

This is the reigne of the Beaſt, and yet he would be called a God, though he be the murderer; well, thou art and ſtill ſhalt be called a God; But thou art the God of the world, that runs round, and when thou art brought to where thou beganſt, then thy dayes are done, thou muſt dye, And the voyce is pronounced, it is done, time ſhall be to thee no more; And thou ſhalt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed without hand, that is, without ſword or weapons; which is the rocke of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well, this Imaginary power is the darke ſide of the cloude; This is the Sonne of the mother Earth mankinde, which cauſes ſhame; This is the curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Serpent, the Devill, and his power hath filled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100449:13"/>
the Creation, and is the burden it grones under; This is the power of darknes.</p>
               <p>And he would be as God, knowing good and evill, therefore the Almighty power of Life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him a time, times, and dividing of time to rule in mankinde. And while he rules he fills all creatures with ſorrow and ſlavery, and ſo in the end of his appointed time he is proved a Devill, and not the true God, the deſtroyer and murderer, and not the Saviour. The curſe and not the bleſſing of the Creation, the power of darkneſſe, and not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Light,</p>
               <p>This is the darkneſſe, that hath covered the Earth, and the curſe that deſtroyes all things, this is he that calls light darkneſſe, and darkneſſe light, good evill, and evill good; and while this power rules in mankinde, mankinde is in priſon and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage within himſelfe, and ſees no Light.</p>
               <p>And under this power of Imagination the whole government of the world amongſt the ſonnes of men is built; all Nations are under this Kingdome of darkneſſe; the frame of this worldly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Devills proper Kingdome; And the power of the ſword fighting and killing, cannot throw downe his Kingdome, but ſet it up in more power; B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t that power that muſt deſtroy the dark Kingdome, is a power contrary to him; And that is, Love and patience. Live in this life; and thou killſt the Devill, and ſhakeſt his Kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his eares. This power of Love and patience, acted with a cheerefull life, kills Imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100449:13"/>Indeed Imagination is that God, which generally every one worſhips and ownes; and in the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they worſhip a lye, the Devill and meere nothing; This is he that makes everie one wiſe in his owne conceit; that makes men, Envie, cenſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oy one another; and to take pleaſure in none but what pleaſes ſelfe. This Imagination feares where no feare is: he riſes up to deſtroy others, for feare, leaſt others deſtroy him: he will oppreſſe others, leaſt others oppreſſe him; and feares he ſhall be in want hereafter; therefore he takes by violence, that which others have laboured for. And, ſo he beates the even ground before him, like a blinde man, that imagines that hill or block lies in his way.</p>
               <p>And though this dark power be a God, or mighty ruler in mankinde; yet aſſoone as he appeared to rule, the true Light appeares to breake his peace; aſſoone as Imagination began to ſit upon the throne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (Mans heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) The ſeed of Life began to caſt him out, and to take his Kingdome from him; So that this is the great battaile of God Alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe two powers are <hi>Michaell</hi> and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and this battaile is fought in Heaven, (that is, in mankinde, in the garden of <hi>Eden</hi>) where God principally reſolves to ſet up his throne of righteous governement, it is not ſought in the ſpirit of Beaſts; but in Heaven in the ſpirit of Mankinde,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100449:14"/>
who is the Lord. And this battaile in our age of the world, growes hotter and ſharper then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; for we are under the dividing of time, which is the laſt period of the Beaſts raigne; And he will ſtrive hardeſt now.</p>
               <p>But it will be in vaine, he muſt looſe his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for the Lambe will caſt the Dragon out, and bring all into Peace; then every thing ſhall appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the end of all ſocieties of Churches, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, Ordinances, ſhould be to finde out this darkneſſe, and to caſt it out; And to worſhip the Father in Spirit and truth; And ſo to advance the Bleſſing, or the Sonne in whom the Father is well pleaſed. That ſo mankinde might ceaſe ſpeaking and acting from thoughts and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may come to ſpeake and act purely, as the truth was in Jeſus, he being the ſupreame Lord of the Earth.</p>
               <p>This, you Preachers, and Profeſſors, is, or at leaſt ſhould be the end of your profeſſion; And if you come ſhort of this, you looſe all your paines, and will be ranked among imaginary Hypocrites, that worſhip they know not what, but as their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore if man would live purely, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that ſpirit in him, which is called the Seed; he is then to know, what ſpirit is it, that rules in

               <p>But the ſeed of all things, which is my ſelfe, will bruiſe that Serpents head, and I will reſtore thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; I am thy Redeemer, and beſides me there is none.</p>
               <p>But yet the Battell between <hi>Michaell,</hi> that Seed, and the Dragon, that Imaginary power is not ended, it begins againe to be fought in heaven, that is, within the garden mankinde; and the day growes hot againe, fleſh and ſpirit does begin a freſh to oppoſe each other ſharply.</p>
               <p>For Imagination begins to tell the ſoule; If thou enjoyſt not fulnes of all objects, thou wilt want and ſtarve for food, and ſo preſently feare of poverty takes the throne and reignes; and feare bids thee goe; get what thou canſt, by hooke or by crooke, leaſt thou want, and periſh, and die miſerably.</p>

               <p>Then thou ſeeſt the treachery of men beſet thee, poverty threatning thee, thy body weake, thy mind diſtempered with feare and care what to doe, and how to live; Some laughs at thee, others cheats thee, yea, ſuch as ſeeme to profeſſe the ſame ſpirit, thou ſtriveſt for, are moſt bitter againſt thee; and they looke after objects more then the inward life, for who more covetous, and hard then they; And wilt thou be alone? yea, thou art alone, where is any one that ownes, or tenders thee.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaith the ſoule, this is an evill time; and then ſaith Imaginary feare, filling the ſoule with ſorrow, oh that this body had never been borne, I would I had dyed in the wombe; If this be the happineſſe of a man, I would I had been a Bird, a Beaſt, or ſome other creature. While I had no care of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly, I could live, I had friends, I had peace; But ſince I began to doe as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would be done by: friends now ſtands a farre off; every body hates me, and I am open to all miſrey; does righteouſneſſe bring thee to this, oh miſerable wretch?</p>
               <p>This now is a battell of another nature, then the former was; for in the firſt battell, the Imaginary fleſh was lofty and ſtout, and full of preſumption, ſelfe-conceit, ſcoffes, jeeres Envie, vaporing, and ſecret ſubtilty, laughing in his ſleave as we ſay, at the wayes of the Spirit of Life.</p>

               <p>And in this battell likewiſe, God and man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fleſh and ſpirit are ſeparated, there is no ſweet agreement; The ſelfiſh Imagination would be a God ſtill, and fight ſtrongly to keep the tottering kingdome, and will not leave off till the Spirit of burning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For if our true peace and reſt, lie in objects and in a Law without, as Imagination would have it, then the Spirit is not within the Creation, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; And if ſo, then there may be places found, where the Spirit is not, and then God is not every

               <p>But the Spirit is within; for the Creation is his clothing; God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world (or falne Earth to himſelfe, he was not without him in objects, offering peace; but he was within, drawing him from the deceitfulneſſe of objects that fades away, to looke for reſt and peace only within, therefore it is ſaid, Chriſt is our reſt, that is, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing within is our reſt, who teacheth us all things, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Imaginary ſelfiſhneſſe, created this power, to burden and oppreſſe the Creation, which was the worke of the righteous Spirit.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Daniell</hi> ſaw this Beaſt lifted up from the Earth, and made to ſtand upon the feet like a man, and a mans heart was given to it, that is, This Power ſhould be the Image of true Magiſtracie, and while the Beaſtly power of ſelfe-Love rules in the hearts of mankinde; this Kingly power ſhould be the preſerver of the meeke in ſpirit, and ſo help the woman.</p>
               <p>And when the time comes for Chriſt to reigne, this Beaſt ſhall deliver up his Crowne, Scepter, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100449:20"/>
and government unto Chriſt, and lay all downe at his feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Beaſt was like a Beare; And this is the power of the ſelfiſh Lawes, which is full of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and of a Beare-like tearing and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; and he had three ribs in the mouth, which are theſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the power of Priſons, whereby he kills and devoures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the power of whiping, baniſhment, and confiſcation of goods, whereby he kills.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the power of hanging, preſſing, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, martering; whereby he kills, and devoures much fleſh, for take theſe three ribs out of the mouth of the Law, or Innes of Court trade, and that Beaſt hath no power, but dies.</p>
               <p>The third Beaſt was like a Leopard, ſpotty; and this is the thieving Art of buying and ſelling, the Earth with her fruits one to another. Imaginary ſelfiſh Covetouſneſſe created this Beaſt likewiſe; And this Beaſt had foure wings; Policy, Hypocriſie, Self-Love, and hardneſſe of Heart; for this Beaſt is a true ſelf-Lover, to get the Earth to himſelfe, to lock it up in Cheſts and barnes, though others ſtarve for want.</p>
               <p>And this Beaſt had foure heads, that guides him, and upholds him in his wayes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the power of the ſword fighting for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the power of the Law, enſlaving others to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the power of the covetous Imaginary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100449:21"/>
Clergie, preaching it up, and drawing the people to wander after him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the power of a blinde deceived Heart, over-awed with feare of men, and a conceit that it is a righteous Art; And this Beaſt had dominion to rule.</p>
               <p>The fourth Beaſt is the Imaginary Clergy-Power, which indeed is <hi>Iudas</hi>; and this is more terrible and dreadfull then the reſt; and though he come laſt, yet indeed he is the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that begot the other; All theſe Beaſts, they differ in ſhape, and yet they agree all in one oppreſſing power, ſupporting one another; one cannot live without another; and yet they ſeeme to perſecute one another; and if one truly die, all dies.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon? only this; they ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that either alone, or altogether, they are the curſe and plague upon the Creation, and is the cauſe of all ſorrowes and teares, amongſt mankinde; for they devoure abundantly, and yet they riſe out of the Sea, even from the body of deceived, covetous, darke, powered mankinde, in the night time of that world.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure Beaſts are all very fruitfull; for from them, as from foure Fountaines or Monarchs, ſprings up divers heads and hornes; that is, ſeverall ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth, of ſelfiſh tyrannicall Power, whereby the Creation is oppreſt and burdened; and theſe reigne in power, while propriety rules as King; but when righteous community riſes, which is the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100449:21"/>
bleſſing, then they all fall, and are ſhaken to peeces.</p>
               <p>The Creation, will never be in quiet, peace, till theſe foure Beaſts, with all their heads and hornes, the variety of their branching powers doe run into the Sea againe, and be ſwallowed up in thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that is, into Mankinde, who ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly inlightned; and Light-Life, and truth ſhall mightily overflow, as the waters of the Seas over the Earth; and all thoſe Beaſts with their ſelfe-will powers, ſhall ſinke like mudd, to the bottome, and their place ſhall be ſeene no more.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the heards of ſwine, that muſt periſh in the waters.</p>
               <p>This worke Chriſt will bring to paſſe, at his more glorious appearance, he will conſume the myſterie of iniquity, by the brightneſſe of his comming. You Angells of the Lord, who are the Lights of the Earth, ſpeake aloud, roare out, and ſpare not, power out the appointed plagues upon the Beaſt, in this her hypocriticall, dividing of time.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the foure Beaſts, or ſelfiſh Beaſtly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that riſe up out of the Sea, to oppreſſe, burden, and deſtroy univerſall Love, and there returne back into the Sea, will be the riſing up of Love, who is the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, cauſing day-light.</p>
               <p>The kingly Power, he tooke the ſword to kill and conquer; and to lift up ſelfe, to be the Ruler; for all Lawes of the Nations are Lawes made by the will of this murderer, kingly power.</p>
               <p>And this Beaſt ſhall be throwne downe by his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100449:22"/>
owne power; for out of the Serpents root ſhall come forth a Cocatriſe, that ſhall devoure the body. I wonder not to ſee the <hi>Midianites</hi> deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; He that takes the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword. This kingly power fighting, is the Army of the <hi>Midianites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, where you ſee Army againſt Army; It is but the kingly power divided, tearing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring it ſelfe; for as he riſeth by his owne ſword, ſo he ſhall fall by his owne ſword, as the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> did; they ſheathed their ſwords one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bowells, while <hi>Iſraell</hi> looked on, and at laſt tooke the ſpoyle:</p>
               <p>So ſhall kingly power doe in his ſeverall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the ſword; they ſhall daſh one againſt another; Time ſhall daſh againſt times, and times ſhall daſh againſt the dividing of time; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the dividing of time ſhall deſtroy him; till the Creation be cleanſed of theſe plagues; and that curſe which hath deſtroyed the Earth, ſhall now in the period of time, deſtroy himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And this makes way for Chriſt, the univerſal Love, to take the Kingdome, and the dominion of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>Therefore you ſouldiers, you may ſee the end o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the other three Beaſts; who, are Clergy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100449:22"/>
Law, and Buying and Selling; theſe riſe up by craft; ſupported by the kingly power; And the chiefe Beaſt is the Clergy, he bred all the other; He is a King, underſtanding darke ſayings, and he ſhall by craft deceive many; the other Beaſts are this Beaſts ſons, he bred them.</p>
               <p>For this teaching Art, firſt bids mankinde, to looke abroad, for a teacher and a ruler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to look abroad for Juſtice and content; and when he had deceived them, ſo to doe: then he put mankinde upon buying and ſelling, of the Earth and her fruits, and ſo by that meanes the Creation is divided, and Mankinde is put upon an Art to cheat, and burden himſelfe; for the Earth ought to remaine a ſtanding portion to them, and their children ſucceſſively, by the righteous Law of Creation.</p>
               <p>Then this teaching Art found out the Law; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it the Law of Juſtice; a very good name, to cover his knavery; for he is a mighty Beaſt with great teeth, and is a mighty devourer of men; he eates up all, that comes within his power; for this Proverb is true, goe to Law, and none ſhall get but the Lawyer. The Law is the Fox, poore men are the geeſſe; he pulls of their feathers, and feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure Beaſts are the Fountaines of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Creation, they are of a fruitfull genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one begetting divers Beaſts; that are of mighty devouring natures; But the moſt dreadfull and terrible Beaſt, is the Clergy Power; for though the other three raiſed him up by action; yet this Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100449:23"/>
learned Beaſt raiſed them up by policie; for ſelfe ends.</p>
               <p>For this ſtamped the other under foot, ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi>; And is not this true? hath not the Clergy ruled over kingly Power, Law, and buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and brought all under his Command? for at the firſt, he was onely a teaching Power, and then it was a Beaſt, differing from the reſt, yet he ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them under foot, and all the other had their ſtrength and ſuccour from him, by his teaching and imaginary inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Out of this teaching Beaſt riſe up ten hornes; or the branching forth of his ſtrength in ten particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; Five fighting againſt the powers of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hearing, Seeing, Taſting, Smelling, Feeling, which is called the body of the living ſoule, that is, very good.</p>
               <p>And five fighting againſt the powers of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is Vnderſtanding, Will, Affection, Joy, and Peace; which is called the Seed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king war againſt him; and ſo darking Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>This is he, that reſtraines the liberty of the outward man, not ſuffering him to have a free enjoyment of his portion in the Earth; making ſuch actions to be ſinne, which the righteous creating Spirit made not a ſinne.</p>
               <p>And he reſtraines thereby the liberty of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; not ſuffering him to act in the liberty of himſelfe; for he makes a man a ſinner for a word, and ſo he ſweeps the Stars of Heaven downe with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100449:23"/>
his tayle, he darkens Heaven and Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files body and mind.</p>
               <p>For ſo long as I muſt not act, according to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of my owne ſpirit and power within me; but muſt be guided by others without me, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for ſuch actions, which others in the ruling Chare doe, in a higher nature then I doe; I am then in bondage, and my eyes are put out.</p>
               <p>And this is the Covenant, that the outward teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, makes with the branches of Mankinde, to put out their owne eyes, to ſee by others; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them none can ſee, but ſchollars: ſo that this fourth Beaſt, is more dreadfull then the other three; for it ſtamps the other three under foot, and rules over all.</p>
               <p>And out of the ten hornes of this Beaſt, riſe up another little horne; and this is the dominion and rule, which the teaching power takes up, called Eccleſiaſticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> power; and this little horne was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a power that was not his owne; for the kingly power puts that dominion and rule into his hands; While he remained onely a teaching pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he ſtamped the other under him, and overawed others by his deceitfull words.</p>
               <p>But now he hath got a power to rule, called Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power, which is the extract of ſelfiſh righteouſneſſe, from the ſeeming righteouſneſſe of the foure Beaſts into one ruling power, and by this, which was little in the beginning; There were three of the firſt hornes plucked up; that is:</p>
               <p>Kingly Power, Law, and buying and ſelling; for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100449:24"/>
the Little horne, or ruling Clergie lifted up himſelfe above all theſe, and made theſe uncover and fall to him; he had dominion and power over all theſe, and theſe were in ſubjection, and afraid, and bowed to him; He by his teaching lifted up theſe, and theſe by their acting, lifted up him to rule; and he by his ruling treads theſe under his proud covetous feet.</p>
               <p>And this is he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is ſaid to be a King of a fierce countenance; underſtanding, darke ſaying, that is mighty, but not by his owne power, and he ſhall by craft and power deſtroy many; his riſing was in the latter dayes, when tranſgreſſions were come to the full; when people were moſt blinde, by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching; then they eaſily receive him to be the outward ruler over their ſoules; for now the Sea being bemuddied, that is, mankinde being mightily deceived, he by his learned policy, riſeth up out of that deceived Sea, for all the peeple wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered after him, though he ſore oppreſſed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3.</p>
               <p>And as the ſword, which is not his power, lifted him up and ſupports him, by forcing the people to pay him tithes; for the Law of the Magiſtrate forces the people to pay them.</p>
               <p>And he being lifted up, he made war with the Saints, and overcame them, for a time, times, and dividing of time; But as he was lifted up by others power, through his owne craft; Even ſo he ſhall be deſtroyed againe, without hand; the Sword ſhall not deſtroy him, he ſhall be diſcovered in all his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, hypocriticall, bewitching knavery, by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100449:24"/>
light and wiſdome of the Spirit of Truth, that ſhall riſe up out of the Sea of mankinde likewiſe, appearing in ſonnes and daughters of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the latter dayes.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, Chriſt ſhall deſtroy him by the word of his mouth, and by the brightneſſe of his comming, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.26. &amp;c. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt the Anoynting ſpirit riſes up, and inlightens mankind, then in his light, they ſhall ſee the deceit and falſhood of this Beaſt, that hath deceived all the world; and ſhall fall off from him, and leave him naked and bare; and if he will teach and rule, let him ſhew his power over the Beaſts; for the people will all looke up to God, to be taught and governed by him.</p>
               <p>The diſcovery of the fulneſſe, and foulneſſe of this Beaſt, throwes downe all the reſt likewiſe; for when mankinde begins to fall off from one part of the beaſtly power, he will fall from all, for they all depend one upon another,</p>
               <p>Kingly power depends upon the Law, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on buying and ſelling; and theſe three depend upon the Clergy, to bewitch the people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; and all of them depend upon Kingly power by his force, to compell ſubjection from thoſe that will not be bewitched.</p>
               <p>But when mankinde once ſees, that his teacher and ruler is within him; then what need is there of a teacher and ruler without; they will eaſily caſt off their burden.</p>
               <p>Therefore woe, woe, woe, to the Inhabitants
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100449:25"/>

               <p>But government is called Magiſtracy, and all Magiſtracie is of God.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Magiſtracie is a good name, and the myſtery of iniquity, hath not only got this name, but many other excellent names: to be ſet upon the head of his blacknes of darkneſſe, that under a good name he may goe undiſcovered, and he puts bad names upon things that are excellent.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us ſee, whether Imaginary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that divides part of mankinde to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Earth, and the other part not to enjoy the Earth, is worthy of the name, Magiſtracie; No, no; ſuch a dividing, ſelfe loving power is an enemie to Magiſtracie.</p>
               <p>For Magiſtracie hath two excellent principles in his nature, which the darke ſelfiſh government is an enemy to.</p>
               <p>Firſt Magiſtracie ſignifies a great Light, as much as to ſay, greater Light of Love, greater Light of Humility, greater Light of Reaſon, greater Light of Truth, keeping promiſe and covenant; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light of Peace, and tenderneſſe of heart, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light of boldneſſe, in a cauſe that is univerſally righteous.</p>
               <p>And where this power, Authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rules, this is pure Magiſtracie, and it is the Life and power of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Imaginarie Miniſtrie and Religion is to be plucked up, as unſavorie ſalt; and this is the learned publick Miniſtrie of the world; for this Miniſtrie is ſet up by craft and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, how to draw the Earth, and the labours of men into the Clergies hands; Theſe men make themſelves miniſters, as a man teaches birds to ſpeake; But they doe not ſtay till Chriſt make them, for that will be too long for them to wait, the rich Benefices will be all taken up.</p>

               <p>For when Chriſt ſent out his Diſciples to preach, he ſaith, that which you have heard and ſeen, goe preach; and ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> we cannot but ſpeake the things which we have heard and ſeen from the Father; But the Vniverſitie publick Miniſtrie runs before he be ſent; they take up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans meſſage, and carries abroad other mens words, or ſtudies or imagines a meaning; and this is their miniſtrie; This is not to preach the truth, as it was in Jeſus, purely and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, as they received it of the Father, but as they receive it from man, and by man.</p>

               <p>IN the body of mankinde, and indeed, in every ſingle body, there are three particulars neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be knowne, without which no man can know himſelfe, let him ſay what he will.</p>

               <p>Secondly, there is the myſterie of iniquitie, or the power of deceit, and this is the God of the world, or Prince of darkneſſe; that deceives the liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, the Life of God, or of the righteous ſpirit riſing up in the living ſoule, and caſting the curſe or power of darkneſſe out, and bringing Mankinde into peace; and this is the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> or the Lord from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now this living ſoule Mankinde is a Beaſt, and the King of Beaſts; for the life of the five Sences onely is the life of the Beaſt; And this Beaſt in every one, as well as in the whole, is to raigne for a time, times, and dividing of time, before mankinde ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

univerſall Love. As Jeſus Chriſt prayd, Father, I pray that they may be one in us, as thou oh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art one in me, and I in thee, they were not united yet.</p>
               <p>The Image of God in fleſh dyed, and was put out by darkneſſe; But the Seed, or ſpirit of true life riſing up from under that darkneſſe, dies no more, but lives for ever; This ſpirit is the tree of Life.</p>
               <p>Therefore, you that ſay you know but one power, be not deceived; for if this one power of righteouſneſſe, which is the tree of Life rule in you, then you are new creatures indeed, you are one with the Father and the Sonne; And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Darkneſſe is now ſwallowed up and gone.</p>
               <p>But if ſelfiſh actions, and ſelfiſh Principles live in their ſtrength in you ſtill; if Imagination be Ruler, truly then, that one power is but the power of darkneſſe, to whom you are in bondage, and you are not yet paſt the combate, the Dragon is not yet caſt out, and you muſt know a fuller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, before you can ſit downe in peace.</p>

               <p>If your owne eye be darke, that is, if darkneſſe rule your whole body; then all the actions of your body towards others are in darkneſſe, and builders up of ſelfiſhneſſe, which is the one pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you yet live in.</p>
               <p>But if your eye be truly ſingle, and full of Light, then the Light power wholly rules in you, and the actions of your outward man will be full of Light, and Life, and Love, towards every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle branch of the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſome may ſay, explaine theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in mankinde, that we may know them diſtinctly, one from another. I Anſwer, I ſhall readily doe it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt particular is the living Soule, or that eſtate of ſimple plaine heartedneſſe, which hath the Life of the five Sences only only, and by that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100449:31"/>
Life preſerves that ſingle body, or proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>But the Life of the Spirit, in ſound reaſon lives not yet in the Sences; for pure Reaſon lives llke a corne or wheate, under the clods of Earth, or Beaſt, and is not yet riſen up to rule as King.</p>
               <p>This plaine hearted ſtate is ſet in the midſt of many objects, tempting him like the Serpent; and it is open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o many croſſes, and teares, like the tender graſſe, that is ſoone bruiſed by the foot of the oxe; it hath not the true reſt of Chriſt in it, though there be much reſt and peace in it; for it is changeable.</p>
               <p>This is ſuch a ſtate, that though there be ſelfe-Love, yet there is no hatred towards others in it, but a quiet content to let others live too. As a childe, though he love himſelfe (the propriety of a Beaſt ſo to doe) yet he envies not others; for Envie, Pride, Covetouſneſſe, Hypocriſie, raſh murdering, anger, hath not yet defiled the Earth. The man is plaine, honeſt hearted, even Innocent <hi>Aam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like <hi>Nathanaell</hi> in whom there was no guile, and yet <hi>Nathana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit as yet ruled not as King in him; for he was open to temptation, and change, and many teares.</p>
               <p>Like <hi>Peter,</hi> a man of the ſame plaine hearted temper, full of Love to Chriſt and others; yet ſelfiſh, he was without guile, and was loving, without knowledge, therefore open to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as Chriſt told his Diſciples, I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you twelve, and one of you is a Devill; that is, eleven of you are plaine, honeſt, ſimpl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hearts, in whom there is no guile; you have ſincerely in love to me, forſaken all your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riends, and riches to follow me: ſo that Covetouſneſſe doth not reigne, Imagination doth not fright you, with what ſhall we eate, and what ſhall we drinke, and wherewith ſhall be cloathed hereafter? As they they themſelves ſaid, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſter, we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken all to follow thee, and what ſhall wee have &amp;c?</p>
               <p>So that here is no ſubtlety, but downe right ſimplicity without guile, and theſe are like wax, prepared for any ſtamp.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Judas</hi> the twelfth man was a Devill, he was defiled and falne by temptation, that is, he was one that followed Chriſt for ſelfe ends; not ſimply, like moſt preachers, and covetous, bitter hearted Profeſſors, that will covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, what they muſt have before they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w Chriſt; And when they heare they muſt part with all to follow Chriſt, then they are ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. This is <hi>Iudas,</hi> a Devill, the power of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, the curſe that hath defiled mankind, and he ſtrives to ſpread himſelfe, that he may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100449:32"/>
defile all. But Chriſt who is the bleſſing appeares to deſtroy this curſe.</p>
               <p>And when plaine hearted <hi>Peter</hi> told Chriſt, that though all forſooke him; yet he would not; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Peter,</hi> thou art plaine hearted, and thou know'ſt not the wiles of the tempter; thou wilt be overcome and made to denie me, I know thy ſtrength; for I that am the light and life of the world, doe not yet live in thee; Thou art a downe right living Soule, a plaine innocent harmeleſſe man; but thou art not yet Anoynted, nor cannot be, till I be gone from you; And then Ile ſend you the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that ſhall lead you into all truth, and abide with you for ever.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when I am taken from you, ſtay you quiet at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> till you receive power from on high, which is the Fathers promiſe to you, and that power ruling in you, ſhall keep you from being overcome by temptation.</p>
               <p>And you ſee <hi>Peters</hi> ſtrength proved weakneſſe, though there was ſimple hearted innocencie in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> love to Chriſt's body; yet his love was change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for when the tryall came, <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this plaine heartedneſſe is the firſt time of the Beaſt, or ſelfe, which is full of peace, while a man is in it; but it is a ſtate like wax, flexible and eaſie to take any impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore the two powers of Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Chriſt and the Devill; ſtrives who ſhall rule in this living ſoule firſt; And theſe two powers are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100449:33"/>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> fleſh and ſpirit, ſtrugling within the wombe of the living Earth, who ſhall rule firſt; And darkneſſe firſt prevailes, and rules within, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cauſes ſorrow, and through his deceit, drawes the man to ſeeke content in objects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. But then followes Chriſt the reſtoring power, and delivers the living ſoule againe from that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and ſets him downe in himſelfe, which is the reſt and ſtrength of Love unchangeable, who doth caſt out all feare.</p>
               <p>Now while the darke power rules; the man is as <hi>Iudas,</hi> a Devill, a betrayer of Chriſt, therefore when Chriſt begins to redeeme; he kills that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and brings mankinde back, to that plaine hearted eſtate of ſimplicitie, in which the Devill found the man when he deceived him; and makes him meeke, humble, flexible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plaine hearted, without guile, free from Envie, like the ſtate of a little child; <hi>Except a man be borne againe, and become as a little child, he cannot enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; that is, into peace; The power of the Devill muſt firſt be caſt out, before Chriſt will appeare to ſit downe in reſt.</p>
               <p>This plaine hearted eſtate is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of; A man muſt firſt become a foole, that he he may be wiſe; that is, voide of guile, or hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall deceit, which the power of darkneſſe is full of; and theſe are the fooliſh things of the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God will deſtroy the imaginary wiſe.</p>
               <p>This plaine heartedneſſe without envie or guile, is the Virgine-ſtate of Mankinde; And this Virgine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100449:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is ſhe that muſt beare a ſonne, and call his name <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God with us.</p>
               <p>This chaſte Virgine-ſtate, that hath no outward Lover, and that is not defiled, but cleanſed from deformity, is this Virgine chaſte ſtate, in whom the Sonne of righteouſneſſe will ariſe, and take the man into union with himſelfe; he rules as King, and Mankinde, the living ſoule is freely ſubject with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>So that this Innocencie, or plaine heartedneſſe in man, was not an eſtate 6000. yeare agoe onely; But every branch of mankinde paſſes through it, &amp;c. firſt is defiled by imaginary covetouſneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is made a Devill; and then he is delivered from that darkneſſe, by Chriſt the reſtorer, and by him made one with the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>In one word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, the innocencie of mankinde, which is the Image of God, is plaine heartedneſſe without guile, quiet, patient, chaſt, loving, without envy: yet through weakneſſe is flexible, and open to temptation and change; This is the living ſoule, which God breathed the breath of life into; This is the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> it is the ſpirits houſe or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in the body of Mankinde the ſpirit hath many manſions or dwelling places; this is the field or heaven, wherein <hi>Michaell</hi> and the Dragon fights the great battell of God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Many men live in their innocencie longer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome are tempted ſooner then others, but all muſt be tempted, and tried by the evill one; that ſo way may be made for Chriſt to ſhew his power; for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100449:34"/>
the Office of Chriſt, the bleſſing, is to reſtore and deliver from death and bondage, and to ſet man downe in life and unchangeable reſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore temptations and falling from innocency muſt be, that ſo man may be drawne up into the life and ſtrength of the righteous God, or ruler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whom he ſhall never fall again; this is the myſterie of God, God manifeſt in the fleſh, or righteouſneſſe ruling King in man.</p>
               <p>So that this innocent eſtate is the Image of God, but not the ſtrength and life of God; It is wiſe, but not wiſdome it ſelfe; it is juſt but not juſtice; it is loving, but not Love it ſelfe. It rejoyces, but it is not Joy it ſelfe; It is patient, but not Patience it ſelfe; It is chaſte, yet not Chaſtity; It is plaine heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without guile, yet not ſincerity it ſelfe; It is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with reſt and peace, while he injoyes himſelfe within, and doth not make a league with Satan, or outward objects; for then he falls and meets with ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Therefore he is ſaid to be made in the Image of God, becauſe this Innocencie is an eſtate very good, and there is no evill in it; yet it is changeable, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be overcome by temptation.</p>
               <p>But now God, or the righteous ſpirit is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for he is Wiſdome, Juſtice, Love, Patience, Sincerity, Chaſtity, Joy, and Peace it ſelfe, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be overcome, by any temptation.</p>
               <p>And this is the myſterie and wiſdome of God, to let that innocent nature of man fall, and be defiled by his owne invention; that ſo, he may declare his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100449:34"/>
power, in redeeming him from that defilement, and in taking him up into unity of the God-head, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in that fountaine of Life and reſt, and never to be deceived againe; and this is a redemption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; not only to deliver from bondage, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to deſtroy the tempter; that he ſhall never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to draw man into bondage againe; this is the worke of the Lamb, and the myſterie of God.

                  </gap>es, which is the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or Dragon, that deceives the plaine hearted, ſimple man; making him to covet after content in objects without him, and to looke for a God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſo fills him with anger, envie, hypocriſie, vexation, griefe; and brings him into bondage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe. Now this curſe reignes in theſe three particulats.</p>
               <p>In the luſt of the Eye; In the luſt of the Fleſh, and in pride of Life.</p>
               <p>The luſt of the eye is covetouſneſſe, after any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100449:35"/>
the man ſees thinking within himſelfe, that if he can obtaine ſuch and ſuch objects, he ſhall be at reſt and filled with delight; And this is an unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied roving Luſt, and is a ſelfe-lover, hurting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for this Luſt of the eye, would draw all to it ſelfe; and leave all others naked; and when he cannot enjoy thoſe objects; Then Envie and anger ariſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vexes, frets and torments the man mightily; But if he obtains, he rejoyces; but his joy is the joy of envie, which doth periſh againe, and ends in vexation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Luſt of the fleſh; And this is an exceſſive, or immoderate degree of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which doth waſte and conſume the objects that his eye luſted after, not to preſerve mankinde, or his body, but to ſatisfie exceſſive Beaſtly deſire; he eates and drinks exceſſively; cloathes himſelfe vaine gloriouſly, or runnes into the immoderate uſe of women; And ſo thoſe objects which are for the preſervation and delight of Mankinde, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately uſes, and by his exceſſe, deſtroyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and them too.</p>
               <p>The third is the pride of Life, and this is the very height of covetouſneſſe, called vaine glory, or ſecret pride of heart, lifting up himſelfe above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, making others bow to him; looking upon himſelfe as a God above others, who indeed are his equalls, vexing and fretting, and ready to kill them if any refuſe to give him that honour he would have. <hi>Hamons</hi> proud heart is mightily troubled, if <hi>Mordecay</hi> will not bow, This is the pride of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100449:35"/>As <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſaid, is not this great <hi>Babell</hi> which I have built for the glory of my Majeſty? ſo lifting up himſelfe above others; this is the power of pride; But now humility ſtayes, and lets others lift him up.</p>
               <p>Looke through the whole body of darkneſſe and every branch of him may be applyed to one of theſe heads.</p>
               <p>And while theſe Luſts rule; the whole body of darkneſſe reignes as King in the man; As Envy, Pride, Covetouſneſſe, evill ſurmiſings, hypocriſie, uncleane luſt of the fleſh, Gluttony, Drunkenneſſe; And the man hath loſt his Innocencie, and is become a Devill; he is a priſoner to his luſts, and is in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage within himſelfe; he enjoys nothing with ſweet content.</p>
               <p>For let him have what he would have, ſtill he is unſatisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſcontent dwells in his heart upon every croſſe; he lives without God in the world, and feeds upon husks like the ſwyne: that is, his delight reaches to outward things only; to riches, honours, pleaſures, and women, they are the husks he feeds on, which dies and rots; take theſe away, and he hath loſt his Kingdome; And in this deceived eſtate, mankinde is a compleat Devill, and is become a very decree of himſelfe and others, as experience makes it appeare.</p>
               <p>The third eſtate of Mankinde, is the day of Chriſt, or the riſing up, and reigne of the bleſſing, which is the reſtoring power, delivering mankinde from this bondage of Luſt, and ſubduing this power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100449:36"/>
and drawing mankinde into union with the Father, making all things new, and ſo making peace.</p>
               <p>And this he doth, firſt, by bringing mankinde back againe, to his eſtate of Innocencie and plaine heartedneſſe, and ſo in the eye of the world is a foole, before he be made wiſe.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly he riſes up in power and glory, and makes man one with himſelfe, and ſets him downe in reſt never to fall againe.</p>

Now, no man hath, or can have true peace, till he be able to ſee this cleare diſtinction within himſelfe; he that ſees nothing but one power, nor never ſaw any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but one power in him, that man as yet is a ſlave to the Devill, But he that hath ſeene the two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to oppoſe each other within him, and then at laſt the bleſſing prevailes, and caſts the other murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out, and ſits downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rules King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Prince of Peace.

               <p>When a man ſees the darkneſſe rule in others, and in himſelfe; he ſees himſelfe in bondage, and is troubled; Now the Seed begins to ariſe, to bruiſe the Serpents head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lots</hi> righteous ſoule, or the pure Creation; man, as he is more or leſſe reſtored from bondage, he is grieved to ſee the bad converſation of the wicked power, as he rules in himſelfe and others; And there are many <hi>Lots</hi> at this day, whoſe righteous ſoule is grieved, to ſee how the Devill and curſe rules and deſtroyes the Earth. The Devill rules the world; Imaginary ſelfe-loving Covetouſneſſe rules the King in the Earth; It is ſeen plaine, and he goes on boldly without feare; hardneſſe of heart riſeth apace, proud murdering fleſh growes ſecure, though his Judgement be near at hand.</p>

               <p>Then the time of univerſall Biſhop, till reformed Epiſcopacy came in, this is the ſecond time; Then the time of reformed Epiſcopacie, till the variety of Independant and Presbyterian Churches, or State-Government came in; is the third time, and theſe two latter are called times.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>England</hi> is under the dividing of time, and it is a fore-runner to the reſt of the Nations, and this is the Image of the Beaſt; and this is the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Churches, and differences in Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Even ſo there are time, times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dividing of time within the heart of man, which is the occaſion of that outward diviſion of times.</p>
               <p>The firſt time is the ſtate of ſimple plaine heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, or Innocencie; when the five Sences acts in their owne light, which is the pure light of a Beaſt, but knowes not the power of the Seed, or of the creating ſpirit; but is a ſtranger to the ſpirit, and yet this ſtate is the Image of the ſpirit; for this is wiſe, and loving, and juſt,; but not Wiſdome Love,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100449:37"/>
and Juſtice it ſelfe; and being tempted, it breaks out into folly, envie, and unjuſtice, and this is the firſt time of the Beaſts reigne within a man.</p>
               <p>Then the pleaſure of ſinne enters, or a league is made betweene that living Earth and outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the man being deceived, lookes altogether without him for good, for pleaſure and for content, and followes all the pleaſures of his five Sences with greedineſſe; and here he would be a ruler, and ſome body over others; and in this eſtate man doth what he will, and his heart never ſmites him for it; he can lie, and cheat, and whore, and oppreſſe others, and thinks all is good, for nothing troubles him; this is the ſtate of prodigality or preſumption. And this is <hi>Eſau,</hi> the hairy mans Kingdome; And this is the firſt ſtep of his fall, eating the Aple.</p>
               <p>Then there followes a time of trouble of minde, ariſing for that pleaſure of ſelfe-ſeeking delight, and this is called trouble for miſpent time, whereby he meets with many rubs in his good name, in his health of body, and in his outward livelihood amongſt fellow-creatures, and now he begins to rebate of his wildneſſe and follow; and the Beaſt or ſenſitive power begins to be a little tamer, and more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; yet Covetouſneſſe (that Beaſt) reignes ſtill, and that with more force within, yet this is a cooler time of the day then the former was, for he begins to conſider what he doth; yet here is no reſt, and this is the third time, and ſo theſe two latter degrees makes times; this is the ſecond ſtep of his fall.</p>
               <p>Then comes in the dividing of time, within a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100449:38"/>
and this is, when the Law in the members fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of the minde; when a man ſees his folly and the bondage of his nature, he ſees himſelfe a priſoner to his Luſts, and this light in him ſtrives againſt darkneſſe in him; he ſees Pride ſtriveing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Humility, Envy againſt Love, contentedneſſe againſt anger, uncleanneſſe of fleſh againſt chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſorrow againſt comfort, and ſo cries out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death,</hi> or bondage to which I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well, this is the dividing of time within thee; this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the time of the battell within thee, between <hi>Michaell</hi> the Prince of Peace, and the red Dragon, the ſelfiſh, imaginary, covetous, murdering pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there is no quiet reſt in this eſtate neither; nay, this dividing of time is the ſharpeſt and hotteſt time.</p>
               <p>And now one ſtep further in the firſt degree of time, and then the man enters into reſt; And this is, when the Seed, or bleſſing in thee kills that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and caſts him out, and takes poſſeſſion of thee, and rules in righteouſneſſe in thee; for now all enemies are ſubdued under the Anoyntings feet, and he now delivers up the Kingdome to his Father, who is the one ſpirit of righteouſneſſe and peace, in whom there is no ſorrow; And this God, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ruler, becomes all in all, the alone King in that living Soule, or Earth; or the five living Sences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:100449:38"/>Now this ſpirit of freedome being riſing up in ſome already, in part, aſſures the Creation, and gives thoſe bodies as pledges, that he will riſe up in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus thoſe three particulars in mankinde is conſidered; firſt, the pure creation of the Living ſoule; the ſingle life of the five Sences, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Earth. <hi>Oh Earth, Earth, Earth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the curſe that hath taken mankinde, or this living Earth priſoner; and this is the power of darkneſſe, called ſinne or bondage, and this is called likewiſe fleſh, or carnall man; <hi>If you by the Spirit mortiſie the deeds of the fleſh you ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the created fleſh is not to be mortified, or killed by us, but preſerved; therefore the curſe therein is called fleſh, and deeds of the fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a meere ſelfiſh power, that would have eaſe, and honour, and would be counted a God, and would rule over all, to the enſlaving of all to himſelfe; this is the reprobate, that ſhall have no peace, for all peace ſhall be taken from this fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the bleſſing, who is the ſeed of Life, or Chriſt, the righteous and rationall ſpirit; ariſing up to rule, and treading unreaſonableneſſe under his feet, this is the reſtorer, or Saviour of the captived, or the impriſoned Earth, which ſets mankinde free from bondage within himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And when this power riſeth up to rule, he doth not rule to enſlave others to him by the murthering ſword, but he drawes all men in Love to him; and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100449:39"/>
the union and communion of Love by him is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, in, and among the Creation.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee there are time, times, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of time within the heart; and though you become to the dividing of time, yet you are not come to the Mount of God, to true reſt, till dividing of time run his courſe likewiſe.</p>
               <p>But yet here is great comfort to burdened ſoules, that lies groning under the darkneſſe of this divide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time within them, and that are mightily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by men that rules in darkneſſe, and oppreſſion over them; To you I ſay rejoyce, your Redeemer is come, he rides upon the clouds, and he will ſpeedily appeare for your deliverance, as he hath done for ſome of your brethren already, who are witneſſes, that he is riſing and ſpreading himſelfe in the Earth, caſting out death, hell, and bondage, and eſtabliſhing life, peace, and liberty in mankinde, and in the whole creation.</p>
               <p>Therefore whatſoever your condition is, murmur not at it, but waite, he that is come to others will come to you, and not tarrie; His power and name is Love, and he will conquer all by Love and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And the ſonnes of ſtrangers and enemies ſhall come and fall downe to him, and ſay, thou art the alone, righteous power; take thee our Crownes, Scepters, Swords, doe thou rule, for thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.</p>
               <p>This is the day of Sions glorie; This is the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, that is unquenchable; this is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull day of the Lord; this is the Lambe that was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100449:39"/>
ſlave, and is now riſen againe; This is the well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſonne of the Father, in whom he delights; This is the promiſed Seed, the bleſſing of the whole Earth, who hath been hinted at, and pointed at by Prophecie, but never fully manifeſted in the whole creation.</p>
               <p>But now he begins to appeare, to draw all men after him, to caſt out the curſe, and to ſet the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in peace; therefore thou weeping ſoule, caſt off this ſackcloth, and mourning weeds, thy redeemer is come, and he calls thee to follow him, acting love and patience.</p>
               <p>This power of Chriſt takes away all peace from the fleſh, and will not ſuffer any part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lie under a falſe peace any longer; And we ſee that while he appeares but weakly, how the peace of covetous fleſh is diſturbed, and filled with much murmuring againſt the Light.</p>
               <p>Oh ſay men, if this power of univerſall love be advanced; this will deſtroy all propriety, and all trading, and bring every thing into confuſion. It is true, he ſhall be advanced for that end, to confound the wiſdome and power, and peace of the fleſh, that the Creation may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Oh ſaith Imaginary, covetous, proud, ſelfe-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fleſh; If I take not the ſword, to reſtraine the unrulineſſe of mankinde; we ſhall not live one by another; But his intent is not in Love to peace, but that he may rule over all himſelfe, and beat downe

               <p>BVt how came mans fall in at the firſt? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The outward objects of riches, honors, being ſet before the living ſoule, Imaginary cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſeſſe, which is the abſence of the true Light, moves the man to cloſe with thoſe objects, and to ſeeke content without him; and through this darke night power, warres, diviſions, and diſcontent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes in mankinde, to teare and devoure it ſelfe; and ſo it is ſaid to mankinde, that his deſtruction is of himſelfe; And the miſery of mankinde came in by theſe degrees.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when whole mankinde walked in ſingleneſſe and ſimplicity each to other; Some bodies were more ſtrong then others, as the elder brother was ſtronger then the younger, and the ſtronger did work for the weaker, and the whole Earth was common to all without exception; But this ſingleneſſe and ſimplicity was ſubject to corruption and change; And the change came in thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100449:40"/>The ſtronger, or elder brother ſeeing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objects before him, thereupon imagines, and ſaith, why ſhould I that doe all the worke, be ſuch a ſervant to theſe that doe leaſt worke, and be equall with them? It is fit I ſhould have ſome larger part of the Earth then they, and be in ſome more eſteeme then others, and that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me in ſome degree above them.</p>
               <p>This Imagination is the Serpent that deceives the man; and as luſt is thus conceived within, and the heart, or the living Soule conſenting to theſe imaginary inventions, preſently death is brought forth, and Mankinde falls from ſingle ſimplicity to be full of diviſions, and one member of Mankinde is ſeparated from another, which before were all one, and looked upon each other as all one.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt ſtep of the fall, conſent within being moved by outward objects of pleaſure, riches, and honour for one to be above another; whereas it was the honour of the elder to help the younger, and not to tread him downe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it breaks forth into outward action; for this imaginary invention, in the elder brother moves him to ſet about, to incloſe parcells of the Earth into ſeverall diviſions, and calls thoſe inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures proper or peculiar to himſelfe, and that the younger, or weaker brother ſhould lay no claime to it, and the younger brother lets it goe ſo; and preſently their nakedneſſe appeares, that is, the imaginary covetouſneſſe of the heart is uncovered, and ſaid open to the view hereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100449:41"/>This dividing of the Earth into parcells, was long before it grew a ſtrong ſetled cuſtome; for plaine heartedneſſe did much oppoſe the growth of this imaginary covetouſneſſe, or Serpent; for when contention began to ariſe amongſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and <hi>Lots,</hi> about the Earth; one ſide would have ſo much, and the other ſide ſo much; Well, ſaid ſingle hearted <hi>Abraham,</hi> let there be no ſtrife betweene us, for we are brethren; Let us ſpread farther; and ſo the one went Eaſt, and the other Weſt, and gave more roome in the Earth each to other, and then they were quiet; this is the firſt breaking forth into action, to make diviſion.</p>
               <p>Then next to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mankinde began to buy and ſell theſe incloſures of Land, one of another, which the creating ſpirit of righteouſneſſe gave them no command to doe; for by reaſon of this bargaining, the younger, or weaker brother is more forcibly ſhut out of the Earth, and ſo here is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſteale the Earth by craft, and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another by the ſword.</p>

               <p>And by this murdering power, over-awing one another, the cheating Art of buying and ſelling, and of dividing the Land into parcells, prevailes amongſt mankinde; till at laſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was raiſed, who was the perfecteſt man in his time, and he ſeeing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde was run into this diviſion.</p>
               <p>He endeavors to keep peace, and to prevent war and bloodſhed, he makes a Law, wherein there was much equity betweene man and man, called ten Commandements, wherein every man is limited in his owne propriety; ſo that if another coveted his Neighbours wife, Land, houſe, or ſervant, it was his ſinne, and was to be accurſed or puniſhed, by a generall conſent of all the people; And they all ſaid Amen to this Law; and ſaid they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and doe it.</p>
               <p>Yet ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> though this be a Law, ſetling peace for the preſent; yet I am not he that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore you to your firſt ſingleneſſe and Innocencie; for a Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up like me, that ſhall doe that reſtoring worke; and him

ſhall you heare; and he ſhall deliver <hi>Jacob</hi> from his ſinne, and Iſraell from his tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>And here he points out Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is the power of univerſall Love; and tells them that whoſoever will not heare the voyce of that reſtoring Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be cut off from amongſt the people.</p>
               <p>And yet this buying and ſelling, and <hi>Moſes</hi> Law of equity to preſerve peace, was part of the fall, for it could not keep them in peace together, but ſtill mankinde did moleſt one another, and riſe higher in diviſions, and ſell to further contention, Covetouſneſſe, and Pride amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſtronger brother goes further in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ambitious invention, and makes warre againſt the younger, or weaker brother, and takes their incloſures by force from them; and either kills them or turnes them out of the Land, which they had beſtowed labour upon; and ſo did break <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law, which ſaid, thou ſhall not kill, thou ſhalt not ſteale.</p>
               <p>And now diviſions, and enmity is riſen to the height, and the power of the Sword is the very ſtrength of the curſe, and is the murderer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this takes not away propriety from others, by labour, or by buying and ſelling; but by cruell violence and force, caſting downe one, ſetting up another by force, and now Mankinde is in the extremity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</p>
               <p>And they that enjoy the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they or their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers got it by the Sword, and they keep poſſeſſion

               <p>This power of the ſword doth not only kill and rob, but by his Lawes made and upheld by his

               <p>They that have the greateſt power of the ſword in their hands, doe kill, and take away the labours of others, and ſay it is righteous; but if a weaker hand doth but take from others to ſupplie neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the other calls this unrighteous, and hangs them for it; ſurely the King of righteouſneſſe is not ſo partiall a God, as to call one and the ſame action good in his hand, that is the ſtronger and bad, in his hand that is the weaker brother.</p>
               <p>No, no; This is the righteouſneſſe of the man of ſinne; this is the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and <hi>Iudas,</hi> that counts every thing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that pleaſes them, and every thing unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that diſpleaſes them; This is the extremity of the curſe, and yet this is the Law that every one, now adayes dotes upon; when the plaine truth is, the Law of propriety is the ſhamefull nakedneſſe of Mankinde, and as farre from the Law of Chriſt, as light from darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>And yet Souldiers and Lawyers, and all that crie up this power of propriety, which is both brought in, and upheld by the murdering ſword, would be called Saints and members of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Truly you are all deceived, you are members and actors of the curſe, which is the deſtruction and bondage of the Creation; you are that power

that hedges ſome into the Earth, and hedges others out, and takes to your ſelves by the power of the killing ſword; A liberty to rule over the labours and perſons of your fellow-creatures, who are fleſh of your fleſh, and bone of your bone; And you doe the very ſame things, in a higher degree and nature, for which you hang other men for, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others for ſuch actions as you call ſinne, and yet you live in the daily action your ſelves; taking the Earth from the weaker brother, and ſo killing him by poverty or priſon all day long.</p>

               <p>And all the ſtrivings that is in Mankinde, is for the Earth, who ſhall have it; whether ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons ſhall have it, and the reſt have none, or whether the Earth ſhall be a common treaſury to all without reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p>And this is the battell, that is fought between the two powers, which is propriety on the one hand, called the Devill, or covetouſneſſe, or community on the other hand, called Chriſt, or univerſall Love. And as Chriſt doth caſt covetouſneſſe out of the heart, ſo propriety is caſt out from amongſt men, and mankinde will not only become ſingle hearted againe, but will walke in the light of pure Reaſon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100449:44"/>
and Love, and never fall againe into diviſions, but ſhall be ſo acquainted with the wyles of Satan, that he ſhall utterly reject, and abhor his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inticement; As Jeſus Chriſt rejected the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of objects; And that Satan, or tempter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prevailed not, becauſe the Anoynting was in him, that was ſtronger then fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now this ſame power in man, that cauſes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and war is called by ſome men the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which every man brings into the world with him.</p>
               <p>But this Law of darkneſſe in the members is not the ſtate of Nature; for nature, or the living ſoule is in bondage to it, and grones under it, waiting to be delivered from it, and is glad to heare of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>Looke upon a childe that is new borne, or till he growes up to ſome few yeares, he is innocent, harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, humble, patient, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, not envious; And this is <hi>Adam,</hi> or mankinde in his Innocency; and this continues till outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects intice him to pleaſure or ſeeke content without him; And when he conſents, or ſuffers the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Covetouſneſſe within to cloſe with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

               <p>Firſt, into the ſlavery of that power of luſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, leading him forth to act all manner of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with greedineſſe to the deſtruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:100449:44"/>And then falls from this delight into trouble of minde, and touch of Conſcience, and inward tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo falls deeper and deeper into Hell, till the Seed or bleſſing riſe up in him to worke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and then carrie him back againe, and lead him into the wayes of truth.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee how mankinde came to fall from his innocencie; and that was by cloſing to outward objects for content, with inward imaginary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, to finde life in thoſe objects without him.</p>
               <p>And mans recovery will be to reject outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and to cloſe with the ſpirit of truth, life, and peace within, preferring this Kingdome within, before the outward Kingdome.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that Chriſt was tempted in all things, like as we are tempted. Now how are we tempted? but by preſentment of outward objects before us, and when the life of the five Sences cloſes therewith, thinking to finde content therefrom, we are deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo fall from innocencie.</p>
               <p>As for example, if objects of riches be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and my inward covetouſneſſe cloſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I fall; or if the beauty of the female ſex be ſet before me, If my inward luſt cloſe therewith exceſſively, running after variety of ſtrange fleſh, I fall.</p>
               <p>But if covetouſneſſe and luſt be killed, or doth not breath in me, then, though thoſe objects be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to me, I reject them; and ſo I fall not; And
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100449:45"/>
now Satan or the tempter, which are the outward objects finds nothing in me.</p>
               <p>And thus it was ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, that when the Tempter came to him he found nothing in him, that is, Jeſus Chriſt had not an imaginary cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous power in him, to ſeeke a Kingdome, or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without himſelfe, in thoſe objects of pleaſure, riches, and honours of the world, but preferred the Kingdome within him before that without him.</p>
               <p>And ſo he was ſaid to have no ſinne, becauſe there was nothing in him that conſented to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation without; he made uſe of outward objects in moderation, for the ſafety and peace of his body, but deſired nothing in exceſſe, or immoderately.</p>
               <p>The power of darkneſſe which is Covetouſneſſe, and Imagination which is the devouring Dragon, had no place in Heaven, that is, in him; for the Dragon was caſt out, and the Godhead did dwell bodily in him, in the fulneſſe of righteouſneſſe and peace.</p>
               <p>Now I deſire any man to ſhew by experience, any other Devill, or darke power, then theſe two, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The objects without, and the powers of the curſe within, joyning in conſent together, to enſlave the Earth, or the living Soule, which is the innocencie of the five Sences.</p>
               <p>While theſe two joyne together, and meet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Mankinde enters into ſorrow, and hath true reſt.</p>
               <p>But when the power of Luſt is killed within, by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100449:45"/>
the bleſſing, or the ſeed riſing up, then outward objects troubles not, nor enſlaves the man. For then a man is content with his preſent condition, and ſeeks for a Kingdome within, which moth and ruſt cannot corrupt, nor theeves breake through and ſteale; If he have riches, he dotes not upon them, he knowes not how to uſe them; If he be poore, he is quiet and content; If he be at liberty he is content, if in priſon he is content.</p>
               <p>So then kill Covetouſneſſe, or that imaginary darkneſſe within; And the Devill is kill'd when the Tempter comes, he ſhall finde nothing in you; he that is free within, is moved to exceſſe, or unrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall action by no outward object; but he that is nor free within, is moved by every object.</p>
               <p>And this is the Reaſon why many people are ſo angry, and bitter, and flies upon their neighbours with reviling, and reproachfull words, or envious actions, becauſe they are ſlaves to their fleſh; they are in bondage within, they know not liberty; It is the night time with them, the ſonne of Love, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and peace is not yet riſen up in them.</p>
               <p>Therefore they that are at liberty within, in whom the Seed is riſen ro rule, doe conquer all enemies by Love and patience, and make uſe of any outward object with moderation, and knows no exceſſe.</p>
               <p>The powers of the curſe, he ſubdues others by the murdering ſword, and thereby enſlaves others to him; as we ſee the government of all Nations
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100449:46"/>
is this, and the darke power in every mans heart is this; which indeed is the Devills Kingdome that yet rules.</p>
               <p>But now the bleſſing, he ſubdues his enemies by Love, and ſaves, and gives life and freedome to his enemies; he firſt brings mankinde back to pure cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and then riſes up, and rules King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe within, and ſo keeps the man, that the curſe never enſlaves him againe, and ſo he puts the man into a better condition then he was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>This Seed or Chriſt then is to be ſeen within, to ſave you from the curſe within, to free you from bondage within; he is no Saviour that ſtands at a diſtance; therefore your publick Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witches you, by telling you of a Saviour at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>The enmity which bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore your Saviour muſt be a power within you, to deliver you from that bondage within; the outward Chriſt, or the outward God, are but men Saviours, ſuch as <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua,</hi> and Judges were, and ſuch as Kings are, and theſe Gods ſometimes proves Devills. Surely ſuch Preachers as tells you your God and Saviour is without, they know not the ſpirit, they are ſervants to the curſe, their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100449:46"/>
Kingdome is all without, and therefore would have you to ſeeke for a Kingdome without that lies in objects; for that Kingdome of Chriſt within they know not.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall end with this queſtion. What are the greateſt ſinnes in the world? I anſwer. Theſe two; Firſt for a man to lock up the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Earth in Cheſts and houſes; and ſuffer it to ruſt or moulder, while others ſtarve for want to whom it belongs, and it belongs to all; This is the greateſt ſinne againſt univerſall Love; this is the deſtroying ſinne, this is <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne; this is the action of Covetouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſinne is like to this, and is the ſame in nature with the other; And this is for any man, or men, firſt to take the Earth by the power of the murdering ſword from others; and then by the Lawes of their owne making, doe hang, or put to death any who takes the fruits of the Earth to ſupply his neceſſaries, from places or perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where there is more then can be made uſe of by that particular family, where it is hoorded up.</p>
