         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>OUR Traveller without doubt will fruſtrate the expectation of ſom, in not giving a more ample account of every Countrey he has ſeen, by an accurate noting down of the Religion, Politie, particular Rites and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants, nor making a further ſcrutiny as to the Antiquity and Original Deſcent and Offſpring of the People as ſom have don. 'Tis undeniably ſo, for I find him more buſy in recording
<pb facs="tcp:33105:3"/>
the circumſtances of his own perſonal condition, and what befell him in remote Places, than remarking the State and Quality of the Land and People, nor do I hold it conſiſtent with the Duty of him that would be a faithfull Interpreter to do that Office for him; notwithſtanding the Freedom ſom has aſſumed in another Language (or ſhall I ſay, Another Work) to leav out more than 70 intire Paragraphs, in ſeveral places thrô the Book, and ſupplied the vacancy by tranſcribing out of other Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which I am confident is not to be found either in the Authors Autograph, or Printed Copy.</p>
            <p>THE Gentleman's reaſon, I conceiv, was becauſe the Matter of what he thought good to ommit was not ſo ſolid, containing ſom homely Paſſages not to be taken notice of, and conſequently would not endure ſuch ſoaring Language, as things more ſublime and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant would, for, <hi>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius.</hi> Nor had it bin leſs warrantable for me to have don the like, and tacitly to have paſſed over ſuch humble Matter as would rather challenge an expreſſion of homely Sentences than feſtivity of Style, which the friendly Reader will find I'me no where guilty of.</p>
            <p>THIS Journal, I am bound to ſay (notwithſtanding the main Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages our Author wanted, both in Eſtate and Parts, which you'l readily inferr no Traveller ought to be without, that would bring his Obſervations upon the public Theater of the World) have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs found a gremious entertainment amongſt all ſorts of Men, being already publiſhed in ſeveral Languages: nor can I find any reaſon to fear, but, as it is for a more univerſal Peruſal taught to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> 'twill be as acceptable to our own Nation, as it has bin abroad in other Countreys, where they are in general more inclined to read Fictions and Fables, than true Philology, and ſuch as may juſtly be convinced by that of an obſcene, but witty <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>OBSCENE indeed incluſivly, but juſtifiable enough in this, for, as the great <hi>Caſaubon</hi> in his modeſt Anſwer to the Epiſtle of Cardinal <hi>Du Perron</hi> ſaith, <hi>E felle mero mel merum interdum exiſtit,</hi> ſo there is nothing ſo corrupt or putrid, but that ſomthing ſound may be extracted from it.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY the Diſcrepance of Mens Fancies muſt be notedly great, if the Price and Peruſal of this ſmall Volum ſhould ſeem too great and laborious to the Buyer and Reader, which has coſt the Author ſo much Time and Pains in Travail, for the greateſt part of Six and Twenty years, during which time he has bin attended with continual Perils on the one hand and unſpeakable Sufferings on the other: by Land in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Jeopardy of his Perſon for Robbers, Cannibals, Ravenous and venemous Animals; by Sea for Pyrats, Shipwracks, &amp;c. and by both, ſubject to Hunger, Thirſt, Scorching Heats, Colds, Sickneſs, and other unavoidable Extremities and gravaminous Solitudes; beſides the lamentable Condition of Slavery, in which I found him both among <hi>Turks, Tartars</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> yet after all returned home in ſafety, and at this preſent here in <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>IT is a thing no leſs cuſtomary than unmannerly among ſom, who will hold all things for forged and falſe, except what themſelvs ſee, and would have all themſelvs ſay to be received for Oracles.

            <p>THE firſt Voyage perhaps may not affoard ſuch ſatisfaction as ſom will expect, and by conſequence give the Reader no Appetite to go forward; but he whoſe leiſure will permit him to go forward, will in the 2d and 3d Voyages find amends for what is defectiv in the firſt.</p>
            <p>IT was intended alſo to publiſh his 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Voyage with this, which has not as yet bin printed in any Language, but finding the Authors leiſure not anſwerable to thoſe Intentions, we ſhall deferr it for the next Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if this prove but ſo acceptable, as to give occaſion for another: which we know is not uſual with Books of this nature, that ſerv no more than for once reading, and not for a dayly recourſe.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt Voyage we find him imbarqued for <hi>Genoa</hi> in a new Ship, which, with another, was built for that State at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in the year 1647. From <hi>Genoa</hi> he went to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where by the way he gives a very exact Deſcription of the <hi>Salt-Iſlands, Sierra Liones, Madagaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, Syam,</hi> (with the moſt horrible Maſſacre committed upon the greateſt Perſonages in that Kingdom) then proceeds on his Voyage for <hi>Iapan,</hi> where he gives you an account of that Iſland and <hi>Formoſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the ſecond the moſt remarkable is the Ingagement between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> by Sea, in which the former fought a ſignal Victory. In this Voyage I alſo find a very accurate Deſcription of the <hi>Greek</hi> Iſlands, as they are now peopled, with ſeveral Footſteps of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>IN the third, and laſt as yet extant, he goes to <hi>Moſcovia</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Czar</hi> aboard a new Ship which was built on the <hi>Wolga,</hi> whereby
<pb facs="tcp:33105:5"/>
the way he gives you a Deſcription of <hi>Lifeland</hi> and its Inhabitants, as alſo <hi>Moſcovia</hi> and the Imperial City <hi>Moſcou</hi>; then proceeding forward he comes at laſt to the <hi>Wolga,</hi> where ſetting ſail for <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> notes punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally what every day occurred. Arriving there he gives you an account of the Inſurrection and Proceeding of the <hi>Coſac</hi>-Rebels, and the occaſion why he and his Company fled over the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea; with the great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they ſuffered till they got aſhoar, where beſides many cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made Slaves by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in which condition he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till he was redeemed by order of the Governour and Council for the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company at <hi>Batavia,</hi> whither he travailed thrô <hi>Perſia,</hi> and being by order of the ſaid Company ſent home aboard the Ship <hi>Europa,</hi> which was taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars; he himſelf was ſent for <hi>Ireland</hi> with about 300 more of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Where arriving imbarques himſelf for <hi>England,</hi> and ſo home.</p>

to that end put me out to a Sail-maker.<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Set ſail from <hi>Texel.</hi>
                  </note>My Father, whoſe Rigour was ſomewhat more than tolerable, was never remiſs in reprehending me for any noted Vice; ſo that for ſome bad deportment he once took occaſion to Chaſtiſe me, and that with ſuch ſeverity, that I reſolved to take my leave both of him, and my native Land. At that time there were two Ships fitted out, and bound for <hi>Genua</hi>: the one was called, The St. <hi>John Baptiſt, Henry Chriſtanſz.</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Maſter, the other, The <hi>St. Bernard, Iohn Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of <hi>VVeſep</hi> Vice-Commander, and <hi>Herman Voogd</hi> of <hi>Schiedam</hi> Maſter; Over both theſe Ships was Mr. <hi>Iohn Maas</hi> of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> as Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Commander. The former was mounted with 28 Guns, the latter carried 26. I hired my ſelf aboard the St. <hi>I. Baptiſt</hi> for Under-Sailmaker, being then about 17 years old, never troubling my ſelf either whither we were bound, or how long we were to be out.</p>
               <p>On the 26 of <hi>December</hi> 1647. By Gods good Conduct, we ſet Sail, from the <hi>Texel,</hi> but were hardly got without the <hi>Gaats,</hi> ere we found that our Ships were not duly poiz'd, and thereupon were fain to Tack about, and put in at the <hi>Texel</hi> again, where we unloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part of the Ships-burthen, and took in a conſiderable quantity of Pewter, ſome Boxes of Quickſilver, and other ponderous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, to Ballaſt us well at the Keel; which when we had done and all ready, we ſet out the ſecond time, that was upon the 4 day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">January, 1648.</note> 1648, and with a brave Wind, we paſſed the <hi>Spaniards Gat,</hi> driven with ſome Shoals of Ice (it being then Froſty weather) Seawards.</p>
               <p>On the 10 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> we were forced by a contrary wind to put in at the <hi>Downs</hi>; where after two days aboad, we weighed anchor, having both Wind and Weather favourable. But ſoon after by a

                     <hi>FEBR. 1648.</hi> Storm at Sea.</note> we were forced again to put into ſome other Harbour; which we did at the Iſle of <hi>VVight,</hi> &amp; there we ſtay'd till the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> when the Weather began to grow more moderate, and the high Winds abated.</p>
               <p>Under hopes that this good Weather would continue we fet ſail, but were no ſooner out of the Bay, before the Weather changed, and we now the third time forc'd to look out for a Harbour.</p>
               <p>On the 6 of <hi>February</hi> we came to Anchor at <hi>Portland,</hi> where we road three days, and then ſet ſail directly for the Bay of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> where we arrived on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that moneth. The next day with a brisk gale we entred the Straits, and with a conſtant and favourable wind, made <hi>Genua</hi> in 15 days, where arriving we dropp'd Anchor behind the Mold.</p>
               <p>On the 32<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we got <hi>Prattica,</hi>

The Ships, as we ſaid before, were ſold to the Duke of <hi>Genua,</hi> which he furniſhed with Proviſion of Victuals, Powder, Shot and other Ammunition, for 2 years. Aboard each Ship were a Hundred <hi>Dutch</hi> taken into ſervice, the reſt for the moſt part <hi>Italians,</hi> amongſt which were a few of the <hi>Banditti.</hi> Here I hired my ſelf for Upper-Sailma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and had 18 Livers <hi>per</hi> Moneth; although neither I, nor any elſe that went before the Maſt, knew whither, or upon what Deſign.</p>
               <p>Having now regain'd my liberty, I long'd to ſatisfy my curioſity in taking a view of the Town, with what elſe was worthy of remark. <hi>Genua</hi> is ſeated on the Sea ſide,<note place="margin">Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Genua.</hi>

The Dukes Perſon is guarded with a Body of 500 Soldiers, who with their Colonel have a place allotted them in the Palace. The City is generally well built with ſtately Houſes and magnificent Structures, more eſpecially on that ſide which is ſeated near the Sea: having beſides the more eminent Hoſtels and Public Buildings, 30 fair Pariſh Churches, of which that dedicated to St. <hi>Laurence</hi> claims the priority, as Cathedral.

The Iſland is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt round in circumference, having its breadth and length almoſt equal, and is full of ſmall Capes or Promontories, which make ſo many Inlets. The common Road belonging to this Iſland, is on the South-weſt Coaſt, where you have 15 and 16 fathom Water, and a ſandy ground; having the Weſtern point of the Iſland at N. and by W. and another Point at E.

On the North ſide of the Iſland, behind a litle black Cape, lies a ſmall Bay, or Road for Anchorage, at 5 or 6 fathom water, and upon the loweſt point, on the Eaſt, is a Village of 10 or 12 houſes. This Iſland is very rocky, high and dry, having litle graſs upon it but what grows in the clefts of the Rocks. It is alſo very barren of Fruit, neither Lemmons nor Oranges will like there; nor no other fruit whatſoever, unles ſigs, and thoſe, by reaſon of the drought of the Seaſon and Ground, ſeldom ever come to maturity, or return to profit.

               <p>On the 3 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we arrived in the Bay of <hi>Sierra Liones.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon our arriving there, the Commander ſent the Shallop aſhoar, and ſuch perſons as he did think fit, with Preſents for the King, which were 5 Barrs of Iron, a Barrel of Brandy, and another of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men that were nominated to deliver the Preſents, were courteouſly received by the King and his Court. We could not perceive any Mark of Superiority, or Grandour in the Prince, which might diſtinguiſh him from his Subjects, no more than in Mr. Mayor of <hi>Stratford,</hi> from his Worſhipfull Brethren, the Aldermen. Yet found him much to vary from ſome other Soveraign Potentates who enrich themſelves at the Coſt and Penury of their Vaſſals. The King and his Folk were equally inſatiable and covetous; for ſo ſoon as the King had received the Preſent, he deſired as much more, which the Commander was content to ſend him, that he might have the freedom to take in Water, and Wood for Fewel, as alſo to provide our ſelves with Oranges, Lemmons, and other Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Inhabitants, which are called <hi>Caffers,</hi> ſhew'd us no ſmall Friendſhip; for, ſo long as our <hi>Penny</hi> laſted, they never faild of a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> bringing us every day good ſtore of Fruit. When the King had received the double Preſent, he inſiſted upon twice as much more, before he would admitt of our coming aſhoar. This great incivility ſo inraged the Commander, that he reſolved to be revenged upon him; and purſuant thereto ſent the Long-boat aſhoar to entreat him to come aboard, where he ſhould receive what his King ſhip deſired.

But his Retinue being too numerous, the Commander having regard to our ſafety, would not permit above 5 or 6 to come aboard. The King was no ſooner got aboard, but he ran in all haſt to the Great Cabin, in hopes of ſome ample Gift; but much miſtaken,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sierra Liones</hi> fettered, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> for the Commander gave order that he ſhould be fetter'd, which was accordingly done, and 4 men appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attend him. The King was hereat mainly altered, but afterward much more, when he ſaw the Commander in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hang him at the Yards arm, which had certainly been had not the Maſter of the Ship undertaken the Office of a Mediator upon him, and made interceſſion for his Life. The Commanders wrath thus pacified, he gave order to throw him over board, which was immediately obey'd and executed, by 4 of the Ships Company, who threw him out at the Fore-caſtle Port; But he was ſo well diſciplin'd in ſwimming, that he preſently got aſhoar. His Retinue ſeeing that, with all the haſt they could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves immediatly to their Canoes,<note place="margin">The houſes of the <hi>Caffers</hi> pillaged; and their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards Spoil'd.</note> and made as if they would do ſome prodigious Feat, or other; or at leſt obſtruct our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhoar, to take in what was neceſſary. The Commander, whoſe temper was too couragious, to be daunted for a ſwarm of Flies, ſent two Boats aſhoar to fetch Water and Wood, both well Man'd and Arm'd, and in ſpite of all their Force, hew'd as much Wood, and brought as much Water, as they thought might ſerve our turn, The Commander notwithſtanding all this, was not yet content, but remanded the men and Shallops to pillage their Houſes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and ſet the Kings Neger-houſe on fire; all which they did in a moment. The King ſeeing this, thought it high time to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a poſture of Defence; and in order to that, muſters up all the Forces he could on a ſudden, the whole Countrey being Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and appear'd with a number of a Thouſand Canoes, or more, half of each being loaden with Faggots, whether to ſet our Ships on fire, or to uſe them for Shields, we could not determine: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever having obtained our ends, we held it beſt to weigh Anchor, and proceed on our Voyage, rather than to incurr a needleſs &amp; unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ingagement, with a Company of ſuch contemptible Schoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels.

               <p>When any Perſon comes to die, the neareſt Friends and Allies,<note place="margin">Their Funerals</note> do bath the Corps; and then adorned with Bracelets and Ear-rings, and wrapt in fine cloaths, is carried in a Mat to the place of burial. But the Funeral Rites of Perſons of the higheſt rank are performed with greater pomp; for when one of ſuch Quality dies, he is alſo bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after that manner as we have already ſaid; which done they ſhave him, and if it be a Woman put a hood upon her head, and adorn her with precious ornaments. Then come in the neareſt Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as Father, Mother and others of the Conſanguinity, with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Children and Slaves, to bewail the Dead, making a lamentable howling and yelling, the tears trickling down the Cheeks.

When they have deplored the Departure of their Friend, and danc'd the whole day, they kill a Fatling or two, which is diſtributed among his Relations in the Evening. So long as the Corps is above ground they burn light by it; and when they are ready to interr him, they cloſe him in a Coffin made of the Trunk of a Tree which is fitly ſhut up, and carried to a litle Cottage made on purpoſe, in the midle whereof is a Grave about 6 foot deep, here they lay him, and ſet by his ſide a Basket of Rice, a Tobacco-box, an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Pan, a Chaffin-diſh; a ſuit of Apparrel, a Girdle, with what other things they conceive he ſhall have occaſion for, in ſuch a long and tedious Journey.

               <p>Of all the Idolatrous Cuſtoms that I could obſerve among them, there is ſome Nation or other that hath parity with them; But one Barbarous and inhuman Practiſe they have, as peculiar and proper to themſelves, that is, making away of their own Children. True it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33105:23"/>
that in moſt places in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Tartary,</hi> they make merchandiſe of their Children, and that by reaſon of their not being in a capacity of bringing them up, but never (like thoſe of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi>) take away their lives. This they are induced to by an implicit Faith, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by their Prieſts, that they are born upon unhappy days, and ſhall be ſubject to great miſery and afflictions ſo long as they live; or that the Planet under which the Child is born, has ſome bad influence upon it; and having view'd the Palms of his hands, and his Face, make concluſion that he will be either Thief, or Parricide, &amp;c. Upon theſe and the like Occaſions, they deliver the Child over to a Slave, which he is to carry out of the way, and throw it into a Ditch or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Thorn-hedge, where the poor Infant muſt either die of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or be devoured up of Dogs, or other Beaſts of Prey. Others there are among thoſe Women, who when they are with Child if they find themſelves never ſo litle out of order, immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcribe the cauſe to the ill Nature of the unborn Babe, and either kill it before it come into the World, or ſo ſoon as it is born bury it alive, and ſometimes throw it into the Water. If a Woman ſlave chance to prove with Child by her Patron, and be turned away; ſo that ſhe be not able to bring it up, ſhe either ſtrangles, or diſpatches it before it come into the World: and ſometimes a white Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having a Child by a Negro, if ſhe ſee it reſemble the Father, or have curl'd hair: as alſo their Young-women, who make themſelves proſtitute for Gain, follow the like Courſe, but commonly murther the Infant before it be born, deeming it but a burthen to them, and a hindrance of their Profeſſion. But beſides all theſe inhuman Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms they have another no whit inferiour to thoſe already ſaid, that when the woman dies in Child-bed, the Child is thrown alive with the Mother into the Grave, ſaying. <hi>Better it is that the Child dies, than to be brought up by ſtrangers.</hi> And becauſe ſo many days are by them held infortunate, almoſt half of the Children are diſpatch'd, which with other occaſions already mentioned, is undoubtedly the reaſon that this great, happy and moſt fruitfull Iſland is not very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, where not only Polygamy is allow'd, but alſo ſuch freedom given to the unmarried to ſatisfy their luſt, and libidinous ends. Yet certain it is that there is a Stock of people among them, who are more compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate with their Young, and when they preſume that the Child is ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33105:23"/>
poſſeſſed, do only cauſe a Slave to carry it away and hide it a while, and ſoon after fetch it home again: aſſoon as they have got it home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they Sacrifice ſome beaſt, or Fowl, or perhaps ſhut it up in a Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooſt, thinking thereby to aſſwage and moderate the ill temper of the childs ſpirit, which otherwiſe would lead him to ſome unhappy end.</p>
               <p>The Religion of the <hi>Madagaſcars,</hi> is hardly worth recounting,<note place="margin">Their Religion</note> they being wholly Strangers both to Houſes of Worſhip, and alſo to Prayer. They beleeve that there is a God who hath made both Heaven and Earth, but neither adore nor ſerve him, yet growing old or ſick, they make a kind of Confeſſion to him. They alſo beleeve that there is a Devil, who is the Occaſion of all evil, having the power of Life and Death in his hand, and that they muſt conſerve a perpetual Peace with him, by Worſhip and Sacrifice. Beſides their Opinion that there is a God and an evil Spirit, they have a third Power, which they call <hi>Dian Manans,</hi> or Lord of Wealth, at whoſe diſpoſing will, they think that they are made rich and proſper in their affairs. They ſeem alſo to have ſome light of inviſible Angels, and of the firſt peopling of the World, after the Creation by <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling thereof, after the great Deluge by <hi>Noah</hi>; as alſo ſome glance of a Saviour, who was made a <hi>Piaculum,</hi> for ſome great offence committed by all mankind in general. They have alſo their Faſts and Holy-days.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion is alſo a rite in uſe with them,<note place="margin">Their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</note> which they do at one certain time of the year, with great ſolemnity. The day before all the Friends and Acquaintance meet together, and drink Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin till they grow raging mad: and then draw up upon the beating of a Drum, exerciſing with their Darts and <note n="*" place="margin">An <hi>Aſſagay,</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs call it, is a kind of dart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>5</hi> or <hi>6</hi> foot long.</note> Aſſagays; the Youngmen and Women all the time dancing in Maſquerado, and in the Evening conclude with a luxurious Banquet, and open table for all that pleaſe to come. At night the mother takes the child to bed with her, in a little Houſe made for that purpoſe, about a moneth before the day of Circumciſion, by the Father and Uncles of the Child. The next morning by break of day, the Woman riſeth, and baths her ſelf, afterwards her child: which done ſhe dreſſes it with Corral and Precious ſtones, and thereupon they fall a drumming again, after which a great ſilence is made, and all the Gueſts which are there, muſt withdraw, as alſo all ſuch as have any thing about their body that is red; thinking that if ſuch were preſent, the blood

would not ſtench. Aſſoon as all are withdrawn, except theſe that are nominated to aſſiſt, the Prieſt takes his knife, and ties a white towel about his left legg; that done the Father and Uncles of the Child, take each of them a Child under the Arm, enter in at the Weſt-door, and out again at the Eaſt; and ſo ſitting down, the Prieſt performs the work. If it be the Son of a Slave or Bondwoman, the Prepuce is thrown away, but if otherwiſe, it is preſerved by the Uncle of the child, who lays it up in the Yelk of an Egg, for ſome Inchantment, or other; theſe people being reputed very active Exorciſts, and much inclined to Necromancy: and laſtly the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was alſo a Navy of Twenty Thouſand <hi>Praws,</hi> preſſed for the behoof of the Army, to tranſport the Baggage and Proviſion; and beſides the ſtanding Militia and Voluntairs, 52000 Citizens preſſ'd for this Expedition, whom the King allowed Rice for Victualling, the reſt they were to take care for themſelves. The Mandate was no ſooner out, but this Body was completed, which gave occaſion of wonder, to ſome, when they obſerved the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and obedience of thoſe Pagans to their lawfull Soveraign. The weapons uſed then for that Diſpatch, were moſtly fire-arms, and about 20 Pieces of Ordnance, which were committed to the charge of 2 expert Gunners; beſides 5 Thouſand Elephants, and 2 Thouſand Horſe; thoſe that were mounted on Elephants were armed with Bows, Arrows and Darts, and the Cavalry with Fire-locks, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matars
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33105:32"/>
and Bucklers, which Armory is alwaies ready for uſe in the Kings Repoſitory. As for Powder they are never at a loſs thro want of it, having ſuch plenty of Salt-peter, which is the main Ingredient thereof: ſo that it is moſt certain, the <hi>Siammers</hi> are never deſtitute of any neceſſary Ammunition for War, either upon offenſiv or defenſiv Occaſions. Nor yet ſecond to any for true valour and courage, which is checked by a prudent Conduct, and politic Direction of their Power; and thereby the Prince, and the leading Officers of the Army, become dreadfull to the Neighbouring Potentates abroad, and awfull to the Subject at home.</p>

In the firſt rank went the Kings eldeſt ſon, aged about twenty Years, who was only brother to the Deceaſed, and was mounted upon a Young Elephant all in White: next him were two brethren of his, by another Queen, mounted alſo upon Elephants, on each ſide one: each of theſe had a long ſilk Scarf faſtned to the Herſe, in their hand.

When this was done the Princes of the blood, and the <hi>Mandorins</hi> returned to the Kings Palace; but the Ladies were injoyned by the Emperour to remain at the Altar and bewail the Dead, for two days longer; at which time the Bodie was to be burned: and accordingly they ſtay'd there till the time was expired, ſtriving, who could manifeſt the moſt ſorrow; hoping ſo to obtain the greater favour from the Emperour. But the greateſt folly I could obſerve among them was, that when any of them could not diſſemble, or let down tears, they were whipped with thongs, by ſome perſons, thereto appointed, till they wept indeed; and this was duly executed without having regard to their Perſons.

               <p>TWo days after the Corps were brought forth, the King went himſelf in perſon, and gave fire to the wood with a Torch, which was done with great Solemnity, and Muſic of all ſorts, that all the time play'd very dolefull Airs. The Cheſt of Gold, together with all the Coſtly Ornaments, wherewith ſhe was attired, when ſhe lay in ſtate, were burn'd with the Corps, and reduced to duſt.</p>

This ſeeing, he was mainly altered, and turning about to one of the <hi>Magi</hi> who ſtood at his left hand, Asked him; What his opinion was? and, What might be the reaſon that this gobbet of

fleſh remained unburn'd. The Sage judging it to be done by ſome Enchantment, durſt not declare his opinion about it; but to ſatisfy the King, replied, That his Majeſty could not but be ſenſible of the Cauſe, ſince nothing could ly occult from his ſearching Wiſdom: the more in regard it was a thing ſo palpable and open. The King by the Saying of this Paraſite, concluded with himſelf that ſhe had been poyſoned, cries out with great raging, <hi>At length I have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the certainty of what I ever had in ſuſpicion: My Daughter is without doubt poyſoned.</hi> Upon that in great diſcontent he went into his Mourning appartment whence he iſſued an Order for the ſudden Apprehenſion of all the Ladies, that attended the Princeſs in her Life time, who were in obedience to his Royal Will immediately ſecured.</p>
               <p>On the day following divers others of the greateſt rank were ſiezed and committed to Cuſtody, who were wont to converſe with the Princeſs, although they had not been in her preſence for the ſpace of a whole year.</p>

After I had ſpent ſome time at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in waiting for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make another Voyage, and not hearing of any, ſuitable to my mind and capacity, I reſolved to go for <hi>Durgerdam,</hi> to ſee what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment I ſhould find at home; and purſuant to that my intention went to the Boat, where I caſually met with one Capt. <hi>Ketel</hi> of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdam,</hi> a perſon with whom I was formerly acquainted. After he had congratulated my happy return, asked me, What courſe I was bound to take? I told him, that I had a deſire to undertake a new Voyage, but I could not meet with an opportunity to Ship my ſelf upon any conſiderable Terms. <hi>Well</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>upon what Terms would you go</hi>? I replied, <hi>For Sailmaker. That occurs very well,</hi> quoth he, <hi>for I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for one, and we had already determin'd to go this Voyage without one: And

                  <hi>I will be as civil to you as I may.</hi> This anſwer of his was no ſmall matter of comfort to me, being then, as I have already ſaid, deſtitute of Service. The Captain brought me aſhoar, and in a Victualling-Houſe agreed with me, when he had almoſt made me tipſy with Strongwaters, and ſo got me aboard the Paſſage-boat, where I lay and ſlept that whole night and the next day, till we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the <hi>Texel,</hi> where the Ship lay at anchor. When I awaked I began to look about me, not knowing where I was, at firſt I thought I was in my Lodging at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but perceiving the Veſſel tumble and toſs too and again, I concluded that I was ſtill aboard the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> man. Whilſt I was in this quandary the Captain comes down to me which unriddl'd the doubt. When I bethought my ſelf what I had done, I grew very uneaſy and diſpleas'd at my ſelf, for my inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat and unadviſed Actions: however the Captain gave me fair words, and aſſopiated the Quarrel between Me and My ſelf.</p>
               <p>On the 20 of <hi>December</hi> 1655 I Shipp'd my ſelf aboard the Fly-boat, called <hi>Het Huys te Gennip,</hi> which was bound firſt for <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> where ſhe was to take in Red-herring.</p>
               <p>On the 14 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> we left the <hi>Texel,</hi> and on the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> got <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Roads, where we met with a contrary Wind, which blew ſo hard that we could carry no Sail, but were fain to let all drive, and truſt to the mercy of GOD. This dured for the ſpace of 12 Watches, at which time we made the <hi>Texel</hi>; and to our great happineſs had a Pilot aboard, that was intended for. <hi>Yarmouth</hi> who brought us ſafe in at the <hi>Spaniards gat:</hi> for it was impoſſible for us to keep off at Sea, the Ship being ſo full of Sand, that we could not ſtir the Pump: and before we made land, found that we had 7 foot Water in the Hold, ſo that had we not luckily put in there then, the Ship had not held out one Watch lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. When by the Grace of God, and Diligence of the Pilot we had got in there, we unloaded the Ship, ſtopt the leaks, and ſupplied the defects of our equippage. and,</p>

Our Maſter was ſo kind as to let me climb up but when I came upon Deck put me in Irons, that ſeeing our courage was not yet cooled in the Sea, he had that one mean to keep us aſunder. In the mean while ſome had taken opportunity to pillage my cheſt, and borrow 116 Ducatoons: but I could never be ſo happy as to learn who was my Creditor: ſo that I had but a ſmall portion left me, with which I purpoſed to go by land to <hi>Venice.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leghorn</hi> is ſo well known of all Gentlemen and Marriners that have ſeen <hi>Italy,</hi> that it may ſeem needleſs to deſcribe it. Nevertheleſs ſince it is a part of my Province, to take notice of ſuch Towns as are in any regard eminent and famous, I ſhall not ommit to ſay ſomething briefly of it.</p>
               <p>This City which is one of the chief Havens in renowned <hi>Italy,</hi> was by <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> great Dukes of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> upon conſideration of it's commodious ſite raiſed from a mean village to a great Empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. The ſaid Dukes fortified it with a ſtone wall, ſince which time it was gradually advanced by the encouragement of Trade; and is at preſent ſtrengthned with 5 Bulwarks and 2 Cittadels, or Forts the one whereof commands the Haven, and the other ſecures the Town on the Land ſide, towards <hi>Piſa,</hi> which is furniſhed with 60 great Guns. About 6 Engliſh miles from the City is a Beacon for direction of Marriners by night, there being many Rocks toward the South that are often the occaſion of Ship-wrack, and is therefore called <hi>Malhora.</hi> Theſe Rocks do cauſe impetuous breakings of the Sea, which yet render the entrance of the Haven more free and ſecure. So that Ships and Galleys may ride ſafely at anchor in this Road. The City on the out-ſide appears more magnificent than it is indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: The Frontiſpieces, as well of Privat as Public Buildings being plaiſtered, upon which are painted Sea-fights, Hiſtories and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchap. In the midle of the Town is a ſtately Market place and an Exchange, where (as at other Places) Merchants meet and negotiate their Affairs. Corn, Fleſh, Fiſh and other neceſſaries are here very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33105:51"/>
good and cheap, which occaſions almoſt all that are bound farther up to put in there for Refreſhment. On a Corner Stand four ſtatues in braſs, repreſenting the Father and 3 Sons, who attempted to row away a Galley, belonging to the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; and ply'd ſo ſtrongly that the reſt of the Galleys, had enough to do to overtake them, and were ready to yield it for loſt. Theſe 4 men were <hi>Moors,</hi> and for that notable Eſſay, are recorded with their Images in mettal which are ſet one againſt another, with their Hands behind their back.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Leghorn</hi> I ſet forward for <hi>Piſa</hi>: but before I was got half way, was aſſail'd with 4 Highway men, who were well mounted and arm'd: two whereof allighted, and clapt their Piſtols to my breaſt, bidding me deliver my money. In the mean while they fell a ſearching of my pockets and breeches, but not finding my money, which I had ſtitch'd up in the lining of my Coat, they gave me 2 bunches of Grapes, and rode away.</p>

There are here ſeveral fair Churches; that dedicate to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is a very ſtately building, and renowned beyond any other Church in <hi>Italy,</hi> for it's coſtly Tower which is of admirable rare Workmanſhip. The Church-yard, otherwiſe called <hi>Campo Sancto,</hi> is viſited by many ſtrangers, which was made at that time, when <hi>Frederic Barbaroſſa</hi> went to Warrs againſt the Infidels in the Holy Land: to which Expedition thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> aſſiſted him with 50 Galleys. But the ſaid <hi>Frederic Barbaroſsa</hi> being caſually drowned, the Galleys returned back again, all freighted with Earth, of which they ſay the Church-yard is made.</p>
               <p>On the 23 towards night I left <hi>Piſa,</hi> and went to <hi>Florence</hi>; Between which two Towns is the moſt delectable Fields and Valleys, that ever I have ſeen, either before or ſince, inſomuch that I thought my Journey neither long nor irkſom, though on foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:33105:51"/>On the 26 I entred <hi>Florence,</hi> which is ſeated in a pleaſant Valley' and divided by the River <hi>Arno</hi> into two parts, which is the ſame River that runs by <hi>Piſa.</hi> On the Weſt it hath the Champane land which is admirably delightfull: on the Eaſt the Countrey is Hilly, and ſtored with abundance of Fruit-trees, and on ſome part it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the <hi>Appenin</hi> Hills. This City is reckoned about 7 miles in compaſs, and enjoys a ſubtile and wholſom Air, which renders the Natives and Inhabitants more acute and of a ſharper Genius than thoſe that Inhabit, or are born in places of a groſſer: The City which is divided by the River, is again united by four ſtately Bridges. which ſo beautify the Town that perhaps gave <hi>Charles</hi> the Arch-duke occaſion to ſay, that this was a City only to be ſeen on Holy-days. The fertile Hills and rich Valleys wherewith it is environed, affoard the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants plenty of all neceſſaries. Here is the Court and Reſidence of the Duke: The Palace being one of the moſt magnificent in all <hi>Italy,</hi> yet far more ſpacious and ſplendid within than without: but to recount the ſpacious Halls, Pompous Antichambre, Marble Statues and Pictures in the Galleries, with all it's Appendencies, were an endleſs labour. Right over againſt the Pallace is a Lifeguard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a hundred <hi>Germans.</hi> Before the Palace is alſo a very ſtately Fountain, adorned with huge Statues both of Marble and Braſs, out of which ſprings Water, being all in emblematical repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon the <hi>Mercato Novo</hi> is a very ſumptuous Building in which the Citizens, meet and treat about the affairs of Merchandiſe. The Palace of the <hi>Medici</hi> is a ſtupendious Fabric, and for artificial car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved works, aſwell in Wood as Stone, and Pictures of the moſt eminent <hi>Italian</hi> Maſters, ſeems to aemulate the famous <hi>Vatican.</hi> Beſides theſe are many other inferior Palaces, Bublic Puildings, Churches, Chappels and very ſpacious Cloyſters, all which would take up ſome moneths to make an exact ſurvey of. In many ſtreets are Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or <hi>Piazzas,</hi> (as in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi>) where one may walk to avoid either Sun or Rain. Here are alſo many Houſes built for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſes, where the Sick are relieved with what they ſtand in need of; and every one of thoſe Houſes kept very neat and clean, eſpecially the Hoſpital adjoyning to the Church <hi>Alla Nunciata.</hi> Yet above the many famous Structures which grace <hi>Florence,</hi> the Houſe of <hi>Prattelino</hi> outbraves them all, which was built by <hi>Francis de Medicis.</hi> The firſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33105:52"/>
you come at is the Palace, which is raiſed upon a ſquare Fund, or Platform, which entring, you have at firſt view four Chambers that are oppoſite to one another, and ſtand alſo in quadrangular form, ſo that the 4 quarters are again ſubdivided each into 4 leſs, which make 16 Appartments. In one of theſe ſtand 2 coſtly Beds, one for the Duke, and the other for the Dutcheſs. The reſt of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are hang'd with Tapeſtry, and ſome with Cloth of Gold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably rich; and illuſtrated with artificial and coſtly Statues, which are ſet in convenient Places thereto ordained. In like manner when we went up another ſtory, we found 16 Chambers more, paralel with the Platform of the former. In every one of theſe was a ſtately bed, the meaneſt whereof is computed to have coſt more than a Thouſand Crowns. Comeing out of the Pallace you come <hi>alla Grotta,</hi> which is a fair Arch having therin a Fountain, that ſeems rather to be Natural than performed by Art. Round about the Fountain are Snakes, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Lizzards and other Serpents, ſo artificially made in Braſs that they might be taken for Living. On each Pillar ſtand Organs, which are moved by the force of Water, in ſuch manner, that they make a moſt lovely and ſweet Harmony. The Walls are in ſeveral places ſo thick ſet with Gems, Coral and other things of value, that they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The reſt is ſet with Marble. About the middle ſtand fair Alabaſter Tables, to which if you draw near, the Water riſes from under your feet, and flies all over your head and bodie, but indeavoring to ſhun it, you are again ſaluted after the ſame manner from another place. On the other ſide is another called <hi>Grotta Sibylla,</hi> which is alſo very coſtly, and ſet out with many fair Statues of Marble and Alabaſtre, richly adorned with Coral, where are alſo curious Water-works, none ever coming there but is wet with thoſe ſubterranean Showers. On your right hand is the Bath of the Prince, which is under full of holes, through which the warmth can come to cauſe Sweat. Beſides theſe there is a third Arch, which is for the Heat in Summer, whither the Duke and his Houſhold retire to refrigerate themſelves. In this Arch, is a fair large Table of Alabaſter, and at each end ſeveral Holes, in which they ſet their wine to cool. There is belonging to this Houſe a pleaſant Garden, wherein are many Springs and Ponds: and every rare and choice Tree that will like in that Clime. Behind this Garden is a Park, full of ſtrange Birds and Beaſts, and therein a ſtately and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33105:52"/>
delightſom Arbor where the Duke frequently dines in the Summer ſeaſon, and from whence he can view both his Palaces, the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City and the other without. Right over this aforeſaid Garden is yet another, in the middle whereof is a Chappel, where the Duke for the moſt part goes to Maſs, and Veſpers. This Chappel is built round, after the manner of the Heatheniſh Temples of old, planted round with Cypreſs trees, and has all its inner works of that Wood. Near to that ſtands an Image of 24 foot high, which will repreſent <hi>Neptune,</hi> or <hi>Thetis,</hi> made of White marble, from whence all the Waters in the Fountains have their Riſe: upon which if a man ſtands he hears a wonderfull murmuring and buzzing of Water from below.</p>
               <p>This City is a place of great Traffic and Commerce, eſpecially in Silks and Velvets, of which I ſaw many rich ſhops upon the <hi>Ponte Pecchio,</hi> or Old Bridge. The <hi>Florentines</hi> themſelves are very able and skillfull in the Affairs of Merchandiſe, and very litle Traffic don in <hi>Italy</hi> wherein they have not an intereſt; ſo that Pope <hi>Clement VI</hi> called them the fifth Element. Beſides their domeſtic and exotic Trade, they have given encouragement to, and bred up many, ingenious and famous Maſters in Architecture, Painting, Carving and other Practical Sciences and Arts, and have for a perpetual memory and Gratitude ſo many ſtately Pallaces, Churches, Pictures and Statues left them to Poſterity. This City is alſo very Courtly in reſpect of it's Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through which all Ambaſſadours and Miniſters of State from forreign Potentates muſt paſs, intending for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Seignory of <hi>Venice.</hi> It is much frequented, viſited and likewiſe inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by many Private Gentlemen, who ſpend their Eſtates here, and is a choice place to live in as well for Artificial as natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, for ſuch as have an Eſtate to bear it out with. However, I had litle reaſon to complain of bad meaſure during the few daies I ſtaid there. For meeting accidentally with a Monk,<note place="margin">A Chriſtian Monk.</note> who ſeeing me to be a <hi>Hollander,</hi> did not only careſs me all the time in ſuch manner that I needed not pay any thing either for Lodging or Diet, but alſo ſhow'd me all what was remarkable about the City. This Monk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that I was ſhort of Moneys, and intended for <hi>Venice,</hi> procured me 4 Rix-dollars, which was as much as I had occaſion for, to bear my Charges thither.<note place="margin">Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Florence</hi>

Monk,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>IAN.</hi> 1656.</note> whom I thanked for his great Favour and Civility, which he had ſo ſignally manifeſted to me a ſtranger, on ſuch an extreme and emergent occaſion: and tending towards <hi>Bologne,</hi> I was fain to climb over a high ſteep Mountain, and in the valley found the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bologne</hi> lies about 44 degr. being a Town of ſmall circumference, yet wealthy and full of Inhabitants. The form of the City ſeems to reſemble a Ship whereof the Tower <hi>d' Aſinelli</hi> is the Maſt. It has ever been a Maxim among them not to ſuffer either Cittadel or Fort to be built, under the ſpecious name of Fortification, being jealous that under ſuch a colour they might check the Citizens at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; So that the <hi>Bologneezes</hi> have nothing to rely upon, than only the Walls, and valour of their men. The City is founded on the Banks of the famous <hi>Savona,</hi> which River incorporates with the <hi>Rhem</hi> a litle above <hi>Ferrara,</hi> by which way all Goods are conveighed. The Air is here for the moſt part moiſt, which renders the circumjacient Countrey very fertile, there being the beſt Meadows and Arable ground in all <hi>Italy.</hi> There is alſo very good Wine, Olives and Oil: although Fiſh they have none except what is brought from a far; but Veniſon in great abundance. In this place are made ſuch Sauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as are ſent abroad for great rarities, which ſome would perſwade us at home are made of Aſſes fleſh: but my curioſity induced me to make ſuch examination of that matter, that I found it otherwiſe; for they are made of <note n="*" place="margin">Yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and eaten by the Jews.</note> Pork and Mutton. Beſides the Traffic in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Products of the Land, they are great Encouragers of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, and eſpecially in Silks. The Streets are very fair and ſpacious, and at each corner is erected a Conduit, or Fountain. The Houſes on the outſide ſeem as if they were quite gone to decay, yet within are very ſumptuous and coſtly, quite contrary to thoſe in moſt places in <hi>Spain,</hi> that I have ſeen, where every Houſe by the Frontiſpiece ſeems rather a Palace than a private Dwelling, yet within naſty, full of ſpiders-webs, and void of Utenſils, pure Emblemes of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy. During my aboad there I found not any thing extraordinary, as worthy of Remark, unleſs the Tower of <hi>Gariſenda,</hi> which is built crooked on purpoſe, for a proof of Art: although ſome hold the Churches of this City (if taken in general) to ſurpaſs all others in any particular Town in <hi>Italy,</hi> more eſpecially in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and rich Images, both of Gold and Silver, but their ground

Nevertheleſs I knew that I could liſt my ſelf when I would, and receive advance-money: and after a litle Inquiry, met with Monſr. <hi>Theodore de Haan,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Golden Cock,</hi> who took me on as Sail-maker. It was not long before the Ship was in her due equippage, and ſet forth in order to joyn with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made of <hi>Venice,</hi> which was upon an Expedition againſt the Turks in the <hi>Dardanelli.</hi> But <hi>de Haan</hi> having received letters from <hi>Holland,</hi> about ſome urgent affairs of his own, reſigned the Command to his Son, and went home by Land.</p>
               <p>On the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> we ſet Sail from <hi>Venice,</hi> in company with the <hi>Grand St. George,</hi> which was then commanded by the Sieur <hi>Court Adelaar</hi> afterwards Admiral of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and lately deceaſed.</p>
               <p>On the 20 <hi>ditto</hi> we arrived at <hi>Xante,</hi> where we ſupplied our ſelves with freſh Water, and took in ſome Pipes of Wine, which is here exceeding good, and tolerably cheap: for the <hi>Barillo,</hi> a meaſure of about 5 Gallon, or rather more, coſts but a <hi>Scudo,</hi> that I ſuppoſe is equivalent with 5<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

Upon this aroſe a great Storm of Wind, which rock'd us to and again, and at laſt broke our Cables. We endeavored all we could to get Sea room, but the Wind being towards the Land, drove us flat againſt the Coaſt, where the Sieur <hi>Adelaar</hi> ſeeing us in ſuch danger, ſent off his Long Boat with 5 or 6 men to fetch a Perſon of Quality from aboard us, who was a Superintendant of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Place, under the Juriſdiction of the Common-wealth: but all the reſt of the Gentry, with about an Hundred Soldiers and Marriners ſtayd aboard.

Lamentable it was to hear the pitifull moan of ſo many that were Parents for their Children, Men for their Wives, Wives for their Husbands, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their Parents, and every particular for their Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, The Maſter of the Ship and my ſelf got a Maſt, which, what by the boyſtrous Wind, and what by the violence of the Floods, did ſo tumble and roll, that we could not keep it in a due ballance, ſo that we thought beſt to look out for ſomething elſe, and by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Providence met with the great Hatch, which came driving with ſuch force againſt the Maſt, that it had almoſt ſent us both to ſound the Deep. However indeavouring to ſave our Lives, we got faſt hold of the Hatch, and won the Shoar. All the reſt were drowned to 19 Men, and 2 Women; the one whereof was a <hi>Venetian</hi> Lady,<note place="margin">A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> whoſe Husband was a Captain in that Expedition. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, after a long and weariſom beating thro the Surges, and Foamings of the Sea, was thrown mother-naked upon Land, but moſt miſerably torn and rent with Nails and Splinters; having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the report made by the Chirurgeon, above Fifty Wounds and Holes in her Body: yet notwithſtanding all this, was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to hear of the loſs of her Husband, than ſenſible of her own calamity: However conſidering the extreme cold ſeaſon, and her weak condition, we covered her Warm with cloaths and Bedding. The other Woman that was ſaved, was the wife of a Privat Soldier, who was great with child, had driven Six and Thirty Hours upon a piece of the Hulk, and to our great admiration was taken up alive. It was certain that ſhe could not have endured any longer being already ſtiff and benummed, and us pale as a Corps. So ſoon as ſhe was brought aboard the <hi>Saint George</hi> and warmed, was delivered of an Abortiv Child: but her ſelf revived, being cheriſhed by the help of other Women aboard that Ship. Shortly after the Ship-wrack came all the Moveables and Goods aſhoar. Being now come aboard the <hi>Saint George,</hi> and a litle refreſhed, we ſteer'd away for <hi>Candy,</hi> where we arrived in ſafety; but what by our unhappy lingring at <hi>Argentero,</hi> and increaſe of Folk, the Victualling grew very low; upon which we deſired the Governour to ſupply us with what we had occaſion for, but Anſwer was returned us, That <hi>Candia</hi> was of it ſelf but very meanly provided, and that they were not in a capacity to aſſiſt us. We then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33105:55"/>
deſired, that we might have a <hi>Tartan</hi> to tranſport us to the Armade, in order to admit our ſelves again into the ſervice of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. To this the Governour gave his aſſent, and with a Ship and 15 men, and ſome Ammonition diſpatched us for the Armade.</p>
               <p>On the 3 of <hi>May</hi> we ſet Sail from <hi>Candy,</hi> but were put to our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the rate of 2 <hi>lib.</hi> of Bread each man a day, upon a Calculation of 10 days, and ſo conſequently 20 <hi>lib.</hi> the Voyage.</p>
               <p>On the 8 <hi>ditto,</hi> we came cloſe under <hi>Mytilene,</hi> and found that our Proviſion was already ſpent, ſo that it was reſolved by the major part of the Company, that we ſhould go aſhoar and ſee out for ſomething to ſupply our Wants, although we knew that the Iſland was under the Juriſdiction of the Turkiſh Emperour. However ſeeing there was as much Danger on the other hand, we chuſed rather to adventure our ſelves on land, than to ſtarv aboard: and accordingly 12 <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and 15 <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtept aſhoar, and ſeeing a drove of Cattel we took 6 fat Kine, which we led to the Boat and ſo got them hoyſ'd aboard, one by one. This fair beginning encouraged us to go further within land and about a mile from the Creek where the Tartan lay, found a ſmall village of about 10 or 12 Houſes, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot any appearance of either man, woman or child, who we concluded had hid themſelves for fear. In the mean while finding no ſcarcity of Bread, Meal, Butter, Cheeſe, Honey, Wine and Oil, we pick'd and chuſ'd each what he had a mind to, and having pack'd up more than we could carry, we thought it a ſin to leave any thing behind us: we therefore went a litle out of the Village, where we found about 20 Aſſes, theſe we took and loaded with our Spoil, and in our return to the Shallop eſpy'd a Caſtle which before we had not ſeen, and thither we ſuppoſed that the Peaſantry of that Hamlet were fled to ſecure themſelves. But in coming forwards, we found that there was but one high way to the Boat from the Village, and that cloſe by the Caſtle; for every man had fenc'd in his Ground with a high Flint-wall: nevertheleſs coming paſt the Caſtle we met with no obſtruction or annoyance in the World, till being got about half-way I looked about, and ſpied 200 Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers following us as hard as they could drive, whereupon I cried out, <hi>Gentlemen, Here comes a Command of Horſe, ſee what you have to do, and reſolve without much loſs of time, for if you do not behave your ſelves coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly we are all dead men. Be valorous and keep together, let us be faithfull,

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Turks</hi> in the mean while drew nearer and nearer: and we loath to part with our Plunder, made a faint-hearted fellow (that was good for nothing elſe) drive the Aſſes before, whileſt we drew up into a Body and put our ſelves into a Poſture of defence. Our men unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly gave me (for the time being) the honour of a Chieftain, in lieu of a better. As for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they were greater Strangers to martial Diſcipline than we, and ran confuſedly up and down without any order. When the <hi>Turks</hi> were juſt come upon us, I gave charge that they ſhould not fire all at once, but by 5 at a time, and that not till they had taken good aim, and the Enemy within ſhot. With that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Commander (being a <hi>Moor</hi>) advanced upon a ſtately Horſe, was bound to level his Carbine, but to anticipate him I gave the Word to the firſt Rank, who brought him down to the Ground and three more beſides him. This falling out luckily the ſecond Rank gave fire, and ſo following the third, till we ſaw above 20 of the Enemies Party dead, that gave us no ſmall encouragement; but on the contrary ſo diſheartned the Enemy that they began to retreat; for beſides the great advantage we had of the High walls of Flint, which ſerved us for a Rampart; our Arms were large Muſquets, and theirs but ſmall Carbines, which at that diſtance could not do much Execution. When they were gone a good way back, we climbed over the Wall, marched along the high way with four in a Rank, and kept our ſelves together. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing that faced about on a ſudden, clapt ſpurrs to their Horſes, and came driving upon us with a moſt horrid ſhouting; thinking ſo to bring us out of our Ranks, and to put us into a diſorder: which if they could have effected, had ſerved their turn. But our men the ſecond time faced about and levelled their Muſquets, till we had them at a due diſtance and ſo we fired for a good while together, without either gaining or looſing ground; till at laſt the Enemy ſeeing themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably weakned by the loſs of their Leaders, were forced to retreat again till they were out of ſhot: but ſo ſoon as we began again to march, they followed us, but in a very eaſy pace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending (as we had colour to beleeve) to ſurprize us at taking our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 12 <hi>dito</hi> we Sailed into the River of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where we found the Sea-Armade of <hi>Venice</hi> at <hi>Troy,</hi> which is the place and remnant of the famous <hi>Troy,</hi> ſo much read of in the Poets of old, although it is hard to judge where the Town has verily ſtood. All that is to be ſeen, is a Gate which is built of white Marble, and ſeems to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ancient, and a ſmall Village with the Foundations of a wall, that encompaſſe the Town 7 times, not in circular form, but as it were involved like a Snake, or the ſpring of a Watch. Towards the Sea are ſome Trenches and a Redout of Earth, which have been lately made by the Turks to check the Paſſage of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> or Channel of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 14 we were taken into ſervice, and I put aboard the <hi>Litle Princeſs.</hi>

               <p>On the 16 came an <hi>English</hi> Ship from <hi>Sante</hi> called the <hi>Midleton</hi> to bring Bread, Oars, and Ammonition for the Armade, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>MAY.</hi> 1656.</note> The Turks in the mean while lay battering the <hi>English</hi> Ship, and the <hi>English</hi> on the other hand defended themſelves couragiouſly. After they had fought ſome hours, the <hi>Turks</hi> boarded her abaft and got the Poop, which the <hi>English</hi> ſeeing blew up the Decks, and ſo ſet the Ship on Fire, which nevertheleſs when they ſaw her on Fire to the Main Maſt, ceaſed not to fire valourouſly out at the Prow till ſhe began to ſink, which they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king betook themſelves to ſwimming, rather willing to burn or ſink than ſurrender themſelves or Ship upon diſhonorable Terms. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Turks</hi> took up as many as they could, and made ſlaves of them. Aboard this Ship was an <hi>English</hi> Woman who kept a Houſe of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment at <hi>Venice,</hi> notedly known by the name of Mrs. <hi>Penters,</hi> and one that was very kind to the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> when in any ſtrait or trouble, and many of our Nation were ſorry when they heard of her Death. The Ship <hi>Midleton</hi> was mounted with 36 Guns, and 60 Men, whereof about 40 were drown'd and burn'd, as we found by the Bodies we took up an hour and a half after the Battel. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward underſtood by the Slaves we took in the Engagement at the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> that the Galleys were ſo diſabled that they repented the Aſſault, beſides more than 500 Men outright kill'd, and a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number wounded.</p>
               <p>While we lay at Anchor at the entrance of the Channel, and loating to and again before the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> the moſt part of our men were quell'd with a Scorbutic diſtemper, for want of freſh Water. For all the Water we could have, we muſt fetch out of the River of <hi>Troy,</hi> which we could not doe without great perril, and jeopardy of our lives; the <hi>Turks</hi> having ſeveral hidden Trenches, in which they lay ſculking till they ſaw opportunity, and then ſurprized us. To my great misfortune, I was ſent out with 7 more to fetch Water with a Boat; and coming to <hi>Troy,</hi> we ſaw very rich Vineyards, at a diſtance, and mightily longing for ſome ſuch refreſhments, we caſt lots who ſhould make the attempt to go and fetch ſome Grapes, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But whilſt I was thus buſy, heard a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oiſe, and turning me about, deſcried ſeveral <hi>Turks</hi> that had lay in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33105:57"/>
ambuſh running towards me, from ſeveral places between me and the River. Our men were newly come aſhoar and filling their Casks with Water, who made all the haſt they could, gain'd the Boat, looſ'd off from the ſhoar, and eying the Enemy too earneſtly ran the Shallop upon a Sand, where they were ſet faſt; but having ſome Fire-arms aboard, they kept the <hi>Turks</hi> off, till they got the Boat adrift, and ſo made their eſcape. In the mean while I ſat biting my nails, and ſcratching my head in the Vineyard. Seeing my way forelaid, and no hopes of coming to the Sea-ſide. I began to conſult with my ſelf what ſhift to make, and concluded it the greateſt folly in the world to oppoſe my ſelf againſt ſo many men, for which (being once in their clutches) I might expect ſeverer uſage. It was not long before they came to ſee what kind of a <hi>Fool,</hi> they had got in their Gin, where they found <hi>Peel-garlick</hi> ready to yield up the Ghoſt for fear. They brought me firſt to the Hamlet, where <hi>Troy</hi> was ſaid to ſtand in times of yore, and afterwards to thoſe Caſtles which are built oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to each other,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor made a Slave.</note> and command the entrance of the <hi>Dardanelli.</hi> Here they put me in a Galley, ſtript off my Robes, ſhaved my head, and ſet me to an Oar, which was work enough for ſix of us to tug at, allowing me only a pair of linnen Breeches to cover my nakedneſs. I was chain'd to a <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> who had been 24 years in the Galleys: for all ſtrangers that they take in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Sea-Armade, are to ſtay in the Galleys during life, without the benefit of Redemption. Which when I came to underſtand, began in all haſt to repent my temerity, and foolhardineſs, and had thought my ſelf more happy if I had been pilling of Turnips or Cucumbers at <hi>Durgerdam,</hi> than plucking of ſuch ſour Grapes, in a <hi>Trojan</hi> Vineyard.</p>
               <p>How inhuman and barbarous our Uſage was, no Tongue can duly utter nor Pen decipher. For the Guardian of that Galley was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt ſevere of any other in the Fleet, and although we plyed never ſo ſedulouſly, were ſure to be threſh'd on the naked ribs with a Buls-pizle, when the fit took him; and one mans hide muſt unjuſtly be made a <hi>piaculum,</hi> for another's Remiſneſs, or Sloth, nor was the Tygre ever well, but when he heard ſome a roaring, or yelling out The <hi>Ruſs</hi> was ever now and then counſelling to betake our ſelvs to flight, which I had a great mind to eſſay (for the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armade lay but two leagues from us) but could never ſee an opportunity,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33105:57"/>
meeting perpetually with one obſtruction or other; and the Coaſt narrowly watch'd by the <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Ruſs</hi> had ſeveral times attempted to run away, but was ever taken, and had neither Noſe nor Ears left him. This woful Praecedent daunted me ſo, that I had no great ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to try, but one day above the reſt he gave me good encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, ſaying, <hi>Prethee Brother, Which is beſt, To live in perpetual Slavery, or, Doe what you can, to make your Eſcape? Put the caſe it should be fruitleſs and we should be taken, I shall be ſure to have the hardeſt meaſure, but you, only a hundred ſtroaks on the foot, at worſt. 'Tis true, they have threatned to burn me, if ever I run away again, and am caught; but I will rather dy ſo, than to live all my days under the lash of thoſe unreaſonable Hell-Hounds, and to be tormented with a Thouſand Plagues, after the manner you ſee. Come, come, reſolve.</hi> Faint heart never won fair Lady, <hi>and</hi> Nothing venture, nothing have; <hi>What is there in the VVorld, that may be praeferred before a Golden Freedom?</hi> By theſe and many other reaſons he moved me to hazard to matter. The <hi>Moſcovian</hi> or <hi>Ruſs,</hi> who was a ſubtile Impoſtor, and had an excellent hand at any kind of Roguery, had been ſome time before at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he had bought a File; this he had ſtitch'd up in his Coat, and carried always a litle Tinder-box and a Watch-light about him, to uſe in time of occaſion.</p>
               <p>Having now for the ſpace of 6 Weeks endured this wofull ſtate,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes his Eſcape.</note> we found an Opportunity to rid our ſelvs of that miſerable Slavery: for being now left to our Liberty to fetch Water for our ſelves, my Camrade and I that were chain'd together went farther within Land than we needed, and ſo returned honeſtly back to the Galley, and that for 2 or 3 times together, the better to prevent ſuſpicion, till at laſt, we ran ſo far out of ſight that we thought our Enterprize half won. The night coming on, it began to rain, and we to ſhelter our ſelvs, crept into a cave, where my Mate ſtruck fire and lighted his Wax-candle, that we might ſee to file: and after a litle labour got our ſelves looſe. The night in regard it was dark favour'd us mainly, ſo that we came to the ſtrand an hour before break of Day, which we ſaw full of Tents. But being a very rainy night and ſtormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sentinels did not attend their Poſts, ſo that we paſſed through the middeſt of them without any examination, and betook our ſelves to ſwimming before it was obſerv'd. But it was not long before they began to ſuſpect ſomething, or other, for that Water is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33105:58"/>
very ſalt and has this property, that with the leſt motion, or troubling, it burns like fire. Hereupon they ſhot at us by gueſs and random, with the Long-bow (for by reaſon of the Rain they could not uſe their Fire-arms,) ſo that the Arrows came pelting about our ears, and ſometimes grazing upon the Water, till at laſt one hit the <hi>Ruſs</hi> directly upon the buttock. However he ſwom ſo long with it, till we were out of ſhot,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ruſs</hi> shot with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> but when I would have pulled it out; the poor caitiff began to yell out moſt miſerably, crying, <hi>Let alone, let alone, 'tis an Arrow with a wicker.</hi> And thus he was fain to ſwim for two Leagues together, before we came to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armade: and had the ſtream heavy on our ſide. When we came to the Armade we were taken into the Ship <hi>Abrahams Offering,</hi> where the <hi>Ruſs</hi> had the Arrow drawn out of his buttock, which had pierced him to the very bone, and put him to a miſerable torture before it was drawn out, being a Harpoon with 8 wickers. However he was by the diligence of an able <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> in a ſhort time cured of his Wound; and we thanked God for his delivery of us from the hands of thoſe mercileſs Tyrants, preſerving us through the dangerous floods, and bringing us to a Chriſtian People.</p>

For the ſpace of one whole moneth we cruſed upon the <hi>Turkish</hi> Armade, which we waited for daily from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In the mean while thoſe of <hi>Maltha</hi> came up with their Galleys to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada, under the Flag of the <hi>Prior of Rochel.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> on the contrary had 28 Men of War. 9 Galeaſſes, and 60 Galleys, thoſe of the <hi>Bey</hi> reckoned with them. The ſaid Fleet was alſo full of men, and well provided with Ammunition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:33105:59"/>On the 23 the whole Armade came down with full Sail before the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> as if they would direct their courſe for the Iſlands of <hi>Greece,</hi> or ſome place in the <hi>Archipellago,</hi> aiming to make a breach ſometimes at one place, and ſometimes at another; But the <hi>Venetians</hi> were too vigilant to ſuffer it; for they compoſed their Fleet in ſuch order, that the <hi>Turks</hi> could not find a Paſſage. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Maltheezes</hi> diſown'd themſelvs to be under the Standard of <hi>Saint Mark,</hi> but reſerved the Command of their own Galleys, as themſelves liſted and thought good.</p>
               <p>On the 24 the <hi>Turks</hi> held themſelves cloſe to the Banks near the two Caſtles, mentioned before (in Pag. 80) which tended mainly to their advantage. Beſides this they had thrown up two Batteries, one upon the Corner of <hi>Barbaria,</hi> on the <hi>Anatolian</hi> Side, and another, on the <hi>Greek,</hi> or Weſtern Coaſt, from whence they play'd off their great Guns againſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Navy, to work a paſſage through for their Fleet. Three days long continued they on both ſides firing with their Canon, the Admiral of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as bearing the chief Standard; riding neareſt to the Enemy, and conſequenly ſuffered more dammage than the reſt of the Navy: for the Turks threw out great Stones with their Bombs, that they killd three men on a breſt, who ſtood very near the General. In theſe Caſtles are Guns of an incredible muſſin, and as ſome ſay, thoſe in the outmoſt Redoubts 30 inches diameter. And although there was not any hope of doing the Enemy much harm, yet the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet kept ſtill in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; waiting greedily for the <hi>Turkish</hi> Navy, which we thought would come out, when ours was a litle more diſabled. On the 26 they came out with full Sail, and in good Order, with ſuch a hideous roaring and ſhouting, that we could not underſtand the words of Command, nor hear one another ſpeak. Their Ships as well as their Galleys were ſo ſtow'd with men, that they were a great incumbrance to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Wind was now at North, and favoured the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> have the benefit of the Wind.</note> that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were almoſt blind and ſtifled with ſmoak: yet the whole Fleet kept their Poſts without giving way to the Enemy. The General to give a good example and encouragement to the whole Navy, put the Fleet in the form of a Creſcent and himſelf in the Nombril; and ſo expected the Infidels Armade: but they kept off at a conſiderable diſtance, ſtill playing off their Cannon. The Wind and ſtream

which favoured them againſt us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>JUNE.</hi> 1656.</note> was alſo advantagious for us againſt the Galleys of the <hi>Bey,</hi> that were to the Rereward of us; who alſo fought couragiouſly, and held their Poſt all the while. The <hi>Venetians</hi> did all they could to cloſe up with the <hi>Turks,</hi> but could not move forward and keep their due Order, thro reaſon of the Wind, and violent Breakings of the Stream, occaſioned on purpoſe by the <hi>Turks</hi> in opening of their Fleet, that beat Strongly againſt the Chriſtian Navy. The Enemy in the mean while battered the Squadron of <hi>Marco Bembo</hi> with an inceſſant ſhooting of whole Tears and Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that all crack'd again; nor had <hi>Lazaro Mocenigo,</hi> and <hi>Gerolino Malipiero</hi> the Vice-Admiral, aſſiſted by the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> the leſt ſhare in this hot Ingagement. But beyond all others, memorable was the magnanimous and reſolved Valour of <hi>Bernardo Bragadino</hi> Chieftain of the <hi>Contarina,</hi> a ſmall, but a well-built Friggat: who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Enemy poured out great ſhot, like Hail upon her, yet dured all the brunt of the battel thundring with her Cannon againſt the <hi>Turkish</hi> Galeaſſes, that they were forced to remove their Poſt 5 ſeveral times. An admirable rare Courage! which if it either could, or had been ſeconded, by all the Naval Forces of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then preſent, would have given ſuch an Overthrow to the Infidels as no Age might paralel. Nor may we forget to commemorate the good ſervice of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who ſerved as Auxiliaries in this Naval Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and behaved themſelvs very well. The <hi>Turks</hi> now ſeeing the prudent Conduct of the General, and undaunted Courage of the whole Fleet did all they could to draw off, fell down to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and retired into the Bay of <hi>Barbery,</hi> where they dropped Anchor, hoping that now they were in Sanctuary.</p>

                  </note> till on a ſudden by Heavenly providence the Wind came about, and GOD, out of his unſpeakable Goodneſs, granted the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> a helping Hand, almoſt after the ſame manner, as about a Hundred Years agon in the famous Sea-fight againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Don Iuan d' Auſtria,</hi> when the <hi>Turks</hi> had the Wind fair and favourable, till they came to engage with the Chriſtians, and then by the Divine Bounty of the Everlaſting GOD, the Wind turned to the advantage of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleet; in ſuch ſort that the Chriſtians gave them the greateſt and moſt fatal Overthrow, that ever yet was either known, or heard of, in the world. The General <hi>Marcello</hi> had no ſooner obſerved that the Wind blew a litle Southerly, but he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſet ſail, and ſtretch the Oars, in order to give the <hi>Turks</hi> a ſudden Aſſault, which was in obedience to his Will immediatly put in practiſe. The <hi>Turks</hi> being thus ſurprized by our ſilent Attacque, and finding the Wind directly againſt them, were dreadfully diſmai'd: inſomuch that upon our entring the Bay we ſaw them by whole flocks jump over board. Some ran with their Ships and Galleys bluntly againſt the Wall, others that lay at Anchor neareſt the Sea, ſtrove to drive through the Fleet and gain the Rere; and thoſe that ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not able to retreat, left the Ships, and betook themſelves to ſwimming; few of which eſcaped (for there runs a ſtong Tide) and moſt of them were carried to the Seaward, that we met whole Shoals

In the mean time the <hi>Turks</hi> continued their Flight, endeavoring with their Galleys to tow away ſome of the ableſt Ships, but the <hi>Venetians</hi> fell ſo furiouſly upon them that they were anticipated, and only made their eſcape with 14 which got the Caſtle for their Refuge: <hi>Lazaro Mocenigo,</hi> who was Volunteer and commanded the <hi>Sultan</hi> (formerly taken by the <hi>Turks</hi>) made in with great Courage, and cut off their Paſſage, where he lay thundring and firing his Cannon till the General <hi>Marcello</hi> broke through the middeſt of the Enemies Armade, put them into diſorder, and kept his own Fleet in good Condition holding ſtill in the Nombril or Center of the Creſcent, joyntly with the Proveditor <hi>Barbaro Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aboard the ſame Ship were 44 <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and 22 left, being juſt the half loſt.

                  </note> and betook our ſelvs to rowing as hard as we could drive towards the Ship. But the <hi>Turks</hi> having far more hands than we, and conſequently ſwifter at rowing, came in between us and the Ship, which lay half a <hi>Dutch</hi> League from Land. We then ſeeing litle hopes of getting aboard, wheel'd about and made towards Land; but were as hotly purſued by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſeeing the Brigantine within piſtol-ſhot of us aſtern, we jump'd over board and betook our ſelves to running. But when I ſaw that I could not run any longer, I was forced to ſeek a lurching place, for my feet were ſore in running through Thorns and Thiſtles. Our Commander and Folk aboard ſeeing how caſes ſtood, came nearer the ſhoar and ſhot at the Infidels with their Guns from aboard, tho they held not up to purſue us. When I had lay a litle there, I began to peep out, to ſee if the coaſt was clear, but was ſpied by 4 <hi>Turks,</hi> who were hunting after us, and ſeeing no mean to make my eſcape was forced to ſubmit.

But the Captain not willing to part with us at ſo low a price brought us to Great <hi>Scio,</hi> where the <hi>Turkish</hi> Armada then lay, thinking ſo to get a better Sum, but found it quite to the contrary: whereupon we pray'd him to ſell us to our own Ship. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if your Commander, or your Countreymen will buy you,

I am content, their money is as good as another's.</hi> With this Reſolution we were brought back again to <hi>Samos,</hi> where when we were arrived, ſent a Letter to the Commander, humbly praying him that he would have the goodneſs to redeem us: upon which he made anſwer,
<q>That he was well inclined to do it, but that the Ship was at that time very ſcarce of Money, and that he could not make up above 1800 Pieces of eight, which if that would redeem us 7, we might ſtrike a bargain with the Captain.</q>
Upon this anſwer we were very glad, and under good hopes of coming out of the Hands of the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Captain of the Brigantine obſerving that we had got an anſwer from aboard, asked us, <hi>What news? will your Commander redeem you or not? Yes,</hi> ſaid one of us, <hi>if you will be reaſonable with us, we shall find means to be redeemed, but otherwiſe not.</hi>
Hereupon he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 2000 Pieces of eight, whereat we ſeemed to be aſtoniſhed, and bad him 800 withall declaring that our Proffer ſeemed more to the matter than his Demands; but he would not ſeem to hearken to that.
We then raiſ'd it to 1000 but he told us, That it was but Labour loſt unleſs we bad ſomething more to the purpoſe, and at laſt declared, <q>That for 1300 we ſhould be redeemed, provided we would pay him that day, but if not, that the next day he would go out of Town, and ſell us to thoſe that would bid moſt, be who they will.</q>
We ſeeing it now brought to a good end, and ſenſible of our abilitie, of performance, took him at the word, leſt ſome other reſolution ſhould take him in the head: and preſently put out a white Flag. The Commander thereupon ſent out a Shallop,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ranſomed</note> which came row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards us, till they came within ſpeech of us, and underſtanding the Conditions of Redemption row'd back again to the Ship, to bring us the Money for which we had covenanted with our Patron; upon this we were again Freemen and thanked GOD for his divine bounty towards us. The other men had ſtay'd at <hi>Samos</hi> ſo long in quiet, till they were fetch'd away by the Ships Company when the Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine was gone.</p>
               <p>When we had don, and diſpatched our affairs in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> we ſet Sail towards <hi>Venice,</hi> tho our Ship was ſo leaky, that we were fain to pump continually, however by the help of GOD we arrived Safe.

It has many Creeks, and abundance of fair Cities, of which the moſt noted are <hi>Candia, Canea, Retimo, Sitio, Apicormo, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamo, Melipotamo, Garahuſe,</hi> beſides a great number of unwalled Towns, which they ſay amount to 650, all the inferior Villages and ſmaller Granges excluded out of the number.

The Fortifications have been and are frequently altered, according to the Diſcretion of the reſpective Governours: and is from the very firſt Foundation famous for it's admirable rare Site, and natural ſtrength. It lies in a fair flat Countrey: the Eaſt and North Angles fronting the Sea.<note place="margin">Strength of Candia</note> Upon that Angle which lies to the northward was an impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnable Fort or Caſtle, which had not only all the Fortifications that could be thought uſefull, or any way advantageous for the Town, but alſo the Sea for a further ſtrength, which encompaſſed it as a Mote. The ſame Caſtle has not only the Command of the Haven, but alſo the Sea on both the right and left ſide. Between this Caſtle and the City was a Wall of 20 foot broad, on which the Soldiers marched, from the one to the other.

The Citizens are <hi>Greeks,</hi> as are moſt of the Inhabitants throughout the whole Iſland; but the Garriſons and Gentry, <hi>Venetians</hi>; beſides a great Concurrency of Strangers from all parts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> which make the City very populous. The moſt eminent Buildings, are the Pallace of the General, that of the Biſhop, which for its Antiquity and magnificent work is well worth ſeeing, the Pallaces of ſeveral Noblemen, and the Churches, which are 8 in number, to wit, <hi>St Mark, St Francis, St Paul, St George, St Mary, St Catharine, St Rochus</hi> and <hi>St Titus</hi> amongſt which the firſt is the Cathedral. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have alſo their Churches, but thoſe ſo mean, that the beſt which is allowed them is much inferior to the pooreſt of thoſe which the <hi>Romans</hi> reſerve for their own uſe. Beſides theſe there is not much in the City worth Obſervation. As to the long Siege and Storming of this City 't were needleſs for me to give you any account, ſince it has been from the very beginning traced along, and fully written by others.</p>
               <p>The Air of <hi>Candia</hi> is temperate enough,<note place="margin">Climat,</note> but on that ſide facing <hi>Affrica</hi> is ſomething hot, and rendred unwholſom by ſoutherly Winds: for which reaſon moſt of the Towns are built on that ſide of the Iſland which lies next to the <hi>Archipelago.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Soil,</note> The Soil is exceeding good, and all kinds of Grain and Pulſe take kindly well, inſomuch that ſometimes, one piece of ground affoards two Crops in one year.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33105:72"/>
from them has a kind of ſlimy matter in it of which it, is not to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Here I have ſeen the Wine-ſtocks grow thicker, than any where elſe, which is a great Argument of the excellent Soil, with which this Iſland is bleſſed; and beſides that the vaſt bigneſs of the Bunches,<note place="margin">Huge and delicate Grapes.</note> weighing moſtly 8 or 10 pound a piece, and thoſe ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that after I had once taſted of theſe could not for ſome years after ſo much as taſt the <hi>Spanish.</hi> And not only Grapes, but alſo every other fruit the Land affoards is paſſing good and delicate, inſomuch that not only the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour but all the Princes and Potentates near this Iſland have their Fruits from hence for Table uſe and Banquet.

Cypreſs wood is in this noble Iſland in greater plenty than in <hi>Cypres</hi> it ſelf, which they do not only uſe for Timber, which gives a very amiable ſmell, but alſo for Fewel. The Common paſturage which the Inhabitants neither uſe for Grain nor the Vine, is all grown over with Roſemary, Thyme, Camomile, <hi>Abroton,</hi> or Southern Wood, and other Herbs which the Apothecaries uſe. Nay, the very Weeds which with us have no ſent, affoard here a moſt amiable flavour, for which <hi>Candia</hi> is often called an Earthly Paradiſe.<note place="margin">Cattel and Fowl Wild and Tame.</note> All kind of Cattel like well, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Sheep and Goats which run together in incredible Flocks.

                  </note> we left <hi>Tenedos,</hi> and came before <hi>Napoli di Malvazia</hi> with our whole Fleet, conſiſting of 36 Ships of War, 6 great Galeaſſes, and 40 Galleys; ſome of which laſt belonged to <hi>Rome,</hi> and others to <hi>Maltha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Napoli di Malvazia</hi> is a City ſituate in the Bay of <hi>Morea,</hi> right over againſt <hi>Canea,</hi> on a barren Rock, cloſe to the main Continent, to which it is annexed with a ſtone-bridge, upon that was a ſtrong Redoubt, fortified with 12 large Braſs Guns, which ſtood very well for the ſafeguard of the Town, and ſerved in place of a Cittadel. Our General immediately gave order to approach the ſaid Redoubt with our Galeaſſes,<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt battered,</note> and break it with our Cannon; which was accordingly done. The whole day we lay battering it on both ſides, with a ſtrenuous reſolution, till towards night the Soldiery within ſaw that they could not hold out any longer to defend themſelves, left the Fortlet, and retreated into the Town; which we perceiving ſcaled the Walls and took away the Ordnance. The reſt of the Ships and Galleys drew up cloſe to the Kay,<note place="margin">and sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> where the Ordnance (from the Top of a Rock where they were placed, and in which they repoſe their main Truſt) could do us no miſchief, for they ever ſhot beyond us. When
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33105:74"/>
we had made a great Breach through the Wall, the General gave Charge that the Soldiers, with the help of ſome of the Marriners ſhould ſtorm the Town that night. Upon this mandate all the beſt and moſt reſolute Seamen joyntly with the Soldiery, went aſhoar and entered the City, but the Governour ſenſible, that the Redoubt was diſabled, the Bridge broken down, Communication hindred on the Land ſide, the whole Fleet before the Town on the Water-ſide, our Men in the City, the Garriſon ſcarce of Men, and ſummarily not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to defend himſelf, at laſt puts out a white Flag, and ſo treated with the General: but what the ſum or purport of that Treaty was, we could not learn, for the matter was held privy; and whether the General had betray'd his Truſt, in making of a diſadvantageous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for lucres ſake, or ſome other ſtrange affair occurr'd at that time, I cannot reſolve my Reader; certain I am that a Truce was made between them, for we fired not a Gun after the Deputy left the Ship. It ſeemed to us no ſmall wonder, that ſo brave an Enterprize ſhould be abandoned at ſuch a rate, without ſo much as repairing the loſs, that the Common-wealth ſuffered in this ſhort Attacque, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that being one of the moſt eminent and abſolutely the moſt convenient Place for an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> or refuge, upon occaſion: and not only commands all the maritim Towns of <hi>Canea,</hi> but is likewiſe the only Magazine of the whole Land, through which all Wares and Merchandiſes are tranſmitted, coming from Sea; and is in ſhort the Key of that Gulf. But this is a Chapter too hard for me to read, and the myſteries of ſuch Politicians are ſometimes ſo abſtruſe, as every head cannot penetrate or unriddle.</p>
               <p>When we had removed the Siege of <hi>Napoli di Malvazia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini.</note> we ſet ſail for <hi>Zantorini,</hi> which is a fertile Iſland, but ſubject to Earth-quakes and influence of Meteors. In the year of Grace 1507 happened a dreadfull Earth-quake, which deſtroyed one Moyety of the Place, and ſubverted all the Strand-countrey: and afterwards in the year 1653 happened another, which deſtroyed another Mediety, or half of what was left, at what time not only Men and Beaſts, but alſo whole Mountains and Villages were waſhed away with the inundation of the Sea. There are at this day many of the Inhabitants which are ſtrucken blind with Lightning. It is bad coming to anchor about this Iſland, by reaſon of the ſteepneſs near the Coaſt, having within a

Piſtol-ſhot from the ſhoar upwards of 70 or 80 fathom Water. Here is the Staple for Cotton-ſtockings, which are fine and very well woven, and ſo cheap that you may buy them at 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> a pair ſingle. Wine is here likewiſe incredibly cheap and good, being ſold at half a Piece of eight the <hi>Bariglia,</hi> and all kinds of Proviſion proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.<note n="*" place="margin">Which is a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>6</hi> quarts leſs than half a Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> This moved our Commander to ſend me aſhoar to buy ſome Sheep and Wine, and accordingly I went to a Village that was about two miles from the Fleet, where I was no ſooner arrived but I heard the Admiral fire a Gun, at which I was mainly perplex'd, for I knew by that, that the Fleet was ready to depart, and ran as faſt as ever I could towards the ſhoar: but before I could come there, they were under ſail. When I ſaw that there was no hopes to get to the Fleet, I turned back, but not without fear of being taken, knowing that this Iſland was but 3 or 4 leagues from <hi>Scio,</hi> and that it was often viſited by the <hi>Turks.</hi> After I had been here 4 days and as many nights, came 2 <hi>Turkish</hi> Brigantines to receive Contribution-money, which I underſtanding ran into the Woods to hide my ſelf, but it ſeems one Pick-thank or other had told them that a <hi>Venetian</hi> was left aſhoar (perhaps to excuſe them of their <hi>Quota</hi>) they began to make inquiry after me; and would needs inſiſt upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be reſponſible for me; they told them that I had made my eſcape by night in a Barque; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs would not pacifie them till they had dawbed the Captain in the Fiſt, which cloſed his Eies and ſhut his Mouth effectually. So ſoon as the Brigantines were out of ſight, the <hi>Greeks</hi> fearing ſome trouble might enſue, brought me with a Barque to <hi>Embro,</hi> where the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet lay, and gave me my Proviſion aboard with me which I had bought for 32 Rix-dollars. Upon my arrival the Commander gave them 2 Pieces of eight for their pains, and glad he was to receive me ſo, and they no leſs joyfull to be rid of me; for the <hi>Turks</hi> had already taken a Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the <hi>Greeks</hi> into cuſtody, with his Son being but a child, who might upon my being found there, after they had denied me, have had hard meſure; and they nevertheleſs forced to deliver me up at laſt; which if they had, the Admiral of the <hi>Venetians</hi> would have plundered the Town, and taken them all for Slaves; ſo that theſe poor People are in a worſe and a more pitifull ſtate under both, than they would be, if they were entirely under one.</p>
               <p>While we lay before <hi>Embro,</hi> the Fleet was divided into two parts,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33105:75"/>
and ſent for the reſpective Iſlands to get in the Contributions: the one part went for <hi>Stampalia,</hi> or <hi>Aſtypalaea,</hi> which is one of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Nicſia,</hi> an Iſland about 7 <hi>Dutch</hi> leagues in length,<note place="margin">Arrival at Nicſia.</note> and as many in breadth, for it is almoſt four Square: the North-ſide is montanous, but towards the South flat and arable. On this Iſland are ſeveral Reliques of Gentiliſm and Idolatry; and amongſt thoſe a famous Temple, in times paſt ſacred to <hi>Apollo,</hi> now dedicate to <hi>S. Salvador.</hi> On the South we ſaw the Ruins of another Temple, built alſo to the Honour of <hi>Apollo.</hi> The Inhabitants are <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ruins of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple.</note> 
                  <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who are ſedulous Planters and Cultivaters of the Vine, the land anſwering their Induſtry with a fertile Soil. The City which is called alſo by the name of <hi>Nicſia,</hi> lies on the Eaſt-ſide of the Iſland, having a very fair and commodious Haven, preſenting for all Winds, and fit to contain Ships of the greateſt burthen. Here is found a kind of black ſtone which is held in great eſteem, not much unlike the vulgar Touch-ſtone, called by the <hi>Italians, Smeriglio.</hi>

The City which alſo bears the ſame name, is ſituated on the North-weſt ſide of the Iſland, fortified with a Caſtle that commands 2 Havens, and is called <hi>Moliva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are beſides this ſeveral ſtrong Holds and fortified Places throughout the whole Iſland. The South-and North-ſides are Champain Land; but the Eaſt and Weſt for the moſt part hilly and montanous, affoarding rich Quarries of white and black Marble; and about the Center of the Land it is woody, and moſtly grown over with Cypres Trees. The arable part of the Land which is tilled, is of a good Soil, and affoards plenty of Corn, of which they make two Sorts of bread, the one they call <hi>Trachana</hi> and the other <hi>Bouchourt,</hi> either of which is more durable than our Ship Biſcake. They make an excellent ſort of red Wine, which the <hi>Turks,</hi> notwithſtanding the voice of their <hi>Alchoran,</hi> greatly covet and ſwallow when they can have

it. The Paſtures ſwarm with all kinds of Cattel both great and ſmall; in which,<note place="margin">Good ſtore of Cattel.</note> by reaſon of their very great abundance, they hold commerce with the Iſlands of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea; but eſpecially in a breed of ſmall Horſe they have, which are in good eſteem abroad.</p>
               <p>After we had done our affairs at <hi>Mytilene</hi> we went for great <hi>Scio</hi> but being by the way warned of ſome Fiſhermen, that the <hi>Turks</hi> had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great number of Soldiery there, we ſail'd paſt the Iſland, and put in at <hi>S. Giorgio di Scyro</hi> which is a ſmall Iſland lying in 47 <hi>degr.</hi> 23 <hi>min.</hi> being almoſt of a triangular form,<note place="margin">Scyro.</note> where the Inhabitants follow the Vineyard.<note place="margin">Delos.</note> Leaving <hi>Scyro,</hi> we ſail'd directly for <hi>Delos,</hi> which now for the moſt part goes by the name of <hi>Sdilly</hi> and lies in the latitude of 47 <hi>degr.</hi> The Iſland is at preſent of no great note: only that it is viſited by the curious in Antiquities. Here we found many Ruins of Temples, and Altars, ſacred to Heatheniſh Deities, and the Image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which is in two pieces, whereof (as the Greeks told us) the <hi>English</hi> ſaw'd off the Head, and carried it away. But ſo much as remains of it I have drawn, as may be ſeen in the Print. There appear yet the Ruins of 3 Temples more, to wit, of <hi>Apollo, Minerva</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> beſides ſeveral pieces of Marble and Alabaſtre, in various figures of Animals, as Lions, Leopards, and the like. Here are alſo many Quarries of a rich ſort of Marble, and various kinds of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtre. Proviſion may be had at very eaſy rates, Hares and Coneys are for their plenty held in diſeſteem by the Inhabitants. Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a thing quite out of uſe, but the greateſt profit it yields the <hi>Venetians</hi> is the conveniency of the Haven, which ſerves them for a Rendevouz.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Caſtle of <hi>Tenos</hi> blown up with it's own Powder.</note>Between <hi>Delos</hi> and <hi>Andros</hi> lies the Iſland <hi>Tenos,</hi> where there is a Caſtle built upon a high Hill, that ſeems of it ſelf ſufficient enough to defend the whole Iſland. In the year 1656 was the greateſt part of this Caſtle blown up with its own Powder by Lightning, at what time, I was in the Fleet not far from <hi>Delos,</hi> and ſaw it. I beleeve alſo that a great part of this Iſland is overflown with the Inundation of the Sea, as <hi>Zantorini,</hi> or rather ſunk: for when we came to anchor at 26 fathom Water, we wrought all we could to weigh, but thought verily that the Cable would break before any anchor would looſe; at laſt it was reſolved to try once more for the laſt, and if it would not then come, to cut the Cable, but at laſt the anchor came, bringing a great

               <p>Thus Traverſing to and again, to and from the Iſlands, our Ship, <hi>The Princes,</hi> grew very leaky, ſo that we were affraid, that if we ſhould be taken in a Tempeſt ſhe would not hold out, which our Mate obſerving, willed the Commander to acquaint the Admiral with her Condition, which he did; and thereupon we were diſmiſſ'd, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> aboard us received order to go aboard other Ships.

Purſuant to this my Intention I married after I had been about 6 Moneths at home, and ſo continued in that ſtate, for the term of 10 years during which time I found but poor advancement in my Fortune, and mean Products of ſo many years hard labour and toil; ſo that I reſolved to take the very firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

               <p>In the year 1668, I came to underſtand that ſome Gentlemen were ſent from the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to take on men into the ſervice of the Emperour, for equipping ſome Ships in the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and ſo to promote the Trade between <hi>Moſcovia</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his own, which otherwiſe till then was done by <hi>Perſians, Tartars</hi> and other Nations, and that moſtly by Land, from whence aroſe many Difficulties by Robberies and the like. The Conditions upon which they were taken on liked me very well, upon which I applied my ſelf to Mr. <hi>David Butler</hi> who was to be our Leader, and to conduct us to <hi>Moſcovia.</hi> After I had treated with him a litle upon what Terms I did deſire to go; we made an Agreement for 75 gilders <hi>per</hi> Moneth, for which I was to ſerve as Sail-maker, and to make up all the Sail-work for a new Ship and a Yacht, which was newly built in <hi>Ruſsia.</hi> The Fore-maſt Men had 50 gilders <hi>per</hi> Moneth allow'd them, their Boardwages included, which was 15 gilders.</p>

               <p>On the 2 of <hi>September</hi> 1668 we ſail'd through the <hi>Pampuys,</hi> and on the 3 towards the Evening came before <hi>Enchuyſen,</hi> where we put in and Shipped 50 Tun of Herring.</p>
               <p>On the 4 we ſet ſail again and got the <hi>Texel,</hi> where we tarried 8 days for a good Wind: and on the 13 the Wind blowing fair all the Ships outward bound which were about 50 ſail; began to weigh, and we reſpectivly to take our leave of Wives and Family, for 5 years: but before we got clear of the Land, the Wind turned, ſo that we were fain to traverſe and wind all we could to get out, in the mean time came a Ship belonging to <hi>Ter Schelling</hi> with a full drift againſt us, and ran her Bow-ſpreet through our main Sail, which was with ſuch force that he rent our ſail, and broke his Spreet-ſail yard, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that we were both fain to put into <hi>Ter Schelling,</hi> to repair and fit our ſelves out again.</p>
               <p>On the 20 being clear we ſet ſail the ſecond time, and had a freſh gale at South and by Weſt, which held favourably, ſo long till we arrived at <hi>Riga:</hi> but when we entred the <hi>Baltic</hi> Sea, it blew ſo hard that our Mizzen ſail was all rent and unfit for uſe; whereupon the Maſter ſet me to work to repair the defects.</p>
               <p>On the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi> of <hi>October</hi> we got the <hi>Boldera,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arrival at Bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> which is the Haven or River of <hi>Riga,</hi> where we dropt Anchor. Immediately upon our arrival came the Searchers to viſit the Ship, and amongſt other Goods found a Parcel of contra-band Wares, and took it aſhoar with them, but the Maſter told them that it was thrown in by chance, and pray'd them to be ſo kind as to leave it aboard, which, after he had daubed them a litle in the fiſt, they did. The next day being under ſail, we were becalm'd, and fain to caſt anchor half way up the River.</p>
               <p>On the 3 <hi>ditto</hi> we came up to the Kay of <hi>Riga,</hi> where being arrived,<note place="margin">Arrival at <hi>Riga.</hi>
                  </note> the Maſter refuſed to pay me the moneys, he agreed with me for, to make up his ſail, which was 10 Rix-dollars; but on the contrary, gave me very ill Language, and told me if I had any pretence upon

him the Law was open, and Judges appointed for the deciſion of ſuch controverſies. This great ingratitude, made me to take a courſe I never intended, which was to ſend him ſummons to appear in the Town hall; where upon a ſecond citation, he made his appearence, and was condemned to pay the money, in preſence of the Court.</p>

By Winter they receive Goods over Land in Sledges and Waggons from <hi>Moſcovia</hi> which is tranſmitted abroad;<note place="margin">It's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce both by Sea and Land.</note> and by Summer from <hi>England, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Holland,</hi> and other Places, by Shipping, which are ſent that way again with the Moſcovian Waggons and Sledges.

                  </note>On the 10 <hi>ditto,</hi> we left <hi>Riga,</hi> and with our compleat Company and Baggage imployed 30 Waggons to bring us to <hi>Pletsko</hi>: and took up our firſt nights Lodging at <hi>Niew-meulen,</hi> being a Village where all the Waggons and Horſes are ſet over a River with great Logs of Timber faſtned together,<note place="margin">Nieu-Meulen.</note> that float above the Water.</p>
               <p>On the 11 we proceeded again on our Journey and broke two of our Waggon-wheels, which the Waggoners repaired, and ſo we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on our Journey. At night we came into an Inn which was ſo meanly provided for Bedding that we were fain to lay all night in the Waggons. The next day we travelled through a great Wood, in the middeſt whereof was a broad Marſh, that coſt us ſome Hours to go over. When we were through the Wood, we paſſed through ſeveral little Villages, the Inhabitants whereof were a miſerable ſilly People,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33105:80"/>
hardly able to draw one leg after the other. The Women have only an old Rag, like a Plad, thrown about their bodies,<note place="margin">The <hi>Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, Habit and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</note> hardly ſufficient to hide their nakedneſs, except a litle below their ears, to let the World know, they have hair as well as other People; ſo that they look like ſo many Gypſies newly come from the famous Peak of <hi>Darby.</hi> As for their Houſes they are but one degree beneath a Hog-ſty and thoſe as full of Utenſils, as a Knave is full of Honeſty. All that ever I could ſee was an earthen Pan or two, and thoſe ſo clean, that I had rather faſt a week than eat any thing, that has come out of them. Great plenty of Cattel they have, and ſuch as have three times as many feet as they themſelves. As for Beds they have none but ſuch as their Oxen ly upon, for when they have ſtuffed their Gutts, they ly down upon the floor one after another, as the Nap takes them. Their Diet is ſuitable to all things elſe they have, for although they might have Veniſon for knocking on the Head, the Creature may live till Doomſ-day before they will take the pains to lift a hand to kill it, unleſs it be a louſe, which ſometimes they cruſh to death for change of Diet. As for their Bread it is not much unlike our <hi>New-caſtle</hi> Coal for colour, but how it is of Taſt I know no more than the Man in the Moon, for neither my Appetite nor Curioſity could move me to it, Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage they have in great abundance, which is of a Taſt like Sorrel, but cloſe and white like ours, That and Cucumbers are the main ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients whereof theſe People ſeem to be compounded, but more eſpecially the latter, for <hi>Cucumber</hi> attends them from the Womb to the Tomb, being held in perpetual Slavery by their Lords. They are conformable to no Laws, unleſs what they are forced to obſerve by a ſtrict aw, which their Lords impoſe upon them, and injoyn them to. They are by nature obtuſe and dull, inclined to Necromancy and Sorcery, but in the performance of an Exorciſm, ſo palpably ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, that I wonder how they have obtained that repute they have in the World among thoſe, who ought to be wiſer than to beleeve ſuch groundleſs Fictions. They have no manner of Schools wherein to educate their Children, that ever I could ſee or hear of: neither Churches or other Houſes for Religious uſe; ſo that they are brought up in the greateſt Blindneſs and obſcurity that may be. Some of them, 'tis true, will needs be called Chriſtians, but thoſe are they that have travelled as far as <hi>Riga,</hi> which they think is the Head of the World,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33105:81"/>
yet are thoſe ſo ſtupid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>OCTOB.</hi> 1668.</note> as a <hi>Lifeland</hi> Gentleman told me, that they have learn'd Catechiſm enough, if they can but know the Church from a Dwelling houſe, or to pull of their Caps when they ſee a man with a ſhoulder knot paſs by. Yet they are flexible enough to Idolatry by Nature, and withall ſuperſtitious. In our going through the Woods we ſaw a great Troop of them buſy about Conjuring of a Tree, which they had tied with a Garland of twigs, creeping round about it and making a great Howling; but ſo ſoon as they ſaw us, took them to their Heels and away. By the Forms and Tenures of the Curſes and Conjuration they ſeem to be ſenſible of a Future ſtate and ſometimes (by I know not what Tokens) preſage Death; and the Soul of any that has been a diſturber of the Public Quiet they deliver up to the Devil. They have a formal Oath, that they take upon divers Occaſions which is thus, The Party cuts up a Turf or Sod of Earth, this he ſets upon his Head and takes his ſtick into his Hand, Wiſhing if ſuch, or ſuch a Matter, be not ſo, and ſo, that They with their Cattel may be conſumed with Fire. They have beſides this, other ſuperſtitious Cuſtomes, to which they are ſo ſtrongly inclined by nature that they will not be better civilized, or if they happen to ſhow themſelves willing, and learn a litle Urbanity it muſt be only for lucres ſake, and they promiſed ſomething to boot to remember it, which if you forget to perform, they will forget to obſerve your Document. In ſhort they are but one remove from Bruits, and ſo ignorant, that the moſt part of them thinks there is no other Land in the World beſides their own.</p>
               <p>Two days long we went through the Woods and found it ſo ſoft and Marſhy that we could hardly bring our Waggons through in ſafety.</p>

One of our Company growing weary of his Journey thought to go away in this Throng, but the Captain being informed of his Deſign, watched him ſo narrowly, that he could not meet with an Opportunity to march off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVolmar,</hi> is a litle, but a well-fortified Town, munited with a ſtone-Wall and a deep Ditch, but without Water. The Market in regard of the Poverty of the Countrey is very conſiderable, and is held twice

a week. This City as appears yet by the Ruins of it, has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly much greater than it is at this day, but with all the Countrey round about has been often depopulated by the <hi>Polish</hi> and <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Armies. It is about 18 leagues from <hi>Riga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 15 by break of Day, we ſet forward on our Journey, paſſing through a Champaign Countrey, and many ſmall Towns and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. By the way we obſerved that the Boors had burn't up great Woods, and converted them into Paſturage and arable Ground. Afterwards we went through a large Wilderneſs, where we could not ſee the Sun, by reaſon of the denſity of the Trees, yet the way was full of Mires, and plaſhy. About 7 in the Evening we came to our ſtage, where we were to ſtay over night. The next morning we broke our faſt, yoked the Horſes, and ſet forward; paſſing over a huge River which had only a Bridge there where we were to paſs over, and no where elſe within 20 leagues above or below: but the Bridge being old and ſeemingly rotten, we durſt not go over all together, but one by one. When we were got over, Evening came on, and the Sky began to grow gloomy, after which followed a very great Tempeſt that the River ſwell'd over the Banks and overflow'd all the flat Lands, which we ſeeing ſo ſuddenly happen, left the common Road; for that our Land Pilot told us, that the High way was ſubject to ſuch Floods with an extraordinary Inundation. After two Hours Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the Weather began to clear and the Pilot aſſured us we were not far from the Town where we were to take our nights reſt, and ſo it happened, for juſt as he was ſpeaking of it we ſaw Light, through the Trees, which mightily revived us for we were extreme cold and weary. The next morning we ſet forward for <hi>Pitſiora,</hi> and had very good Weather, but came ſhort of the Town that night, inſomuch that we were fain to ly all night in the Woods, where we gathered all the Windfalls we could find and laid them on a heap, and with dry Sticks made a huge Fire, which ſerved not only to warm our ſelves at, but likewiſe to affright the Bears and Wolves away, which are very bold and cruel in theſe Parts, as alſo the Muskettos, which ſwarm here by Millions, and annoy both Man and Beaſt, after an incredible rate.</p>

                     <hi>OCTOB.</hi> 1668.</note>ON the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of October 1678 we arrived at <hi>Pitſiora,</hi> which lies on the Confines of <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> and under the Protection of that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. It is ſeated in a fair and pleaſant Countrey, affoarding all things neceſſary to the ſuſtenance of human Bodies. 'Tis true <hi>Pitſiora</hi> is no more than a Village, yet for wealthy Inhabitants, Commerce abroad and Advancement of Manufacture, ſurpaſſes any City in all that part of the Countrey. In paſſing through the Town we ſaw many rich Mercers and Drapers Shops; the Markets ſtored with all ſorts of Proviſion, as Corn, Butter, Cheeſe and Fruits, with a very noble Butchery or Fleſh-ſhambles, and the ſtreets crouding with People from all Parts. So ſoon as we were arrived, there came ſeveral Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who asked if we had any Pearls, or other Jewels to ſell or barter.</p>
               <p>Having refreſhed ourſelves at <hi>Pitſiora</hi>; we left the Town the next day about 10 in the Morning, and about noon entred a large Wood where we found great ſtore of Hurtles or Bilberies, that were far greater and better taſted then any I have known elſe where; which moved me to fall a plucking of them; but going a litle way into the Wood, and making a ruſhing through the Thickets, up ſtarts a huge Bear, which ſo affrighted me that I had hardly power to run from him; however it ſeem'd that he was as fearfull of me as I of him, for when I ran Eaſt he ran Weſt, and glad I was to ſee his Bear-ſhip turn tails with me. This was the only Bear that ever I had ſeen in <hi>Lifeland,</hi> or all the way from <hi>Riga</hi> hither, but the Boors often warned us to take care of our ſelves, ſaying that, ſometimes both Men and Cattel are devoured with thoſe cruel and ravenous Beaſts.</p>
               <p>On that Evening we arrived at <hi>Pletskou</hi> where we had Lodgings and all neceſſaries provided us; and on the 22 payd our Waggoners who returned for <hi>Riga.</hi>

                  <hi>Pletskou,</hi> is a large City,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>OCTOB.</hi> 1678.</note> a great part thereof is ſurrounded with a wall, the reſt with huge Balks like Pallizados, and computed about 8 [<hi>English</hi>] miles in compaſs. Their Houſes are made ſleightly of Trees and pieces of Timber, let in with joynts, without any Gentility or ornament. The Town it ſelf gives a noble Proſpect if you view it from without, by reaſon of the many Pariſh-Churches and Towers it has, but when you come within, it appears very ugly, the ſtreets are irregular without Uniformity, and the Houſes built after multifarious manners, ſo that the pooreſt Village, in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> is a Paradice in compariſon of <hi>Pletskou.</hi> 'Tis true they have ſome Houſes of ſtone, but the moſt eminent and wealthy Citizens chuſe rather to live in Wooden-Houſes than in thoſe, for that they ſay, The latter are more wholſom. Here I happened to meet with a <hi>Hamburger,</hi> and after we had exchanged a few words together, concerning our journey from <hi>Riga,</hi> I told him of my rouzing the Bear. He replyed that I was happy to make my eſcape ſo, ſince not only men are ſometimes devoured by them, but alſo Horſes and Kine, and withal told me, how that they dig up the Graves for the Bodies of the Dead, when they are hungry. But more lamentable was a ſtory he told me, of a She-Bear, <hi>that in the year</hi> 1656. <hi>broke by night into a Houſe in the Country not far from thence, where she had found the Woman of the houſe with a ſucking, Infant in the bed with her. The woman she devoured, leaving only a part of her left leg and a litle of the Scalp, but the Infant was altogether miſt, whence it was concluded that the Bear had eaten it up, as being young and conſequently more delicate. Not long after this diſmal hap, the Peaſant took his Muſquet with him into the Woods not far from his Houſe, with intent to shoot an Otter which haunted his Fish-pond, and by the way eſpies a Bear, at which he levels his Muſquet, and hits him directly on the skull. The Bear (as the cuſtom is when shot) rolls himſelf in a heap, the Peaſant runs to her and finding it a Female, and her Duggs full of Milk, reſolves the next day to make ſearch for her Seat, for then he thought that her VVhelps would be hungry and yell out. The day following he went out to ſeek the Cave, taking</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>other Peaſants with him, who being about the Middle of the VVood, on the ſide of a hill, heard a young child cry, and following the direction of the ſound, found his own Infant in the cleft of a great Rock, which he took and brought to</hi> Pletskou, <hi>to be nurſ'd up by his VVives Siſter, where out of curioſity I went to ſee it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Suburbs of <hi>Pletskou,</hi> was to be ſeen a ſhank-bone of a Giant,

               <p>On the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> it began to freeze hard, and afterwards to ſnow, which made us uneaſy for our delay, being conſtrained to wait here ſo long, till we received the <hi>Poddowodda,</hi> which is an Order given by his Imperial Majeſty, that every Town we came at ſhould furniſh us with Horſes, Wagons, Bedding, and defray our other Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. On the 28 towards night came an Expreſs from <hi>Moſcou,</hi> and the next day we ſet forward, intending firſt for <hi>Novogorod.</hi> This part of our Journey was much more eaſy and delightfull than that through <hi>Lifeland,</hi> which was altogether deſert and Marſhy, this on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, inhabited and till'd.</p>
               <p>On the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we came at a great Lake before <hi>Novogorod,</hi> where we left the Sledges and were fetch'd over in a kind of a Cymb, or Boat which is made of a hollow tree, and by them called <hi>Knoos</hi>; of theſe they had two ſorts, the one for Paſſengers, who may ſit 4 or 5 at a time, the other broader, and every way larger, fit to tranſport Goods. This Lake is very broad but ſhallow, not having above 5 foot Water in moſt places. When we were ſet over, our Goods were put into Sledges, and brought after us into the Town.</p>
               <p>In paſſing through the Town we found the Suburbs far greater than the City it ſelf, which as appears by the Ruins of the Walls, has been formerly a well fortified Place. In times paſt it was neither ſubject to the <hi>Ruſsian, Swede,</hi> nor <hi>Polander,</hi> but had a Prince, who coined Money and ruled as abſolute Soveraign, with an independent and arbitrary Power; Yea, to ſo high a ſtate was it once advanced, that it was grown to a Proverb, <hi>GOD and</hi> Novogorod, <hi>who is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi> Their Puiſſance I need not diſpute, ſince it is well known to thoſe that are acquainted with Geography what Sway the Princes of <hi>Novogorod</hi> have born, and what a name this City has had abroad for her Wealthy Merchants and great commerce with other Places. About the year 1477 it was beſieged and ſtorm'd by <hi>Ivan Vaſilowitz,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> who took away all the Priviledges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of the Citizens: ſince which time their Wealth and Traffic began to decline and decay. However by reaſon of it's commodious Situation, it retains the footſteps of its former Trade, and is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33105:83"/>
frequented by <hi>Swedes, Danes, Hamburgers</hi> and <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> who come up the River <hi>Nerva,</hi> with their ſmall Shipping. The chief Commodities they deal in, are Wheat, Ry, Lin-and Rapeſeed, Furrs, Hemp and Flax. The Countrey is bleſſed with a good Soil, and produces ſufficiently enough of what is requiſite to human ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is here very cheap. This is reckoned the beſt place in all <hi>Moſcovia</hi> for River-fiſh, eſpecially Pikes and Perch, Salmon they have in great abundance, as alſo Carp, Bream, and Sturgeon, with other kinds not commonly found in the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Novogorod</hi> (which is as much as to ſay, <hi>New-town,</hi> or <hi>Newton,</hi> being compounded of the Latin word <hi>Novus,</hi> and the ſubſtantive <hi>Gorod,</hi> in the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Tongue, a City) is at this preſent ſtrengthned only with a Wall of Timber, but well provided with Ammunition, and Braſs Ordnance. On the one ſide is a ſtrong Caſtle with a high ſtone-wall, which as then was the Reſiding place of the Primate or Arch-biſhop of the Weſt-Province, and ſome other Temporal Lords. The greateſt Decorum and Ornament of this City is the Pomp and ſtatelineſs of the Churches and ſome Public Edifices, as at <hi>Pletskou,</hi> but the Houſes and Private Dwellings of the Inhabitants without any Order or neatneſs of Structure. Between the Caſtle and the Town is a long wooden Bridge where the beforenamcd <hi>Ivan Baſilowitz,</hi> a great Tyrant, threw in ſome Thouſands of the Inhabitants. When you enter the Town, by that way you come within view of a famous Cloyſter, dedicate to Saint <hi>Anthony: which Saint they beleeve and will perſwade you came driving on from</hi> Rome, <hi>out at the</hi> Tyber, <hi>through the</hi> Aegean <hi>Sea, the</hi> Propontis, <hi>the</hi> Negropont, <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Which is a Lake and has no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any other Sea.</note> Mare Caſpium, <hi>and ſo up the</hi> Wolga <hi>to</hi> Novogorod <hi>upon a Milſtone: where he met with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Fishers, with whom he covenanted for a certain ſome of Money, that the firſt thing they took should be his. The Fishers drew their Net, and brought up a Cheſt, which was full of Money, beſides a Ghoſtly Attire, and ſome Books, VVith the money he built there a Chappel where he lies interred, and (as they tell us) his Body is yet to be ſeen, fresh and undecay'd, by which many miracles have been done, but none can ſee him, or them, but ſuch as are of their own Faith.</hi> And ſo much of a floating Mil-ſtone.</p>
               <p>In the year 1611 this City was beſieged and taken in by <hi>I. de la Gardie,</hi>

                  </note> and about 2 a clock in the afternoon arrived at a village called <hi>Bruynitz</hi> where we ſtay'd, and took up our Lodging for that night. The next Morning we took freſh Horſes, but the ſnow was ſo melted with the Sun that we were fain to take Waggons, and leave the Sledges: but the way was ſo miry, that we had much ado to get the Horſes through, for the Earth there is of a tough clay. About 8 in the Evening we came to <hi>Miedna,</hi> which is a poor Village, and could hardly affoard us Hous-room for that night.</p>
               <p>On the 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we had bad travailing way, being for the moſt part marſhy and full of Boggs, with Planks and trees laid over to make them paſſable, which totered and shaked ſo that our Waggons were often out of order, but were as often mended by the Peſants who by continual uſe are very expert at it. By the way we ſaw abundance of Squirrels and Foxes which run together in Troups, yet ſo ſhy that we could not come within muſquet-ſhot of them. That night we got <hi>Gankrezza,</hi> a handſom little Village, where we refreſhed and ſupplied our ſelves with neceſſaries for our Journey.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Robbers.</note>The next day being the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> we ſet forward on our Journey, and travelling thro the Woods, we were ſurprized with a Party of High-way men, well mounted and masked, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what we were? We replied, that we were <hi>Dutch</hi> and ſervants to the Emperour. They hearing that, were in a doubt whether they ſhould plunder us, or not; but at laſt rode off and bad us adieu. It was our opinion that they were affraid that our Company was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that the reſt followed us, for they were better arm'd and mounted than we, beſides the Waggons we had to take care of, or otherwiſe in all probability they would not have neglected ſuch a fair booty, that being, as we were told by the Waggoners, one of the moſt dangerous places in all the Countrey. That night we took our reſt at <hi>Iazel-Bitza,</hi> being very bad and ſnowy weather.</p>
               <p>On the 12 <hi>ditto,</hi> we took in freſh Horſes, and put our Baggage and Moveables into Sledges becauſe of the ſnow, paſſing through thick Woods, and a vaſt Wilderneſs, before we came at <hi>Gamzymnagoru</hi> where we were to take up our Lodging.</p>
               <p>On the thirteenth we changed Horſes and ſet forward on our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33105:84"/>
Journey, paſſing firſt through a thick Wood, and afterwards, came into champian Land, which was dry, level, and tilled as far as we could ſee. By the way we ſaw many ſmall Villages, but at night came into <hi>Colomna,</hi> which was the faireſt and beſt Village I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſeen in <hi>Moſcovia</hi>: the Inhabitants are reputed wealthy, and live in very good faſhion. We came pretty early to our Stage, having had very good way, and reaſonable fair weather, ſo that we had time enough to take a view of the Town, Our <hi>Priſtaf,</hi> or Guid, who ſpoke good <hi>Nether Dutch</hi> went with us to ſhow what was worthy of remark, and very courteouſly reſolved us in any thing we deſired to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about.</p>
               <p>On the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we went through a great Wood where we ſaw abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wolves playing together, which, when we would have taken aim to ſhoot with our Long Guns, they ran inward and took the Wood. Our <hi>Priſtaf</hi> told me that they knew us to have Fire-locks about us, that being the only ſafeguard to travel with, without which they will not fear to aſſail Horſe and Man, and ſometime lay ſculking in the way ſide, where of a ſudden they run out and prey upon Paſſengers. Towards the Evening it began to freez hard, that we were fain to ſtep out of the Hurdles, and walk afoot.</p>
               <p>On the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we got <hi>VVaizna,</hi> and from thence departed for <hi>Gam-VVoldoka,</hi> where we tarried 4 days to reſt our ſelves.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33105:85"/>
where we ſaw great ſwarms of Squirrels fly from Tree to Tree;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>SEPT.</hi> 1668.</note> as alſo abundance of Pheaſants and Partridges, which the Peaſants take and ſell for a mean price. About the Evening we came to <hi>VVuidra Pusk,</hi> where we remained that night, but could not get any Lodging fit to entertain us either for Houſ-room or Victuals, this being yet a poorer Village than that of <hi>Miedna.</hi> At this place happened a Quarrel between one of our Company and a <hi>Ruſs,</hi> the firſt having taken the others Ax, for that the <hi>Ruſs</hi> had ſtole ſom Tobacco from him: which being made known to the Company, they ſtruck and miſuſed the poor <hi>Ruſs,</hi> after an unſufferable manner, which Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> reſented very ill, not willing to give the <hi>Ruſsians</hi> any diſguſt. But above all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World there are none that covet Tobacco ſo much as they do, and will be ſure to ſteal it, if they cannot otherwiſe come by it, although they were ſure to looſe their Heads for it.</p>
               <p>On the 23 by break of Day, we ſet out and entred another thick Wood. Here they ſhowd us ſom Graves where they told us, 8 <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants were buried, who had been murthered by Robbers. When we were got thro the Wood we went over a fair Paſture-ground, and ſaw divers Boors Houſes by the Way-ſide. In the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we arrived at <hi>Torſtock,</hi> which we found to be but a ſmall, yet well-built City, although it appeared greater, from the Number of Towers which we ſaw, when at a diſtance, having above 30 Churches and Chappels within the Walls. Here we unloaded our Sledges and left them, putting our Goods aboard ſome ſmall Shipping that was provided for us, and ſayled down the River to <hi>Troetzka Miedna</hi> where we took in ſom neceſſary Proviſions. That night pretty late we came to <hi>Tweer</hi> which is Seated upon the River <hi>VVolga,</hi> which River with many windings and turnings runs to ſeek the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, into which its diſgorges its ſelf. <hi>Tweer</hi> is ſomething greater than <hi>Torſtock</hi> and is built on the ſide of a Hill from whence it has it's name.

This City like <hi>Torſtock</hi> makes a greater Show abroad than it does within; being neither well built nor at all fortified, ſave only with a Wall of Wood and 2 or 3 Braſs Cannon on the Land ſide. Here we took out our Baggage and laid it again upon Sledges, taking our way through the Woods where we were aſſail'd by two <hi>Ruſsians</hi> a foot,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33105:85"/>

                     <hi>DECEM</hi> 1668.</note> Firſt they began to make a quarrel, and ſo boldly offered to ſtrike with their Axes, ſaying, that they were upon their own Ground, and that we were a parcel of Rogues and Vagabonds &amp;c. To which ſome of our Company who could ſpeak the Language, prai'd them not to moleſt us, as they tendred their Welfare, and that we had no time to ſtand diſputing, and anſwering their impertinent Objections. This not availing, or perſwading them to be quiet, but rather made them worſe, for they came cloſer and cloſer to us: which Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> obſerving fell a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, whereupon they retired a litle, as if they would go away, but all on a ſudden came running in upon us full drive with their Axes, upon which three of our Company levelled their Muſquets, but the Captain forbad to fire, and let the Maſtive looſe upon them. The Maſtive flies directly at one of them, and had him ſo faſt by the Throat, that we had much ado to get him off: the other ſeeing his Mate ſo hard put to it, ran away as faſt as he could, but the Dog being looſe flew after him, and tore off his left ear; and had we not done our indeavour to take him off, had rent him all to pieces. So ſoon as we had got rid of them we proceeded on our way, and at night came to <hi>Gorodna,</hi> where we ſtaid till morning.</p>
               <p>On the 24 <hi>ditto</hi> we went forward, paſſing over 2 Rivers, where we came to a Village called <hi>Sawidowa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Saulka Spaz.</note> and at night came to <hi>Saulka Spaz</hi> which was our Stage. Here we provided our ſelves again with freſh Horſes, but not without much difficulty, for in the mean time we were very uncivilly treated by the Inhabitants, whom we found migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily inclined to quarrel with us, although without occaſion.</p>
               <p>On the 25 we took our leaves of <hi>Saulka Spaz</hi> going over a large plain, and at night came to a village called <hi>Klien,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Klien.</note> where for want of Moneys we were forced to ſtay, till we had an Expreſs from <hi>Moſcou</hi> which came not before the 4 of <hi>December</hi> following, at which time came alſo one of the Domeſticks of the <hi>Heer van Sweden,</hi> Kinſman to Captain <hi>Butler</hi> bringing the unwelcom news of his Maſters Sickneſs whom the Phyſicians judged to be paſt recovery. The Captain upon the opening of the Letter was ſadly dejected, and immediatly took Horſe and rode poſt for <hi>Moſcou,</hi> leaving us Order the next day to follow with the Baggage. In the mean time it began to ſnow hard, inſomuch that we were forced to tarry 6 days at <hi>Klien.</hi> On the 11 we
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33105:86"/>
ſet forward having fair Weather, which at our ſetting out ſeemed to be durable. On this days Journey we met with, Rivers which we were to paſs over that hindred us not a litle; by reaſon that the Floats were ſo litle, not able to carry above 3 or 4 Horſes at a time with Sledges and Wagons, At night we arrived at <hi>Serkiſowo,</hi> where we took up our Night-lodging. In the mean time it froze ſo hard, that we were all benummed, and fain to run after the Waggons to keep our ſelves Warm.</p>
               <p>On the eleventh <hi>ditto,</hi> we went through ſeveral thick Woods of Juniper, where we ſaw abundance of Foxes playing together in the Sun. About 3 in the afternoon we arrived at <hi>Nicholo Direverno,</hi> from whence we could ſee the long-wiſh'd-for <hi>Moſcou.</hi> About Evening we entred the Suburbs, where by one of our own Nation we underſtood that the <hi>Heer van Sweden</hi> was deceaſed, and that the Ship was fit for Lanching.</p>
               <p>On the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we had order to come into the City, and had Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments provided us near the Houſe of the <hi>Heer van Sweden.</hi> Our Landlady had ſo little ſatisfaction in the Gueſts that were appointed to have quarters with her, that ſhe addreſſed herſelf to Court, to deſire that we might be brought ſome where elſe, but inſtead of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her Requeſt, was ſent home with a hundred ſtrokes on the Ribs for her pains. When ſhe came in, ſhe ran into a back-room, where was the Image of <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> painted upon a Plank, and falling down proſtrate before it, ſhed a ſhower of Tears. However ſhe was forced to content her ſelf for 14 days longer, during which time we made good chear, and ſpared not for Fewel in the Stoves. And albeit the Woman was ſo diſſatisfied at our being there, yet her Husband could have wiſh'd us there the whole year round, for our Brandy and Tabacco ſake.</p>
               <p>On the 27 we had order to go into the Houſe of the late deceaſed Gentleman, even now remembred, which was a very commodious Houſe and provided with a great <note n="*" place="margin">Or Cackel.</note> Stove, which was by reaſon of the bitter Weather, very welcome to us; the more becauſe the ſaid Houſe was well furniſhed with Wood, and other fewel for the Winter. We ſtayd here three weeks, during which time there was care taken for what we had need of; when that time was expired we received ſudden Orders, forthwith to depart for our wharf at <hi>Aſtrachan.</hi>

Here was alſo the Emperours Bear-Garden, being accidentally when we were there a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gentry, from <hi>Moſcou,</hi> and other places to ſee the Paſtime, and the Evening before, came the Emperour with the whole Court and Retinue. The Theatre was only environed with Stakes and Pales, that the People might alſo ſee, that were without. Before they began were brought out about 200 Wolves and Bears, and almoſt twice the number of Dogs; all which were drawn in their Kennels ſet upon Sledges. The Emperour, and the prime of his Nobles ſate in a Gallery made on purpoſe in a very convenient place, to ſee on every ſide. So ſoon as the Emperour was ſet, a ſign was given, upon which a litle Wolf and an old Bear were turned out looſe together, that after they had encountered about half a quarter of an Hour, were parted, which notwithſtanding their being in the heat of the Fight, were eaſily brought aſunder and led to their Kennel. The Wolves were afterwards engaged with Dogs of which many lay dead upon the place, and others ſo wounded that they were no more fit for uſe.</p>
               <p>On the 23 of <hi>February,</hi> one of our company married with a <hi>Tartarian</hi> maid, who had been taken Captive when ſhe was a Child and brought up in the Chriſtian Religion, by the <hi>Heer van Sweden,</hi> who taught her to write and ſpeak <hi>Netherdutch,</hi> both which ſhe did expertly well.

               <p>On the 13 of <hi>March</hi> died the Empreſs in Child-bed who by reaſon of her great Charity, Piety, and the beſt of Vertues,<note place="margin">Death of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</note> was much lamented by the Common People, who oftentimes in diſtreſs were accuſtomed to addreſs themſelves to her, as a Mediatrix. The next day ſhe was interred with great Pomp and magnificency, for it is not their Cuſtome as in other Countreys to embalm the Corps, or to let it lie in State.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Moſcou it's Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and ſtate</note>
                  <hi>Moſcou</hi> is the Metropolitan, or Capital City of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> and the Imperial City of <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> and all that is within the Juriſdiction of the Emperour, whoſe Empire is bounded on the North with the <hi>white Sea,</hi> on the Eaſt ſevered from the <hi>Samoieds,</hi> and other <hi>Tartarian</hi> Countreys, on the South it has the <hi>Mare Caſpium,</hi> and on the Weſt, part of <hi>Poland, Lifeland,</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> So that the large and wide Dominions of the <hi>Czar,</hi> are extended as well into the <hi>Aſian</hi> as the <hi>European</hi> Continent.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Moſcou</hi> (which ſeems to have it's name from the noble River <hi>Moſcqua</hi>) lies in 50 <hi>degr.</hi> 37 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly Latitude. It is a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33105:87"/>
very large City, and computed to be about 30 or 35 Engliſh miles in compaſs, yet was almoſt twice as great, before it was taken in and depopulated by the <hi>Tartars.</hi> It gives a very fair proſpect from without by reaſon of it's many Towers and high Buildings. This City is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 4 wikes or Wards, to wit, <hi>Kitay-gorod,</hi> or midle City, <hi>Zaar</hi>-or <hi>Czar-gorod,</hi> the Emperours City, <hi>Skorodom</hi> and <hi>Strelitza Slowoda.</hi> Theſe ſeveral Diviſions ſeem rather ſo many diſtinct Towns or Cities whereof <note n="*" place="margin">Perhaps from <hi>Cathaia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Kitay-gorod</hi> ſtands in the middeſt, and is environed with a high wall, which they call <hi>Craſna Stenna,</hi> that is, Red Wall. It is feated between 2 Rivers, to wit <hi>Moſcqua</hi> on the South, and the <hi>Neglina</hi> on the North, which are united behind the Palace. The Palace together with its Appendences, to wit, the Wall, Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, Creſcents and other Fortifications is the larger part of the <hi>Kitay-gorod,</hi> called alſo <hi>Crim-gorod</hi>; being well provided with Men and Ammunition. In the midſt of this Palace is a very ſtately Church, in which we ſaw a Silver branched Candleſtick, formerly preſented to the <hi>Czar</hi> by the Ambaſſador of our States. Beſides this Church is another dedicated to the Archangel, where are to be ſeen the Tombs of thoſe of Imperial blood, as alſo <hi>Triotzis Maria</hi> and that of <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> which are both very ſumptuous. Thoſe which are in <hi>Kitay-gorod</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Palace are alſo reputed the beſt and faireſt in all <hi>Moſcou,</hi> being reckoned 56. Beſides the Churches which are within the Walls of the Palace are 2 very beautifull Cloyſters, the one for Young Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen, and the other for Ladies, who have reſolved to live a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtichal Life; altho the former may rather go under the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Iluſtrious School, becauſe it is appointed for the Education of the Young nobility in all kinds of Literature and good Manners, who at 16 Years have a choice preferred them, whether they will lead a Ghoſtly or a Secular Life: but that for the Ladies, diſpences not with ſuch a Freedom, but all that are admitted muſt continue <hi>durante vitâ.</hi> In the middle of this Palace, or rather Fort, is a high Tower, which the Ruſſians call <hi>Ivan Velike,</hi> that is <hi>Great Iohn</hi> being covered with Copper and double guilt. This is that Tower,<note place="margin">This Story has been recorded of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, but 'tis no great matter.</note> on whoſe Top the Emperour <hi>Boris Gudenow</hi> (as is to be ſeen in their Chronicles) brought a <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſadour to view the City <hi>Moſcou,</hi> and amongſt other diſcourſe began to ſpeak of the great Loyalty and Obedience of ſome ſubjects to their Soveraigns in paſt ages: Whence
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33105:88"/>
the Emperour took occaſion to ſay) <hi>So faithfull are my ſubjects from the higheſt</hi> Bojar, <hi>to the meaneſt Vaſſal, that there is not one of them who would refuſe to throw himſelf praecipitantly from the Top of this Tower, if I thought good to command:</hi> and thereupon calls a <hi>Bojar,</hi> or Lord, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly commanded to throw himſelf head-long down, which after he had taken his Leave of his Imperial Majeſty and thoſe that were with him, jump'd off from the higheſt pinacle, where he was taken up dead, buried with greated Solemnity, and his Children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the greateſt Places of Truſt, in which they and their Deſcent continue till this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The great Bell</note>Beſides this there is yet another Tower and one of the wideſt that ever I have ſeen in my life, in which is the greateſt Bell without doubt in the World, weighing 394000 <hi>lb.</hi> and the Clapper 10000 <hi>lb.</hi> I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it and found it 23 foot Diameter, and 2 foot ſolid mettal. It is as much as 50 ſtrong men can move, and that only ſo as may juſt be perceived. It is ſeldom rung, and that only upon Feſtival days, or when any Forreign Prince or Miniſter of State deſires it. When they intend to do it at any extraordinary time, they make proclamation through the Town, by which warning the Citizens take down all the Glaſſes and Earthen Ware, for it makes all tremble and ſhake.</p>
               <p>There are beſides the Imperial Court ſeveral other ſpacious Palaces for the <hi>Bojars,</hi> or Nobility, as alſo for the Spiritual Lords, amongſt which that of the Patriarch is the moſt magnificent. Without <hi>Kitay-gorod,</hi> directly before the Palace of the <hi>Czar,</hi> is one of the faireſt Churches (I muſt neds ſay) that I have ſeen in all my Travels,<note place="margin">Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </note> which is built after the model of the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> from whence it has that Name. Near unto this church is the great Market having Shops of all Wares and Merchandiſes that may be imagined, but every Shopkeeper has his own Row or Street, ſo that people of one Dealing have all their Shops together, and by themſelves. In this part of the City dwell likewiſe the ableſt Merchants [<hi>Kneeſen</hi>] and other Perſons of note, who dwell in ſtone houſes to preſerve their Goods, if a Fire ſhould happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zaar-gorod</hi> which is the ſecond part of <hi>Moſcou</hi> encompaſſeth <hi>Kitay-gorod</hi> almoſt in the form of a Creſcent, which is alſo environed with a huge Wall, which they call <hi>Biela Stenna,</hi> that is, The white Wall. <hi>Zaar-gorod</hi> is divided into two parts by the River <hi>Neglina,</hi> which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33105:88"/>
runs thro the midſt of it. Here is alſo a famous Founding-Houſe for caſting great Bells and Ordnance, as alſo the Emperours ſtable. Near the River is a Beaſt-market, and a famous Butchery or Fleſh-ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, where you find not only Beef, Veal, Mutton, Pork, Lamb, Veniſon, &amp;c. but alſo Horſe-fleſh to ſell. Corn, Meal, Butter, Cheeſe and other Proviſion is here good, cheap, and very plentiful.</p>
               <p>The Third City which is <hi>Skorodom,</hi> embraces <hi>Czar-gorod</hi> on the Eaſt, North and Weſt-ſides likewiſe in the form of a Creſcent. In this City, or Ward, is the Houſe-market, where at a low price you may buy a Houſe, of what greatneſs you pleaſe. Theſe Houſes are made of Square pieces of Timber notch'd and let into each other, which when you have bought you can disjoint and bring it where you liſt upon Sledges, that amongſt many inconveniencies has this one Conveniency, that if a Citizen has his Houſe burn'd he may be every day ſupplied with a new, which (conſidering the old is brought to Aſhes) may without much coſt, be placed where the other ſtood; whereas on the contrary, we are often forced to ſtay ſometimes a year or more before the Rubbiſh be taken away and a convenient Houſe built in lieu of the old. Beſides that conveniency, they have another, which is, that at what time any Houſe happens to take fire, and any probable danger of breaking out, the Neighbours upon timely notice have their Houſes taken in pieces and removed as if they were but Tents.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Wike is <hi>Strelitza Slowoda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Strelitza Slowoda</note> which reaches out toward the South, over the River <hi>Moſcqua,</hi> and towards the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Countrey. Here is the placc where the <hi>Soldateſque</hi> are inquarter'd, which they call <hi>Strelitzen,</hi> from whence this Part of <hi>Moſcou</hi> has it's name. It is very well fortified with Bulwarks, and other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications.</p>
               <p>The number of the Houſes within the four Diviſions and the Suburbs, according to their computation are ſaid to be about 95000, the Palace and all its appendencies excluded. The Churches, and Cloyſters, wherein they preach are 1700. Amongſt this great number of Dwelling-houſes you find few or none, but what are altogether of Wood, except ſome Merchants Houſes in <hi>Kitay-gorod,</hi> who as we have already ſaid, build moſtly of Stone for the better ſecurity of their Goods. They uſe no Chimneys as we do for fires, but great Cackels,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33105:89"/>
or rather Ovens; made altogether of ſtone, which ſometimes being over heated, or by the negligence of the People, who are great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Brandy, is the occaſion of ſetting their Houſes on fire, as it happened about 6 Weeks before our arrival there, at what time, by the negligence of a poor Woman, happened a moſt dreadfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,<note place="margin">A great Fire in <hi>Moſcou.</hi>
                  </note> that reduced about 35 Thouſand Houſes to aſhes, and that in the beſt part of the City, which beſides an incredible loſs of Houſe-furniture, Merchandiſe and the like, there were many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and impotent People killed. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, who had moſtly their Reſidence near the place where the Fire firſt broke out, ſuſtained an incredible loſs. Tis true the Houſes are upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions removed with as much eaſe as ours are blown up, but if the Timber be knotty the Sparks and Cinders fly abroad and kindle other Houſes at an incredible diſtance, which being covered with dry Planks are not ſo eaſily extinguiſhed, The <hi>Czar</hi> upon conſideration of the frequent Fires has appointed a party of the <hi>Strelitzers,</hi> to be quartered in ſeverall places, at a due and convenient diſtance from each other throughout the 4 Wards; who are continually to be at hand upon ſuch occaſions. Now by reaſon of the great ſcarcity of Water in <hi>Moſcou,</hi> the firſt thing they lay their hands to, is to disjoynt the Houſes, and therefore for the moſt part are train'd up in that kind of Architecture, to be aſſiſtant again in the rebuilding of the ſame, when all danger is ſuppoſed to be over.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Great but miry Streets.</note>The ſtreets of <hi>Moſcou</hi> are very ſpacious and wide, but in rainy weather ſo miry, that in walking you are up to the very knees in mud; for which reaſon both Men and Women are fain to wear Boots. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though 'tis certain that inconvenience might be remedy'd, by paving it with ſtone, as they do in the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> and elſe where. During the time we were there, it was not poſſible to thwart the ſtreets if they had not thrown great beams and planks acroſs the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Air.</note>
                  <hi>Moſcou,</hi> and all the whole Countrey towards the North is capable of a very unwholſom Air, for thoſe that are not brought up in it, being in the Winter exceeding ſharp and cold, and in the Summer hot and moyſt. In Winter they muffle up their Noſe and Ears in Furs, eſpecially when they go upon a Journey. And in <hi>Moſcou</hi> it is well ſeen that many of the Inhabitants have neither Noſe nor Ear, which they ſay is by coming out of the bitter cold Air into a hot Stove: for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33105:89"/>
although it may ſeem ſtrange, yet cannot that be avoided in ſome places, unleſs they rub their Noſes and Ears, which are frozen, in Snow till they grow hot, which done they may come into a Houſe without danger, and this you ſhall ſee them continually a doing in ſuch Seaſons. It is alſo obſervable how that after a hard Winter the very Earth chinks and opens when it once begins to thaw. But on the contrary, it is there ſo hot in the Summer that a ſtranger cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, at what time alſo the Marſhes and ſtanding Pools do ſo ſtink that one is ready to faint away: beſides the great annoyance of Gnats, Muskettos and other Vermin, againſt which there is no way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ones Face. The Peſtilence is ſeldom ever known there,<note place="margin">The Countrey Sic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some I have heard ſay that in times paſt it was far more frequent and rigorous than at this day, for before, they had not the uſe of Phyſic nor would admitt of any that profeſſed it to practiſe, as of late, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great benefit thereof, they have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſcovia</hi> is a Countrey of a fat and fertile Soil, far beyond that of <hi>Lifeland.</hi> Their Wheat, Ry, Barley and Oats, they ſow about St. <hi>Iohns</hi> day at Midſummer, which within 7 or 8 Weeks is fit for the Sickle, or Sithe (for they uſe both) and that by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant heat. They have beſides the beforementioned fruments, good ſtore of Pulſe, as Peaſe, Beans and Lentils. Cucumbers, Pompions and Melons are more common there than with us, of which laſt I have ſeen ſome weighing above 40 pound. The Fruits they have are Pears, Apples, Quinces, Medlars, Cherries Plumbs, and of theſe ſeveral kinds. There grows in the Countrey lying upon the River <hi>Moſequa</hi> a kind of an Apple ſo tranſparent that you may diſcern the Seeds, as Grapes: The Shell or Rind thereof is very thin and ſubtile and the Fruit it ſelf very delicate, but too juycy, and after a long Rain ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſh that they grow inſipid. 'Tis generally known abroad that <hi>Moſcovia</hi> affoards Flax and Hemp to that exuperancy, that they ſupply almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> with Rope-work. The next Staple-Commoditie of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> is Wax and Honey, which the <hi>Ruſsians</hi> take wild and make a vaſt profit thereof. In ſhort there is no Vegetable of general uſe with us, but what likes there, ſave only the Vine, which the Extremity of the Winter will not ſuffer to like or come to perfection: but that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33105:90"/>
defect is ſufficiently ſupplied from abroad, by the <hi>English, Dutch</hi> and others, who bring the Products of every Vintage from <hi>France</hi> and elſe where. They have no Mines ſave only of Steel and Iron.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Cattel.</note>
                  <hi>Ruſsia</hi> if taken in general is better ſtored with tame Cattel and Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſts than any Countrey in <hi>Europe,</hi> or as ſome beleeve, in the whole World. Kine is without doubt in greater abundance there than in <hi>Tartary,</hi> agreeable to the opinion of all Travailers and Geographers, who have given an account of either. The rich Furs which are yearly exported hence to moſt places of the World ſufficiently teſtify the ſuperabundancy of Foxes, Sables, Martens, &amp;c. But moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to travel alone for the many Beaſts of prey which run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vaſt and innumerable Troops; and thoſe, when the Earth is covered with Snow, very bold and daring, inſomuch that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are in continual danger, and are fain to keep their gates barricado'd from thoſe cruel Animals, to ſecure themſelves and their Cattel; nay, it has been often known that they have undermined Houſes in ſome parts,<note place="margin">Fowl.</note> and devoured whole Families at a time. Wild-Fowl I have ſeen of ſeveral kinds, as chiefly Heath-hens, Herns, Wildgeeſe, and Cranes by Millions in a flock together. As for ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, by which I mean Larks, Finches and the like, which we hold for great delicacies, they have them in litle, or no eſteem, and that by reaſon of the vaſt ſwarms, for they fly together as thick as Gnats or Infects over a Pond. Theſe are havock'd by the Hawks, Faulcons and Merlins, which are there in a proportionable plenty to the prey. The Rivers and ſtanding Lakes are ſtored with Fish of all kinds,<note place="margin">and Fish.</note> which are throughout the whole Land incredibly cheap; in ſum <hi>Moſcovia</hi> has whatſoever is neceſſary for Food and Rayment, as good and at as eaſy rates, as any other Land in the World, none excluded: altho I do not ſay but that one Province differs much from another, and that every particular Province and Region has ſomething or other, as proper or peculiar to it's ſelf.</p>

               <p>THe right <hi>Moſcovians,</hi> or <hi>Ruſsians</hi> (for the <hi>Tartars</hi> now under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Czar</hi> we ſhall ſpeak of in their due place) are moſtly able, corpulent and big, eſpecially of Head, Arms and Legs. The Common ſort are very hard by Nature and patient in extremity, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pamper their Bodies with ſoft lying, when they reſt, or delicat Diet when they eat. In ſummer they lie upon boards, or at beſt upon
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33105:91"/>
ſtraw, and in Winter on the tops of their Ovens, or Cackels, where Man and Wife, Children and Servants lie all down together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction at all. Utenſils they have not many, but ſo many as themſelves judge needfull, which are Earthen or Iron Pots, Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Diſhes, Brandy-and Metheglin-Cups, which they rarely rince. As for rubbing and ſcouring they are meer ſtrangers to it, as alſo to ornaments and Toys, unleſs it be a Figure which they call <hi>St. Nicholas,</hi> or perhaps ſome other Saint for whom they have ſome particular or extraordinary veneration. Slaves they are by nature, and born to ſervitude and Bondage, ſeldom ever aſpiring ſo high, as to indeavour to make themſelves franc, and yet will be excited to nothing by fair means, or uſe diligence about any affair, ſave what they are driven to by conſtraint and blows: and yet ſo ſweet this Slavery ſeems to be to them, that rather than to become free upon the Deceaſe of their Lords to whom they ow allegiance by nature or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, that they will immediatly ſell themſelves <hi>durante vitâ</hi> to ſome other Patron. They are very prone to Theft, yea and to Murther when they think that they can do it clandeſtinly, or to any advantage, how poor ſoever it be, which ſeems to be primordially occaſioned from the Penury of their Lords, who hardly allow them what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit to ſupport and ſuſtain human Bodies: as for Brandy and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco they hold it but a venial Tranſgreſſion to filch when they can come at it, notwithſtanding the ſtrict and ſevere Laws againſt Theft, in the loweſt nature and leſt importance.</p>
               <p>This only is to be applied to the Vulgar ſort, as for thoſe of greater Ability and Rank, they ſpare not for what tends to a voluptuous Life, and indulge their ſences, as much or more than is tolerable. Free they are, and indeed generous enough at their Table, eſpecially when they treat or welcom Strangers, who are very welcom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all imaginable Urbanity, on Condition, that they obſerve the Countrey faſhion, which is to bring a Preſent with them, that may countervail more than thrice the value of what is ſet before them: and this if you forget to bring, you may take my word, they'l forget to make you welcom. The Slaves in <hi>Moſcou</hi> are very hardly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and poorly fed, but much harder thoſe that are in the open Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where their Lords are ſparing of their Allowance, and therefore connive at their Filching; thinking it falls out at laſt to their own

profit, eſpecially if it be any thing of Food.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ruſſes</hi> feed moſt of Roots, Pulſe and Fiſh,<note place="margin">Their Diet.</note> uſe much Onions and Garlick in their Pottage and alſo for ſauces. Their Bread is moſtly of Courſe Ry. As for Fiſh they eat it rather pickled than freſh, which is plentifull in their Markets, and by reaſon that waſhing and making clean the ſhambles is a kind of an Abomination to thoſe people, you cannot come within a hundred paces of the Market, unleſs you ſtop your noſe, ſo nauſeous and hatefull is the ſmell. Thoſe of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Rank and ability do in general hold good Tables, but eat moſt Spoon-meat although it were but bread out of Water that Fiſh has been boil'd in. <hi>Cavear</hi> is a great Dainty amongſt them, but not ſo high in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, there as abroad. When they have drunk more than well agrees with them, ſo that their ſtomach be ſurcharged, they prepare a certain Diſh which they call <hi>Pochmelie</hi> made up of cold Beef or Mutton ſliced very thin, and <hi>Quas: Quas</hi> is a Liquor which they uſe as Beer of which it is made, with a Compoſition of Water, Beer-Vinegar, Garlick and Pepper: this <hi>Quas</hi> being ſo prepared they put their meat into it, and ſeeth it a litle, which afterwards they eat with Spoons. The poorer ſort have a certain Liquor much in uſe among them, which they alſo call <hi>Quas,</hi> this is made of Water with a litle Bran and Barley-meal, which according to their ability they temper thicker or thinner. The Gentry drink Beer, that there is very ſtrong and heady, but more commonly Metheglin, which they make of the beſt Honey, adding Cloves, Cinnamon, Pepper, Galangal, Cardamom and other Spices: This is a very ſtrong and ſtealing Liquor of it ſelf; yet they think good to mix it with Brandy to make it more effectual. Brandy which they call <hi>Wina</hi> they covet above all other Liquors, which without any diſcretion or noted difference is drunk both by Spiritual and Temporal, Nobles and Plebeïans, Men and Women, Young and Old, and that at all times of the Day, before and after Meals; Sometimes to add a medicinal vertue they put a litle Pepper amongſt it. Nay, ſo beſotted are the Vulgar with Brandy, that in the ſharpeſt Weather, they will not only part with their Caps or Coats for the Reckoning, but likewiſe with their Boots, Shirts and Stockings, ſo that I have ſeen ſome of them come mother-naked out of the <hi>Kaback</hi> or Tipling-Houſe. The Common people were formerly ſo irregular and void of Order that they would drink themſelves full,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33105:92"/>
and afterwards the men and Women, ſetting aſide all Reputation and Modeſty commit ſenſual and beaſtly Actions together: This great Diſorder was lately remedied by the care of the <hi>Czar,</hi> who, by the advice of the Patriarch, put down all the ſmall Tap-houſes throughout the whole Empire, appointing in every Town and Village one public Houſe, or <hi>Kaback,</hi> which they are to farm of the Emperour himſelf. They are very covetous of Tobacco, as has been elſewhere ſaid, notwithſtanding the Tenure of a Decree or Mandate promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated about the year 1634, which ſtrictly forbids every perſon of what degree or quality he may be, to ſmoke it: which nevertheleſs is done privately.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ruſsians</hi> are generally groſs of Body yet ſubtile enough in affairs of Merchandiſe which they can manage very well. Their Women are much inclined to Goſſiping, and buſie Tatlers, often beat by their Husbands, who ſometimes uſe them unkindly: upon which they ſometimes addreſs themſelves to Court, where the men once convicted over ſuch Crimes are ſent to <hi>Syberia.</hi> The Emperour conſidering the multitude of Complaints of this nature, has ordained that if any Woman makes complaint without ſufficient Evidence, that the Man is to be tortured on the Rack, which if he ſtands out, the Wife is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to exile, her ſelf, before which Law the Court was dayly troubled with ſuch like Differences.</p>

                  </note>Few people, there are in the World that are more accuſtomed to ſcolding, railing and calumny than theſe, although 'tis very rare to ſee them come to blows, yet much more rarely do they make uſe of their Weapons.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Habit.</note>The ordinary Habit of the Citizens, is firſt an upper Coat of a dark green, red, brown or violet-colour'd Silk, open before and on the ſides, and garniſhed with loops, having behind great Capes, almoſt like old-faſhioned Cloaks in the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi>: Under that they wear another coat of Say or Silk, with a high and ſtiff Collar, theſe have long ſleeves which are tied up round with loops and ſtand Cooks in good ſtead to remove hot Pots and Cauldrons from the fire: Thoſe that have, an intent or deſign to ſteel or murther, uſually have an iron Bullet, or ſome other hard and ponderous thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33105:92"/>
they knock their party down at unawares. Under this they wear yet another Coat which nevertheleſs is not very cloſe, for they affect looſneſs as well in their Habit as in their life. Their ſhirts they tuft with Silk on the back, as alſo the Necks, which the Gentry adorn with Pearls, Gold, Silver, or Precious ſtones. In Summer the Citizens wear white Felts, in Winter Caps turned with Beaver or ſome other Furs, and the <hi>Kneeſes, Bojars</hi> and other Perſons of the greateſt quality Black Fox and Sables. The Habit of the Women is not ſo much different from that of their Men, as they differ from each other, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Quality of the Perſon. They wear generally Caps turned with Sables or other Furs but greater than the Mens, ſet with Pearls and Rubies upon the Crown, under which they let their Hair hang in its full length, theſe are thoſe of higher Rank and Quality; thoſe of meaner Condition have them only turned with red Fox. The Young-women when they grow Marriageable, have their hair knotted up above the crown of the Head in a round ball, but under the age of 10 or 12 years have their Heads all ſhaven, except only two Tufts that hang down on each ſide ſo that they can hardly be diſtinguiſhed from Boys in their Habit, only the Girls are known by the great rings which hang at their Ears. On this manner the Gentry and Citizens are attired, but the Peaſantry as poorly as thoſe of <hi>Lifeland,</hi> and much after the ſame manner. Their Upper-garment is ordinarily of ſheeps-skins, with a Cap of the ſame ſtuff; their Boots and Shooes are made of the Barks of Trees cunningly plated.</p>
               <p>The Women are by nature well proportioned,<note place="margin">Painting of faces in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ruſsian Women.</note> and fair enough to boot if they did not paint, which they do ſo botchingly that every one may diſcern it. <hi>Spanish</hi> Wool and Tincture of Brazil-wood it ſeems they do not yet know the uſe of, but inſtead of that uſe Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and <hi>Minium,</hi> and for Flake, a dull White-Lead, or Ceruſe at beſt.</p>
               <p>The Reader may obſerve that their manner of Marriages is far different from that in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi>

A <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Youth inclinable to admitt himſelf into the conjugal number detects his purpoſe and deſire to his Parents, or neareſt in Conſanguinity, who thereupon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33105:93"/>
go about and ſeek out a Virgin ſuiting his Degree and Condition, whom having found, they apply themſelves to her Parents or Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, to treat about the ſubject; where neither the Young man nor any near Relation of his are to ſee the Bride, in ſum the Purchaſe is like a <hi>Pig in a Poke,</hi> for all people of faſhion keep their Daughters chamber'd, ſetting always an old Woman to look to her, who is as vigilant in her Office, as a Turn-key at <hi>Wood-ſtreet</hi> Counter. And hence it comes that they live in perpetual Jarrs, and contention, when ſometimes in hopes of a ſweet, well-ſhaped, and comely Darling, they are chain'd to a ſtinking, crooked and deformed Hag. This induces me to a Tale of a young Squire, who thinking himſelf old enough to be a man, intimated his Inclinations to a common Broker, or Match-maker, withall conditioning beforehand that he would not come to any concluſion with the Parents of his Party, till he had by ſome means or other got a ſight of her Face, which the man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do; and accordingly goes to an old Couple who had long intreated him to procure a Husband for their Daughter: this ſaid Couple he acquaints with the buſineſs who no leſs joyfull to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it pray'd him to haſten the Match: now you are to underſtand by the way that their daughter had but one eie, which made ſome difficulty in the carrying on the matter, by reaſon that the Young man would not venture upon the purchaſe, unleſs he ſaw what kind of a Bargain he had: However the Broker gives her inſtructions, how to behave her ſelf in paſſing by the Houſe where this Youngman was to be, and bad her look alwaies on one ſide, which ſhe did. The young man peeping through a creviſe, ſaw her have a good half face, aſſents to the Articles and Propoſitions whatſoever they ſhould be, but comming before the Altar, was ſo concerned that he took an Ax and clove his own head.</p>
               <p>They have many quaint Ceremonies about Marriage: thoſe of the higheſt Rank uſe theſe following Rites. The Bridegroom and Bride have each of them one to attend them, to prepare and provide all neceſſaries; theſe they call <hi>Swachas.</hi> The day before the Wedding the Brides <hi>Swacha</hi> goes to the Bridegrooms Houſe to provide and furniſh the Brides Chamber and Bed with what elſe is requiſite, being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with 60, 80, or perhaps 100 Perſons according to the degree and ability of the Parties. Theſe all go in their under-cloaths, bearing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33105:93"/>
each ſomething upon their Heads which will be requiſite at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Having once entred the Chamber ſhe takes the Bed and ſpreads it upon 40 ſmall Garbs of Ry, which is firſt brought thither by her Husband, together with a great number of litle Barrels, containing ſeveral ſorts of Grain, ſet up and down the Room, which perhaps will ſignify Fruitfullneſs in procreation. The next morning the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom goes to the Houſe of the Bride accompanied with the Prieſt who is to marry them, where they are kindly received by the Friends of the Bride, and invited to ſit down, and here they have 3 ſorts of Diſhes brought before them, which they nevertheleſs touch not. Here the Bridegroom is to tarry ſo long diſcourſing with the Friends of the Bride, till ſhe ſends a Servant to introduct him into her Chamber, where being come ſhe is brought in, ſtately apparrel'd, and ſet by his ſide, but he not ſuffered to look her in the Face, nor ſhe him, and when they cannot withhold their curioſity but offer to look aſide, as longing to ſee that dear Viſage, which ever after they may mutually do with more freedom than any other in the World, there is a Flag or Tablet of red Silk ſet between them, to hinder it. When they are ſet the Brides <hi>Swacha</hi> plates the Hair of the Bride, and ſets a Gold or Silver Coronet upon her Head, richly ſet with Precious ſtones and Gems, to which are fixed two long Pendants of Diamonds, or (if it be Perſons of a lower Calibre) of baſer ſtones, theſe hang down to their Breaſts. So ſoon as the Bride is dreſs't, the Bridegrooms <hi>Swacha</hi> likewiſe combs his head; upon which all the Women fall a dancing. After they have danc'd a litle, there come in two young men with a Basket of White bread and a great Cheeſe upon a Barrow, covered with Sables, which is conſecrated by the Prieſt and ſent to the Church. When this Ceremonie is ended, they bring a great Silver Charger, and ſet it upon the Table, in which are laid ſome pieces of <hi>Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Taf,</hi> with ſeveral Square plates of Silver, as alſo a handfull of Hops, Barley and Oats, mixt together: upon that that the <hi>Swacha</hi> ariſes and covers the Face of the Bride, and ſtrows the mentioned things out of the Charger amongſt the Gueſts, when as thoſe that are minded may take up the pieces of Silver. When that is done the Parents of the Parties interchange the Rings of the young people.</p>
               <p>When theſe Ceremonies are ended, the <hi>Swacha</hi> ſets the Bride in a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33105:94"/>
Riding-ſledge which is richly accoutred and ſet out with Cloth of Gold, and Fringes ſuitable: The Horſe is alſo covered with coſtly Trappings and rich Furrs. Then follows the Bridegroom, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Prieſt both on Horſe-back; and after them the Friends on both ſides. When they enter the Church the Bridegroom takes his Place which is covered with Taffataf, whither alſo the Bride is brought. When they are ſet together there are ſeveral Images of Saints ſet up before them, upon which the Prieſt pronounces a Bleſſing: and afterward taking the Bridegroom by the right hand, and the Bride by the left, asks, <hi>Are you content to enter the ſtate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony together?</hi> The Parties then anſwering, <hi>Yea,</hi> the Prieſt ſings the 128 Pſalm, which they likewiſe mutter out after him. This done the Prieſt ſets a Garland upon their Head, uttering theſe Words, <hi>Increaſe and multiply, what GOD joyns together let no man ſeperate.</hi> Then all the Friends light their Torches, and the Prieſt takes a Glaſs of Red Wine into his Hand, which he delivers over to the Bridegroom and Bride to drink off, then taking the empty Glaſs from them delivers it to the Bridegroom who throws it down and the Bride ſtamps it with her foot to powder, ſaying, <hi>So may they fall before our feet, and be crushed to powder, who go about to ſet us at enmity together.</hi> Upon that the Married Women ſtrow them with Hemp, wiſhing them Proſperity and a happy union. Theſe Ceremonies being ended they return home again after the ſame manner that they went to Church. So ſoon as they have entred the Houſe, the Bridegroom goes and takes his ſeat at the Table where he receives, and bids all his Gueſts welcom but the Bride is brought directly into her Chamber where the <hi>Swacha</hi> undreſſes her to the Shift and lays her down upon the bed, The Bride being thus laid ſends to call her Bridegroom by two of her Servants with Torches in their Hands. Immediately upon his entring the Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe jumps out of the Bed and puts on a Gown fur'd with Sables, and giving him the hand goes out with him, but her Servants in the mean time put out their Torches by running them into one of the litle Barrels [mentioned in Pag. 142] Thus hand in hand they go to the Table where all the Gueſts ſit. The firſt Diſh which is brought up is a roaſted Pullet, this the Bridegroom himſelf is to carve and throws ſome part thereof over his Shoulder which the Brides <hi>Swacha</hi> catches in a Napkin, and keeps for a Monument. When the Meal is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33105:94"/>
done the Bridegroom takes his Bride by the hand and ſo leading her to her chamber they go to bed, upon which all are to go out of the Chamber, and the Muſic which ſits before the Window expecting Notice of it imediately fall a playing, and upon that a noiſe of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petters begin to ſound, and ſometimes the Kettel-Drums to beat. After they have been about an hour in Bed the <hi>Swachas</hi> come and conduct them to the Bath, where they are both bathed and waſhed with Wine, Water and Metheglin, dulcified with odorous flowers and ſpices, and, as the cuſtome is at <hi>Moſcou,</hi> the Bride preſents her Bridegroom with a Bathing ſhirt. After they have bathed they come and accompany their Gueſts, who all the time were merry at Table, in which Humors they continue ſometimes a Week, or 10 days, before they depart to their reſpective Lodgings.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Ceremonies are ſuch as thoſe of the beſt rank uſe, by which you may perceive more vanity than Reaſon in this Folk: However I think we have no great cauſe to hiſs at them for their folly, ſince we have as many inſignificant Rites amongſt our ſelves, which are with them equally ſenceleſs and as plain puerility, as theirs may be eſteemed by us.</p>
               <p>But as for the Plebeïans and Peſantry theirs is after a different manner. The day before the Marriage is to be ſolemnized, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſends a Kinſman of his own to the Brides Houſe with new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, a Cap, a pair of boots, a Comb and a Box of painting and other materials for Rigging. The day following comes the Prieſt and gives the benediction: which done, he brings them a Looking-glaſs requiring them to look into it both at once. In the mean while the <hi>Swachas</hi> ſtrow the Gueſts with Hops wiſhing that the Bride may be as fruitfull and increaſe her ſtock, as that <hi>hopefull</hi> Weed. After that comes another who preſents the Bride with a Sable or Beaver-skin, withall wiſhing her ſo many Children as there are <hi>Hairs</hi> upon the Hide. Theſe Ceremonies ended at home they go to Church, and are married. in manners as before.</p>
               <p>After the Wedding is paſt, the Women keep at home for ſometime together, not daring to ſtirr out.</p>

               <p>SO much, kind Reader, may ſerve by way of account about their Marriages, as to what I have obſerved my ſelf, although I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſome have written otherwiſe and deſcribed theſe Solemnities much different to what I have found them, yet rather willing to fee with my own eies than with anothers, ſo I thought fit likewiſe, rather to give you theſe few Memorials with my own pen than (as ſome Plagiaries of late have done) tranſcribe out of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Ruſſes.</hi>
                  </note>If we regard the forementioned Manner of their procuring Wives, without any former ſight or converſation, Reaſon will inform us, that they muſt needs live diſcontented Lives, which oftentimes turn to Divorcement at laſt. Divorcements are with them very frequent and thoſe obtained upon very eaſy terms; for when either partie finds themſelves too weak at blows, and not able to repugn the other, 'tis only to ſhave and betake themſelves to a Cloyſter, whence they may never be brought out by any legal mean. The Man ſo going into a Cloyſter is capable of Holy Orders, after a certain Term of years, if he be accordingly qualified. They are alſo divorced when either Party is convict of Fornication, and the Offender confined to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery. Barrenneſs is alſo the Occaſion of Divorcement, upon which the Wife becomes a Nun, and the Husband may marry again within ſix Weeks.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who marry again after once Divorced are for ever after excluded the Church, yet may enter the Porch or Gallery, but if they be divorced a ſecond time and married a third, they are totally Excluded the Church and Congregation.</p>
               <p>They have ſeveral ſuperſtitious Ceremonies concerning purity, as to the outward, and carry themſelves very ſtrictly according to the Traditions of the Church. They hold it not for ſo hainous a Sin
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33105:95"/>
to perform the Works of Unchaſtity with a Woman, as to do it in preſence of an Image, or having their Croſs about them, for that they lay off upon ſuch Occaſions, and if it be in the Room where an Image hangs, they draw a Curtain before it, as if they were ſure that that Image was an Informer, and one that got Bread and Butter for telling School-tales.</p>
               <p>They are very obſerving of their Duty in the great Faſt at which time if any man among them chance to ſleep, he is forbidden to communicate, during the Term of a year and 9 days. If it be a Prieſt he is ſuſpended from Office and Benefice for a whole year; but if a Proponent, he is rendred incapable of taking any ſacred Function upon him ſo long as he lives.</p>
               <p>They hold it for a Crime unpardonable for a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> to marry with a Stranger, but to commit Adultery with a Heretic-Woman only Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and pardonable in it's own nature, but if a Woman of that nation become Proſtitute to another of a different Opinion to their own, it is not accounted ſo hainous, by reaſon that the Offſpring may be educated in their Religion, and conſequently tends to the Increaſe of the Church, for they have a Maxim contrary to that of <hi>S. Paul, Ne faciamus mala ut eveniant bona,</hi> Let us not do Evil that Good may come of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe external ſuperſtitions of purification are the main reaſon that every perſon that is of any Conſiderable Ability, has a Bathing-tub in his Houſe, which in <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> are equally made uſe of for Purification and Health. They have alſo Common Baths in every Town and Village, whither both Men and Women, without any diſtinction have recourſe; running in and out naked, only ſome of the Women for Modeſty ſake have a few Bur-dock leaves about their middle, which are firſt dried and afterward laid to ſteep in Oil of Olives, which afterwards they rub their Bodies with, in the Sweating-tub. They can indure extremity of Heat and Cold to a Miracle, for I have ſeen them run out of the Water, which I could not ſuffer my finger in, and of a ſudden over Head and Ears in Snow, where they would lay a quarter or half an Hour and then into the Bath again, that remained ſcalding hot, which if one ſhould do who is not hardned to it from the very Cradle, he were ſure to leave his skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. Beſides the ſeveral Inſtances I have already given you,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33105:96"/>
I have ſeen the Children walking over the Ice, without either Boots, Shoes or Stockings, and that in ſuch piercing cold Weather that we could not go out of Doors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants that have their Reſidence at <hi>Moſcou,</hi> have alſo (conformable to the manner of the Countrey) their Baths, which they ſtrow with odoriferous Spices and Flowers, and make frequent uſe thereof. When they have bathed ſo long as they think good, they have a Retiring-room in which is a Sweating-tub or Stove, whither they go and rub themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> as they differ from all other Nations as well in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as in Habit, ſo they have ſeveral Cuſtomes, Geſtures and Actions proper ſolely to themſelves. Their Shirt they wear above their Breches and tie it above the Waſt with a Girdle, like their upper Garments; When they Whiſtle they do it through their Teeth, not with their lips, ſaying, that in ſo doing they abuſe their true ſhape in which GOD has formed them: When they are ſurprized either with Wonder, or a ſudden Danger, they do not throw back their Head, like the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> nor ſhrink up their Shoulders, as do the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but throw their Head firſt upon one Shoulder, and then upon another, or perhaps turn it round, as a Fencer flouriſhes his Rapier, or an Enſign his Colours in token of Victory.</p>
               <p>When they pray they do it not upon their knees as we do, thinking that GOD is diſpleaſed with ſuch an irregular poſture: and when they write they never make uſe of a Table, altho they have one at their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, but alwaies upon their knees; and what they write is altogether in Rolls, paſting one ſheet to another as they write them. Fatneſs they hold for a prime token of Beauty, as alſo long fore head and eies for which they pull and draw as much as they can to correct nature, which in things of ſmaller moment they ſeem to abhor and deteſt, if a property of other People.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of their Sick.</note>About the Sick and Burial of their Dead the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> have theſe following Cuſtomes. When any lies Sick, and by his Friends thought in danger of long Continuance or Death, they ſend for a Prieſt who adminiſters the Communion to him, he firſt confeſſing the moſt noted Sins he can remember that he has done in his life time, to the Prieſt alone, adding a Promiſe and Reſolution to live a pious and devout Life, if GOD grant him recovery. When he has communicated,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33105:96"/>
they ſhave, anoint and put him in a Monks-hood, which they call the <hi>Seraphic Weed</hi>: After which they adminiſter no more Phyſic to him, but commend him to the Grace of GOD. Now if it happen that he recover, he is obliged to abandon Wife, Children and Eſtate for ever, and betake himſelf to a Monaſtery, where he is to ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his days.</p>
               <p>But if our Patient dy,<note place="margin">Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Queſtions propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the dead.</note> then all the Neighbours and Friends come together to bewail the deceaſed asking the Corps, how he came to dy, and for what reaſon, for what defect or want, like thoſe of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> remembred in my firſt Voyage. I remember that having occaſion to viſit a Countreyman of mine upon a Munday morning I entred the Houſe, where the Maſter was dead and the Corps laid out, above a ſcore of old Women, were ſet round about him, and ſpeaking to him as if they expected ſome anſwer from him; but above all, his Wife began to howl and yell aloud, who in his life time wiſhed him a thouſand times in Hell, for he behaved himſelf very ſeverely towards her. <hi>Oh,</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>Timminni Do Shinca</hi> [for that was his name] <hi>my Deareſt, how haſt thou left me thus? What failing didſt thou diſcover in me? Did I ever neglect to paint my ſelf? Have I not brought forth a fair Iſſue? Hadſt not thou all things at Command? Metheglin I am ſure we had always in plenty, nay, and Brandy too. What then perſwaded thee to leave me deſolate and forlorn, Oh remember the diſconſolate ſtate of Widdow-hood and return to the merry World,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, and many other fooliſh expreſſions by way of Interrogation, ſhe accoſted him with, which made me at firſt to think that he was not fully dead. So ſoon as the Party is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they open the Windows, and ſet Baſons of Holy-water, together with ſeveral Diſhes of meat beſide the Body, to relieve his Wants on ſo long and tedious a Journey, as do the <hi>Circas Tartars</hi>; which ſeems to be the Reliques of Heatheniſm, not long ſince profeſſed in many parts of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> Imediately upon his departure they ſend Brandy, and Beer, with other Liquors and Preſents to the Prieſt, who is to pray for his Soul. The Body they waſh from Head to foot, as doe the Jews, then winding it in a ſheet, put it into a Coffin which is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out of a Tree, and ſo carried to Church, where they beſprinkle it with holy Water, and perfume it with Incenſe; which done they ſay Maſs, and with ſeveral Hymns commit it to the Ground.</p>
               <p>But if a Perſon die without adminiſtration of the Extreme Unction,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33105:97"/>
be Murthered, or Frozen to death, or die by any unnatural or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means, whether caſual, or thereto condemned to ſatisfy Juſtice, the Corps is not permitted to enter the Sanctuary, but carryed to a place to that end appointed, which they call <hi>Zemski Precaus,</hi> where it is expoſed to public view, and if it be a perſon unknown, is to remain there 3 or 4 days to ſee if any will own the Body, which if none come to claim it is immediately carried to another Place without Town, which they call <hi>Boghze Dome,</hi> that is <hi>Gods Houſe,</hi> and there thrown into a great Pit, where ſometimes a Hundred or more Bodies lie on a Heap uncovered, till about Midſummer, at what time, the Prieſts go and cover them, with a few Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies which are uſed in ſome places in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> differ from others. About <hi>Moſcou</hi> the Corps is follow'd by a Train of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women who are neareſt in Conſanguinity or Affinity, who with a great Noiſe and Howling bewail the early departure of their Friend, then preſently all are ſilent, that not one is ſo much as heard to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or give a Sigh, and then on a ſudden elevate their Voice and yell out like ſome of the more bruitiſh and ſavage <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On each ſide the Herſe go the Prieſts, Chaplains and Monks, bearing Images, Torches, and a Thurible, or Incenſe-pan, which is all the while waved to and again, to expell Evil Ghoſts which they believe ſtill haunt the Body of the Deceaſed. After the Corps follow the Friends and Acquaintance, without any order, each car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Wax-tapour in the Hand. When they come to the Grave, the Coffin is opened and the Incenſe pan ſwing'd 3 times over the Corps in remembrance of the H. Trinity, and then the Image of that Saint which he in his Life time made choice of for his Patron, is thrown into the Coffin with him, upon which all his Relations come near and take their laſt view of him, kiſs the Coffin and go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When the Friends have ſo taken their leave the Prieſt delivers him a Letter ſuperſcribed to Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> containing a hearty recommendation of the Deceaſed. A copy of one of theſe came once to my hand which before I had Tranſcribed it out, was taken from me by a Prieſt being the Brother of the Gentleman who lent it me, for it is not lawfull for a <hi>Ruſsian</hi> himſelfe to know the Contents, much leſs for a Heretic. The Paraphraſe of the Fragment was after this Manner,

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Religion and Church-Government of the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> The Patriarch and his Office. Of their Sacraments, &amp;c.</head>

                  </note> but tainted with many ſuperſtitious Ceremonies about Imagery and other Relicts of Gentiliſm; which the good Emperour <hi>Baſilius</hi> about the year 989. rooted out of his Empire, baptizing himſelf, and cauſing all his Subjects to do the like. They boaſt mainly of their Continuance and Conformity with the Primitive Church, which they ſay is ſtill the ſame in purity without the ſtains of Innovation, as indeed in many things it ſeems to be nearer than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſwell in matter of Faith as Government of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:33105:98"/>The Church of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> has like that of <hi>Rome,</hi> one ſupreme Head, who is the Patriarch. Under the Patriarch are 4 Metropolitans, 4 Arch-Biſhops, beſides many other Biſhops, Abbots and the Inferior Clergy. The Patriarch is almoſt Sovereign in Spiritual Affairs, having an abſolute and immediate power without any appendency on the Temporal Government unleſs it be in caſe of inducing Hereſy, upon which he muſt Submit to a Synod, as in the year 1662, a General Council was called, and the Patriarch ſummoned to make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; at what time he was impeached for Innovations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring to alienate the preſent condition of the Church and reform it's Government by diminiſhing Image-worſhip, which he held for litle better than Idolatry. After many days ſitting that Council thought fit to confine him to his Manſion-Houſe, and ordain the Firſt Metropolitan in his room, who was then living when I was at <hi>Moſcou.</hi> The Revenues of the Patriarch, as alſo of the Metropolitans, are very great, out of which they are obliged to levy and Maintain an Army of 15000 men, during the time of War.</p>
               <p>The Habit of the Patriarch, and the Metropolitans differ but litle. The Patriarch has always a great Croſier born before him, or a litle one in his hand and ſometimes both, this they call a <hi>Poſok.</hi> Mitres they wear only upon Convocations or high Aſſemblies, and upon ſolemn Occaſions. Abroad they are diſtinguiſhed by a high Cap, flat at top like the <hi>Switzers,</hi> or Yeomen of the Guard. Next their Bodie they wear a Caſſoc, and above that a long Gown or rather a Pall, which is born up by two Gentlemen. The Inferior Clergy and Prieſts wear a Cap but not ſo high as that of the Superiors. This Cap is given them when they are ordained by the Biſhops, at what time they ſhave their Heads, and ſuffer it to grow no more, ſave in two litle tufts juſt above their ears.</p>
               <p>There is a Law among them that whoſoever beats one of thoſe Clerks ſo, that his cap fall to the ground, he is liable to a very ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty (if I well remember to looſe his hand) which nevertheleſs happens frequently in the <hi>Cabac</hi>: but to prevent the worſt when a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is minded to beat one of thoſe Muſhrooms, he firſt takes off his Cap and then trounces him off ſo long as he will, which done he ſets the Cap upon the right Block again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:33105:98"/>The Clergy are not forbidden Marriage, nor none that ſerve at the Altar, but on the contrary are obliged to marry, and that only once,<note place="margin">Of the Marriage of the Clergy.</note> gathering that from the Saying of S. <hi>Paul. A Bishop ought to be the Husband of one Wife.</hi> Nor is it lawfull for him to marry a Widow. If a Prieſts wife come to die before him, he is not only injoyned by the Church to remain a Widdower, but alſo to leave the Altar, yet not wholly to lay down the Prieſtly Function, for he may ſit in the Chore or Chauntry and aſſiſt at Mattins and Veſpers, as alſo at Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, as far as it is done without the Verge of the Altar. For this reaſon the Prieſts are beſt matched, as uſually making much of their Wives, and treating them more gently than the Laïty generally do, leſt by hard uſage they ſhould drive them into melancholy, and conſequently ſend them too early out of the World, which ſends them as ſuddenly from the Altar.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm they hold forth as a Sacrament very neceſſary,<note place="margin">Of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> for which reaſon they make as litle delay as may be between the Womb and the Font. If they fear the Child be weak they have it Baptized at home, but never in the ſame Room where it is born, for that they hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. The Conſponſors or God-fathers being come to the Church Porch, the Prieſt meets them and repeats the Benediction. The Godfathers deliver 9 Wax-candles to the Prieſt, which he places round about the Font afterwards turning about toward the Eaſt mutters out a Verſicle or two, then taking the Incens-pan goes round about the Font, which done he ſings a Pſalm or Hymn, making a brief Oraizon, and after that demands the name of the Infant which is delivered him in writing. So ſoon as he has read the Billet, askes, whether the Child beleeves in the Sacred Trinity? and, Whether he utterly Forſake the Devil, &amp;c. To which they confidently reply in the Affirmative. Then the Prieſt pronounces this Adjuration, <hi>Get thee hence, than unclean Spirit, and make way for the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Then he takes the child into his Arms, blowing three times in his Face, and making a croſs upon his Head, dips it three times in Water, Saying, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the</hi> FATHER, <hi>and of the</hi> SON, <hi>and of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. Having thus plunged the Infant, he puts ſome Salt into it's mouth, anointing the Fore head, Breaſt and Hands with conſecrated Oil, and then draws a clean white ſhirt over it's Body, which done he ſaith, <hi>Now thou art cleanſed from thy Sins.</hi> Laſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33105:99"/>
of all he hangs a Croſs about it's neck of Gold, Silver, Tin, or Ivory, with the Image of ſome Saint, to whoſe Patronage he is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially committed and commended, and ſo the Sum of this Sacrament is performed. The Water is thrown away into a Cave of the Earth, becauſe it is impure. If any Perſon be ſo far beſotted, as to become a Proſelyte and embrace their Religion, he muſt renounce his former Baptiſm, and be rebaptized after their manner, firſt ſpitting 3 times over his ſhoulder in token of Abhorrency of his former Errors.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</note>The Sacrament which we call <hi>Coena Domini,</hi> or the <hi>L. Supper</hi> they hold forth likewiſe as neceſſary to Salvation, receiving it in both kinds, yet not as is uſual among thoſe of the Reformation, for they break the Bread into the Wine, which the Communicant takes with a ſpoon. This Sacrament is alſo adminiſtred to Children, and all under the Notion of Tranſubſtantiation, altho not in ſo full a Sence as the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> The Sick do likewiſe partake of this Sacrament, which is given them upon their Death-bed, as the Hoſt in the Church of Rome.</p>

No time, nay all the time in the year round affoards not more news of Murther: and ſince the Main Faſt happens in the Winter, there are many ſo far beſotted that they are not able to find the way home, but dropping aſleep by the way are ſo frozen to death; whence (if they eſcape the Wolf and Bear) they are carried to the <hi>Zemski Precaus,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Bogzi Dome,</hi> of which we have already made mention.</p>

The Executioner and his Office are not there ſo contemptible as with us, for it is ſometimes purchaſed by the moſt wealthy Merchants in the Land. Other Crimes are puniſhed with Chapping off a Hand or a Foot, and ſometimes only a Finger according to the enormity of the crime. Falſe Coiners have liquid mettal poured down their Throats: and Raviſhment of Virgins [or as our Laws call it a <hi>Rape</hi>] is expiated by gelding of the Delinquant, of which if he recover well and good, but it is very rare that any does.</p>

The Patriarch ſat upon a Horſe apparelled all in white, repreſenting the L. Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Czar</hi> being ſupported by two <hi>Bojars,</hi> led the Horſe by the Bridle, being richly apparreled, with an Imperial Diadem upon his Head. The Patriarch, as was ſaid before, was arrayed with a long white Stole, with a Hierarchichal Infula or Mitre upon his Head, richly ſet with Pearls. In his right Hand was a Croſs of Gold ſet with Diamonds and precious ſtones, with which he ſigned the Multitude that came thronging to him with great Reverence and Devotion. He ſat croſs over the Horſe, which Horſe was ſet out with ſplendid Trappings and richly Cappariſon'd, after the manner of an Aſs. On each ſide the Patriarch went ſeveral Biſhops; and the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy, with white Surplices, Having Thuribles. The Hoſt, the Chalice, the <hi>Pax,</hi> Books, Bells, Tapours and other things uſed at Maſs, beſides a great number of Flags. The Way from the palace to the Creſcent was all laid with Red-cloath. Here it was where the Patriarch firſt took Horſe: the Horſe being there tied to a pale. After the Patriarch follow the <hi>Bojars,</hi> bearing a huge Tree, woven and wound with Silk and Ribbons, as alſo many ſorts of Fruits thereto annexed. Herein ſate ſeveral litle Children, with Apples, green Twigs and Branches. After all came the Mobile, ſtrowing the way with Branches which they had in their Hands, crying out, <hi>Hoſanna Son of David, bleſſed is he that commeth in the name

of the Lord, Hoſanna in the Higheſt, &amp;c.</hi> When they were returned to the Creſcent, the Patriarch gave the Benediction to the Multitude and ſo the Proceſſion ended.

Theſe Ceremonies are ſo univerſally obſerved, that none paſſes the ſtreet without giving and receiving of Eggs of what Condition or Degree ſoever they be. Towards the Evening, they entertain one another, every one in the beſt manner he can, as well Clergy as Laïty, and now are all the Taphouſes, or <hi>Kabacks</hi> crouded with men, where they toſs off whole Bowls of Metheglin, Brandy and ſtrong Beer, till they fall together by the Ears.</p>

               <p>Our whole Company conſiſted in 20 <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 12 we ſet Sail from <hi>Dydenof</hi> which was the Wharf where the Ship <hi>Eagle</hi> was built,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>MARC.</hi> 1669.</note> conducted by the Col. <hi>Boekhoven</hi> about 2 leagues downward. The ſame day in the Afternoon we came to a Town called <hi>Nicholo,</hi> where we found proviſion incredibly cheap. Here I bought ſome Wild-fowl in the Market about as big as Wild-gees, for a <note n="*" place="margin">A coin about the value of a Penny.</note> 
                  <hi>Kopeke</hi> the Couple, and ſatisfyed my Chapman to the full.</p>
               <p>On the 13 we came to <hi>Omula,</hi> which is a Village about 40 [<hi>English</hi>] Leagues from <hi>Dydenof.</hi> After two days Sailing we came to <hi>Pereſlaf,</hi> which is a ſmall City, rebuilt, as I have been told out of the Ruins of <hi>Reſanski,</hi> which formerly was a famous Town, ſurprized by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> demoliſhed, and the Inhabitants, removed to <hi>Pereſlaf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 17 we came cloſe to <hi>Reſanski</hi> where we viewed the Ruins of the City, which teſtified the former Greatneſs and Strength of the Town. From hence we ſailed to the Eaſtern ſide of the River, where we ſaw many famous Houſes and ſtately Buildings, with Fair Orchards and Groves.</p>
               <p>On the 18 we ſaw many goodly Towns and Religious Houſes, and at night arrived at <hi>Novoſolki,</hi> a Place ſolely belonging to the Arch-Biſhop. Here we bought proviſion, and all kinds of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33105:102"/>
that the place affoarded, finding all things very cheap and good: and from hence we ſailed away paſſing <hi>by Schilko, Tericho, Tinersho Slavada, Koponaw</hi> and other fair Towns.</p>
               <p>On the 22 we came to <hi>Kaſſienie-gorod,</hi> a beautifull litle City, and the Reſidence of Prince <hi>Reskitski.</hi> Our Captain and Maſter intended to viſit the ſaid Prince, and for that end came here to Anchor, but coming a ſhoar underſtood that he was departed for <hi>Moſcou,</hi> with the old Princeſs his Mother. However they went to view the Palace, and were magnificently entertained by the ſteward, of whom after the Exchange of ſome Rarities on both ſides, by way of Preſents, they took their leaves. <hi>Kaſsieme-gorod</hi> has been formerly a Hold of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but the preſent Prince at the age of 12 years ſurrendred it up to the great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> whom he as then obtained to be his Protector.</p>
               <p>On the 23 we ſailed paſt many fair Villages, Churches, Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and other Houſes built for Religious uſes, coming the next morning to anchor before <hi>Leshi,</hi> which is a very great Town, but not walled.</p>
               <p>On the 24 we came before <hi>Moruma,</hi> a Town inhabited partly by <hi>Ruſses</hi> and partly by <hi>Mordwin-Tartars</hi> whoſe Countrey begins here, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both the City <hi>Moruma</hi> and the Circumjacient Land-ſhip is at preſent under ſubjection of his Majeſty of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 27 we ſailed by <hi>Prewas Palo</hi> and ſome other leſſer Towns. Near this Place are two Rivers which vent themſelves into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> the one called <hi>Morſna Reka</hi> on the ſtarboard-, and the other <hi>Kleſna</hi> on the larboard-ſide in ſailing downward, which laſt comes from the City <hi>VVolodomur.</hi> The Bank on the one ſide is very high Land, and ſteep, yet above level and fair Land; but to the Northward the Bank is level with the Water, and the Land woody and deſert, nether inhabited nor tilled to any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>On the 28 we ſailed paſt <hi>Isbuilets,</hi> and <hi>Troitska,</hi> dropping anchor before <hi>Slowoda.</hi>

                  <hi>Niſen-gorod</hi> lies in the Latitude of 36 <hi>degr.</hi> and 28 <hi>min.</hi> under a wholſome climat, and in a fertile Countrey.<note place="margin">Niſen-gorod.</note> It is well fortified with Walls, Bulwarks, Towers, Men and Ammunition of War. About 2 [<hi>English</hi>] miles without the City live more Inhabitants than within, being <hi>Ruſſes</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> but in ſubjection to the great Duke. The <hi>Germans</hi> had formerly built two Churches here, one for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and another for the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> both which went to decay upon their leaving the Town. It is here very cheap living, and all things neceſſary for the ſuſtenance of Human Bodies may be procured at eaſy Rates. The Paſtures abound with Cattel the Villages with Poultry, the Woods with Veniſon, the Rivers with Fiſh, and the Land with Corn, Fruit, Roots and Plants. Butter we bought there for 10 <hi>gl.</hi> the 100 <hi>lb.</hi> [which is after the rate of 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>per</hi> pound] and yet we eſteemed that the deareſt Purchaſe we bought there. We bought there a good ſort of Linnen for 2 <hi>ſtivers</hi> the Ell, which ſerved us well for ſhirting and other uſes aboard the Ship. And by reaſon of the Cheapneſs of Proviſion and all neceſſaries, we received here 6 Moneths pay: and becauſe that they had here an excellent Ropeyard, the Heads of our Company thought good to leave the Lieutenant <hi>Schack</hi> with our chief Boatswain, to look after ſome Ropes which we had given order to be made, as alſo to fit us with new Anchors.</p>
               <p>On the 21 <hi>dito</hi> we put off from <hi>Niſen</hi> and left the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the River <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                  </note> This is reputed one of the greateſt and longeſt Rivers in the whole World, taking it's beginning in the higheſt Mountains of <hi>Nova-Zembla,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning paſt <hi>Ieriſlaf,</hi> or <hi>Ieriſlaw, Tweer</hi> and other eminent Cities, whence with many Windings and Turnings it runs through the Land till it come at <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> where it divides it ſelf into ſeveral Heads like the <hi>Nile,</hi> and ſo looſes it ſelf into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, receiving by the way many great and navigable Rivers, and thoſe moſtly on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt ſide: from whence by reaſon that the River receives it's Water, it is ſubject to riſing and falling, as at <hi>Iune</hi> it is at higheſt, and in <hi>Iuly</hi> begins again ſuddenly to decreaſe, inſomuch that it is in all places full of Banks and Sand-beds, as hereafter, in the purſuit of my Journal ſhall more particular and ample mention be made; whereas when it is increaſed to it's heighth, one may ſail over ſeveral

Iſlands. This ſaid River is in ſome places more than 3 [<hi>English</hi>] miles broad, and proving in other places very narrow makeing at each ſide of the River a Whirl-pool, which cannot be avoided without great difficulty. The courſe of this River from <hi>Niſen</hi> to <hi>Caſan</hi> is moſtly Eaſt and South-Eaſt; but from <hi>Caſan</hi> to <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Mare Hyrcanum,</hi> or <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea altogether South. On each ſide the River you have for the moſt part very good Land and many fair Towns, as I have already noted, whoſe Inhabitants are ſedulous in their Husbandry, and are well ſupplyed with the particular Products of all the ſeveral Landſhips adjacent on this noble River, as alſo with many ſorts of excellent Fiſh. In times paſt the <hi>Wolga</hi> was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated by the <hi>Coſaks</hi> of <hi>Don,</hi> who being very ſtrong in ſmall ſhipping, would ſometimes, ſurprize, aſſail and take the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Fiſhermen and <hi>Strougs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 22 we paſſed by the Iſlands <hi>Tlerinski</hi> and <hi>Subſinski,</hi> but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening were fain to drop anchor, by reaſon of the many Sands and Banks.</p>
               <p>On the 23 we weighed but found our Anchor faſt among the Roots of the Trees, which coſt us ſome pains to get clear. About mid-day we got the Iſland <hi>Dioploy,</hi> about 3 in the afternoon <hi>Muſa,</hi> and about the Evening <hi>Kremonsky,</hi> where we anchored.</p>
               <p>On the 24 we proceeded forward and got <hi>Parmino,</hi> where we took in Proviſion, which we found very good and of a low Price. From hence we looſed, and ſailed by many pleaſant Iſlands, Towns, and an Excellent proſpect from Land, which was ſtored with Cattel, fruitful Dales, Woods, Meadows, Currents and whatſoever natural Delights that may content the heart of Man.</p>
               <p>On the 29 <hi>dito</hi> we came to <hi>VVaſili-gorod</hi> a litle Town on the Weſt ſide of the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and becauſe it was here a level Countrey we tooke the heighth of the <hi>Arctic</hi> Pole, which we found 55 <hi>degr.</hi> and 50 <hi>min.</hi> above the Horizon. This ſaid Town was then without Gates or Walls, and is built moſtly of wood, ſave only Public Edifices, and Religious Houſes, which are there but few, ſince it has not been long in poſſeſſion and ſubject to the <hi>Czar,</hi> or great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> On the South-ſide of <hi>VVaſiligorod,</hi> is a litle River called the <hi>Soura,</hi> which here guſhes out with a violent ruſhing and buzzing into the <hi>VVolga.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:33105:103"/>Above <hi>VVaſiligorod</hi> begins the Land of the <hi>Ceremish Tartars</hi> which extends it ſelf out as far as <hi>Caſan.</hi> Thoſe again are divided into two ſorts of People; The one ſort is called <hi>Nagorni,</hi> which are thoſe that inhabit the hilly Countrey, and the other <hi>Lugowy</hi> who dwell moſtly in the Valleys. The former follow altogether Paſturage, the latter Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, for which they have a happy Land, bleſſed with a fertile Soil. The Inhabitants are a rude and barbarous People, utter ſtrangers to good Manners and Learning. They ſpeak for the moſt part the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Language, but ſome places there are where they ſpeak <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and in other places they have a peculiar Tongue of their own. They are the moſt ſtupid Heathens that I have yet ſeen in all my 3 Voyages, have neither Sence nor light of a Divine Power. Houſes of Worſhip, and Prieſts, Reſurrection, Heaven and Hell are things they never heard of, nor nor will ever learn to know what they are. However I may not be ſo general but that I may except ſome, who have ſome light and knowledge of an immortal God, and ſuch an one as has the direction of all, but only rules them as a King upon Earth does his Subjects. They are further of Opinion that there are Devils or evil Spirits, whoſe power is limited and circumſcribed, and that they cannot do any miſchief ſave only in this Life, for theſe doubt much about the Reſurrection, and for this end they do Sacrifices to them as do the <hi>Madagaſcars</hi> that they ſhould do them no harm. They tell you of a ſtrange Water by the means whereof the Prince of the Devils comes in horrible and moſt ugly ſhapes, for which they dread, as Children do Bugbears they never ſaw. To that Immortal Deity and divine Eſſence they offer up all manner of Beaſts as Oxen, Horſes, and Sheep, which when they do, they take the Hide and ſtretch it out upon a Rack made on purpoſe, making thereby a Fire, over which they hang the Fleſh to boil, When it has ſeethed long enough, they take out a Bowl of the Pottage in the one hand, and a Bowl of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin in the other, and throw them both upon the Hide, upon which it falls into the Fire, ſaying, <hi>Accept, O God, this Offering at my Hands, and be pleaſed to hear my Praiers</hi>; which Praiers do commonly import their own Health, or the increaſe of their Cattel. So that their main Opinion about that God, is only that he is a good-natur'd and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent-Lord, and the Devil malevolent, which is all that may be gathered from them. Others I have ſeen who worſhip the Sun,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33105:104"/>
Fire, and Water. Ceremonies about the Dead I could never perceive any, ſave only that when any eminent Man among them comes to dy they make a Feaſt of Horſe-fleſh, at which all the neareſt Relations are preſent, and the Corps given to a ravenous Beaſt called <hi>Brigga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol,</hi> which I have not elſewhere ſeen: That done they hang up his Veſtments upon a Tree in memory of him, as we do Eſcutcheons, and this was all I could learn of my ſelf, or from the Obſervations of others that had been longer and further within Land. Their Habit is as courſe as their Breeding, moſtly of Skins or a kind of Canvas. Their Upper-coat comes down only to the Thighs, and their Breeches and Stockings all one. Thoſe that are married ſhave their Heads, but whilſt ſingle they let their hair grow, but all in one Tuft, which they commonly ty up in a ball above their head, or plate it, as our Jockies do their Horſe-tails. The Women wear alſo courſe Garments having their faces muffled up to the eies: but more quaint is the Habit of a Young-woman ready to marry, who beſides other od accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wears a piece of Wood, ſhaped like a horn directly upon her Fore-head, about an Ell in length, and at the ſmall end a litle Bell. Circumciſion they have not yet learn'd from the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Iews,</hi> nor yet Baptiſm from the Chriſtians; but have ſome few Ceremonies about the naming of their Children, which is done when they are about half a year old. Polygamy is in uſe among them, and that without any order or regard to nearneſs in Blood, for it has been well known that the Father takes the Daughter and ſo procreates Iſſue, and the Son the Mother, after the manner of the <hi>Cingaleezes</hi> in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> where the Father about marrying his daughter out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves her of her Virginity, ſaying, <hi>Should I plant a Tree and not enjoy the Firſt-fruits my ſelf?</hi>

Having diſpatched here we weighed anchor, and on the 3 of <hi>ditto,</hi> gain'd the Iſland <hi>Coſin</hi> where we were faſt again, but without much difficulty got clear. We ſailed that day paſt <hi>Sundir,</hi> a handſome litle Town, and dropp'd anchor before <hi>Cokſchaga</hi>: looſing thence we were fain to caſt out our Fore-anchor to hale over a Foord, which was 10 <hi>Dutch</hi> leagues long, and found work enough to bring the Veſſel over, however after much pains taken we gaind the Deep, without any damage to the Ship.</p>
               <p>On the 4 we came paſt the Shallow places, and before <hi>VVolofka</hi> were faſt again, where we were fain to caſt anchor and wind our ſelves off. At night we lay before <hi>Swiatkhi,</hi> which is a fortify'd Town, having many fair Churches and Monaſteries within walls.</p>
               <p>On the 5 we weighed anchor and ſet Sail, having a brisk Gale, which in 3 hours time, or leſs brought us before the River <hi>Caſanka,</hi> from which River the City and Kingdom of <hi>Caſan</hi> have their name, here we came to anchor where ſome ſmall Shipping belonging to that place, aiming to enter the River, ran againſt our Bow and ſome fell overboard.</p>
               <p>Here about is a very fair Countrey and as fertile as any that ever I have ſeen in all my Life.

               <p>On the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Caſan,</hi> together with the Metropolitan came aboard, where they ſeemed to receive great ſatisfaction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never ſeen the like before. The Common people came likewiſe flocking in great multitudes to ſee a floating Caſtle, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the aw of the Deputy and Provincial, we had much ado to keep them off, for they ſtrove to come aboard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſan</hi> is a great City, and reaſonably ſtrong,<note place="margin">Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>Caſan.</hi>
                  </note> but it's Walls and Towers of Wood, as almoſt all the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Towns are. The Cittadel is walled with ſtone, and well provided of Ammunition and Men. The Town is ſituated upon a Hill, but in a Champan Countrey. The Cittadel is encompaſſed with the <hi>Caſanka,</hi> which renders the Water within inexhauſtible in time of Siege. The Traffic of this Place is very conſiderable, regarding the Countrey it lies in. It is frequented by the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> who bring thither all manner of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe their Land affoards, and not only the vendible Products of the Earth and Cattle, but as orderly their own Children, which they ſell at a low rate, a Boy or a Girl of 16 years of age, for the value of 20 Crowns a piece. The City <hi>Caſan</hi> is equally inhabited by <hi>Ruſſians</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> and governed by a Deputy, as we have already ſaid, but the Cittadel kept ſolely by <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> where no <hi>Tartar</hi> is to come upon pain of Death. There is beſides the Deputy (who is only as Preſident and ſupreme in Civil Matters) an extraordinary <hi>VVay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode,</hi> who is always as Superintendant in time of War, having the ſole Direction of Martial Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Countrey of <hi>Caſan,</hi> which has been formerly a Kingdom, is of a very wide extent; bounded on the North with <hi>Syberia,</hi> on the Eaſt with <hi>Nagaya,</hi> and on the South with the River <hi>VVolga.</hi> This Countrey was formerly very populous and able to bring a great Army to field, as in recorded of their famous Expeditions againſt the <hi>Ruſſes</hi>; but ſince depopulated, made waſt and ſubdued, by <hi>Baſilius Ivanowitz,</hi> who overcame theſe <hi>Caſan-Tartars</hi> in a very bloody Battail, and after that ſo notable a Conqueſt ſet a Vice-Roy. This <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> although a <hi>Caſan-Tartar,</hi> was always more loyal to the <hi>Czar,</hi> than favourable to his own Countreymen; which occaſioned great murmurings and jealouſy, among the <hi>Caſaneers,</hi> that at laſt they called in the <hi>Crim-Tartars</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:33105:106"/>
for their aſſiſtance, who were <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Theſe made not much delay, but on a ſudden raiſed a mighty Army, which incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the Rebells gave the Vice-Roy battail, and gain'd the Field, and purſuing the ſucceſs of the day invaded the Emperours Territories. The <hi>Czaar</hi> in the mean while being informed by Expreſs that the Hoſtility kept the Field, had put the Forces under Conduct of the Vice-Roy to flight, and that they approached with a great Body, he levied as great an Army as he could do with ſo ſhort war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ingaged with the <hi>Tartars</hi> in open Field. But the Hoſtility increaſing more and more, what with their own Nation, and what with the Malecontents within the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Juriſdiction, were almoſt 15 to 3, and after a ſhort but very hot Battel the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was fain to flee and betake himſelf to <hi>Novogorod.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> ſeeing themſelves Maſters of the Field, marched forward to <hi>Moſcou</hi> which they attacqued, took in and plundered. However the Cittadel <hi>Cremelena</hi> held ſtoutly forth all the time, without making Propoſals or Articles upon which they would ſeem willing to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it, till at laſt finding themſelves not in a capacity to hold forth they gave it over, upon very honourable Conditions as to themſelves, but diſadvantageous Terms for the great Duke himſelf, and the City of <hi>Moſcou.</hi> Shamefull was this Loſs to the Emperour, and no leſs ground of Honour for the Victory to the Hoſtility, who now as it were in a moment had regained all their Freedoms which from time to time before they had loſt. Right loath was the <hi>Czar</hi> to give his aſſent to the Concluſions of the Treaty, but was at laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſign it with his own hand, partly for that his <hi>Bojars</hi> and Council preſſed him to it, and partly upon his own conſiderations, how that his Countrey in all probability would in caſe he continued refractory be overrun, and he himſelf with all his Race be ſecluded from the Monarchy. The <hi>Tartarians</hi> had 2 Generals, Brethren and equall in command, whereof the elder called <hi>Mendligeritz,</hi> erected a Statue in <hi>Moſcou,</hi> to which he obliged and injoyned the <hi>Moſcovians</hi> to pay certain Homages. The younger called <hi>Sapgeri</hi> marched on for <hi>Caſan</hi> where he had his Reſidence, thinking, that becauſe it had formerly been a Soveraignty, and that the Footsſteps and Reliques of a waſted Kingdom were ſtill apparent, he might the better erect and rear a new Monarchy upon the Foundations of an old. <hi>Mendligeritz</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:33105:106"/>
the elder marched with his Army towards <hi>Rheſan,</hi> well knowing that the great Power of that Province might check him, upon oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. So ſoon as he was ſet down before the Town, he ſignified the occaſion of his coming, ſent the Governour a Copy of the Articles ſigned by the <hi>Czar,</hi> demands the Town, and willed him to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But the Governour (who was a Gentleman both of known Fame and Worth, in regard of his rare Conduct in ſeveral Battails at the Head of an Army) let him know, That all the Infidels and Barbarians in the world ſhould not deterr him ſo far as to tranſgreſs his Duty, and Oath, ſince he himſelf had no ſuch Intelligence from his Lord, the Great Duke, and till he had Aſſurance of what the <hi>Tartarian</hi> General had adviſed him about concerning ſuch Articles, he would defend the Town and Cittadel. The General upon this Anſwer ſent him the Original of the prementioned Articles, and ſo willed him to avoid Blood-ſhed: but the Governour detained the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and kept the Schaedule, reſolving to ſtand out the Siege. Upon this the <hi>Tartars</hi> raiſed the Siege, and attempted to ſtorm the City; but thoſe within couragiouſly defended themſelves, and plai'd of their Canon; together with an inceſſant ſhooting of Arrows, at the Enemy, that they were forced to retreat and remove the Siege to another ſide of the Town, where ſome diſloyal <hi>Ruſsians</hi> had acquainted them that the place was weakeſt and conſequently the moſt eaſy to be ſtorm'd: however finding no hopes of gaining the Town, the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſent a Herauld to urge the Governour to reſign the Papers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf thereupon willing to draw off his Forces, which the Governour refuſing the General left the Town. Several Narratives were ſent off to <hi>Moſcou,</hi> which occaſioned a general Joy, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Townſmen to revolt, and unanimouſly fall upon the Garriſon, who being incapable to make reſiſtance were fain to ſubmit and beg Quarter. The Statue of <hi>Mendligeritz</hi> was alſo pulled down and broke to pieces in deteſtation of his Tyranny. The <hi>Czaar</hi> immediately upon theſe news gathered all the Forces he could, which when drawn to field amounted to 25000 Men, and marched forward to <hi>Caſan,</hi> where he gave the <hi>Tartarians</hi> Battail; and after a hot fight gain'd the Camp, the Enemy retiring into the Weſtern Provinces of <hi>Tartary,</hi> ſhortly after the <hi>Czar</hi> died, without the performance of any honorable atchievment, ſave that during the time of his Reign.

                  </note> but without much difficulty got clear again.</p>
               <p>On the 18 we came cloſe to an Iſland called <hi>Staritzo,</hi> where we anchored, our Pilot went aſhoar to view the ſaid Iſland and coming about 3 furlongs within land found ſtones, of the ſhape and bigneſs of Lemmons which being broken had within the ſimilitude of a ſtar, but thoſe not all alike in Colour, for ſome were like Gold, others like Silver, and others of a Yellow and Tawny colour. This Iſland is ſituated in 45 <hi>degr.</hi> 31 <hi>min.</hi> being of it ſelf about 3 <hi>Dutch</hi> Leagues in length and 2 broad.</p>
               <p>On the 19 we got the Iſland <hi>Potenski</hi> where we came to anchor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that a great ſtorm would come on.</p>
               <p>Upon the 22 we ſailed paſt the <hi>Buytma</hi> which is a branch of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous River <hi>Lanca</hi> being about 12 <hi>Dutch</hi> Leagues from <hi>Caſan.</hi> This ſame River has it's Riſe or Fountain about <hi>Chambretoky</hi> which lies to the North-eaſt of <hi>Caſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we met with a company of Fiſhermen of whom we bought ſome Bream, which they take in great Abundance, and after an od way, which if time had permitted us we would have learned.</p>
               <p>On the 23 we came to a very pleaſant Coaſt where we went to aſhoar, and found there the Ruins of a great City which had been made waſt by <hi>Tamarlan.</hi> While we lay here it began to blow very hard, and the next day we were fain to keep at anchor. In the mean time I went with ſome of our Ships Company to the Hill <hi>Arbuchin,</hi> where we found the Ruins of another City, bearing one name with the ſaid Hill. In aſcending the Hill we found a great ſtone with this Inſcription in old <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Words and Letters, IF THOU WILT REMOVE, THOU SHALT NOT

This vexed them ſo that they rather willed to let it ſtand in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, than take the pains to ſet it as it was before, to deceive others.</p>
               <p>The Land round about is very fair and withall of a fat Soil, yet not cultivated, for there are no Inhabitants, but the Relicts of ſeveral Towns and Villages, formerly depopulated by the famous <hi>Tamerlan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 17 we ſailed paſt the River and City of <hi>Adrobe,</hi> lying in the heighth of 54 <hi>degr.</hi> and 48 <hi>min.</hi> At the mouth of this River we were again ſet faſt, and after much labour, and all the means we could imagine to be any way helpfull, we gave the Ship and Yacht both over for loſt, but in the Evening it began to Thunder, and abundance of Rain fell, that the River began to ſwell, and ſo ſet us adrift again.</p>
               <p>On the 29 we came before <hi>Calmaka,</hi> where were many Salt-pits and two new Towns. We found there ſeveral Pans where the Ruſſes made their Salt, which they fetch out of great hollows and cavernal Rocks; this being boiled is ſent up the <hi>Wolga</hi> in <hi>Stroughs,</hi> and ſo diſperſed over the whole Countrey of <hi>Moſcovia.</hi> Theſe Salt-pits keep abundance of Men in imployment, and is no ſmall profit to the Overſeers.</p>
               <p>On the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we ſet ſail again, and after half an hours ſailing ran aground upon a ſand, where after much ado we gott off, but with the Loſs of an Anchor and 80 fathom of our Cable.</p>
               <p>The next day it began to ſtorm very hard, wherefore we thought good to come to anchor, for the River was here about very perillous, and ſo we were fain to continue till the 4 of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we came to <hi>Morrakzy</hi> where we ſaw abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Fiſhers, of whom we bought ſome <hi>Cavear,</hi> and Sturgeon, having as much of that Fiſh as 20 Men could eat for the value of 11 <hi>ſtivers</hi> [or one ſhilling <hi>ſterl.</hi>

                     <hi>AUG.</hi> 1669.</note> but we were informed by the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> that it was there very dangerous to travail by reaſon of Robbers, and the vagabond <hi>Coſaks,</hi> who kept themſelves in the Woods, whence they ſometimes ſalley out in whole bands, and ſurprize Paſſengers. The <hi>Coſaks</hi> alſo haunt the River, having Boats which are made long and ſmall, with which they row admirably ſwift. On one ſide of the <hi>Uſſa</hi> are ſome Mountains and amongſt thoſe one of an incredible heighth called <hi>Sariol Kurgan,</hi> where they ſay an Emperor of the <hi>Tartars</hi> with 70 Kings ly buried, when they came up the <hi>Wolga</hi> with intent to invade <hi>Ruſsia</hi>; which Mountain being bare and rocky, they ſay that the Soldiers carried up ſo much Earth and Mold as was ſufficient. Some of thoſe Mountains are woody and other ſome bare ſtone and cliffs.</p>
               <p>On the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we ſailed forward and came to <hi>Samara,</hi> which is ſo called from a certain River that runs through it; where it runs into the <hi>VVolga.</hi> The City is built four Square, and moſtly of Wood; only the Churches and Cloyſters are built of ſtone.</p>
               <p>The day following we ſaw the Mountain <hi>Coſak-krim,</hi> ſo called from the <hi>Coſaks</hi> which were there beat by the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Army; having ſadly moleſted all the Countrey, under the ſubjection of the <hi>Czaar,</hi> by a continual Plundering: but having at that time received ſuch an overthrow could never ſince complete ſo great a Body, as might be any way obnoxious to the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> Behind <hi>Samara</hi> the Mountains are very high, but <hi>Coſak-krim</hi> ſurpaſſes all the reſt for heighth.

               </p>
               <p>On the 11 we ſailed paſt the Iſland <hi>Zagra,</hi> where we met divers. Fiſhers-boats and ſupplied our ſelves with freſh Fiſh. Here we had news that a great number of <hi>Coſac-Rebells</hi> were entred the Iſland <hi>Satyry-Boggere,</hi> at the mouth of the <hi>VVolga,</hi> on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and annoyed the River.</p>
               <p>On the 12 we ſailed by ſeveral Iſlands, namely <hi>Saſnow, Oſsino, Schip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namago Koltof,</hi> and other not inhabited.</p>
               <p>The next day we ſaw the Mountain <hi>Smiowa,</hi> which in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is as much as to ſay, a Snake, or Dragon, having it's name as I conjecture from its ſimilitude of a Snake, riſing up into hillocks

and falling down again into gaps like a ſerpent when he creeps. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> as alſo the Inhabitants tell us a Fable of a famous Cavalier who went out to kill a monſtrous Animal like a Snake, that waſted all the Countrey round about, and devoured every day 50 Men for a Break-faſt. The Knight having killed the ſerpent it was meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed into a Rock which is now this Mountain.</p>
               <p>The day following we came before <hi>Saratof,</hi> where we caſt anchor, This City lies in 52 <hi>degr.</hi> 12 <hi>min.</hi> in a valley upon a Branch of the <hi>VVolga,</hi> on the larboard ſide in ſailing down, and is only inhabited by a Military Officer and a Garriſon of Soldiers to free the River and Countrey of the <hi>Coſacks</hi> and <hi>Calmuc-Tartars,</hi> whoſe Countrey is bounded here. Theſe <hi>Calmucks</hi> are the moſt ougly and miſhapen People in the World, worſe favoured by far than the <hi>Hotentots</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> which are Angels in Compariſon of thoſe. Their Faces are broad and almoſt four ſquare, their noſes flat, their mouths reaching almoſt from one ear, to the other, their Eies long and ſmall, upon their Heads they wear a Quoif; the reſt of their Habit is ſufficiently denoted in the following Plate. They ſeldom go afoot but moſtly on Horſeback, as if they were Centaurs, for ſome of them do not only eat and drink but alſo ſleep upon their Horſes. Their only weapons is the Long-bow which they uſe with an admirable Dexterity. There is a continual enmity between thoſe and the <hi>Nagayans,</hi> for they perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſteal one anothers Children and Cattel, which they bring to <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> to Market, for there they have 3 ſeveral market days, one for the <hi>Ruſsians</hi> themſelves, another for the <hi>Nagayans,</hi> and another for the <hi>Calmuc-Tartars,</hi> which 2 laſt-named may not come together, altho they be both <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and under the Juriſdiction of the great Duke. The <hi>Calmuks</hi> dwell not in Towns as other People do; but travail all over the Countrey, pitching their Tents where they find a fertile fat Soil, which when their Horſes, Camels, Cows and ſmall Cattel have eaten bare, they break up and march forward to find out ſome other place, as Hiſtorie records of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who without diſpute were the ſame People. Their chief and choice Diet is Horſe-fleſh, which they eat raw after they have rode a litle upon it, thruſting it between the Sadle and the Horſe.</p>
               <p>Upon the 15 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we ſailed paſt 2 Iſlands, to wit, <hi>Criuſna</hi> and <hi>Saponoufka,</hi> as alſo by the Hill <hi>Solottogory,</hi> which is as much as to ſay

               <p>On the 16 <hi>ditto</hi> we came before the River <hi>Ruſlan</hi> on the left hand, right over againſt a round Hill called <hi>Vrak-ofskarul,</hi> from one <hi>Vrak,</hi> a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince who lies there buried.

               <p>The next day it began to blow very hard for which reaſon we were fain to remain that day at anchor, and on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to ſet ſail having a gentle Gale which brought us before the City <hi>Czaritza,</hi> which is as much to ſay <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> or rather <hi>Empreſs,</hi> lying on the Right hand at the foot of a Hill. The City is in it ſelf not great, but very ſtrong mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with 6 Ramparts, or Bulwarks, beſides other Fortifications. The Garriſon is well maintained with Recruits of <hi>Strelitzers,</hi> being a Place of great Truſt and Importance, eſpecially for that it lies upon the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Continent.</p>
               <p>On the 19 we came before the Place where <hi>Czareſ-gorod</hi> of old had ſtood, by the Ruins thereof we could obſerve that City had been built of Brick. It was demoliſhed beſides many others by <hi>Tamerlan</hi> the Great. The ſtones have been of good uſe to thoſe of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they built their Walls. Towers, Churches and Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>On the 20 we haled over ſeveral Riffs and ſhallow Foords, and at laſt ran our ſelves aground upon a ſand, where we ſtuck 3 hours before we could yet clear. From this place where we were faſt all along the Banks to <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> grows great plenty of Liquirice, but all the Land to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea waſt, and not fitt for Tillage.</p>
               <p>On the 21 we got the Iſland <hi>VVeſaway,</hi> which we left on the Starboard-ſide, and that Evening came before <hi>Tzornogar,</hi> or <hi>Tzornojar,</hi>

On each ſide are ſeveral Watch-houſes, with Towers from whence they can ſee the Enemy at a diſtance, the Countrey being level and not Woody. The firſt occaſion of the building of this City was ſaid to be from a party of 400 <hi>Coſacks</hi> which had ſpoiled a <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Caravan, intercepting it between the Land and the Boats, where the <hi>Strelitzers</hi> were, that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Convoy it, and by reaſon that the ſtream was ſo ſtrong that the Boats could not row againſt it, the ſaid Robbers made their eſcape with a very rich Booty.

               <p>On the 22 we ſet ſail and ſaw the Mountain <hi>Polowna</hi> where the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Fablers ſay the Moon goes every night to bed, becauſe that over that Hill is always a great miſt. About 2 in the afternoon we got the Iſland <hi>Kitzier</hi> in ſight and ſpeeded our courſe ſo that we gain'd the ſight of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> before the Sun ſet.</p>
               <p>The 24 before noon by the grace of the Everlaſting GOD we arrived at the long-wiſh'd-for <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> where we for Joy fired all our Guns to the Aſtoniſhment of the Inhabitants, who had never ſeen a Ship of that Burthen and Force before. From the day of our Arrival here, we lay off in the ſtream till the firſt of <hi>September</hi> and then came up cloſe to the Kay with our Ship and Yacht, thanking the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for his ſpecial Bounty, in delivering us through ſo many perils, and bringing us at laſt to our deſired Port.</p>

It is environed with a thick ſtone wall, and that time I was there furniſhed with 500 great Braſs Cannon, beſides a very ſtrong Garriſon, with Ammunition proportionable to defend it againſt the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſaks,</hi> who have often had a deſign to retake it. It gives a very noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from abroad, with it's many Towers and Lofty Piles of Buildings, as well what appertain to the Fortifications as to the Churches and Religious Houſes. It is a famous Town for Traffic, frequented not only by all the Regions of <hi>Tartary</hi> adjoyning to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, but alſo by <hi>Perſians, Armenians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who bring their Goods and Merchandiſes in a certain ſort of Shipping which they call <hi>Boeſes,</hi> being about 80 Tun burthen a piece. But theſe Veſſels cannot Sail by traverſe, but alwaies before the Wind. Of all the ſeveral kinds of Merchandiſe which thoſe of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> deal in, Silk is the chief, ſo that this ſeems to be the ſole Magazin of that Comodity, whence it is re-exported up the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and conſequently through the whole <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> has been formerly the Royal Seat of the <hi>Nagayan Tartars</hi> but making a League with the <hi>Crim</hi>-and <hi>Caſan-Tartars</hi> was a means to detrude the King, and bring the People under the Subjection of the Grand <hi>Czaar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> for according to the Tenure of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, each was obliged to aſſiſt other, whether upon offenſiv or defenſiv Occaſions: ſo that <hi>Ivan Baſilowitz,</hi> declaring war againſt thoſe of <hi>Caſan,</hi> they were aſſiſted by the <hi>Nagayans,</hi> who were beat in open field, and after both Armies defeated, ſeveral Holds belonging to

The Cuſtoms and Duties beſides the Bartering of Commodities in this Citie is a conſiderable profit for the <hi>Czaar.</hi>

                  </note> The Air about <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> is very indifferent and tollerable as to it's Temperature, neither rendred unwholſom by the ſcorching heat of the Summer Solſtice, nor in any caſe inſufferable for the penetrating Froſts in the Winter, as if this place had the benefit of two Climats. Hence is the Soil alſo very fertile and the Countrey fructiferous beyond (I had almoſt ſaid) any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in either of the temperate Zones, if the People and Inhabitants had but two Advantages in cultivating it, which tend mainly to the Improvement and maintenance of Agriculture, that is, an aſſured conſtant Peace, and the Myſteries of Husbandry which we have in the Weſtermoſt Countreys of <hi>Europe.</hi> They have many and various kinds of ſelect Fruits, as Water-Lemmons, Oranges, Apples, Pears, Cherrys, Damzons, &amp;c. The Vineyards are in a ſhort time very much improved, for before the year 1613 that Plantation was not known among them, till certain <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchants beſtowed a Vine upon a <hi>German,</hi> but a Proſelyt and Monk of the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Church, which he planted in a Garden belonging to the Monaſtery: the ſame Vine thriving ſo well, cauſed divers great Merchants to do the like whoſe indeavours had in the ſpace of 3 years that ſucceſs, that they preſented the Emperour with 200 Pipes of Wine, and 50 Pipes of Brandy, upon which the ſaid Emperour gave them all the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement he could to propagate that laudable beginning.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nagayan-Tartars</hi> who for the moſt part inhabit the Champan land about and near <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> are not permitted to dwell in the City; nor may they fortify their villages with Walls or Towers: only by many Intreaties they have obtained a Grant of fencing in their Tents with Stakes and Palizados, to ſecure themſelves from the Aſſaults

The Chimney is turned round with a Weather-cock; in the midle of the Tent they make the Fire, which is commonly of Cows-dung and ſmall Twigs dried together in the Sun about which they ſit, and as they are ready for a Nap drop down one after another.</p>

                  <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> being almoſt on every ſide ſurrounded with ſuch a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Countrey, has good plenty of all ſorts of Fruit brought every day to Market; and thoſe very cheap. Melons I have bought 10 or 12 for the value of a penny and other fruits after a conformable Price. Fiſh and Fleſh they have in better plenty than any where elſe I know in the World. For the value of 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> I bought a huge Sturgeon, a Carp weighing 30 pounds, and 25 Herrings, greater and fatter than ever I have ſeen in <hi>Holland.</hi> Pearch, Pike, Bream and <hi>Sandaks</hi> are there ſo plentifully taken, that only poore people eat them, of which a family of 8 Perſons may have as much as will ſuffice them, for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of 3 farthings. The fiſh <hi>Sandach</hi> is a great Rarity, and proper only to the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and ſuch Rivers as run into it: being about the bigneſs of a Haddock, and ſomething like it in taſt, but much more delicate and faſter, if taken about <hi>November</hi> and the 3 following Moneths. Their Beef and Mutton is exceeding good, ſold uſually for a Farthing the pound. All kinds of Water-Fowl are very plentiful and cheap, eſpecially a ſort of Wild-gees and thoſe we call Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Ducks which the <hi>Tartars</hi> take with Hawks, and bring them in ſuch plenty to Market, that they may be had for a peny the dozen. The <hi>Tartars</hi> who live chiefly by Fiſhing and Fowling uſe alſo Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in ſeveral woody Iſlands about <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> take many Wild-ſwine which are fed with Accorns, that being known for the beſt maſt that is, for Hogs. Theſe they alſo bring to <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> which by reaſon that that Fleſh will take Salt well, they buy and uſe it aboard the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that trade to and again in the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, the more becauſe of it's cheapneſs for none but the <hi>Moſcovians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> buy it, the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> themſelves being moſtly <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and therefore not

permitted to eat it. To be brief, there is not that thing which may delight the Pallat, but may be had for a very mean and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable price, and at a far eaſier rate than the courſeſt Diet which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated people muſt be content with in the Weſt of <hi>Europe</hi>; and if any man of a mean Eſtate could deny himſelf that Society of his Relations and Acquaintance in which every one has more or leſs ſolace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire thither, he may live as contentedly there as the greateſt Lord, or richeſt Merchant in the World, who, as it were in taking Honey are frequently ſtung with the Bee, and in receiving Proſperity and Benefits from the right hand of Fortune, are as often buffeted with her left. However by way of exception I muſt mind you of one thing, that the <hi>Ruſsians</hi> are here at a great Loſs for Brandy, ſince the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Late Edict, the tenure and purport whereof was, That no Brandy ſhould be diſtilled there for a certain term of Years: but upon what inſight it was that moved his Majeſty to order ſuch an Interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I know not; unleſs to prevent the <hi>Strelitzers,</hi> or Soldateſque, to forget themſelves ſo far as to let the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which ly on every ſide the City, to ſurprize them with a ſudden Invaſion: for Brandy is not only under a ſpecial Interdiction of being made there, but alſo the Importation prohibited to a certain Quantity, every year, which makes the <hi>Ruſsians</hi> the more to covet it, inſomuch that ſometimes they have drunk all the <hi>Kabacks</hi> and Brandy-cellars in <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> dry before 3 Moneths of 12 be about. At <hi>Niſen-Novogorod</hi> we bought a meaſure, holding about a Gallon for about 3 <hi>sh.</hi> 2<hi>d. Sterl.</hi> which here when at cheapeſt is ſold for 50 <hi>sh.</hi>

This Salt is digged out of the Hollows and Caves of Rocks, and proves a very rich Commodity, being exported aſwell up the <hi>VVolga</hi> into all parts of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> and <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> as <hi>Perſia, Armenia, Tartary</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys bordering upon the <hi>Hyrcan</hi> Sea.

much reſembling a ſheep having Head, Feet and Tail, and what is more worthy of Note, a skin of white ſhining Hair and ſoft as Silk. This Skin is held in great eſteem by the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> and ſold for a good price, as I have paid my ſelf ſometimes 5 or 6 <hi>Roebels</hi> and doubled my money when I ſold it again. One of thoſe Skins is to be ſeen at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>John Swammerdam,</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a Gentleman famous for collection of the Rarities of Nature from every place of the World: but that of his he had from a Seaman that had been formerly a Slave in <hi>China,</hi> where coming into a Wood, found of this Fruit, and brought away as many Skins as made him a Coat. The Deſcription he gave of them, did very much agree with what the Inhabitants of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> informed me of them. It grows upon a low Stalk about 2 foot and a half high, ſome higher, and is ſupported juſt at the Navel: the Head always hangs down as if it paſtured, or fed, of the Graſs, and when the Graſs decays it periſhes, but this I ever look'd upon as ridiculous, altho the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants aſſeverated to me by many Oaths, that they have often out of curioſity made experience of that, by cutting away the Graſs, upon which it inſtantly fades away. However what I might further add as to what they ſay of this Fruit, and what I my ſelf beleeve in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Operations of a ſecret Sympathy in nature, I ſhall rather keep to my ſelf, than aver, or impoſe upon the Reader, what, I am ſenſible will be univerſally exploded for a Fable. Certain it is there is nothing which is more coveted by Wolves, than this, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of it are more congruous with the Anatomy of that Animal, than Mandrakes are with Men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nagayan</hi> and <hi>Crim-Tartars</hi> are thick and corpulent, broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd, and litle-eied. The Eies of the Men are wrinkled like old Wives. Their Beard grows very ſlovenly, here and there a hair, and ſhave their Heads bare on the Crown; yet theſe are not altogether ſo ougly as the <hi>Calmucs.</hi> Their Habit is altogether as gentile as their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are comely, their upper veſtment either of a very courſe ſtuff with every thred as fine as a Tobacco-pipe, or elſe of Sheepskins with the Wool-ſide outward, their Caps and Hoſe of the ſame colour, where they wear any, for they uſe as litle Rigging as they can. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men like the <hi>Calmuccers</hi> wear a courſe linnen Coat and round Caps, bulging out like a Helmet. Their Firſtborn Children are generally

               <p>In the Summer ſeaſon they have no faſt place, but paſture over all the face of the Countrey as we have ſaid of the <hi>Calmucs.</hi> When they march they carry their Tents upon high Wagons made on purpoſe, and ſo take their Wives and Children with them, and drive their Cattel before them, their Moveables they ſet upon Camels, Horſes and ſometimes upon Kine. Thus they go up and down all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and when the Winter approaches pitch together about <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> appearing like a great Army; where they can aſſiſt each other in time of need againſt the <hi>Calmucks</hi> their perpetual Enemies, who when the <hi>VVolga</hi> freezes ſometimes aſſail them: and to the end that they may the better oppoſe their ſaid Enemies in ſuch caſe, the <hi>VVaywode,</hi> or Governour of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> provides them Arms, which at the breaking up of the Camp they are to redeliver, and for ſecurity ſend ſome of their chief Princes as a Pledge to <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> where they are committed to the Cittadel; and upon their reſtoring of their Amunition are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred into their hands again.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nagayans</hi> follow the Fiſhing-trade, as alſo Fowling, Hunting and Paſturing of Cattel, and are reputed the beſt Herds-men in the world. Their Kine are generally great, their Sheep very fair and fat, having great Tails like the Rams in <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> ſome weighing 20 or 30 pound a piece, their noſes bending upwards, and their Ears hanging like a Spanial. Their Horſes are but ugly ſhaped, but very durable in running. They have alſo ſome Camels but not many. Their chief Diet is dried Fiſh which they uſe in ſtead of Bread. They have alſo a way of making bread of Rice, which they knead in Oil and Honey, and ſo bake it in Cakes. All kinds of Fleſh they eat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Swine, holding Horſe-fleſh for the beſt. Their Drink is Water and Milk, eſteeming Mares-milk above all other. They profeſs the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and are of the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſect. The <hi>Czaar</hi> allows them Laws and Judges of their own. They are alſo Tribute-free, but in ſtead of Tribute are to bring ſeveral Thouſand men to field upon occaſion.</p>

               <p>There are two Nations of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> the <hi>Saporoksky,</hi> and the <hi>Donsky.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two ſorts of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks.</hi>
                  </note> The former of theſe were ſometime ſubjects to the <hi>Polish</hi> Crown, and keep themſelvs about the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> and <hi>Kiof,</hi> upon 50 Iſlands which are environed with that famous River. They call thoſe Iſlands in their own proper Tongue <hi>Porog,</hi> which is as much as to fay Stairs, and therefore are called <hi>Sa-porogsky.</hi> Their work is to watch the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the <hi>Tartars</hi> or other Enemies upon the <hi>Polish</hi> Territories. They are called <hi>Coſacks</hi> from the <hi>Slavonian</hi> word <hi>Coſa,</hi> which is as much as to ſay a Spirit, by reaſon of their admirable celerity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being always ready at hand upon occaſion. The <hi>Donski</hi> or <hi>Don-Coſaks</hi> are thoſe who live upon the famous River <hi>Tanats,</hi> by the Natives called <hi>Don,</hi> and are properly under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Czar,</hi> although more out of their free and voluntary diſpoſition; for they have been indowed with many Priviledges, as to have their own Princes, Judges and Laws, as alſo a General of their Armie whom they themſelves Elect. As alſo this Immunity that when a <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Slave runs away from his Lord, and betakes himſelf within their Territories, they are not obliged to deliver him up unleſs themſelvs liſt. Of this People laſt mentioned was <hi>Stenko Radzin</hi> the famous Rebell
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33105:116"/>
born, who, as we have ſaid, ſo ſtoutly oppoſed the Emperour <hi>Alexius Michailowitz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt occaſion of this Revolt (as himſelf confeſſed) was to revenge his Brothers death, who was killed by an Eminent Perſonage, whoſe name was <hi>Iurie Alexowitz Dolgeroeky</hi> in the year 1665. The Brother of <hi>Radzin</hi> was at that time in the ſervice of the great Duke in the <hi>Polish</hi> Warrs, under the command of the before mentioned <hi>Bojar, Iurie Alexowitz Dolgeroeky,</hi> who commanded in chief: and when the Camp broke up to go into their Garriſons, the young <hi>Radzin</hi> deſired to be diſcharged with his Men, having done the Emperour very good ſervice in that laſt Expedition, and that then there was no more occaſion for their Aid: but the General refuſed to let them go, as not having any certain Intelligence that the Hoſtility were ſent to their Winter-quarters. The <hi>Coſaks</hi> were hereat greatly diſcontented, being Volunteers, and had deſerved yet greater Civilities than their Requeſt, or than ever they had received from the <hi>Ruſsians:</hi> they therefore marched off ſilently, led by their Collonel, brother to this ſaid <hi>Stenko Radzin,</hi> which was ſo badly reſented by the General, that he took the Collonel, and hanged him. This was the ſum and ground of his revolting, which prompted him not only to imploy his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons againſt the <hi>Ruſsians,</hi> but aſwell againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1667 he began to commit many Inſolencies and himſelf and all his crew betaking themſelves to the <hi>VVolga,</hi> where they took all the ſmall Shipping they met with, and plundered them, killed and threw over board all the Men, unleſs they would admitt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their Companie: They entred alſo all the Towns ſeated near the River, where they pillaged the Churches and Monaſteries. From hence he took his way directly for <hi>Iaik,</hi> which he took in and ſet a ſtrong Garriſon. From hence he marched toward the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea gathering vaſt multitudes of diſcontented Perſons, who came upon the noiſe of Rebellion from all parts. From the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea he went for the <hi>VVolga</hi> by the way committing many Inſolencies, plundering and ſinking all the ſmall Shipping, waſting and depopulating of Cities and Villages, and uſing the People very inhumanly if they would not reſolve to joyn in that Rebellion. From hence he went to the City <hi>Terku,</hi> and ſo onwards to the Bounds of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where he alſo ſadly moleſted the Subjects of that King, as well as thoſe of the

                  <hi>Czar.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>AUG.</hi> 1669.</note> The Inhabitants of a ſmall <hi>Perſian</hi> City hearing of his approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching deſerted the Town and betook themſelves to the Hills and Mountains without the Town, where they though themſelves ſecure from his violent and tyrannical Actions. <hi>Stenko Radzin</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, ſent out Emmiſſaries to ſee where they kept themſelves, with Inſtructions, to tell them that his End was not to do any harm to their Perſons or Eſtates; but only to buy Proviſion for his Money, and therefore willed them to return into the City. The Perſons who were ſent did their meſſage, and the credulous Citizens came down entred their Houſes, and ſet open their ſhops, of whom <hi>Radzin</hi> and his followers bought ſeveral Commodities and Neceſſaries paying them to the utmoſt farthing: but had given a token to his Men by ſetting of his Cap after an unuſual Manner, upon which they were all on a ſudden to fall upon the Towns-men and maſſacre them, which after a moſt barbarous Manner they did, ſparing neither Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor Child.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waywode</hi> of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Ivan Simonowitz Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rofski,</hi> hearing how many places they had deſpoliated in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the <hi>Medes</hi> and upon the Borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> thought it high time to put himſelf in a Poſture of Defence, and ſuppreſs the growing Army of the Malecontents; he in order thereto cauſed all the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as well Merchant-men as others to be put into an equippage, and diſpatches <hi>Simeum Ivanowits Geboof,</hi> who had then the third ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> to find out the <hi>Coſacks-Rebells,</hi> and give them battail. This Navy conſiſted of 36 <hi>Stroegs,</hi> and about 40000 Men. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells had already 22 <hi>Stroegs</hi> with a proportionable number of Men, keeping themſelves about the Iſland <hi>Satyry Boggere,</hi> which lies about the Entrance of the <hi>Wolga</hi> into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, where they had ſet up a Watch-Houſe upon the Top of a high Hill, from whence they could view the whole Countrey round about, as alſo the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea and the <hi>VVolga.</hi> This Iſland lay very commodiouſly for their Ends being all along the Coaſt of a high ſolid Rock, and had only one way to enter it.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the <hi>Coſacks</hi> ſaw the <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> Fleet approach, they put off their Shipping, and betook themſelves to flight, ſo that that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was in vain.

                     <hi>IUNE.</hi> 1669.</note> It was not long before the <hi>VVaywod Proſorofski</hi> received Letters from the <hi>Czaar,</hi> with a Pardon for <hi>Stenko Radzin</hi> on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would ſubmit to the Emperour, and for the future demean himſelf as a loyal ſubject. The ſubtle <hi>Coſack</hi> not expecting ſo gracious a tender, accepted of the Emperours Grace, being already by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and other extremities brought to ſuch a ſtate, that he would of his own accord have requeſted it, for they were then put to a ſhort allowance, and had taken a <hi>Perſian Boes</hi> having ſome Horſes aboard that were ſent to the <hi>Czaar,</hi> from the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> for a preſent; theſe they took, killed and uſed very ſparingly, whence it may be gathered in what a mean condition they were. Having thus obtained an aſſurance of Pardon from the Emperour, they marched forward for <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> where they were very kindly received, and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated by thoſe of the Townsmen, every one of them appearing in the moſt ſplendid manner he could, for they had rifled many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Houſes where they found always Apparrel, Jewels and other Plunder for habit and Ornament. <hi>Stenko Radzi</hi> the Ringleader of that Rout, could not be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, but by the Honour which was done him, being ſaluted by the name of <hi>Batske,</hi> Father; and certainly he was a father of many impious Sons. I have ſeen him ſeveral times upon the <hi>Stroegs</hi> and in the City; he is a brave man as to his perſon, and well proportioned in his limbs, tall and ſtreight of Body, pock-pitted, but only ſo as did rather become than diſfigure him, of a good conduct, but withall ſevere and cruel, as has been already inſtanced. The <hi>Coſacks</hi> who were his Followers came dayly into <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> where they ſold their Booty which was very rich and coſtly. The Silk they ſold for a 3d of the currant value, which was bought up of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants. I bought a Gold-chain of one of them which was almoſt a fathom long, and in joynts like a Bracelet, between each piece were precious ſtones: the price I gave for it was not fully 7 pound <hi>ſterl.</hi> Shortly after their Arrival Captain <hi>Butler</hi> went to viſit him, taking 2 bottles of Brandy along with him, which he thought might be an acceptable preſent, ſince they had been ſo long at Sea, and preſented them to him and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whom the <hi>Ruſsians</hi> called <hi>Devils-whisker</hi> by a Nick-name.

He forthwith gave order to a Gentleman to conduct us into his Tent where himſelf and ſome of his Council ſat, and cauſed us to ſit down, took our preſent in good part, and drank the Emperours health. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time we went through the Camp where we ſaw him going aboard a Yacht to divertiſe himſelf upon the Water, with ſome of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: he had with him a <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes which he had taken, together with her Brother. The Brother he preſented to the <hi>Waywod</hi> of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> but the Siſter he kept for his Concubine. Being now in the heighth of his Cups, and full of Frolicks, bragged of the many preſents he had given and received ſince his being reſtored to the Emperours favour, and on a ſudden brake out into thoſe Extravagant terms, ſpeaking to the <hi>Wolga: VVell,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou art a noble River, and out of thee have I had ſo much Gold, Silver and many things of Value. Thou art the ſole Father and Mother of Fortune and advancement: but, unthankfull man that I am? I have never offered thee any thing: well now, I am reſolved to manifeſt my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> With thoſe words he took her into his Arms and threw her into the <hi>VVolga,</hi> with all her rich Habit and Ornaments; her attire was of rich Cloth of Gold, richly ſet out with Pearls, Diamonds and other precious Stones. The Lady was of an angelical Countenance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, of a ſtately carriage of Body, and withall excellently well qualified as to her Parts, being of a ſingular wit, and always pleaſing in her demeanor towards him, when he was in the heat of fury, and yet at laſt became the inſtance of his Cruelty. However there is no man ſo addicted to any one Vice but there are ever more ſome ſparks of vertue. His own outrages as to the ſin of Adultery he would allow himſelf, but would not indulge or diſpence with it in others. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that a certain Soldier of the <hi>Coſacks</hi> had been taken in the action with anothers wife: this being made known to <hi>Stenko,</hi> he cauſed them both to be inſtantly apprehended, and the man to be thrown into the River with great ſtones made faſt to his neck and heels: but for the Adultereſs he provided another puniſhment which was to erect a Pale on the Water ſide, and tying her by the feet cauſed her to be ſo drag'd along the Earth, and from the Tent to the Pale which was almoſt 2 [<hi>English</hi>] miles, and there hoiſed up, where ſhe hung 48 Hours before ſhe died, and yet nevertheleſs the great torment of

               <p>Beſides the many Robberies and great inſolencies they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as well within Land as in Sea-Towns in <hi>Perſia,</hi> as at <hi>Niſabath, Scabaran, Mardore</hi> and <hi>Tackuſi</hi> ſituated near the famous Hill <hi>Barmach,</hi> from hence they went to <hi>Aſtrabath</hi> and <hi>Bachu</hi> which they ſurprized took in, and plundered, committing many barbarous actions in maſſacring of the Inhabitants and ſetting the Houſes on fire. Here they found a great Quantity of Wine, which they divided among themſelves, and carouſed ſo long, till they were all beſotted and drunk, being about 6000 Men in all. In the mean while the <hi>Perſians</hi> had drawn down ſeveral Companies, and all on a ſudden fell on this Rout, and made ſuch a ſlaughter that the twelfth part, or litle more were left alive and <hi>Stenko</hi> himſelf 5 times in danger of being taken. The Remainder betook themſelves to the <hi>Stroegs.</hi> This ſo much weakened them that they were not in a capacity to do any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable damage by land, the more by reaſon the <hi>Perſians</hi> watched their Coaſt with very great vigilancy; as did alſo the <hi>Coſacks</hi> and <hi>Dageſtan Tartars,</hi> ſo that they were conſtrained for ſome time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to keep off at Sea, and keep cloſe to Pyracy, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was well warned of them and conſequently ſo cautious that they got but very litle Booty. But finding that they could not long ſubſiſt they were forced to land at <hi>Satyry Boggere</hi> an Iſland (of which before) where they waited for what Providence would allott them.</p>

               <p>Some diſcontented <hi>Ruſsians</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Coſacks</hi> ready to depart, they came and deſired to liſt themſelves under his Conduct, to which he readily aſſented, and by fair Promiſes drew abundance after him.</p>
               <p>It happened ſometime before he deſigned to leave the Town that meeting with about 20 or more <hi>Ruſsians</hi> whom he could ſee by their countenance to be inclinable to follow him; theſe he fell in diſcourſe with, and liberally diſtributed a Bag of Gold among them, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them that if they would follow him they ſhould fare no worſe than he. This was encouragement enough for them who did not only liſt themſelves, but perſwaded alſo many of their Friends to take the like Courſe, and joyn their Fortunes, amongſt whom were divers that were in the Emperours Service.</p>
               <p>The Governour of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> coming to underſtand that ſeveral Perſons in the ſervice of the great Duke, his Maſter, had withdrawn and liſted themſelves among the Rebells, he ſent one <hi>Wederos</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Strelitzers</hi> to <hi>Radzin,</hi> with Inſtructions to demaund the <hi>Ruſsians,</hi> and to will him to ſend them back upon pain of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Disfavour, which ſhould not be ſo eaſily accommodated as before, when perhaps he ſhould be compel'd to make ſatisfaction for

Prethee, go tell thy Maſter, that I equally value him and the Emperour, and let him know that I shall be with him ere he be aware, and reward him for this Protervity.</hi> The Captain was fain to ſmother his thoughts, and contented himſelf with this Anſwer which he related to the Governour. The Governour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſſembles a Council, and conſulted what to do; learning from the anſwer of <hi>Radzin</hi> that he intended to come down again, and ſo it happened, for within 3 days he began to march toward the <hi>VVolga,</hi> where he had 80 <hi>Stroegs</hi> and other Shipping provided, filled with Ammunition and Men, but did not at firſt any hoſtile feat. The <hi>VVaywod</hi> of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> called a Counſel the ſecond time, where it was concluded that ſo long as <hi>Radzin</hi> did not do any attempt or violence upon any Town belonging to the Emperour, he ſhould not oppoſe him till the whole Navy were come together.</p>

The <hi>VVaywod Proſorofski</hi> conſidering that the Commonalty were very much incenſed, and that ſome mutinous Enterprize was a hatching, he aſſembles the Lords and Council of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> to conſult with their Judgments what was beſt to be done in thoſe imminent Dangers and Juncture of Affairs, and what courſe they ſhould take to ſedate thoſe Animoſities and Heats, which ill-affected perſons indeavoured to raiſe and foment among the Towns-men and Plebeïans; as alſo what manner of Defence to uſe againſt the approaching Enemy. As to the former they concluded, that there was no better way to remedy it, than to conduct themſelves warily in the latter, and firſt obſtruct the growing Power of the Rebells, which Perils being removed it might not then be doubted but that the Commons would be the better and ſooner pacified. Upon this Reſolution ſeveral worthy Gentlemen preſented their Service to go as private Soldiers upon that ſudden and urging Expedition, not daring any more to put the leſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Strelitzers.</hi>

But on the 4 of <hi>Iune,</hi> by a Gentleman who had made his Eſcape, they had notice of the Affairs of <hi>Tzornojar,</hi> that on the ſame day that the <hi>Knees Elboof</hi> made his appearance the Town was taken in, and that the Governour and Officers were all maſſacred and their Bodies thrown into the River: and further, what was more deplorable, the Privat Soldateſque of <hi>Knees Elboof</hi> had murthered all their Officers in the Fleet, declared themſelves for the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and ſurrendred all the Shipping into the Hands of <hi>Stenko Radzin</hi> the grand Belweather, or Ringleader of the Rebells; altho immediately before their coming at <hi>Tzornojar</hi> they had unanimouſly ſworn, to live and dy with their Leaders. The Report of theſe things, altho the Governour indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to ſmother as much as was poſſible, gave the Rabble greater Occaſion to mutiny than they had before; yea, ſo far they were induced, that they publicly reproached the Superiority that they durſt not look out of their doors, or windows, much leſs walk the ſtreets to conſult together of means to remedy the diſtemper of affairs, to defend themſelves againſt the Hoſtility abroad, and to ſuppreſs inteſtin Jarrs at home, for it was no rare thing now to ſee the Rabble aſſemble togethers in heaps, and before the Doors of the Magiſtrates to cry out with infamous and bitter Railings, <hi>Now, now, the times begin to alter, it will be our turn next to Lord it, you villains come out and show your ſelves to the VVorld, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Governour in the mean while loſt no courage on his part, and the Gentry and Officers ſtill continued under hopes of Aſſiſtance from the Field Army, and new ſuccour and Recruits from <hi>Moſcou.</hi> The Deputy therefore cauſed all the Ordnance to be viſited and laden by the <hi>German</hi> Gunners, and gave orders to furniſh themſelves with neceſſary Ammunition. However we could very well remark, that were the Officers never ſo ſedulous, they were never able both to defend themſelves from ſuch a Power without, and be ſecure for Mutiny within, of which many Reaſons were given to the <hi>VVaywode,</hi> and he as often forewarned by divers prudent Perſons.

               <p>In the mean while we heard continual News of the approaching of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> to attacque <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> which had it's inward ſtate been in all things conformable to the Muniments of that Town, they needed not fear 100000 undiſciplin'd men as are the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> for to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Ramparts and Fortifications of the Walls, there lay about four hundred and ſixty great braſs Guns in the Battlements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe of the Cittadel.

However it came ſo far that Captain <hi>Butler</hi> began alſo to dread ſome ill might befall us if we did not conſult our Safety betimes; he therefore upon a time called us all together, and uttered his mind in theſe, or the like words. <hi>Gentlemen, I doubt not but that you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon ſome of our Company pray'd them that they would pilot us down to the mouth of the River, which they promiſed to do, and agreed with us for a Ducat. We took one of thoſe <hi>Tartars</hi> aboard the Shallop, and kept company a while with the reſt. After a few hours ſailing we got <hi>Oetsjoege,</hi> which is the chief place where the Fiſh <hi>Biloege</hi> is taken, whereof <hi>Cavear</hi> is made, being far greater than a Sturgeon, but of the ſame kind. The <hi>Wolga</hi> is here all laid in with Stakes, after the manner you ſee in the Plate, theſe Stakes are ſet in rows, wide at the Entrance ſo that they can drive in the Fiſh, which when once in they chace to the other end, where it runs up to a narrow angle, ſo that ſhe can neither get forward, nor yet turn about, but is eaſily taken. When they have caught her they take out the Rows, which weighs ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily 300 or 400 <hi>lb.</hi> but the reſt of the Fiſh they commonly throw away, although ſometimes they pickle it, and ſend it to <hi>Moſcovy</hi> where it is held in reaſonable good eſteem. The length of one of thoſe <hi>Biloeges</hi> is from 26 to 30 foot if come to its full growth. <hi>Cavear</hi> is uſed all over <hi>Ruſsia</hi> and <hi>Moſcovia</hi> inſtead of Butter during their Lent, which as I have before remarked, comes 4 times a year, and is likewiſe ſent into all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that this Fiſhing is hard followed by

Upon this Iſland we ſaw ſome Watch-houſes which <hi>Stenko Radzin</hi> (even now remembred) had cauſed to be built, to view the approachment of his Enemies. However it was not intent

his intent or deſign (in building of theſe Watch-houſes) only to be forewarned of any danger, but to prey upon the <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchant men, who were bound for <hi>Aſtrachan.</hi> From hence to the <hi>Circas</hi>-Mountains we often ſounded and found it never more, or ſeldom leſs than 12 foot Water. All along the Coaſt we ſaw abundance of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geeſe Pelicans and other Fowl which now and then we beſtowed a litle powder upon. The ſtrand was all grown over with Reeds, which grow to an incredible heighth, and the Water there we found deeper than off at Sea, in ſomuch that it were very commodious, in a ſtorm for any ſmall veſſel to ſhelter themſelves, dropping anchor a litle without, for the Reeds break of the Winds and the impetuous beatings of the Water. In the afternoon towards the Evening it began to thunder and rain very hard, the Wind was very high at South and by Eaſt, and our Courſe lay South and by Weſt. The Water all the time beat over the Gunhil, and two men forced to heave out with their Backlers, though hardly to any purpoſe, for notwithſtanding all the pains they took the Shallop was ſtill full, the Tempeſt continuing ſo till 5 in the next morning, at what time it began to grow very calm and moderate, yet not ſo but that we were driven with a fine freſh Gale. The Water here is freſh and potable, and affoards all manner of Fiſh, that uſually breed in freſh Rivers, Pike, Carps, Breams, &amp;c. Beſides Sturgeons, Seals and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that will endure both.</p>
               <p>On the 15 we loſt the ſight of Land, and came about midday into the Bay <hi>Kieſelarke,</hi> which is otherwiſe called the <hi>Golden Bay</hi> the ſand whereof ſhines as fire, and is therefore by ſome called <hi>Kiſelarſche Kolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoeh,</hi> which is no other than <hi>Golden Bay.</hi> My curioſity was often to taſt the Water; ſometimes I found it laſt of Sulfur, ſometimes of Saltpeter, and ſometimes of an od bitter taſt, whence I collected that this came from the property of the Ground and bottom. The River <hi>Kiſelar</hi> is a Branch, or an Arm of the <hi>Buſtro,</hi> riſing about 8 <hi>Dutch</hi> Leagues above <hi>Terki,</hi> and runs paralel with the <hi>VVolga</hi> about 65 leagues, ſo disbanding its floods into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. But now we were in a more deſperate Condition than ever, partly for that our Shallop was ſo loaden that we were not a foot above Water, and on the other hand wanted bread, for we had not above 6 or 7 pound among all the Company. The Wind began to grow high and boyſtrous, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33105:128"/>
towards the Evening we had a very rough Sea, every billow riſing Mountains high, inſomuch that with continual pumping and laving we had much ado to keep the Shallop above Water, working ſome times 4 or 5 together, and by taking turns relieved thoſe that were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry every hour with freſh men. The next morning we could ſee no land, but let all be left to the mercy of GOD.</p>
               <p>On the 16 we had a ſtiff gale, and ſailed before the Wind, which furthered us ſo, that by noon we deſcried Land: and ſoon after got ſight of a <hi>Dageſtan-Tartar's</hi> Barque, which we made up to, but when we came near it, it was run upon a Bank, and deſerted of the Men, which upon our approaching them, jump'd over board. We percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that it was only for us that they left their Veſſel; called out to them, and willed them freely to return and that we meant no harm; upon which they came back, and we pray'd them to furniſh us with ſome bread for our Money, but they told us that they had not enough for their own Voyage however they gave us 6 litle Loaves, for which they would have no money, as alſo dried Pears and Plumbs which we thank fully received. This ſaid Bark was laden with Bales of Silk and bound for <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> which when we underſtood we gave them a Caution, and told them that we verily beleeved that by that time <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> was in hand of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and conſequently we could not judge it ſafe for them to proceed on their Journey thither. They thanked us for our Advice, and directed their Courſe for <hi>Terky,</hi> that being alſo a good Market. We agreed among our ſelves to follow the like courſe, with intent, at leaſt, to ſupply our want of Proviſion, not knowing whether the Town was taken in by the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> or that it was ſtill under the Emperour. About 9 in the Evening we anchored before the Town, and immediately upon our anchorage ſaw 10 or 12 Soldiers come rowing towards us, but when they came nigh ſaw that we were well armed, offered not to do any violent Act, but only asked us, Who we were? and, From whence we came? We anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That we were <hi>Hollanders,</hi> belonging to his Majeſties great Ship at <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> and were come thither to ſound the Bay and Haven. <hi>Ho!

               </p>
               <p>All the night it blew very hard, and in the morning we ſaw land on each ſide. The Iſland which lay on the Larboard ſide we called <hi>Meynders</hi> Iſland, becauſe he was the firſt that diſcovered it. We ſteered directly through the Iſlands, and when we were about 20 leagues within the Bay, we diſcovered high land, which we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward knew to be the famous <hi>Caucaſus</hi> and <hi>Ararat,</hi> which alſo border and extend to the <hi>Circas</hi> Hills, and ſailing a litle further we found that we were near the Quick-ſands, ſo that we were fain to tack about, and bear up to the Channel, where coming we ſounded and found it 2 fathom, and a good ſandy ground. Being juſt got thorow the ſtraits or narrow Channel, we looked about and diſcovered a great Bark making up toward us with all the Sail they could; which afterwards we underſtood was ſent by order of the Governour of <hi>Terki,</hi> to purſue us, having 62 Soldiers, and all well armed aboard, with a charge from the Governour to give us no quarter, but to hack us in pieces, and to bring back the Shallop and Goods to <hi>Terky.</hi> We ſeeing them in a full purſuit thought it no time to dally, but laboured as hard as we could, till we got the Iſland <hi>Sierlan</hi> where we came to Anchor, and the Bark ſeemed to give over their chace.</p>

They wear gray Felt-coats with a mantle of the ſame,<note place="margin">and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</note> which is rough without; this they hang ſlovenly about the neck made faſt with a great button, that they can turn it which way they liſt, and make it ſerve for a Buckler againſt the Wind.

               <p>Their Women in regard of their complexion ſeem almoſt as if they were of another Nation, being in reality very fair and lovely, their skin as white as the faireſt people of <hi>Europe,</hi> and their countenance angelical; which I have often wondred at, when I compared them with the Men. They are alſo well proportioned in their Bodies and of a middle ſtature. Their Eiebrows are jet-black, as alſo their Hair which hangs down in ſeven or 8 curled locks on each ſide the Head. They cover not their Faces, like moſt of the Women in the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Nations. Their Head-attire is a double black Hood, lined with Cotton and made faſt under the Chin: above that they wear a Velvet or ſattin Quoif, and are very nice in ſetting of it.

Thoſe of better faſhion do uſually wear two Coats and a pair of Drawers coming down to the Calf of the Legg, and ſometimes to the ancles. They are as curious in ſetting of their Breſts as the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Ladies, altho they never accuſtome themſelves to painting. They are very familiar and free in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and will not refuſe to let a ſtranger kiſs them: altho in preſence of their Husbands who are never jealous without reaſon. To confeſs the Truth I was very much careſſed by them, being often beckned at under colour of viewing my Habit, which to them ſeemed very ſtrange. To be brief their Women are as curious in their Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and adorning of the Body, as they are complete perſons by nature. They are very ambitious and emulating in ornaments, and are well trick'd up with Chains, Bracelets, Rings and other fine things, and thoſe both of Gold, Silver, Pearl, Coral, &amp;c. which they become exceeding well. As I have already ſaid, they are very friendly and familiar with ſtrangers, as appeared by their community with us, when as ſome of our men began to tickle and play with them, which they took all in good part, but HE that offered to be bolder paid ſeverely for it. The Men, altho the <hi>Alchoran</hi> do diſpence with Polygamy, yet they reſt contented with one wife, whether becauſe they think it too chargeable, or otherwiſe unreaſonable I cannot affirm. They are Mahometans by profeſſion, but in reality meer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; for although they ſpeak much of one only eternal God the Author of their being, and Adminiſtrator of the World, yet they deny him in their Idolatry and Devil-worſhip. They have neither Prieſts, Churches, nor Writ, but at certain times and places preſent themſelves with their Offerings. The greateſt day wherein they pay theſe Religious duties is on the Feſtival of St. <hi>Elias</hi> which happened on that very time when we were there, which we eſſayed to ſee ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but were not permitted. All I could obſerve was only the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of a Hee-goat, which after they had cut off his Genitals, offered the ſore and boyled the hinder-part, which themſelves always eat, hanging the Hide upon a Stake, which is done with a few Ceremonies and Singing.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33105:133"/>
aboard were <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and as we beleeved of <hi>Radzins</hi> Folk.</p>
               <p>Finding that they left us we conſulted which way to ſteer, and reſolved to let drive before the Wind. We ſounded and found 4 fathom, and came in a ſhort time cloſe by <hi>Zierlan,</hi> which we found to ly in 43 <hi>degr.</hi> 7 <hi>min.</hi> From hence we ſaw the famous <hi>Ararat,</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his head far above the <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> which was nearer us. The Land of the Iſland <hi>Zierlan</hi> is all covered with ſhells, which ſeem to be waſh'd over, with high Floods and Inundations, whence I preſume none will Inhabit it. About evening we put off, and after an hours failing ſounded and found we had 6 fathom and a ſandy ground. When night came we were ſurprized with a great Tempeſt, and the Sea roſe mountains high, inſomuch that we expected every moment to go to bottom, and ſo we were thrown to and again on the tops of the billows. In the morning it began to clear up and the Winds abated ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ething, ſo that we made a litle ſail, and indeavoured to ſteer towards the High-lands on the <hi>Circas</hi> coaſt. After much labour in beating through the Waves, and danger of our lives we got that heighth. We ſailed by a <hi>Tartarian</hi> City Seated near the Water between two Hills, and by the way met with a <hi>Moſcovian Boes</hi> where the Men aboard had acquaintance with us, having lay with their Veſſel aboard our Ship at <hi>Aſtrachan.</hi> The ſaid Men invited us all to dinner, of Freſh Mutton and Rice, which they firſt parboiled, and afterward ſtewed with Butter, of which we made a hearty meal. After we had taken our leaves of them, we ſteered away by the Coaſt, and ſaw many pleaſant Valleys and a fruitfull Countrey. When the Evening came on, and we ſeeing it good weather reſolved that night to take our reſt, which we had not done for 3 nights together, and to that end drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped anchor.</p>
               <p>On the 20 we came within 15 Leagues of <hi>Derbent,</hi>

                  </gap> again we ran into a Circle of Rocks about 3 or 4 foot under Water, and had much labour to get clear. Having now wrought our ſelves out we gave our ſelves over to the mercy of Heaven, letting the Boat drive what way it would, till at laſt by a great Sea we were thrown upon the ſtrand, without either loſs of men or Goods, every man packing up what they thought fit to carry along with them. The Goods which belonged to Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Termund</hi> we buried in the Sand, thinking to ſend for them upon occaſion by the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But moſt unhappy proved this our landing here, for no ſooner were we come aſhoar but we were eſpied by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who came and delved up the Goods we had ſo hidden, and carried it away upon their Horſes to a litle Village hard by, and brought the news of ſuch an accidental Booty to <hi>Aly Sultan,</hi> their Prince, who came on Horſe back with a guard of Troopers to ſeek us. Altho by day we hid our ſelves in the Woods, and by night went forward on our Journey.</p>
               <p>Having remained one night in the Woods where we took our reſt, Our Company conſulted what was beſt to do, whether to march
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33105:134"/>
forward on our journey or to tarry; It was adviſed by the major part to go, but I was rather deſirous to tarry 3 or 4 days longer, till the heat of the purſuit was over, that ſo thinking when the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſhould have ſought for us a while in vain, they would give us over for loſt. However they were very forward to be going, and rejected my Council. In the mean while <hi>C. Brak</hi> ſlept with his wife and child at a litle diſtance from us, and the reſt of the Company would that we ſhould leave them there, becauſe that the Woman and Child were but a cumber to us. So ſoon as I underſtood their intent was to leave them ſo, I inſiſted on the contrary, with words to this effect. <hi>Pray Gentlemen remember your ſelves; to what end ſhould you do ſuch an unworthy act, and leave thoſe poor ſouls behind us who have neither Money nor means to ſubſiſt, and muſt in all apparency periſh in a ſtrange place? and then what guilt muſt we have upon our Conſciences? But know this if you indeed reſolve, to go and leav'em it is alſo my reſolution to cry out and make our Fates equal.</hi> When they ſaw me ſo zealous and in a hot paſſion, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to take them with us. I was the more concerned at it, for his Fathers ſake, who when we left our Native Countrey ſhow'd us all imaginable Friendſhip, and therefore indeared him the more to me. About half a day we marched with Muſkets and other heavy Armor upon our ſhoulders, beſides our baggage, along the ſides of the Mountains, till at laſt we came into a Valley where we were eſpied by a Company of Troopers, being about 15 or 16. Theſe made up towards us, and drove harder and harder, till coming near at hand, we began to conſult about the point of Safety, yet could not come to an unanimous Reſolution till it was too late: ſome were for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, others for yielding, which Advice was thought beſt, and approved on by the <hi>major</hi> part; for that we thought if the kind Heavens had given us the Field for that time, yet we were ſure that ſome muſt looſe their lives, and that they might in the mean time be ſeconded by another freſh Party, who when all was done would take the remainder and uſe us the more unkindly for our obſtinacy.<note place="margin">They ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</note> We therefore upon their approachment freely ſurrendred our ſelves into their hands and implored their Mercy after the beſt manner, and with all the ſigns we could. When they had got us into their Power, they drove us into the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Scemkals,</hi> for we were then within the Confines of the <hi>Oſmin.</hi> When they had brought us
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33105:135"/>
within their own limits, they allighted from their horſes and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered us, yet not with that rigorous uſage we feared, for having ſtript us of our upper Garment they let us go, taking only what we had with us that was thought to be of any value. They took from me a Parcel of rich Silk, which I had bought of the Rebells at <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> but my gold Chain which I had faſtened in the inſide of my Garter they did not find. When they had thus pillaged us, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us which way to go for our Safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dageſtan</hi> is a Countrey ſubject to divers Princes and Lords who are independently Sovereign, but the moſt principal Provinces are <hi>Scemkal</hi> and <hi>Oſmin,</hi> already mentioned: and of thoſe two, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the more eminent, the Government whereof is not heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,<note place="margin">A ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of electing a Prince.</note> but by lot, which is after this manner.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33105:135"/>
me faſt to a Tree, ſhot me with their Arrows, which they had broken off and made ſtumped on purpoſe to urge me to diſcover the reſt of our Company. But when they could not move me to detect them they continued ſhooting, that I often wiſhed that they would have diſpatched me, and rid me of that miſery. The marks and pits remain ſtill in my Body, as I have ſhown them to many hundreds ſince my arrival at home. Theſe Torments I endured with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience, not willing to detect my Countreymen, Torments, I ſay, that none without experience could be able to imagine how great. When they inſiſted hard that I ſhould tell them which way they went, I told them that they went toward the Hilly Countrey, altho I was certain on the contrary for they had determined to go along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that they might have their ſhelter in the Woods. After they had uſed us ſo inhumanly and out of hopes of getting any thing from us, they took me and <hi>Els Pleterſz,</hi> tied us legg to legg with a ſmall Iron Chain, and ſo brought us up to the Prince <hi>Oſmin,</hi> often threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they would tear us limb from limb, ſuſtaining that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of us that we were of <hi>Stephen Radzin's</hi> Company, and ſent out as Emmiſſaries on his behalf, and therefore were reſolved that his Inſolencies ſhould be lay to our charge. When I underſtood that their Opinion and Intentions were ſuch, I was in a great conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not that I was affraid of Death (for that was what I chiefly longed for, at that time) but that we were liable to ſuch a bad Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and could not explain our ſelves ſo well, as to ſatisfy them to the contrary: and beſides all that to be kept alive and ſuffer ſo many Tortures as they threatned us, to detect what we were utterly ignorant of, and unable to ſatisfy them in.</p>
               <p>When we came to the Princes Palace, they led us thro the Guards that ſtood on each ſide with naked Scimmatars in their hands; theſe we expected to be our Executioners, to hew us in pieces, altho after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we underſtood it was the manner there, when captives are brought before the Prince. So ſoon as my Companion ſaw this wofull ſight he turned his head about, and ſtared upon me with a very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full look, which I beleeve was the firſt time, and the occaſion of a Frenzy, which he has been often ſince poſſeſſed with, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (if he be alive) continues with him till this day. Being come before the Prince we threw our ſelves down at his feet; he thereupon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33105:136"/>
aſked us, <hi>Whence we came, and to what end we were come thither?</hi> We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Dutch, <hi>and fled from</hi> Aſtrachan, <hi>to avoid the</hi> Coſacks, <hi>who upon our departure were about to lay ſiege to that City, and now come to implore your Highneſſes gracious Protection. All this I hear very well</hi> (quoth the Prince) <hi>but I am certain that you are your ſelves</hi> Coſacs, <hi>and of that Rout which not long ago depopulated my Countrey and made Havoc of my Subjects, and now the Villain, your Maſter having taken in</hi> Aſtrachan <hi>has ſent you as Spies and Explorators to viſit my Towns.</hi> Our reply was, <hi>Sir, we know nothing of the Deſigns of the</hi> Coſacs, <hi>but ſerved as Marriners in a Ship, which ſome of our Countrey-men have built for the Emperour of</hi> Moſcovia. When the Prince heard that, he was ſome what appeaſed, hearing us with more attention, and that we might the better be underſtood, he called for ſome <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Slaves, who aſſured him that we were no <hi>Coſaks</hi> but real <hi>Dutch,</hi> for that we had nothing of the <hi>Coſac</hi>-Dialect. Upon this the Prince turned about, and told us our Life was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us. This news was very welcom to us, but had been more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com if we had with one been ſet at liberty for we were chained ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſent away to <hi>Mahemet Sultan,</hi> the Princes Son, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding place was near mount <hi>Ararath.</hi>

               <p>ON the 21 <hi>dito,</hi> my Companion and I took our leaves of each other, but not without great ſadneſs, for ſo ſoon as we were brought out, and underſtood that we were to go two ſeveral ways, I obſerved Tears run down his cheeks, which alſo moved me to weep, for that we were out of hopes ever to ſee one anothers face again in this World, neither that our Wives or Friends ſhould ever hear from us
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33105:136"/>
or that we ever were like to be redeemed by our Friends or Countrey men being in a remote Land. Having thus taken our laſt Farewell of each other, I was ſet upon a Mule, and committed to the Charge of ſome Slaves and Renegados, who were to bring me to the Court of Prince <hi>Mahomet,</hi> being about 3 [<hi>Dutch</hi>] miles from <hi>Urwan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Evening we came to a Village called <hi>Tzurbag</hi> ſeated upon a high Mountain, where we took up our lodging for that night. While we ſtayed here there came abundance of Women to ſee me, who wondred that I wore ſuch long hair, for the Inhabitants of theſe Countreys (being <hi>Mahometans</hi>) always ſhave their Heads bare.</p>
               <p>On the 22 betimes in the morning we ſet forward, and went through a great Grove of Fruit-trees, where we ſaw abundance of wild Swine maſting of the ſhaken Fruit. Theſe Fruit trees do not grow naturally of themſelves here, for they have an Ordinance among them in that Countrey, That none, of whether Sex it be, ſhall marry, till they can prove that they have planted a Hundred Trees with their own Hands, ſo that they begin when they are Children to plant; which having been obſerved for ſome Ages, is the reaſon that this Wood is grown ſo wide. There are divers ſorts of Fruits, as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Figgs, Almonds, Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts and others, and that in ſuch abundance that the hundreth part is not conſumed or us'd, for none are prohibited to pluck and carry away. There is alſo very fair Medow and Arable Ground, the Fields full of Corn, affoarding many delicate and rich Plants, both for Kitchin uſe, and Medicinal. Cattel is there both good and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, far ſurpaſſing ours in <hi>Europe</hi> for fatneſs, eſpecially Kine &amp; Sheep; Goats and Swine, both wild and tame, run together in innumerable Flocks, but incredible is the Plenty of Hens and Pidgeons which are brought in and ſold for trifles.</p>
               <p>On the 30th we arrived at <hi>Urwan,</hi> or <hi>Ervan,</hi> a City ſituated under Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> in the Countrey of the <hi>Medes,</hi> about 65 Leagues from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. The Town is not very wide, but ſufficiently munited with ſtrong walls of ſtone, being about the greatneſs of <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maar</hi> in <hi>North-Holland.</hi> There are in it ſome <hi>Perſian</hi> Moſquees, and Churches, as alſo a Cloyſter of <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friars. They uſe no kind of Commerce, or Merchandiſe, ſave that of Slaves, which the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33105:137"/>
                  <hi>Dageſtan Tartars</hi> come to buy there, and are there ſo cheap that a luſty well-bodied youngman is ordinarily ſold for ten Crowns, as ſome of our Company were ſold for the ſame price. The City <hi>Urwan</hi> is moſtly inhabited by the poorer ſort of <hi>Armenians</hi>; but Mount <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> by thoſe of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, and other Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Mount <hi>Ararat</hi> is ſeated juſt in the parting of <hi>Armenia</hi> from <hi>Media,</hi> and is reckoned under the rank of the <hi>Dageſtan</hi> and <hi>Caſpian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The <hi>Armenians</hi> call it <hi>Meſsina,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians Agri:</hi> It is much higher than either <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> or the famous <hi>Taurus,</hi> or any other Mountain in all <hi>Media, Armenia</hi> or <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſo far as one can view. It is a blew, and dark-coloured Rock. I have found there a kind of a dark yellow Mineral, very ponderous, and ſparkling; but could never learn what mettal it would have produced if melted, nor that of a ſparkling Sand and Duſt, which I alſo found here, although I brought a proof of each, which I loſt, when we were taken at Sea by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and plundered, as herafter ſhall be ſaid at large. This Mountain is for the moſt part barren, and without Earth, and what may be further ſaid by way of Deſcription, the Reader will find in the Relation of my Aſcent towards the Top of it.</p>
               <p>My Maſters purpoſe was to ſell me here, but I could eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they had no great mind to buy me. The ſame evening two Carmelite Friars came to me, and aſked, If I was not a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, or, if I had any Judgment that way? I replied, No: but not ſatisfied with the Anſwer I gave them, they applyed themſelves to my Patron, aſking him the ſame Queſtion; the one of them tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that a Friend of his had a Rupture, and if I could perform the Cure, they would give him 50 Crowns. My Maſter hearing ſuch a tinkling ſum of Money promiſed, preſs'd very hard upon me to undertake the Work, promiſing upon Condition that I effected the Cure, he would declare me <hi>Franc.</hi> Hereat I was in a great ſtrait, on the one hand incited by the ſweet hopes of Freedom, and on the other daunted when I thought what a ſevere penalty I was liable to from the hands of thoſe cruel men, if I ſhould chance to miſcarry However I took courage, and conſented to take the Patient in hand truſting in the good Grace of GOD, and hoping for a lucky ſucceſs which alſo would have come to paſs, by the death of one of us three Thus I undertook the Journey, and was ſeven days before I came

                  </gap>und a Hermitage, where we were ſupplyed with a Peaſant and an Aſs, to carry our Proviſion, and Wood for Fewel, becauſe that about the midle of the Mountain it is ſo extreme cold, that Ice of half a nights freezing, will bear man and horſe. In our Journey upwards, we paſſed through three ſorts of clouds. The firſt were thick, miſty and dark. The ſecond were cold and like ſnow, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was then perfect ſummer below in the Valleys, and ſo warm that the Grapes were very early ripe. The third ſort were ſo cold, that we could hardly endure any longer, and thought verily that we ſhould have grown ſtiff, and not able to proceed on our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But having now travailed 4 days, and had paſſed through the higheſt and coldeſt clouds, we found the Air very temperate and tolerable. On the 7 of that Moneth, we arrived at the Hermites houſe, which was hewen out of a Rock, the Weather being there ſo moderate and gentle as man can imagine, or heart can wiſh; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more hot than might very well be endured, nor yet more cold than was expetible and congruous to humane conſtitution. The ſun enlivened us with thwarting beams, which were again refracted, with the refreſhing gales of Wind; the Wind correcting the Sun, the Sun the Wind. The Hermite told me he had lived there 25 years, and never had ſeen the weather any otherwiſe. But on the top of the Hill, it was yet more calm, where as none can remember that the Air there did ever change, or was ſubject either to Wind or Rain, which is preſumed to be the reaſon that the Ark has endured ſo long without being rotten.</p>
               <p>Going into the Hermites Cell, I took a view of the Rupture, which I ſaw was ſhut forth about the bulk of a henns-egg; and with one aſked him, How long he had had it? he anſwered, A Moneth: which gave me good encouragement, ſince I was ſure that the Fiſſure was freſh, and therefore the Cure with greater facility to be effected.</p>
               <p>Thus I undertook the work, and taking 200 freſh Hen-eggs I boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them hard, and made thereof an Unguent. I made alſo a Truſs, and anointed him 4 times a day with the Oyntment cauſing him to ly ſtill for a fortnight together, which done I let him riſe up to ſee
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33105:140"/>
how he was, and found that it was ſufficiently bettered: for the Rupture which he with his own hands had indeavoured to ſtop, by thruſting it in, and as often broke out, was now ſtay'd, and he told me that he could every day perceiv that it grew better. I gave him advice to keep himſelf a whole year in the Truſs, and continue anoynting himſelf after the manner I did myſelf, which he alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to obſerv. When I took my leav of him, he gave me a piece of hard wood, of a dark-red colour, with a Croſs, and a ſilver Chain which he wore about his neck, as alſo a Stone, which he told me he had taken from under the Ark; Theſe Relicts he adjured me to be very carefull of, ſaying the real value and eſteem thereof would be ſuch, that if ever I came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and beſtowed them on St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church that they would reward me with a Gift which ſhould ſerve me for a maintenance ſo long as I lived. The Wood and the Croſs I brought with me, but the ſtone, with ſome ſparkling Oar were taken from me when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took our Ship. The Hermite was born at <hi>Rome,</hi> and of very good Parentage, his Father being one of the moſt eminent Citizens there, who upon his Death-bed charged his Son, To retire himſelf from the Society of Men and betake himſelf to the Mountain <hi>Ararat,</hi> there to ſpend his days in a Heremitical Life. The Son in obedience to this his Father's Will, took upon him this Journey and manner of Life, where he had then been 25 years, living there in great Tranquillity and with more contentment than he could do in the World of <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides thoſe Relicts already mentioned he gave me a Teſtimonial in Writing, to evidence to the Curious my being there, which [<hi>after a Monkiſh Elegancy</hi>] runs thus:

               <p>SO ſoon as I was arrived at <hi>Urwan</hi> and entred the Houſe of my Patron <hi>Mehemet,</hi> he gave order to ſecure me with 2 Chains, for he feared that I would make my eſcape, by running into the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Jurisdiction. One of theſe Chains was light and tolerable, but the other very maſſy and ponderous, inſomuch that to bear the Chain alone, might ſeem to be Slavery enough. This Condition brought me into a deep Melancholy, even to death, not only that I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Slave, but that my Patrons Incredulity should be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch Affliction to me, as alſo that he should ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Word, when having promiſed to let me go free again, on condition he received that money upon my effecting the Cure, which the Heremite cauſed to be honeſtly paid; for had I not truſted to that his promiſe, I should have prevailed with the Heremite ſo far as to purchaſe my liberty, ſince the Slave-market is there very low. Beſides all this he continually wrought upon me to renounce Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, with many fair Promiſes, as, that if I would be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33105:141"/>
he would give me, two of the faireſt Damoſels in the Countrey for Wives; but this his proffer I refuſed without making much ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in framing of an Anſwer, deſiring him rather to ſevere my head from my body, than to urge me to what my Conſcience would not diſpence with: yet not ſatiſfied with this Reply, he perſiſted on, and told me that he would give me ſo many Acres of Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Orchards and Slaves: yet all he could imagine to perſwade me to embrace the <hi>Turkish</hi> Faith, would not move me ſo much as to give him the leſt hopes: inſomuch that for that time he broke off without giving me any ſharp Language. Shortly after he ſent 2 fair Girls, who at firſt entrance ſaluted me very friendly, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a trifling diſcourſe, they proceeded on to more ſerious matters, and conſequently proffered themſelves to me as Wives, making uſe of a <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Slave to be their Interpreter: and to make their requeſt prove the more effectual, they began to ſtroak me, and play a hundred wanton tricks to allure me, which when I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pray'd them to deſiſt and not to trouble me any longer, for it was againſt my Conſcience to violate the Laws of Chriſtianity, which forbid Polygamy, having already a Wife by whom I had two Children, and although I were in the moſt remote parts of the World, I ſhould not alienate my Love and Troth, by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of another ſo long as ſhe was alive. To this they made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That I ſhould never ſee either my own Countrey or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions again, and that many thouſands would be glad of what was proffered me, and therefore willed me to accept of it, leſt I ſhould afterwards repent when it could not be revoked, &amp;c. After they had uſed a few ſuch like Arguments they left me. Hardly were they got out but my Patron came in, who fell to work again with greater, and more ſpecious promiſes than before, as. That if I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Muſulman</hi> [or True Beleever] he would advance me to the Dignity of a Commander in the Guards. This perplexed me very much when I ſaw him ſo earneſt, thinking that if he could not get his will by fair means, he would proceed to rigour, and being abſolute Lord and Soveraign, as well of the Countrey, as of my Perſon, would force me to embrace the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I had already ſtood out ſo much Torture, that being a litle hardned to it I feared it ſo much the leſs: but gave him a ſhort
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33105:142"/>
Anſwer; to this Effect, <hi>Sir, All the fair promiſes you have already, and that you may hereafter make shall not have that efficacy with me, as to make me renounce my Faith, for I had rather diſpatch my ſelf, than to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Mahometanism.</hi> He hearing me ſay ſo did not for that time preſs me much more.</p>
               <p>On the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                  <hi>dito</hi> I continued ſtill in Chains, at what time the young Damoſels that had been with me before, were ſent again, who, as they did the laſt time, endeavoured to perſwade me to turn <hi>Mahometan</hi>; neither did they deſiſt to uſe all manner of Allurements they could deviſe, to entice me to ly with them, for ſo they thought that if I had done that, I muſt either become Turk, or dy a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Death; They further did what they could to put me in mind of my preſent miſery, and told me that I muſt never expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any better than what I ſaw before my eies; and in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all, told me that they wondred at the Folly and Vanity of the Chriſtians who were ſo ſtrictly tied to Monogamy, or only to marry one Wife, when as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> might have as many as they liſted, or thought themſelves capable to maintain.</p>
               <p>My Maſter altho he was a Prince yet thought it no diſhonour to trade in Commerce: but the chief thing he had which brought him up the moſt Revenues, were the Baths which he kept; having ſom almoſt in every City, as well in his own Juriſdiction as in <hi>Perſia</hi> and other Countreys, whereof thoſe were the moſt conſiderable, at <hi>Derbent,</hi> at <hi>Scamachy,</hi> and at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> which brought him in a vaſt ſum of Money yearly.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Baths are there in ſuch eſteem, and ſo much frequented by perſons of all Ranks and Degrees, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their affected Cleanlineſs, in which they ſurpaſs all others: but as well thro Superſtition: for that after the uſe of their Wives, they are to bath, being till then reputed unclean, and may not enter the <hi>Moſques:</hi> and this both ſexes are injoyned to upon ſuch Caſes by the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> A man among them may not ly with his wife from Conception to her Delivery: which is probably inſtituted as a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the <hi>Alchoran</hi> to make thoſe Countreys more populous; for ſo one Man is capable of generating many Children in one year. The Baths are frequented from Break of day to the Setting of the Sun. From morning till noon the Men bath, and from noon till night the Women, ſo taking it by Turns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:33105:142"/>On the 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> came my Patron to viſit me and asked me how I did, and if I had taken good Courage: I anſwered him that I had no great occaſion to thank him for my Welfare, ſince he did all he could to make me miſerable, and contrary to that Honeſty and Truth, which the <hi>Turks</hi> boaſted of, he had ſhown me an odd example: Withall telling him that he had little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to chain me ſo faſt, and make my Slavery the greater when as he had promiſed me my Freedom, upon the receipt of the Money which was paid him. Upon this he ſeemed to be a little moved to compaſſion and commanded that the greater Chain ſhould be taken off: Now when I obſerved that my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning had a litle prevalency with him I purſued on in my Argument, with theſe, or the like Words, <hi>Sir, Is it not ſufficient that I am your Slave? why then muſt I be kept in Chains, when as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have their liberty? If it be ſo that you fear I should go from you, Know this, That you can not keep me longer than I liſt: for I can at once part with my Life and take leav of this miſerable Bondage, which if you perſiſt to uſe me ſo inhumanly I am reſolved to do.</hi> This I could perceiv wrought in him no ſmall change, for he was naturally very covetous, and would have loſt the price of a Slave. Beſides that, it is a Maxim of their Law, that if any perſon do any way murther himſelf, the Houſe is to be accurſed and pulled down to the Ground. My Patron conſidering what the Iſſue of this might be, altho I had not the leſt thoughts to lay violent hands upon my ſelf. he therefore to prevent the worſt ſold me to one <hi>Hadſy Mahomet Sala,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr I. Struys ſold to a Perſian.</note> a <hi>Perſian</hi> for 25 <hi>Abbas,</hi> that was about 30 Shillings <hi>ſterl.</hi> which is but a ſmall ſum in compariſon to the ordinary Market price of <hi>Argiers,</hi> and other places in <hi>Barbary.</hi> My new Patron ſpoke the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Tongue very well, by which means we came to underſtand one another the better: for he uſed me more kindly than the other, and would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bid me have courage, ſaying, he would go with me to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> where there were many <hi>English, Dutch</hi> and other <hi>Europeans,</hi> and probably thoſe that would buy me off his hands, and ſo ſet me at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again, which gave me no ſmall encouragement to do my utmoſt to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>On the 12 <hi>dito,</hi> I went with my new Maſter to <hi>Derbent,</hi> and ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with him ſeveral times over the <hi>Caſpian Sea:</hi> his principal dealing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33105:143"/>
being in <hi>Crap,</hi> which with ſeveral other Roots uſed in Dying, grow there in great abundance. He had alſo a ſmall Bark of his own, wherein he tranſported his own Commodities: This ſaid Veſſel alwayes lay in a Bay about half a League from the City, and thither his Slaves alwaies brought the Wares; for about <hi>Derbent</hi> it is very rocky and unſafe for Veſſels to lie at Anchor, in caſe of Storm or tempeſtuous Weather. But in the ſaid Bay is very good anchorage, at 6, 7 and 8 Fathom Water, and a clay ground with Shells. The Coaſt from <hi>Baynak</hi> to <hi>Maſanderan</hi> is altogether ſandy, and here and there low land, where appear the Tops of the <hi>Dageſtan</hi> Hills: between thoſe two Coaſts it is all a long very good anchorage, there being many fair Roads able to receive Ships of a greater burthen than are uſually built for this Sea; there are alſo many fair Towns, built for the moſt part at the mouths of Rivers, and have many Veſſels and Shipping belonging to them, as well for Traffic and Tranſportation of Merchandizes, as for the Fiſhing trade: for this Sea is very plentiful of Fiſh, and brings up the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> an incredible ſum of Money yearly, receiving from ſome as Toll, and from others as Contribution. In the Bay of <hi>Gilan</hi> are 2 great Whirl-pools,<note place="margin">Great VVhirl-pools- in the Bay of <hi>Gilan.</hi>
                  </note> for which the <hi>Perſians</hi> are very fearfull in ſailing from their own Coaſts to <hi>Gilan.</hi> The Water in theſe Whirpools is hurried about with an incredible violence and makes ſuch a noiſe, that if the Weather be ſtill, they may be heard at 5 or 6 leagues diſtant. It is my opinion that theſe are the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages whereby this great Lake has a ſubterranean communication with the <hi>Euxin,</hi> or ſom other Sea, for it is well known that it receivs 84 huge Rivers, beſides the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which is reputed the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> River of the World for greatneſs, and hither do all the Floods of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Rivers haſten, as it were to their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with an admirable celerity, ſo that when we ſailed we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made a calculation how far we would be carried off in thwarting the ſtream, and ſo bore up towards the Coaſt, as well for ſhortning our Courſe, as to avoid the Whirpools, where if any Veſſel be brought ſhe muſt inevitably periſh. The beſt and moſt commodious Shipping for this Sea, is a Flat-bottom, from 80 to a hundred Tuns.</p>
               <p>Upon a time it happened that my Maſter and I fell into a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33105:143"/>
diſcourſe about Trading and Commerce, making a paralel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their way of merchandizing and ours, where among other Words, I told him <hi>That If I were once again at Liberty, I could make a good Advantage, and did not doubt but that in a short time I should return with a Ship full of</hi> Hollands <hi>Commodities</hi>: upon which he asked me, <hi>If I was ſo rich then</hi>? I anſwered <hi>No; But if I came ſafe into my own countrey ſome or other would intruſt me with a Cargo for thoſe parts, being now well acquainted with the Conveniency of the</hi> Caſpian <hi>Sea.</hi> My Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron hearing, that thought that I might probably be ſom way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to do him ſervice and that night diſcourſed ſom <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> about me who dealt in Silk: upon which they deſired to ſee me. My Maſter having appointed them a day, I went along with him, where one of the moſt eminent asked me if I could ſpeak <hi>Italian,</hi> and if I was of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or if I knew ſuch a Merchant there? I anſwered him in <hi>Italian,</hi> That I was of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but did not know the Gentleman he named, yet was acquainted with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral there who dealt in Silk. He then entred into a diſcourſe which was much after this manner:
<q>That the only way to Trade with <hi>Holland,</hi> was to bring over, Lead, Quickſilver, Cloth, Serges, Says and all kinds of <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> Commodities and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, which would be very marketable at <hi>Derbent, Scamachy</hi> and <hi>Ardobil</hi> and might produce good profit, ſo that all the Staple of Silk might be brought to <hi>Holland.</hi> and, That all Goods whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might be more conveniently tranſported over the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and ſo up the <hi>Wolga,</hi> bringing it down to <hi>Archangel,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Holland</hi>: which would not prove ſo tedious by far, as to bring it over Land to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where by the way ſo much Danger and ſo many Duties were met withall; and then from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to run the Hazard of the <hi>Barbary</hi> Corſairs thro the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sea: beſides unreaſonable Duties that are impoſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> which probably the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> would not ſet ſo high, to draw a Traffic of ſuch importance thro his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, &amp;c. That <hi>Gilan, Scirwan</hi> and other adjacent Provinces bordering upon the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, could deliver upwards of 50000 Bales of Silk every year. <hi>Bocharen</hi> alſo affoards pretious Furrs and the Eaſt Countrey good plenty of Segrine-Leather, Saffron, Rhubarb and other precious Druggs.</q>
This was the ſum of all the Diſcourſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33105:144"/>
we had for that time, but not much hopes were then given me of gaining my Freedom, by aſſiſting them in a Trade to <hi>Europe.</hi>

It has many Boughts, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Creeks and Angles: the Bay of <hi>Gilan</hi> tends above 38 Leagues inwards, taking its beginning at the Cape of <hi>Scabaran</hi> and reaches to <hi>Sengar Haſam.</hi> This Sea is environed moſtly on the Eaſt and North with a ſandy and barren ground, having alſo many Quarries of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Alabaſtre. On the Eaſt ſide of this Sea is a Noble River, not much inferior to the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which river parts the <hi>Calmuc</hi>-from the <hi>Gwin-Tartars</hi> but the Countrey on each ſide being inhabited with a wild People, uſing among themſelvs no kind of Traffic, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe for others to adventure themſelvs. My Maſter <hi>Mahomet Sala</hi> once ſailing paſt the mouth of this River, I preſſed him hard to ſail up to view the Conveniency and take an account of the Quality of the Countrey. But he told me, he had a greater eſteem for his Life, Ship and Goods, than to ſatisfy my curioſity about a buſine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Sea affoards great plenty of all kinds of Fiſh, and is farmed of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> for a vaſt ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

and that for a certain Diſtance from the Coaſt which is ſet off with Stakes, within which bounds none are to fiſh upon pain of Death, but without every one has the permiſſion to fiſh; yet without Fiſh is very rare except in ſome litle Shoals here, and there, and thoſe only at ſome Seaſons, which are uncertain. After the Farm is expired it is alſo free within the Stakes for every one to fiſh. Here is an incredible plenty of Salmon, as alſo Carps, Breams, Sturgeon and other Fiſh, held with us in great eſteem, and thoſe in general both larger and fatter than thoſe taken on the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other Sea or Water in <hi>Europe</hi> that I know. Carps when come to their full growth are ſometimes above 4 foot long, but thoſe are not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate as when they are leſs: Here alſo many ſtrange Fiſhes by us unknown, and I beleev moſt of them proper only to this Sea.

This City lies longwiſe Eaſt and Weſt from the Sea ſide to the Land, and is according to computation about 2 [<hi>English</hi>] miles long. One ſide thereof lies ſo near to the Sea that the Waves
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33105:145"/>
beat againſt the Walls, and in a Storm or tempeſtuous Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Surges riſe over the Walls. This is alſo reckoned as a Barrier againſt the Irruption of the <hi>Tartars</hi> and other Savages, being the only place on all that Coaſt for many miles together, where they can come aſhoar, for the Shoar is there naturally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with a ſteep Bank and wholly inacceſſible. Wherefore this City is not improperly called <hi>Derbent,</hi> which in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage imports as much as <hi>The Kingdoms Key, Der</hi> ſignifying a <hi>Key,</hi> and <hi>Bent</hi> a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Countrey</hi>: and ſo the City <hi>Gammeron</hi> on the <hi>Indian</hi> Coaſt is called <hi>Bender,</hi> which is the ſame Word with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Syllables, and a little variation of the Dialect.</p>
               <p>This Town is very ſtrongly munited with a Stone-Wall, and as ſome ſay, was built by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who had here his Reſidence for ſom time, althô there doth not any Building re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of his, ſave only the Wall on the South ſide, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: but all the Fortifications on the North were built by the famous <hi>Nauſchirwan,</hi> King of the <hi>Medes</hi>; having no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than a ſolid Rock. The Walls both on the North and the South ſide are ſo broad that Horſes and Waggons may ride all along, and the Stones are of a hard rock, brought hither from a Hill not far diſtant from the Town, being all equally 6 foot Square. On the Wall of <hi>Alexander</hi> [for it ſtill bears his name] is an oblong Stone having an ancient Inſcription in old <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic</hi> Characters, which none now a days can read.</p>

appears very plain, and is about four Foot thick. Round about this City are alſo divers ſtone Redoubts, whereof Four are furniſhed with Ammunition and a Garriſon of Soldiers ſuitable to the Occaſion of the Times. In the Countrey round about are alſo the Ruins of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong Caſtles, inſomuch that it plainly appears in what eſteem this Place has bin with the <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs in times paſt.<note place="margin">Walck Towers about <hi>Derbent.</hi>

On that ſide of the Town which faces the Countrey are many Sepulchrets, or Tombs, ſom of an oblong form, and others ſemicircular, being in breadth about a mans length and hollowed, ſo that a Man may eaſily ly in them. In this great Sepulchre was in times paſt a famous Battel fought, between <hi>Caſſan</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the <hi>Dageſtan Tartars,</hi> where the former had a notable overthrow, with the loſs of ſeveral Thouſand men, and the principal Heros and Leaders were buried in thoſe Tombs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this place and the Sea is alſo another Plat of Ground, environed with a high wall, wherein are 40 Tombs, under which are ſo many <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Median</hi> Princes interred and made ſacred to Memory. Upon the Walls are ſeveral Flags pitched, and by each an old Man to beg an Alms of ſuch as out of Devotion and a Religious Zeal come to viſit this place, as it is throughout all <hi>Perſia</hi> held very meritorious to viſit the Sepulchres and Graves of the Deceaſed.

               <p>Within <hi>Derbent</hi> live no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but altogether <hi>Mahometans,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few <hi>Iews</hi> who boaſt themſelvs to be deſcended from the houſe of <hi>Benjamin</hi>: theſe commonly follow baſe and diſhonorable Traffic, as buying of Prize-goods and Booty taken at Sea, which the <hi>Dageſtan Tartars</hi> bring thither to market:<note place="margin">Great market for Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</note> The reſt of the Inhabitants likewiſe trade in buying and ſelling of Slaves that being the main and almoſt only Merchandize they deal in, which they buy of the <hi>Dageſtan</hi> Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and ſend all over <hi>Perſia,</hi> making an incredible gain thereof. Thoſe that are brought hither for Slaves are very unhappy, for they are no more looked upon than an unreaſonable Animal or Bruit: and when
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:33105:146"/>
they are about buying, they pull of their Cloaths and grope them all over as if it were a Swine or a Calf. Beſides their low eſteem they have for Slaves as to their Perſons they are very unkind and void of Mercy, ſo that were it not for the Loſs of ſo much money very few of thoſe wretched caitiffs would die a natural Death; Thoſe people being by nature very prone to Anger, and beſides that too jealous to live upon Earth, thinking that if a Slave do but ſmile or caſt a friendly look toward one of their Wives that ſomething extraordinary muſt be in the caſe; althô I had never reaſon to complain of my Patron for any ſuch thing: but one that lived in the neighbourhood was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to that inquietude and reſtleſs humour. The bed where I lay was upon the Top of the houſe for coolneſs ſake, and could very well ſee into my neighbours Court, or Garden, where his Wives walked and played together being undreſt. The man ſaw me ſeveral times and I him; but he not knowing how to prevent it, went and told my Maſter that I hurled Stones among his Wives, which was not true, for conſidering what circumſtances I was under and ſenſible of the Condition of a Slave in thoſe Places, it had been a Token of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt imprudence in the World to hazard my ſelf ſo far as to offend ſuch men who were both void of Reaſon and had my Life in their hands. My Maſter told him he did not beleev that I would do any ſuch thing, <hi>Well,</hi> replies the other, <hi>take your Slave away,</hi> or, <hi>I ſhall bring him down for you.</hi> Upon this my Patron warned me to take heed of looking down any more, not knowing what might come of it. I was very curious to know what courſe the Infidel would take in hand, to fetch me down, and accordingly went down to the old Place, where I ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral long Hand-guns ready levelled and cock'd, laying out at the Window, which made me in all haſt to turn about and out of the way, but was no ſooner turned before I heard him fire, althô it did not the miſchief he hoped and expected. The Inhabitants, as was ſaid before, are in this place ſomthing curriſh-natured, but the <hi>Perſians</hi> in general do not uſe their Slaves ſo unkindly, as the <hi>Turks,</hi> which I could well obſerv the time I was on the Galleys, nor yet ſo inhumanly as they do at <hi>Argiers, Tripoli, Tunis, Salee,</hi> and other maritim Towns in <hi>Barbary,</hi> according to the univerſal report given by thoſe that fall into the hand of theſe cruel Men; for here when they do uſe them ſo hard, it is more to make them renounce their Faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                  <hi>Mahometans,</hi> than innate Cruelty. Moſt proud they are and lofty, boaſting in their honorable deſcent and Pedigrees from their ancient Nobility, famous in Hiſtory, and renowned from the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the <hi>Medes.</hi> The Soldiery, which they call <hi>Kiſsil-baſſchen,</hi> are very unruly, and take the leſt word that one can ſpeak for an affront, yea, ſuch is the aw they have gained of the People, that they dare not ſpeak without great reverence; ſure I am they have taught me ſilence, ſince they are accuſtomed to be the Interpreters of other Mens Words, and are as apt to miſconſtrue what is ſaid, whence conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they fall to blows.</p>
               <p>On the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> my Patron brought me again to Market,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſold again.</note> where he ſold me to one <hi>Hadzi Biram Ali,</hi> A very rich Merchant in Jewels. The ſame <hi>Hadzi Biram</hi> had 9 Wives, 5 at <hi>Derbent,</hi> and 4 at <hi>Scamachy.</hi> The Chief of theſe 9 was a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlewoman by birth, and a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but her Father was an <hi>Amſterdammer,</hi> by name <hi>Iohn Fluſius,</hi> who had a Command of Horſe under <hi>Caſimire</hi> K. of <hi>Poland,</hi> and married there a Gentlewoman of that Countrey by whom he had 4 Children. Upon a time, when theſe People lived in the Countrey, it happened that the <hi>Tartars</hi> made an irruption into <hi>Poland,</hi> and among many others carried away my ſaid Patroneſſe, being then a Damoſel of 12 years old, and ſold her for a Slave. She was a Gentlewoman of a very fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and a well proportioned Body at that time, for which reaſon alone (I ſuppoſe) my Patron bought her and made her his Wife, promoting her ſhortly after above the reſt.</p>
               <p>It was my Maſters cuſtom to bath himſelf once a day in the Sea,<note place="margin">His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron in danger of his Life.</note> which the Inhabitants of thoſe Parts do account very wholſom, and his cuſtom was alwaies to take me with him to hold his Horſe till he had don. It happened that one time he went a litle farther in than was uſual, and lighting accidentally in a Whirl-pool he was forcibly overturn'd and not able to recover himſelf. I ſeeing him then immerge made all the haſt I could to get him out: and coming to the Place could not get a ſight of him for it was as I ſuppoſed in a Quickſand: but at laſt, by accident I felt his head with my Foot, which I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to take hold of with my hand, and at laſt got him out, brought him to the Land and lay him over a Stone, till abundance of water came guſhing out of his Mouth, but no appearance of Life was left in him, when I thought he was rid of the moſt part of the Water, I
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33105:147"/>
ſet him upon the Horſe and got up my ſelf behind him, in the mean while he continued bleeding at the Noſe and Ears, and ſo weak that I had much ado to hold him upright upon the Horſe After he came home he was put to bed, which he kept for 14 days together before he recovered his Strength. It was no ſmall cauſe of Joy to me that things fell ſo well out, as that he lived to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the true cauſe of this diſmal accident: whereas if he had died, 't would certainly have coſt me my Life, among thoſe brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, furious and unreaſonable People, eſpecially in conſideration of of the Condition I was in, not only a Stranger both to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Manners as well as their Countrey and Perſons, but likewiſe a Slave, for whoſe Death and Slaughter a man is no more accountable than for the ſlender Value and Market price; whilſt on the contrary it fell out that I got the Credit of ſaving his Life, and his Benevolence ever after for an act of ſuch merit, having run the jeopardy of my own Perſon. So much kindneſs he profeſſed for me, that he promiſed to take me with him to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> where he ſaid he would beſtow me upon ſome of my own Nation.</p>
               <p>This Motion liked me exceeding well, but my chief Patroneſs who ſpoke very good <hi>Low-dutch</hi> adviſed me to the Contrary, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>My Husband, your Lord, 'tis true goes for</hi> Iſpahan, <hi>but from thence he intends to go on a Pilgrimage to Meccha, and beſtow</hi> 200000 <hi>Gil. on the Sepulchre of Mahomet, for which Gift he and his Son</hi> Hadzy Kan, <hi>will be canonized and regiſtred among the Saints, for a perpetual memory of themſelvs and Honor of their Poſterity, and now you are not ſenſible what Danger hangs over your head in regard of your Religion.</hi> This ſaid; ſhe told me if I would vow Silence ſhe would impart me a Secret, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would be of more importance than that, and without doubt I should judge it more worthy of Acceptance. I promiſed her I would not detect her Council, be what it would; but for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it deſired her not to injoyn me till I had heard and well conſidered of it. To this ſhe replies. <hi>See if you can prevail with your Patron to excuſe you on this Journey, or if you can counterfeit with Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, feign your ſelf ſick: To which if he gives his aſſent, we will trip off together, after he has been a few weeks upon his Journey, and being you are well acquainted with the</hi> Caſpian <hi>Sea we, will take our Bark with us. I have means enough to Maintain us in any part of the World ſo long as we
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33105:147"/>
live, I have at preſent in my Cuſtody a Casket of Jewels worth</hi> 300000 <hi>gild at leſt, beſides a ſum of</hi> 10000 <hi>Ducats in Gold. I prethee then let's not loſe this opportunity but away with our own Bark; and I hope that we shall in</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>days be in</hi> Ruſſia, <hi>from whence we can go forward to</hi> Holland, <hi>and if your wife be not alive we shall marry, if not I shall ſeek up my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>ſuppoſing my Fathers Brother may be ſtill alive.</hi> To this I replyed, <hi>Moſt gracious and worthy Madam, what you propoſe is very well, and what I could freely embrace and would willingly undertake to manage, But Madam, are you not ſenſible that</hi> Aſtrachan <hi>is at preſent under hands of the</hi> Coſacs, <hi>and the Caſpian Sea full of Pyrats, how then may we promiſe our ſelvs a ſafe Arrival in</hi> Ruſſia? <hi>Well,</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>Do you think that</hi> Aſtrachan <hi>will be ſtill in tenure of the Rebells? no, without doubt, we shall ſpeedily hear that the</hi> Czar <hi>will come down with a great Army and deſtroy that Vermin.</hi> &amp;c, Hereupon ſhe ſhowed me an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſure of <hi>Diamonds, Emeralds, Rubies</hi> and other Precious Stones.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſals I muſt confeſs gave me work enough to ſtudy upon day night, and certainly had not <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> then bin in the hand of the <hi>Coſacs</hi> I had taken it upon me, not doubting, but to have good ſucceſs, being able enough to pilot a Veſſel from thence to the <hi>Wolga,</hi> for I was very well acquainted with the Coaſts, but becauſe of the before mentioned difficuly was fain to refuſe her offer. I could obſerve that the Lady was ſom way diſaffected to her huſband, which I preſumed was ſom certain Jealouſy; for my Patron had bought not long before 2 <hi>Georgian</hi> Girls for Slaves, the one of 11, and the other of 12 years old, with whom he lay by Turns, which was no ſmall trouble to his Wife, who was her ſelf not above 26 years of Age, and therefore very unwilling to be a Widdow with a living husband.</p>
               <p>On the 22 came two of our Ships-company to <hi>Derbent,</hi> to wit, <hi>Cornelius de Vries,</hi> the Gunner, and <hi>Peter Arentſz</hi> of <hi>Schevelingen.</hi> Theſe had been taken in <hi>Boynak,</hi> near the <hi>Scemkal,</hi> and had betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to flight, being followed by ſome <hi>Tartars</hi> to the Gate of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent</hi>; where they were reſcued by a Soldier, who ſpoke the <hi>Ruſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Tongue very well, which Soldier ſeeing them ſo hotly purſued, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> cloſe at their heels, interpoſed himſelf between them, and asked ours, Who they were? who repled, They were
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33105:148"/>
                  <hi>Dutch,</hi> and had Letters for the <hi>Sultan.</hi> Whereupon the Soldier tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the <hi>Tartars</hi> bade them ſee what they did, for that thoſe men had Letters for the <hi>Sultan</hi>: and ſo they got free from the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> but were ſuddenly carried before the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who ſo ſoon as they were admitted asked them, What Countreymen they were? They anſwered <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Then he asked for the Letters which he was informed they had for him, upon which they fell down u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their knees humbly begging Forgiveneſs, ſaying, <hi>That we have ſaid, how that we had Letters for the</hi> Sultan, <hi>Great and Mighty Prince, we cannot deny, for moſt true it is; but that was only an Invention to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and releaſe our Perſons from the</hi> Tartars, <hi>that purſued us to within the</hi> Perſian <hi>Juriſdiction: Wherefore, Great Sir, vouchſafe to have Compaſsion upon us, for we are thoſe very people that fled from</hi> Aſtrachan <hi>upon the approaching of the</hi> Coſacs, <hi>and have been unfortunately Stranded on the</hi> Dageſtan <hi>Coaſt, where we were plundered, beat and made Slaves by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and ſince continued in miſerable Servitude under the</hi> Scemkal, <hi>and therefore have made bold to ſeek Protection under your Highneſs.</hi> They told him moreover how that they had been 3 days and 2 nights by the Way; Travelling only by night and hiding themſelvs by day, leſt they ſhould be detected, and retaken, as they had ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been at the Gate, if the Soldier had not ſhown them ſuch a a Favour. The <hi>Sultan</hi> freely pardoned them and ſent them to a Houſe where he had ordered they ſhould have abode and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, till they were otherwiſe provided; for this Prince, has ever been favourable to our Nation. But theſe two fearing that their Living ſo would coſt them too dear, and that one time or another they muſt pay for all, they removed into a <hi>Carwanſera,</hi> for ſo they call an Inn or Tavern, where they took no care for Diet, being well ſupplied by the continual concourſe of people that came thither, as well <hi>Indians</hi> as <hi>Perſians.</hi> The <hi>Sultan</hi> alſo promiſed to write to the King about the Redemption of the reſt of the Captiv Slaves, and as much as in him lay to further the ſame. Certain it is he did as kindly for our Countrey men as might be expected from him, when as the Brother of the <hi>Scemkal</hi> came to demand them as Fugitivs, and he refuſed to let them go, for that they were now in <hi>Derbent,</hi> and that the King had underſtood how unkindly they had dealt with thoſe that were his Allies, and with thoſe with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33105:148"/>
whom his Subjects had a great correſpondence, as to matter of Commerce: Inſomuch that <hi>Aly,</hi> the <hi>Tartar,</hi> returned without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what he came for, and the Slaves they had ſtill were for this reaſon more ſeverely uſed than before, and kept with more ſtrictneſs, ſince by that they were ſenſible, that if they could but make their eſcape to <hi>Derbent</hi> they were protected.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as I underſtood that <hi>P. Arents</hi> and <hi>De Vries</hi> were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Derbent</hi> I pray'd my Patron to let me go to viſit them, which he granted. So ſoon as I came to them, I begun to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their manner of Eſcaping, and of their preſent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which they related from the beginning to the end of all. My Patron was alſo curious to ſee them and came himſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Upon which I did bethink my ſelf of a Stratagem to redeem my Companion <hi>Els Pieterſz,</hi> who was ſtill at <hi>Boynak.</hi> I told my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then that I had ſtill a Son in the Hands of Prince <hi>Oſmin,</hi> and looking towards the Gunner I gave him a wink with the Eie, that he ſhould aſſert it, which when my Patron asked him he did: he therefore ſent to redeem him with intention to keep us both, but the Party ſent, who was a <hi>Ruſsian</hi> and a <hi>Renegado,</hi> brought us news that he was gone within Land, which ſadly troubled me: For, had I got him to <hi>Derbent</hi> I could have brought him to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> where there was more apparency and likelyhood of obtaining Liberty than among the obſcure <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meanwhile I went dayly to viſit the Gunner and <hi>Peter Arentſz,</hi> and once finding them very heartleſs and Melancholic I did all I could to comfort them. <hi>How,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>can you be ſo ſad being free, and I who am a Slave ſtill keep a good heart? Be not ſo dejected, for the</hi> Perſians <hi>will ſom time or other take you with their</hi> Caravans <hi>to</hi> Iſpahan, <hi>and ſo you may get to</hi> Gameron, <hi>and thence be tranſported for the</hi> Indies, <hi>by which means you will be brought home,</hi> &amp;c. They told me alſo that the reſt of the Company were at liberty and without Chains, that they had alſo reſolved to flee together, but judged themſelvs aſwell unſafe at <hi>Derbent,</hi> which they had intended for their <hi>Aſylum,</hi> ſaying, That they ſhould come thither ſoon enough, when they ſhould be ſold at the Slave-Market; and certainly they were not much over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, for the greateſt Task they had was only to hew wood for Fewel and other uſes in the Princes Houſe: and if my companion
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33105:149"/>
and I had but had the ſame opportunity they had to be unchain'd we ſhould not have dallied long about a Reſolution, whether to ſtay or betake our ſelvs to flight, for it was not above 12 [<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>[ miles from <hi>Derbent.</hi> We often contrived to break or file the Chain in ſunder, but the Links were ſo maſſy that we durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt leſt we ſhould not perform it at one time. They were alſo taken by the <hi>Dageſtan-Tartars,</hi> which are reputed the more mercifull, but we by the <hi>Calmucs,</hi> the one being under the <hi>Oſmin</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the <hi>Scemkal. C. Brak</hi> was ſold by the <hi>Scemkal</hi> for thrée years, after the expiration of which time his <hi>Patron</hi> was to have him again: His Wife whom the Prince had raviſhed, was alſo taken from him and made uſe by the ſaid Prince for a Concubine, being attired in Princely Habit, and had much favour ſhown her. <hi>Brak</hi> therefore intending to make his eſcape, intimated his Deſign to his Wife; who would by no means aſſent to the matter, becauſe of her Child, and told him further that if he did offer to go that ſhe would detect the matter to the Prince. To this he replied, that inaſmuch as ſhe was taken from him they were never like to come together again, and that he probably for that reaſon ſhould be carried farther within Land, where he ſhould be out of all hopes of ever being redeemed; whereas on the contrary if ever he came to <hi>Derbent</hi> that there he ſhould not only himſelf be free, but alſo ſeek a mean to get her redeemed, yet all this was but in vain, for ſhe would not hear of it; inſomuch that he was fain to run away without her knowledge; but what then became of him, and whether he was retaken by ſome others, or is dead, I could never yet be ſo happy as to know. As to his Flight, we were well aſſured, for his Patron ſent to us at <hi>Derbent</hi> to enquire after him, but had a very unwelcom Anſwer: and the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to hearing that ſuch a Perſon was come to ſeek for them, gave order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, and ſo continued him Captiv till he proved that he only came to ſeek one that he had bought for ready Money, and was not of Intention to meddle with any body elſe; upon which the <hi>Sultan,</hi> ordered him enlargement.</p>

He comes firſt into the Service of the <hi>Polish</hi> Ambaſſadour.</head>
               <p>ON the 29 were ſent out about 50 Slaves together with ſome other free perſons to hew Wood in the Countrey, amongſt which my Patron ſent me alſo. We took our way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mountains, having with us two Carts, with 5 Oxen, 2 Aſſes and a Horſe, we had alſo ſeveral Renegados with us. All the Company went into the Wood, and fell to work leaving me alone to look to the Carts and Proviſion. After they had been about 3 hours at work, I eſpied a Troop of about 300 Men coming towards us, and thinking by the haſt they made towards us, that they were Robbers, I therefore called out to them in the Wood, to give them Notice that they might keep together. When I ſaw them come within Bow-ſhot of me I ran away as faſt as I could drive, which they ſeeing me, ſent a Shaft or two, but they did not hit me. Having entred the Wood I met our Company coming out who at firſt ſtoutly reſiſted, but finding that the Robbers fell on with a greater violence, and exceeded us both for Arms and Number of Men, they thought good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with as much haſt as they could. We left here 12 dead, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which was a <hi>Polish</hi> Renegado; beſides theſe that were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led we had 20 wounded, and loſt all our Baggage, with Carts, Oxen, Aſſes, &amp;c. and were fain to return ſo home. For this reaſon is it very perillous to hew wood or to paſs thoſe mountains upon any other Occaſion, being the Rendevouz of the <hi>Banditti</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who notwithſtanding all the Indeavours which the King doth, by ſending of Troops down to expell them, cannot be driven out, for
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33105:150"/>
when they perceiv that any Forces are ſent out againſt them, they run into Caves and holes in the Hills and Woods: They are alſo very well diſciplin'd and as well arm'd, the greateſt part thereof conſiſting in deſerting Soldiers. And by reaſon thoſe of <hi>Derbent</hi> muſt have all their Fewel and Timber from this Place, and the work put upon the Slaves, it happens that every year a great number of thoſe miſerable ſort of men are either diſpatched or wounded.</p>
               <p>The next day I was ſent up into the Countrey to a place where my Patron kept his Cattle, which I was to look after and drive them up and down where I found the beſt Paſturage.<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor taken and carried away by Robbers.</note> When the Sun was gon down and I driving the Cattle to their Houſe, I met 3 Robbers, who took three Cows away with them, and tied my hands behind my back, ſo drawing me along; yet it was not long before we met with 8 Gentlemen of <hi>Derbent,</hi> ſom whereof knew me, being frequently at my Maſters houſe. Theſe therefore releaſed me and retook the Beaſts, ſo that I came ſafe home: for which kindneſs my Maſter gave them a Preſent, I ſuppoſe, of more value than what I was ſold for to him. Unſpeakable was the kindneſs of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron that he had for me, for althô my Work was a litle ſervile and Slaviſh, yet my Bed and Table was Lordly; and whatſoever I did whether well or ill, he always took it in good part, and would after that time, never ſuffer me to go abroad to do any work, ſaying, that he beleeved that I was born under ſom malevolent Planet. To be brief I found my daily Taſk ſo eaſy, and my uſage ſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that were it not for the name of a Slave and that to a <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> I could not have lived better abroad in any Place of the World, having litle or no care upon my head.</p>

                  </note>About this time my Patron made preparation to take a Journey for <hi>Scamachy,</hi> there to repair his Houſes which were thrown down with an Earth-quake in the year 1667. On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> we were ready and ſet forward with a <hi>Caravan</hi> of 1800 Horſes, and a great number of Camels, Dromedaries, Aſſes and other Beaſts of Carriage, having in Company ſeveral Thouſands of Men. The firſt day we paſſed over three Rivers, to wit <hi>Kurgani, Koſtar,</hi> and <hi>Sambur</hi>; whereof the ſecond is the greateſt, running thrô the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Elbur.</hi> This River divides it ſelf into 5 branches, or arms, broad but ſhallow, and runs over a ſtony Ground. The next day
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:33105:150"/>
we travailed 8 [<hi>Dutch</hi>] miles further and came to <hi>Koctep</hi> a large vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where we took our reſt for that night.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>SEPT.</hi> 1670.</note> By the way we ſaw a goodly Tomb erected to the memory of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Saint, The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Town and the Countrey about it are called <hi>Padar</hi> in their Language. They are much addicted to ſtealth and Robbery, ſo that we were fain to keep a narrow watch over them the time we lay in the Town, which was not above 8 hours. Their Houſes are but little, built ſquare and covered on the Top with Earth, not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 6 or 7 foot high above ground, but are as deep below, as they are high.</p>
               <p>On the 3 of the ſame moneth we ſet forward and travailed through many great villages, amongſt which was a very fair one called <hi>Niſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> or <hi>Nayſabath,</hi> which I gueſs lies about 41 <hi>degr.</hi> and a <hi>quart.</hi> It is ſeated in a very pleaſant Countrey of <hi>Old Media,</hi> now called <hi>Surwan,</hi> or <hi>Schirwan.</hi> This is the Place where ſom time agon the <hi>Holſteyn</hi> Ambaſſadours ſuffered Shipwrack. At night we ſet down at <hi>Muſkar,</hi> being a Town without Walls, or any other Fortification but ſeems to have bin in times paſt a place of truſt, as well from its Situation, as the Ruins of the Walls and Bulwarks which yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. By the way we ſaw abundance of Robbers in the Woods, but they knowing us to be too ſtrong would not adventure the Attempt.</p>
               <p>On the 4 we broke up, and that day came to <hi>Scabaran</hi> a little City, where the whiteſt and beſt Rice in all <hi>Perſia</hi> is brought to market, and grows in the Countrey round about. It is alſo in ſuch plenty that the Hundred weight is ſold for 13 <hi>Ochbas, [being about</hi> 4 <hi>Shil.</hi> 2 <hi>Pence</hi> Sterl. or a halfpenny <hi>per Pound.</hi>] The Walls of this City are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed ſo that it is no more than an open village. The only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable I found here was the Ruins of the Ovens, wherein they averr <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> had Bread baked for his Army.</p>
               <p>On the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we came to the mountain <hi>Par</hi>— or <hi>Barmach,</hi> which lies cloſe to the Sea, and is very famous for it's many veins of <note n="*" place="margin">Which is alſo called <hi>Median</hi> Oil &amp; <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen,</hi> of the nature of Marl, which when once ſet on fire, will burn more vigorouſly if water be poured upon it, but is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with Earth, Duſt, or any other thing that is dry.

that all hung with Iceicles. On this Hill appear the Ruins of ſom Watch-Towers, and below have been ſeveral Fortlets to check the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and ſecure the <hi>Medians</hi> from the Invaſion of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Robbers.

                  <hi>Petrelaeum</hi> is an Oil coming naturally out of the veins of the Rock, which veins do run thro the whole ſtones, as in Marble. There are 40 Pits digged as Receptacles to hold the ſaid Oil, being convey'd thither by ſeveral Pipes, or Conduits; But there are three of thoſe whence it naturally flows or ſprings, where you may ſee it buble up like boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pitch. Of this Oil there be two ſorts; the one tending to a brown or black, which has a very ſtrong ſmell, but the other which is white is of a lovely ſmell when freſh, and held in far more eſteem than the other.</p>
               <p>On the 6 <hi>dito</hi> we ſet forward again, and went over very high Hills, coming at night to <hi>Bachal</hi> a village ſeated in a low but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Valley. Here grows much Rice, and that very good, it being a marſhy Ground, where that Grain likes beſt; Barley alſo grows there in good plenty. The Inhabitants have an excellent way of making Cakes, the main ſtuff thereof being Honey and Oil: whereof for the rareneſs and novelties ſake my Maſter bought certain to uſe on our Journey.</p>
               <p>On the 7 <hi>dito</hi> we left <hi>Bachal,</hi> and after a good Days Journey came into <hi>Cothany,</hi> which is a very pleaſant Place: and here we took up our Lodging. This Village lies in a low Valley which is full of Woods of Haſles and other ſmall Trees, in which Woods are the greateſt plenty of Hares that ever I have ſeen in all my Life.</p>
               <p>On the 8 <hi>dito</hi> we arrived at the famous <hi>Scamachy,</hi> called alſo <hi>Sumahi,</hi> and <hi>Samachy.</hi> It is a very famous Mart, and lies in 40 <hi>degr.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> In the Province of <hi>Schirwan,</hi> or <hi>Media.</hi> It is handſomly ſeated in a Vally, ſo that one cannot ſee it till he be within Cannon Shot of the Town. The diſtance between <hi>Derbent</hi> and <hi>Scamachy</hi> is computed a Weeks Journey, excluding Sunday, to wit, following the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way which is crooked and Winding, for by reaſon of Hills and Rivers they are fain to travel far about, or otherwiſe one might go it in 2 days: there is alſo another way which Paſſengers take when they go not with the <hi>Caravan</hi>; the Caravan would alſo go that way,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33105:151"/>
but the Tolls about the Mountains of <hi>Lahatz</hi> are very great, and oftentimes long a clearing, ſo that they rather chuſe to go the other way. In former times this was a Town of ſome conſideration as to matter of ſtrength; but in the Wars of <hi>Abas,</hi> the <hi>Scach,</hi> or King of <hi>Perſia</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> it was by him diſmantled and made an open village, which was ever by him a Maxim of Military Policy, by reaſon the Turks were wont to retire into fortified Places under pretext of Refuge, and after a few Moneths proving ſtrong and numerous would ſurrender up the Town to their own Nation in time of War, or upon an Uproar:<note place="margin">Scama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</hi>

               <p>The Northern Quarter is far leſs than the Southern, and the Mote ſo ſhallow together with the mean condition of the Walls, that one may enter in as they pleaſe in many Places, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their due ſhutting of the Gates, that are in number 5. The Streets are all thrô the Town very narrow and the Buildings low, made up of Clay, Planks and Twigs daubed over.

Near this place are alſo two great Warehouſes having ſeveral Portics or Alleys, where all Merchants-ſtrangers buy and ſell ſeveral ſorts of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes.

This Town upon my arrival there was altogether new built, althô about 3 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it lay on heaps.

Ambaſſadour to buy me of my Patron. This gave a delicate ſound in my Ear, being the only thing I deſired to hear of; and coming home began to ſupplicate my Maſter that he would vouchſafe to ſell me into the Hands of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, at which he ſeem'd to be a litle altered, and ſaid, John, <hi>conſider with your ſelf the nature of your requeſt: have you found ſuch hard uſage the time you have been with me? Why then would you go from me? Go rather with me to</hi> Iſpahan, <hi>where, ſince you have once ſaved my life and in all things elſe proved faithfull, I will beſtow you upon ſom of your own Nation without Redemption Money: or any thing elſe in ſtead of you, where you ſhall be aſſuredly free.</hi> But I ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the words of my Patroneſs <hi>Altine,</hi> and had no great ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to go for <hi>Iſpahan</hi> with him: However with many thanks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his Offer, praying him rather if he had the Kindneſs for me he profeſſed, that he would pleaſe to let me have my requeſt herein; for I longed mainly to be among Chriſtians. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſince you will go, you ſhall, but be aſsured you ſhall not find better uſage than you have here, althô it were with a Chriſtian, [forſooth]. As for this</hi> Bochdan <hi>the</hi> Poliſh <hi>Miniſter, he is not ſo good a Chriſtian as you think, but a light vain</hi> Georgian, <hi>whom the King of</hi> Poland <hi>has diſpatched to the</hi> Sophy, <hi>to treat about a War with the</hi> Turks, <hi>but ſuch is his deportment here, and remiſsneſs in the Affairs of the King his Maſter, that he will in all probability be called in queſtion about it.</hi> All this did not a whit daunt me from my Reſolution, for I gave him a certain allowance as to the Character he had given him; or, althô he had been ſuch a Perſon there was more hopes of my coming home thrô <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> ſooner than thrô <hi>India,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Batavia.</hi> This <hi>Bochdan</hi> as I have been ſince infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med had formerly a Command of Horſe under the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and was ſo well acquainted with the Humor of the King, that he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd on this Ambaſſage, but much envy'd by the <hi>Polanders.</hi> The next day I was ſold and delivered up to the Ambaſſador for 150 <hi>Abas,</hi> being the ſum <hi>Hadſy Biram</hi> had paid for me to the Prince. Upon my taking leav of my Maſter, he wiſhed me happineſs, and withone told me that he was ſenſible the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had Money enough to redeem a Chriſtian, otherwiſe he would have taken nothing for me.</p>
               <p>And now was none more happy than my ſelf in imagination, not thinking otherwiſe than ſuddenly to have my Freedom. On the 1 of <hi>November</hi> I was ſent for by the Ambaſſadour, where being

introduced into the Parlor, he ſpeedily bad me ſit down, and fell to aſking many Queſtions about my Nation, and my coming to be a Slave. I told him all from the Beginning to the End. He then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a Bowl of Wine, and bade me drink. Whilſt I ſat there, were two young <hi>Georgian</hi> Girls brought to the Door, who being ſtole by the <hi>Dageſtan Tartars,</hi> of handſom Bodies, and tolerable Beauties as alſo the Ambaſſadours own Countrey Women he had compaſſion of them and bought them for the value of 100 Crowns.

He on the Contrary continued a Junketting with thoſe of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that an Ox a day would not have been too much, if it were not for varietie and change of Diet. He bought 13 Kine which he ſent out into the Field, and ſet me to look after them, but finding my ſelf at a loſs for Victuals, I aſſumed the liberty to tell his Excellency <hi>that he muſt pleaſe to ſend me ſomthing to eat in the Field.</hi> His anſwer was: <hi>If you will have any thing, ſteal a cow from the</hi> Perſians, <hi>and help your ſelf ſo.</hi> But that Commiſſion I took occaſion to let alone, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that my maſters Order would not excuſe me.

Shortly after he alſo received a Mandate from <hi>Iſpahan</hi> to depart immediatly for <hi>Poland,</hi> which was acceptable news for the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentry, hoping at once to be rid of that Slavery and Miſery they ſuffered. After my old Patron had diſcourſed me a litle about this affair, took his leav of me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, John, <hi>I am very ſorry for your condition, pre'thee therefore com twice

               <p>'Tis true this Offer was very acceptable, but all my fear was, that <hi>Hadſi</hi> would not tarry long at <hi>Scamachy,</hi> ſo that I ſhould again be at a loſs, and therefore I determined with my ſelf to run away; as then I met with an opportunity to go for <hi>Smyrna</hi> with a great <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> which was a preparing and almoſt ready to ſet forward. I had already beſpoke my ſelf to go with an <hi>Armenian</hi> who was to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 6 days before the general Departure with the great <hi>Caravan,</hi> but what reaſon I met with to the contrary ſhall be ſhortly told.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4. I went out of the Town to ſee if I could ſpeak with an Ambaſſadour who was diſpatched from <hi>Iſpahan</hi> to <hi>Moſcou,</hi> and to requeſt of him to repreſent our Condition to the <hi>Czar,</hi> but I could not get to ſpeech of him. He had with him 4 Tygres and Leopards for a preſent to the Great Duke.</p>
               <p>On the 11 to my great Aſtoniſhment and Joy I ſaw our Captain <hi>Butler,</hi> together with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Gunner, <hi>J. van Termund, Chriſtian Brand, Lewis Fabritius</hi> and <hi>Peter Arentſz</hi> coming into <hi>Scamachy</hi>; upon which in all haſt I ran to bid them welcom and ſalute them, althô the Captain ſhowed himſelf much diſpleaſed at us, for that we (as he alleadged) went away without his leav and order, and not waiting for him: to which I replied, <hi>Captain you cannot forget what your Order was, That we ſhould not ſtay ſo much as a quarter of an hour for any one, after the Gates were ſhut, but if any transgreſsion of your Order muſt be imputed to us, it muſt be this that we ſtay'd till midnight for you, and not hearing any thing of you, we concluded that you were either killed in the Tumult, or had made your eſcape ſom other way; we then not holding it ſafe for us to make any longer delay, thought it more prudence to put off than to ſtay till it was day light,</hi> &amp;c. With theſe and other reaſons I gave him he ſeemed to be ſatisfied, and promiſed to do all that lay in his power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Redemption, as from that time forward he laboured very much to do. And this was the reaſon, that my intended Journey for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> was not undertaken thinking this to be a more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33105:156"/>
and a more ſecure way to get free: for this happened juſt the ſame day I had purpoſed to ſet forward with the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and ſo after 2 or 3 days Journey to wait for the great <hi>Caravan.</hi> Our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain applies himſelf to the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Scamachy</hi> to intercede for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivs, but all he could do might not avail, for there was no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience lent him, It ſeemed as if the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Derbent</hi> had hardned his temper, for in preſence of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and others that had taken the Mediation upon them; whereas on the contrary they had ever been good Friends with the <hi>Calmuc</hi> &amp; <hi>Oſmin,</hi> frequently ſending and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mutual Preſents from each other.</p>
               <p>When the Captain ſaw there was no hopes to procure our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at <hi>Scamachy,</hi> he purpoſes to go for <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and addreſs himſelf to the King; the more for that the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company might aſſiſt him. He therefore took up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Abas</hi> of an <hi>Armenian,</hi> for which he muſt have pay'd 25 <hi>per Cent</hi> more at <hi>Iſpahan:</hi> he left <hi>I. van Termund</hi> at <hi>Scamachy</hi> for ſecurity.</p>
               <p>On the 18 <hi>Chriſtian Brand</hi> by the interceſſion of <hi>I. van Termund,</hi> was taken to board in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Houſe, giving good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the ſame at <hi>Scamachy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mean while the Brother of the ſaid Ambaſſador went a ſecond time to Court, for to get the conſent of the <hi>Scach</hi> in changing of his Religion, but the reſult was as unwelcom to him as the former, with an expreſs order to depart immediatly for <hi>Poland,</hi> and to give a reaſon of his delay. This news as it was very unacceptable to him, for that he was ſenſible how affairs would be repreſented at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> there being a Courier diſpatched off from the <hi>Scach</hi> to the K. of <hi>Poland</hi>; ſo was it alſo very welcom and acceptable news for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Gentlemen in his Retinue. Nor did this outwardly appear at the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, for upon ſuch occaſions they never acquaint any Forreign Miniſter with any dislike, but intimate it by their own at the Court from whence they are ſent in ſuch Quality, whence they expect Satisfaction. This when <hi>Bochdan</hi> underſtood he ſtudied all means to avoid going back to <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and aſked me if I thought that the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, or their Directors there, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to let him imbarque there for <hi>Holland</hi>? My reply was that I did not beleev it would be granted, and told him ſeveral Praecedents for it, as alſo the improbability of the thing ſince their Intereſt was ſo
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:33105:156"/>
great in Commerce with <hi>Perſia</hi>; as that they would not do any thing to quit it: However if he would go clandeſtinly and occaſion a Rumor as if he were gone for <hi>Moſcou,</hi> or ſom where in <hi>Tartary,</hi> he might imbarque himſelf as a privat Perſon. This I ſaid in hopes to come that way home my ſelf. Yet he was various in his Intentions, ſomtimes taking a reſolution to go for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and ſomtimes for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or elſewhere. However during the time he was at <hi>Scamachy,</hi> he Lorded it ſo bravely, that the <hi>Chan</hi> durſt not check him in any extravagancy he committed: for it ſeems that the ſaid <hi>Chan</hi> had taken up a conſiderable Sum of the Ambaſſador upon Intereſt and not being able to pay was fain to reſt contented. But the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador willing to get in his Money and the <hi>Chan</hi> not in a Capacity to pay it upon demand, the Ambaſſador ſent his Brother to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> to make complaint to the <hi>Schach,</hi> which when the <hi>Chan</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſent a Poſt after him, who intreated him to return back, upon promiſe of Payment, and full Solution both of Stock and Intereſt.</p>
               <p>On the 21 came a <hi>Perſian</hi> to <hi>Scamachy</hi> with <hi>William Barentſz Klopper</hi> our Chief-Mate, who had been taken by the <hi>Tartars</hi> and ſeverely uſed all the time. The ſaid <hi>Perſian</hi> offered him to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor who on the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> bought him. The <hi>Scemkal</hi> had firſt ſold him to a <hi>Perſian</hi> of <hi>Bachu</hi> for 150 <hi>Abas.</hi> This new Patron ſet him to keep Cattle, in a Paſture, between <hi>Derbent</hi> and <hi>Scamachy,</hi> where upon our Journey to <hi>Scamachy</hi> I ſaw, but knew him not. He had a very churliſh fellow to his Patron, and therefore attempting ſeveral times to run away was ſtill caught again, and beat moſt ſeverely: and now being redeemed came unexpectedly out of the Frying Pan into the Fire.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt day of <hi>January</hi> 1671, on which day we uſually in our own Countrey wiſh one another Happineſs: we were aware of a mighty and moſt dreadfull Earth-quake, which had in a moment laid ſome hundreds of Houſes in Rubbiſh; moſt terrible was it to ſee ſo many Souls ſwallowed up in the Earth alive and as lamentable to ſee ſome cruſh'd to pieces and others half dead, ſome ſo faſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up between Walls that they could not be got out. And others wanting their Legs; Arms and other Members, nor was there any but ſuſtained ſome loſs one way or other. When it ceaſed every one hoped that all was done, but the next day at night the Earth

On the morning very early the Biſhop came out with great Pomp and ſung Maſs, after which an Oration was made ſuiting the Day, being Epiphany, which he performed with great Zeal and Pains. After that was a Feaſt which they call <hi>Chalſe Schuran,</hi> or <hi>Dipping of the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Ceremonies were performed as follows: On each ſide the River were placed the <hi>Chans</hi> Guards, and all the Soldiery, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Tumult or abuſe of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who pay dear enough for the ſame. After the <hi>Chan</hi> had taken his place in a Tent expreſſly provided for that Prince, and the Watch ſet in good order, the Biſhop went to beg permiſſion, before which obtained he dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. So ſoon as the Token was given, ſome of the <hi>Armenians</hi> ran naked into the Water, and cut up the Ice with Bills; the Biſhop all the while continues reading and the Common people ſing. After this they begin to play upon Bels and Cymbals, then the Biſhop ſtepping ſoftly to the River ſide, pours in Oyl and Water. Then he took a litle Silver Croſs, ſet with Diamonds and other precious Stones, which he dipt 3 times in the Water. This done he took a ſtaff [or Croſier] and ſtretched it ſeveral ways over the River, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſeveral Benedictions. Immediately upon this all the People ran together, and ſtrove who ſhould be firſt at the River to drink and waſh their Faces. This was obſervantly don of all ſorts of People, young and old, Men and Women. Laſt of all ſeveral youths uncloathed themſelvs, jumped into the River and ſwam to and again, diving ſeveral times together, as if it had been in the midſt of Summer.

I alwaies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd him,

He thanked me for my advice, and reſolved to do as I had council'd him; and ſoon after departed, as is ſaid. Right ſorry I was when he left us, being ever kind to me and other Slaves, althô I was by duty injoyn'd to wiſh and rejoyce at his Welfare, for his extraordinary Civilities.

Firſt he was beat with ſticks on the ſoles of his Feet which he nevertheleſs manfully ſtood out: when this was done they held his Feet cloſe to the Fire, which made him yell and roar out, that the Hair of my Head ſtood on end; and in as much as he could not any longer endure the Torment, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed what he was not guilty of, as afterwards appeared; althô when he was taken away he denied all: and thus the poor man meerly becauſe he was a <hi>Pole</hi> ſo uſed that he could neither ſtand nor go, nor was allowed a ſufficient care to reſtore him to his former Sanity, nor had any thing by way of ſatisfaction, as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of a wrong.</p>

Prince then makes the Overture, telling him that young Gentleman was one with whom he had intruſted his Life, and aſked if he would give him his Daughter in Marriage. The Merchant was at firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, hardly ready enough to give conſent that a ſtranger he had never heard of in his Life ſhould have his only Daughter; and yet durſt not well deny him, for thoſe Princes rule with an Arbitrary Power; and althô out of ſome ſhow of Courteſy they ſeem to requeſt a thing of their Subjects, yet when occaſion ſervs they command at their diſcretion: nor dare the Subject either murmure or oppoſe them in the leaſt, for fear of parting with their ſweet Lives, and loſs of Eſtate which is taken from their Poſterity. The Father gives conſent but thought her too young for the nuptial Bed, ſhe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 12 years of Age, and therefore pray'd the Marriage might be put off till ſhe was 2 years elder; however the Contract was ſigned in preſence of the Prince, with Condition that ſhe came to die without Iſſue that her Eſtate ſhould devolve upon him. In fine he was there in very great reputation and gave the Merchant reaſon to be well ſatisfied with his Perſon; who ſhow'd him all Poſſible Favour and Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>On the 26 <hi>dito</hi> our Patron, the Ambaſſadour, got intelligence of the Party that had ſtole his Plate, being diſcovered by a Goldſmith that had bought it; for Notice was given to all the Goldſmiths in <hi>Scamachy,</hi> that if any one bought it, he ſhould have his Money again, and a Reward to boot.

                  <note place="margin">A Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant looſes his Daughter to find her.</note>When this Muſter was certified and publiſhed, which is but a ſhort warning, I knew a very rich Merchant whoſe greateſt ſolace and imaginary happineſs was in one onely Daughter, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready marriageable, and courted by a young Gentleman of no ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fortune; but the Father whether he thought her a Match, in regard of her Dowry, Beauty, Wit and other Accompliſhments, fitter for a greater Perſonage, or that the youth had ſom Property which he the ſaid Merchant took diſlike at, I cannot determine; yet certainly he courted her long before he could gain the will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the old Man, which till theſe Summons came he quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of. But no ſooner did the old Gentleman hear of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date but he ſent for the Youth, and not only gave him his Daughter for his Bride but made him in Poſt-haſt to bed with her, that ſo he might juramentally declare ſhe was no Virgin. The Youngman did not deſire many Moneths to deliberate the buſineſs, but ſuddenly accepted of his Offer, and ſo anticipated the King. Yet this did not altogether excuſe them, for it was not ſo univerſally known but that ſom Pick-thank Neighbour thinking that the Gentleman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his Daughter to eſcape the Cenſure, went and informed the Commiſſioners, that ſuch a Virgin was not brought to the Teſt, being a great Beauty and well bodied. The Commiſſioners imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſend out a Privat Summons to the Old Gentleman to bring his Daughter into the <hi>Chans</hi> Antichambre where they held the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez-vous; the Old Gentleman makes his Appearance with his Son in Law and Daughter, together with ſom Perſons of Quality to make uſe of in caſe Evidence were required where being come, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents his Daughter, and pray'd them to take his Son too, for he was the Perſon that had her Maiden-head, which was the only thing the King deſired; In fine he declared the matter ſo circumſtantially that ſhe was diſmiſsd.</p>
               <p>When the laſt Muſter is made, thoſe that are elected are ſet in Boxes, made not much unlike a Sedan, and carried on Camels, every Camel carrying two, which hang on each ſide like Higlers Baſkets: and the Morning appointed for their Departure they ſound a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, upon which all the Caravan comes together in order to their

               <p>All this while I ſaw little hopes of ever enjoying my Freedom, ſo that I began to deſpair of Redemption. After I had conſulted all means, I concluded it my beſt way to diſpatch Letters to ſom of my own Nation, and accordingly ſent one to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and another to the Sieur <hi>Molives</hi> at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to ſend them forward for <hi>Holland,</hi> with one acquainting them that I was in Slavery at <hi>Scamachy,</hi> and could not ſend any Letter with ſafety and conveniency thrô <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> which was the reaſon of my being ſo importunate, as to direct them that way.</p>
               <p>On the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we had very tempeſtuous Weather, high and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Winds, mixed with Thunder and Lightning, ſo that all ſhaked again. On this day went all the Woman to the Sepulchers of their deceaſed Friends, to perform the cuſtomary Rites.</p>
               <p>The next day was a great Feſtival, or Holy day among them, which was ſolemnized with Beating of Kettle-drums, ſound of Trumpets, and Playing on all ſorts of loud Wind-Muſic.</p>
               <p>On the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> was one of <hi>Radzins</hi> chief Officers brought into <hi>Scama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> being with 3 more of the <hi>Coſac</hi> Commanders ſent upon an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage to <hi>Boulat</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Circas-Tartars,</hi> to deſire his Aſſiſtance of ſom Auxiliaries, promiſing not only to ſpare his Subjects, but alſo to give him a conſiderable Reward. The Prince having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſum of their Inſtructions, cauſed immediatly Three of thoſe to be beheaded, and their Bodies to be thrown to the Eagles and Ravens. The Heads he cauſed to be embalmed and put in a Bag, which he compelled the Fourth to carry to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> and preſent the King. His one Hand and his Neck was nailed to a Wooden Collar made like a [Y] with 2 Branches, between which his Head was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, ſo that he continually looked upwards. This <hi>Coſac,</hi> or rathér Renegado, for he was a <hi>Ruſs</hi> born, I knew very well at <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan.</hi> He was mounted on a bay Horſe, and attired in a Garment of yellow Silk, and notwithſtanding the unexpected ſevere Uſage he met with did not ſeem by his Countenance to be at all concerned.<note place="margin">The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> gets his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

               <p>I have already made mention, how that about 2 years before, <hi>Radzin</hi> had diſpatched 7 Ambaſſadors to the Court at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> deſiring a Supply of Men and Ammunition, as alſo to enter into a League with the King: but by reaſon the <hi>Coſacs</hi> had plundered <hi>Aſtrabath, Ferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> and <hi>Lenkeran,</hi> and committed many inſolent Outrages within his Majeſties Territories, and that <hi>Radzin</hi> was not by any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as a Soveraign Prince, his Ambaſſadors found a very unkind Reception at Court, and meeting with ſome menacing Sentences in their Inſtructions, the King cauſed their Heads to be ſevered from their Bodies, reſerving only one to bring back the Tidings, who was upon his delivery of the Meſſage ordered by <hi>Radzin</hi> himſelf to be chop'd into Gobbets, as may be read more at large in <hi>Pag.</hi> 192, 193.

Bridegroom in a gay and jolly humour was ſuddenly ſtruck at the Heart, as if he had taken in ſomthing that was a vigorous and ſpeedy poyſon, and immediately fell down and died in the arms of his Bride. Immediatly upon this all was in a lamentable caſe: The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms Mother was ſo impatient and concern'd that ſhe took a Knife and ript up her own Belly, that all her Bowels guſhed out, and ſhe fell to the Ground. The Siſter ſeeing this, ran out of Doors as one diſtracted, tearing her Hair and rending her Fleſh, that many wondred to think how a young Woman of that tenderneſs could ſo mangle and abuſe her Body, and at laſt ran up to the top of a ſteep Rock, whence ſhe threw her ſelf praecipitantly: ſo that this fair Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had a foul Evening, and theſe Nuptial Solemnities which began with a Comedy, concluded with a deep Tragoedy.</p>
               <p>On the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> was a ſolemn Proceſſion made at <hi>Scamachy</hi> which is yearly celebrated in Memory of St. <hi>Hoſſeyn</hi> the ſecond Son of <hi>Aly,</hi> and the Grand Expounder of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> who was ſtoned to death, or, as ſom aſcertain ſhot with Darts or Arrows. This Feaſt they call <hi>Aſſchur,</hi> which in their Language ſignifies <hi>Ten,</hi> for that <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyn</hi> when he went from <hi>Medina</hi> to <hi>Kufu</hi> was 10 days purſued by his Enemies, ſo that this Feaſt continues 10 days. This <hi>Hoſſeyn</hi> as I ſaid before was the youngeſt Son of the great <hi>Aly,</hi> for whoſe death they ſeem very ſorrowfull. About the Beginning of this Feaſt thoſe that are able apparel themſelvs in Blew, which is their Mourning, as Black is with us. During theſe 10 days they never ſhave their Hair, nor take any Raſour in their Hands, whereas at other times they make uſe of it every day. They hold alſo a very ſtrict Faſt drinking nothing but Water, and all the time howl and make a very mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noiſe, breathing out many fearfull curſes againſt the Murtherer, beating themſelvs continually and with that earneſtneſs till they grow black and blew. The Boys and Men run continually about the ſtreets with Flags and Daſſels, raging and bawling as if they were either drunk, or beſides themſelvs, ever crying out <hi>O Hoſſeyn, Hoſſeyn!</hi> Others ſit at the Threſholds and in the Galleries of the <hi>Meſquits,</hi> or Churches, inceſſantly crying, <hi>O Hoſſeyn, Hoſſeyn! O Hoſſeyn, Hoſſeyn!</hi> Before every door, and at every Window were planted many Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and not a Houſe how poor ſoever it was in all <hi>Scamachy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great Number of Torches and wax candles ſet all in Rows,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33105:167"/>
which gave a wonderfull ſhow. No leſs worthy of ſight was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which was performed with many Ceremonies; and ſuch was my curioſitie that notwithſtanding all the Thumps I got, I ſtill crowded in among them to ſee all I could. Firſt of all appeared the <hi>Chatib,</hi> or High-prieſt, accompanied with a long rout of Inferior Clergy; The <hi>Chatib,</hi> or <hi>Mufti,</hi> himſelf was attired in a long blew Robe, with a white Torſe, or Wreath about his Head, and ſo were all the reſt of the Clergy attired after the ſame manner, yet diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Pomp and ſtatelyneſs according to their ſeveral degrees and advancement. The <hi>Chatib</hi> had in his hand an <hi>Arabian</hi> Book, out of which he read the Memorials of the Saint with an exceeding loud voice; which ended he was ſilent for a little while, and then again began all the Prieſts to ſing with a ſtrange melody or rather howling, for it was but a confuſed Harmony, ever crying out <hi>O Hoſſeyn! O Hoſſeyn! Hoſſeyn!</hi> In ſhort a third part of what I heard was <hi>Hoſseyn.</hi> After theſe followed all the Great Perſonages; and next to them 2 Great Pageants of form, ſquare, each with a pompous Canopy, theſe were ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and born by a certain number of Men, on the one was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Prophet being ſignified by a Perſon who had taken in a Potion which made him to ſleep for 48 hours together, lying upon a Bier. Round about the [ſuppoſed] Corps ſate 6 little Boys, who had the Art of weeping <hi>ad unguem.</hi> Above the Canopy ſtood two Towers very pompous and coſtly, and out of the one a Youth put forth his Head weeping aloud and dolefully cried out <hi>Hoſseyn, Hoſseyn! O Hoſseyn, Hoſſeyn!</hi> On each ſide the Pageant ran ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral young Men all naked, ſave only about the Middle, having anointed themſelvs with Flower and black <hi>Naphtha,</hi> that they looked more like Satyrs than Men: in their Hands they had Truncheons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they threatned (<hi>quaſi verò</hi>) to baſtonado the Murtherer: Others there were who carried in each hand a Flint or ſom hard ſtone, which they ſmote together, ſtill howling and weeping aloud, that had it not appeared otherwiſe by their wanton Actions when any She-ſlave came near them I ſhould have taken all for real and unfeigned ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. All this while they jumped and twiſted themſelvs into many poſtures; the Air ſtill Ecchoing with <hi>Hoſſeyn, Hoſſeyn.</hi> Beſides theſe were 6 luſty Men of robuſt Bodies having each a naked Scymiter in the hand, and bare-headed: theſe danced after a very od manner
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33105:167"/>
making various Figures, and always at turning made an effectual Exerciſe of their Weapons, in ſuch manner that the Blood which came guſhing out of the Wounds on their Heads ran down their Shoulders with ſuch ſtreams, that no part of their Bodies was free of Blood; and to thoſe Champions was imputed a great meſure of Sanctity, for that they had voluntarily ſhed their Blood for the ſake of the great <hi>Hoſſeyn.</hi> In one of their Heads (as I afterwards could deſcry) were more than 20 Wounds.</p>
               <p>After this follow'd the ſecond Pageant which was carried by the like number of Men. Above it had a Coffin, upon which was a green Turbant, and round about it were alſo 6 young Men, each one with an <hi>Alchoran</hi> in his Hand, wherein they continually read. After this Pageant there followed another ſmall one, on which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Veſſell, not much unlike a Bathing-Tub, full of Blood, wherein ſat two Children, nothing appearing ſave only their Heads [per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to repreſent the 2 Sons of that reputed Martyr] This was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a ſtrange noiſe of vocal Muſic, but to me ſeemingly void of Rule and Judgement. Laſt of all came another ſmall Pageant, with a fair blew Silk Covering, and thereon ſate a Youngman who read all the way in a great Book. After theſe Pageants, or Brancards, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed 4 Noble-men, each leading a horſe of State, richly cappari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd: The Saddles being of Gold, and beſet with Precious Stones. On the far-ſide had each Horſe a <hi>Damaskin</hi> Scymiter, and on the near-ſide a Shield. On each Saddle was a Turbant, adorned with variety of Gems and unſpeakably rich. This Solemnity was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a grand Retinu of Citizens, who ſeemingly ſurpaſſed all the reſt in Devotion. When the Pageants were come before the Door of the Deputy they ſtood ſtill: and the Deputy accompanied with all the Nobles about the Court, rode out to hear the <hi>Chatyb</hi> [or Sermon] that the Prieſt before mentioned, according to the cuſtom, was to preach, which he did with ſuch Zeal, as that the <hi>Chan</hi> [or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty] with all that heard him could not refrain from weeping. Moſt of the Sermon was a collaudatory Rehearſal of the Sanctity and Noble Acts of <hi>Hoſſeyn,</hi> together with a Hiſtorical recitation of his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. When the <hi>Chatyb</hi> was concluded there came an Image of Straw mounted upon an Aſs, armed with Bow and Arrows: this Figure was to repreſent the Murtherer, who as he rode thrô the Preas, every
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33105:168"/>
one contemptuouſly ſpit upon him, and curſed him with the moſt bitter Curſings of Hell, Miſery, and what elſe they could imagin, for the violent Hands he had laid upon ſo holy a man.</p>

The <hi>Chan</hi> himſelf followed the Bier, and next to him his Son, being about 15 years of Age: after thoſe the Noble Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages and Courtiers, according to their rank and degree. When they were come to the Sepulchre, the Body was ſet down before the Door of the Chappel, or Oratory, where the Nobility diſtributed Alms to the Poor, beſtowing alſo very liberally certain pieces of Gold upon the Prieſts thereby injoyning them to pour out their Prayers for the Soul of the Departed, and to have him in perpetual Remembrance. This don the Body was carried inward, and laid in a new Grave, upon which was a fair Tomb or Monument of white Marble, with admirable curious Foliage, and other Ornaments of Sculpture. The Prieſts received the Body to interr it with many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Bowing. When all was cloſed the <hi>Chan</hi> drew near to kiſs the Tomb, as alſo his Son, and the reſt of the Nobility, and ſo after their former rank and order returned back to the Palace.</p>

               <p>On the 20 was a great Wreſtling Match, of 6 expert Wreſtlers being ſtrangers, who quitted themſelvs in the Game with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Dexterity, doing many noble Exerciſes in preſence of ſeveral Hundred Spectators, who could not behold them but with great Wonder.

               <p>On the 22 a Youngman (according to Sentence paſſed upon him) was beat to death with Sticks, being to paſs thrô the Town and at the Corner of every Street to receiv a certain number of Blows, till at laſt he dropped down dead. This was mainly occaſioned upon the requeſt of his unnatural and mercileſs Father, who was an eminent Gentleman, and Inhabitant of <hi>Scamachy.</hi> The Crime for which he was accuſed was a kind of Satyr, or a Paſquil, which he had written and ſent to the Governour: the main purport whereof was in theſe Words. <hi>How comes it that your Lordſh, grows ſuch a great Saint all on a ſudden?

This Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he meant, was an Interdiction which the <hi>Chan</hi> or Governour, had iſſued 3 days after the Proceſſion, That none ſhould hew and cut (as was their Cuſtom) with Swords in the Streets, like as we have ſpoke more amply in the Feaſt of <hi>Aly.</hi> The Father, ſom ſaid, durſt not but make complaint, leſt it ſhould have been imputed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Miſpriſion, it being well known by others that it was his Son who ſent the Libel.

But others who were indifferent looked upon it as an Example of Unmercifulneſs and Ambition, where he only did it for Hopes of Favour from the <hi>Chan,</hi> which be eſteemed a Purchaſe aequivalent to his ſons Life.

               <p>On the 6 of <hi>June</hi> I went with a <hi>Venetian</hi> (who had bin a Slave in <hi>Turky</hi> and run away) about 15 Miles w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thin Land, where we found an <hi>Armenian</hi> Friary. The Monaſtics received and treated us very kindly, when they underſtood that we were Chriſtians, and in Slavery to the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> They intreated us to tell them all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages we had met with abroad, which the <hi>Venetian</hi> firſt did, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſiring me to do the like, I related all in brief, which they took great delight to hear, eſpecially about the taking in of <hi>Aſtrachan.</hi> They deſired us further to tarry with them for ſom time, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do, and accordingly ſtay'd there two nights. All the time they careſſed us with all kindneſs imaginable, neither ſparing for Victuals nor good Drink: profeſſing themſelvs ſorry that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would not allow them the happineſs of a longer enjoyment of our Company. Their manner of Life was very ſingle, without any Incumbrance of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> their Hous-holding regular and gentile, and the Men among themſelvs mutually loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſociable with ſtrangers, very charitable to all that were in neceſſity, of what Opinion or Faith ſoever they were. Right loath we were to leav them, but not daring to ſtay any longer, we took our leavs of them, thanking them for their kindneſs and civility they had ſhown us. In taking our way to <hi>Scamachy,</hi> we were fain to climb over ſome Hills, and one great Mountain flat at Top, upon which was a Lake, according to our gueſſing, 3 miles in Circuit. Going along the ſhore to our great amazement we found four Bodies of Men that had but newly been murthered, having their throats cut, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to be Anglers, ſeeing Fiſhing Canes and other Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about them. However, we thinking it for two reaſons unſafe for us to ſtay there any longer, made all the haſt we could to get out
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33105:170"/>
of the way. This Lake as we afterwards underſtood was very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull of many kinds of delicate Fiſh, which are ſold very dear and highly eſteemed of abroad throughout all that part of the Countrey, and indeed it was once our thoughts to make a Trial if we could take any thing, till meeting with theſe new murthered Perſons, we chuſed rather to let the Fiſh remain in their Element, than by the probable conſequence to pay too great a price for our ſport.</p>
               <p>On the 9 happened a very Tragical paſſage at <hi>Scamachy,</hi> which, notwithſtanding the horrible ſpectacle I had ſeen the Day before, made my Heart beat withrn my Breaſt, as it did many times after that, when it came into my mind. A <hi>Poliſh</hi> Woman and a Slave was taken by a <hi>Perſian</hi> for his Wife. Whether ſhe had ſom private Quarrel with him, or that ſhe was conſcious of ſom misbehaviour to him I cannot determine, however ſhe came to my Patron the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, firſt making a large Demonſtration of her State, and of her Friends and Family in <hi>Poland,</hi> ſhe requeſted that my Lord would vouchſafe her his Protection, till ſuch time as ſhe could meet with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to convey her ſelf clandeſtinly home into her own Countrey. My Lord, at the earneſt intreaty of ſom Domeſtics who were his Minions, aſſented: but after ſhe had ſo privily held her ſelf about the ſpace of 14 days, her Husband got Intelligence by ſom Pick-thank or other, where ſhe was, applies himſelf immediatly to Court, where (after a litle ſoliciting) he gets an Order to fetch her out, and uſe her as ſeemed good to him. But conſidering that the Domeſtics of my Lord were too numerous and a little unruly, he durſt not attempt to make the demand, but went back again to Court deſiring Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon which the Prince ſent ſom of his Officers, who when our People ſaw that they were com in a warrantable way, durſt not oppoſe them, nor had they any conveniency to put her out of the way, ſo that ſhe was forthwith delivered into the hand of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The Man having as was ſaid permiſſion to puniſh her at his own Diſcretion had already provided a Wooden Croſs, upon which, with the help of his Servants, he bound her faſt, being mother naked, and with his own hands flea'd her whilſt yet living. I ſtood my ſelf all the while at the Door with a great Company of Men, Women and Children, and heard her cry out moſt bitterly. Yet none thought that his cruelty was of ſo high a nature till we ſaw the

Thoſe who go with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Heads, are ſuch as we commonly call Gameſters, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute. So ſoon as any one comes in a doors, the Woman runs into a Chamber and locks her ſelf up that ſhe may not be ſeen, althô the Slaves have often the Opportunity to violate their Maſters Couch notwithſtanding all the Indeavours they uſe to ſuppreſs them.<note place="margin">Eunuchs.</note> But the King and the Great ones of the Realm prevent that by gelding their Slaves; which they doe very effectually, but Modeſty forbids me to make further mention of the Manner. They do it commonly when they are young, buying Children that are ſtollen from their Parents, and are therefore in regard of their bringing up, held in greater value than others, as alſo becauſe that there is hardly one in three that both live and like. The price which is ſet upon them is one reaſon why ordinary Perſons have them not, and another is becauſe that if they thrive they grow very fat and lazy, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unfit to do any ſervice they have occaſion for. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Women-Slaves are ſomewhat rare among them, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Citizens Wives are moſtly attended by Men, who if they have a ſprightly and airy way and Carriage, are ſomtimes admitted to enjoy thoſe illicit Pleaſures, which in proceſs of time they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the loſs of their Lives.</p>

               <p>The next day being the 27 I preſented <hi>Hadzi Biram</hi> my former Patron with the Model of a Ship and a Galley which coſt me about 3 Moneths Labour. On the Ship were 40 Guns, and 10 on the Galley, with 42 Oars, both being complete, as to Maſts, Sails Rigging, Anchors, &amp;c. <hi>Hadzi</hi> accepted of it kindly, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with preſented it to the Prince as a great Rarity. The Prince was greatly taken with it, and asked <hi>Hadzi Biram,</hi> whether I was at <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machi,</hi> which underſtanding deſired to ſee me; upon which my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron ſent a Slave to fetch me. I had hopes that this might work out my Redemption and bring me into Favour, went without much delay to give Attendance, where being admitted and come within preſence I bowed after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, with my Hand upon my Breaſt. The Prince, ſeeing me ſtand at a diſtance, bad me com near, which I did. Then he fell to asking me ſom Queſtions as to my Countrey, and the Occaſion of my coming thither, which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.

and 300 Sail of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> encountered each other, continually firing their Guns, and then proceeded to Boarding, Sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Burning, or Blowing up. He then asked me, why thoſe two Nations profeſſing one Faith and Religion made War upon each other. I anſwered him, that it was for no other reaſon than the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> made War againſt each other, and thoſe two mighty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates the <hi>Schach</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperour, profeſſing one and the ſame Faith in ſubſtance. The Prince turning about to <hi>Hadzi Biram,</hi> told him that what I ſaid was juſtly true. Upon this came in ſom Great Perſonage, and giving me the Beck, a Token that I muſt withdraw, I went away as much a Slave as I came in.</p>

Fabritius,</hi> of whom I got ſo much Money as I thought would ſerv my Turn. With this Money I bought a good <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe; but coming to preſent it, he had no liking to it, ſo that I was fain to buy another, which I thought might pleaſe him better; yet this he fancied no better than the former, ſo that I was fain to look out for another. The <hi>Perſian</hi> [Jockey] ſhow'd me another, and a ſtately <hi>Arabian</hi> Gelding,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Freedom.</note> for which I was fain to give a greater Sum.

This ſatisfied my Patron very well and upon my delivering it, told me I might go when I ſaw conveniency.</p>
               <p>On the 29<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> I went about to take my leav of all my Friends and Benefactors. The many great Favours that were ſhown me from <hi>Hadzi Biram</hi> my former Patron, and the great Civility of his Lady obliged me above the reſt to perform that piece of Duty and manifeſt my thankfulneſs to them for their Bounty. When I came there I found my Patroneſs <hi>Altina</hi> at home, the reſt being all gone to bath as they do every day. My Patron himſelf was alſo abroad about his Affairs. My Patroneſs upon my coming in bad me wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com, having underſtood the reaſon of the Viſit: and ſeeing me ſtand at a diſtance, bad me ſit down, ſaying, her Husband would com home at Noon. Entring into ſom earneſt diſcourſe, ſhe asked me what my Maſter, the Ambaſſ. had given me for the ſervice I had don him, <hi>Nothing at all, Madam,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>but my liberty to famiſh, which I muſt certainly have don, if I had not been ſupplyed by your bountiful Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to whom I have made bold to have recourſe, ſo often that I was aſhamed. Well,</hi> replies the good Gentlewoman, <hi>has he given you nothing, as a Corrolary for your Faithfullneſs? I ſhall do it my ſelf, upon condition you tell it to no perſon whatſoever</hi>; and with that fetched me a coſtly Jewel, and ſeveral pieces of Money, which far outvalued the Price I was ſold for. After a little diſcourſe ſhe deſired me to ſtay at <hi>Scama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and ſo renewed what ſhe had propounded to me at <hi>Derbent,</hi> to wit; that we ſhould go together for <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Holland</hi>; but

I weighing the danger of the <hi>Coſacs,</hi> who ſtill moleſted the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, durſt not reſolv thereupon, but deſired her to put that out of her mind. She perceiving me not at all flexible to imbrace her Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, grew on a ſudden very Heartleſs and dejected, and with a deep ſigh ſaid, <hi>Well, I find my ſelf in deſpair of ever coming into Chriſtendom, yet the Will of GOD be don: and ſeeing you are reſolved to go for</hi> Iſpahan <hi>you would do well to take your Journey with my Husband, who intends if the ſeaſon prove good to ſet forward to morrow, very early.</hi> Incredible was my Joy to hear the news, that my Patron was to take the Journey ſo ſuddenly, who had an entire and unfeigned Love for me, as I have already ſhown. About 2 hours after my coming thither came my Patron him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who underſtanding by my Patroneſs that I was com to take my laſt leav of him, bade me ſit down, and after a friendly welcom told me if I would go along with him to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> he would bear my Charges. I accepted of his kind Offer, with all telling him, how that I was aſhamed of the freedom I had aſſumed to my ſelf in being a continual burthen and Charge to him: but ſince it was an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his to heap yet greater favours upon me, I pray'd him to admitt 2 more of my Countreymen into our Company, to wit, <hi>L. Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Brandt,</hi> who were redeemed by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon the Interceſſion of Monſr. <hi>Termund,</hi> they bearing their own Charges: He made anſwer, John, <hi>for your ſake it ſhall be don althô there were Twenty of'em.</hi> When all was in a readineſs I went to give my Patroneſs the laſt Adieu, and obſerved that Tears ſtood in her Eies. <hi>William B.

               <p>ON the 30 <hi>dito,</hi> by Gods good Conduct we ſet forward, with the whole <hi>Caravan,</hi> which conſiſted of 2000 Men, or upwards, and about 1000 Camels and Horſes of Carriage. My Maſter alſo had 20 Horſes of his own in particular loaden with Cheſtnuts, for a Preſent to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> for one having any Matter, or Affair at Court never appears before either the <hi>Scach,</hi> or any ſubordinat Prince, empty handed. Our way was over very high and ſteep hills: amongſt which we found the Sepulchre of a great <hi>Perſian</hi> Saint called <hi>Pyr Mardechan,</hi> being at the foot of the Mountains of <hi>Faherlu.</hi> The Countrey here about lies waſte and deſart, there being neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, nor Proviſion to be had by the way, ſo that we made all the haſt we could to get the <hi>Carawanſera.</hi> This hard travailing was not very unwelcom to us, becauſe that the weather was cold, althô ſom of the Horſes being heavy loaden and tired were left behind. About the Evening we came to <hi>Kaſily</hi> where we took up our nights
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:33105:178"/>
lodging. The Countrey round about <hi>Caſily</hi> is altogether barren and dry, except here and there ſome good paſturage, ſo that the manner of Living with the Inhabitants is like that of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> moving to and again over the face of the Countrey with their Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Utenſils, Cattel, and what elſe they have, and when they ſet down pitch their Tents all in Rows, which they call <hi>Oſtak.</hi> During our travailing thrô this Countrey we could get litle elſe but Milk to refreſh our ſelves: however my Patron out of his Bounty would not ſuffer me to want for any thing, but imparted to me what he had as well Victuals to eat, as Wine to drink, which ſerved me for a good Breaſt-plate againſt the Cold.</p>
               <p>Having ſtaid one night at <hi>Kaſily,</hi> we ſet forward and about 8 a clock the next evening came to a fair Village called <hi>Tzawaar,</hi> or <hi>Tzawat,</hi> as ſome call it, which is ſo much as to ſay, a Thorow-fare; becauſe that here is the Paſſage which brings over the grand River <hi>Araxes,</hi> and here every one is to ſhow his Paſport, out of fear that ſome <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould ſlip over with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> of whom the <hi>Perſian</hi> is alwaies jealous, and are conſtrained to take ſharp notice of every particular Perſon. At this place is a long Bridge made of Keels, and thwarted with maſſy Planks, that are faſtned together with great Bolt and Chains, which for better ſecurity is guarded with a good number of Soldiery. When we were tranſported over the ſaid River, we took our Nights-reſt in the Open-fields.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the River <hi>Araxes.</hi>
                  </note>The River <hi>Araxes</hi> takes its head about the high Mountains between <hi>Schirwan</hi> and <hi>Mokan</hi> behind Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> running North-eaſt till it finds the River <hi>Kur,</hi> or <hi>Cyrus,</hi> where it diſgorgeth it ſelf, about 39 <hi>degr.</hi> 54 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly latitude, where theſe two Rivers are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated. <hi>Kur,</hi> as it is vulgarly called, riſes in the Mountains of <hi>Georgia</hi> or <hi>Gurgiſtan.

               <p>On the 3 of <hi>November</hi> we travailed 5 leagues over the Heath of <hi>Mochan,</hi> and ſaw by the way many Hurdles and Boors Cottages, but durſt not call at any to provide our ſelvs with Refreſhments, being ſenſible of the perils, for hither are all thoſe ſent to Exile whom the <hi>Scach</hi> thinks good to baniſh, and hither reſort all the Mutineers; ſo that theſe like the <hi>Banditti</hi> in the <hi>Alps,</hi> render the way very unſafe and incommodous to travel, ſomtimes ſurprizing and aſſailing the <hi>Caravans,</hi> when they find themſelves of Force enough, or the <hi>Caravan</hi> too weak to withſtand'em.</p>
               <p>On the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>

                  </note> and in the way found the River <hi>Baltharu,</hi> which for Greatneſs gives place to all the before named; but, for the Multitudes of Tortoiſes that are taken here about, no leſs famous nor inferiour to any other in all the ſurface of the Countrey. All along the Banks we ſaw holes and caves which thoſe Animals had made in the Sand, the ſhoar appearing like a Coney-borrough. Theſe Caves have their mouth or entrance alwaies to the Southward, where they lay their Eggs. On the Countrey through which this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſoftly glides we ſaw ſeveral Cottages or Tents, as we did the day before, but found the Inhabitants harmleſs and very poor, yet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and jocund, the Children were ſtark naked, and the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had hardly cloaths enough to cover their middle. They received us in very friendly manner according to their ability, bringing us Milk for our ſelvs, and Provender for the Camels and Horſes, which they ſold at a very mean and inconſiderable Price, conſidering under what neceſſity we were then. This day we travailed 6 [<hi>Dutch</hi>] Leagues.</p>
               <p>On the 5 we travailed about as far as we did the day before, but were fain to take up our Lodging under the great Canopy of Heaven, ſetting down with the whole <hi>Caravan,</hi> near ſom Water-pitts, where we found good paſturage for the Beaſts, conſidering the ſeaſon of the year.</p>
               <p>The next day we found an end of the Heath <hi>Mokan,</hi> and had High-land to travail over, as the Mountains of <hi>Bethzyrvan,</hi> or <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyrum.</hi> This day we croſſed a ſmall River (if I well remember) 12 times, having a crooked or ſerpentine Courſe, which the Merchants
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:33105:179"/>
of <hi>Scamachy</hi> for their Conveniency, had promiſed a conſiderable Sum of Money to ſom Ingenieurs to to make ſtreight, yet by reaſon of many intervening Hills, and thoſe moſtly of a hard rock could not be effected. At night we got the Village <hi>Schechmurat,</hi> where my Patron ſent me out to fetch ſom Spring-Water: but being about half an [<hi>Engliſh</hi>] mile without the Town was aſſail'd by 3 Robbers, who ſuddenly came running out upon me, having their Eies fixed my Armor; ſo that in all probability, that which I had for my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence would have been my Death, if ſom belonging to the <hi>Caravan</hi> and ſent upon the ſame Errand, had not com in time to aſſiſt me; for I was almoſt out of breath with defending my ſelf, having my Back againſt the Ruins of an old Wall, which ſeemed to be the Relicts of ſom Watch-Tower. One of the 3 I had wounded very ſore on the Arm, but the other two breaking in proved too ſtrong for me: yet when they ſay the reſt com in and cloſe up with them, thought it better to make uſe of their Heels than their Hands.</p>
               <p>On the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we travailed over very hilly and montanous Ground, encamping that night in a Valley, which was waſt, and deſtitute of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>On the 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we came to a very fair and commodious <hi>Caerawanſera,</hi> built at the Charges of the <hi>Indian</hi> Traders, for the conveniency of their <hi>Caraevans:</hi> Here we intended to remain over night, but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take our Reſt, were alarm'd upon a ſudden aſſault of a great Troop of Robbers, who fell upon the <hi>Caravan</hi> on every ſide, and plundered all they came at, that was of any value and portable; and althô we had timely notice to defend our ſelvs, yet they had got a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Booty, and made their eſcape without the loſs of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or the leſt damage. We therefore fearing that the incouragement and ſucceſs they had met with might embolden them to make up a ſtronger Troop, and conſequently our tarrying there might be very unſafe, it was unanimouſly concluded that we ſhould break up, and being fair Weather, purſue our Journey by travailing the night, as we did, and about 12 a clock came to <hi>Tzanle,</hi> which is a beautiful Town, but not fortified, where it was thought fit that we ſhould ſtay till the next morning: <hi>Tzanle</hi> is a Paradiſe in regard of it's pleaſant Situation; round about which is nothing to be ſeen, but Orchards, Gardens and Houſes of Recreation. Here we ſupplied our ſelvs
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:33105:179"/>
with all neceſſarys &amp; refreſhments, which we had for a very mean price.</p>

This Bridge we paſſed over, and towards night came to <hi>Trabedar</hi> a Village ſeated in a pleaſant Landſhip, where we took up our Nights-lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but not our Nights-reſt, for we were horribly tormented with Fleas and Lice, that being (as in <hi>Scotland</hi>) the Countrey-Plague,<note place="margin">Lice and Fleas.</note> which I preſume comes from the Heat of the Cows-dung, that the Inhabitants dry and ſtow up in their Houſes, to uſe for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</p>

But the next morning finding him in a pleaſant humor I renewed my requeſt and he aſſented, thô conditionally, as, Firſt, to keep ſilence all the time, ſince I was not perfect in the Dialect, and ſo might com to be diſcovered; Secondly, not to ſtare any Perſon fully in the Face; and Thirdly, to act for Changeling in caſe any Body came to queſtion me, Fools and Madmen being with them reputed Holies, for they are of Opinion that all men have an equal underſtanding, and that thoſe, who are either Mad or Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh imploy the reſt of their Senſes in a Divine and Celeſtial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, or Converſe with Angels.</p>

It was raized high, ſo that we muſt aſcend 10 ſteps before we enter. Being com to the Threſhold my Patron made there certain Prayers, that don he gave the Sign that he would be in, upon which one of the <hi>Hafiſans,</hi> or Waiters came out, who demanded of him his Sable and Boots, and of me my Truncheon, which he ſhut up in a litle Chamber: my Patron then having given him a piece of money in the Hand, and ſo we both went in bare-foot. The Floor was all laid with Tapeſtry, the Roof and Walls were painted Blew, illuſtrated

here and there with Flowers of Gold, which made it look with a great ſplendor; the Glaſs in the Windows was of divers colours like as in old Chriſtian Churches, and I preſume don by the ſame Art, which ſom will needs ſay is loſt.

Here ſit ſeveral Doctors, who are to inſtruct Youth in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> as alſo to read and to ſing, that ſo they may be fit to ſerve in that holy Function, and adminiſter at the ſacred Tomb. Here and there were ſeveral Chairs whereon lay ſom pieces of the <hi>Alchoran.</hi> In the Middle of all ſtood the ſaid Tomb, being about a Mans height raiſed above ground, 6 Foot long, and proportionably broad. It was of pure Gold and laid in with Flowers and Foliage of Silver, which was very artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially don. Above the Tomb under a Canopy of Blew Silk hung 4 Lamps, 2 of Gold, and 2 of Silver, which every night are lighted by certain Attendants which they call <hi>Tzirachtſchikan.</hi> When my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron approached to the Grave the Waiters took off the Covering, which was of green Velvet, upon which after he had mumpled over certain Prayers bowed himſelf, puſhed with his head againſt the Tomb, kiſſed it, and ſo ſtepping backwards, was met at the door by one of the <hi>Hafiſans</hi> who gave him the Benediction, and ſo diſmiſſed him. When he was com to the <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> concluded this Devotion with a ſumptuous and an Epicurean Banquet, with Drinking, Dancing and Whoring, ſo that it may eaſily be perceived that the extreme and furtheſt Hope they have, who are the greateſt Zelots in <hi>Turciſm</hi> is only for libidinous Enjoyments, and to obtain their fill of voluptuous Pleſures and ſenſual Delights in the World to com, as by an implicit Faith they are induced to beleeve.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ardebil</hi> are many excellent Hot-baths, which bring in no ſmall profit to the Owners; my Maſter alſo made frequent uſe of the ſame, as well out of a ſuperſtitious Zeal, as for conſervation of Health. But about 3 [<hi>Dutch</hi>] miles without <hi>Ardebil</hi> are certain Hot wells, proceeding from a ſulphurous quality of the Earth; Theſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot, and may not be touched; ſo that round about are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Baths and Fountains which are tempered with the hot water being convey'd thither in Pipes and Conduits. Theſe Baths ſo tempered are reputed very good againſt the Itch, Biles, and other external Grievances and Sores, and as ſom have found uſefull againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

               <p>On the 16 my Maſter ſet out to go to theſe Baths and asked me to go with him, bidding me take a Horſe, ſo that I was as well mounted as he himſelf: he took with him 3 Slaves with an Aſs to carry clean Linnen, Meat, and Wine, with other Refreſhments. A little before we came at thoſe Wells, we ſmelled a ſtrong ſmell of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and heard the Water bubble up and boil. We ſaw alſo ſmoke and vapours that roſe in many places from the Water, which made me very faint. The chiefeſt of thoſe Wells is called <hi>Grandauſch,</hi> but this my Maſter thought not fit for him to uſe, but went to another called <hi>Serdebe,</hi> which nevertheleſs is reputed the beſt Water, and was therefore roofed over with a ſtately Arch, at the Charges of the Grand Chancelor <hi>Tzulpharachan.</hi> Among the Slaves that my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron had was an old <hi>Greek,</hi> for whom he had a great kindneſs, and uſed him more like a Brother than a Servant. So ſoon as he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed this <hi>Greek</hi> rubbed his Body with a Towel, till he was all over red, then he ſtepped into the Bath, where for ſome time he ſat to the neck in Water, and then coming out dried himſelf, took a draught of very ſtrong Wine, and away again into the Bath, which having done 2 or 3 times together he clothed himſelf and rode away to a <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> where the Day before he had beſpoke a warm Bed, in which he lay him down and ſtayd over night.

                  </note>On the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> I went with my Patron to ſee the moſt noble Sepulchre of <hi>Schach Sephy.</hi> My ſaid Patron alſo prepared himſelf for this, as he did to viſit the other at <hi>Kelcheran,</hi> by Faſting and Prayer. This famous <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> erected to the memory of <hi>Scach Sephy,</hi> and now the Burying Place of other <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings lies near the <hi>Maydan.</hi> Before this pompous Sepulchre ſtands a fair Gate of rich Marble, in which is ſhown an Admirable Skill in Architecture. Within this Port or Gate hang two Maſſy Silver Chains athwart each other like Feſtons: thoſe they ſay were beſtowed on this Place by the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Meggura,</hi> for a Monument of his Zeal. Having entred this Gate we came into a fair and ſpacious Court all paved with ſquare Stones and poliſhed Porphyr; round about on each ſide were Arches, as Piazzas, under
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:33105:183"/>
which were ſhops of all ſorts of Haberdaſhery Wares and Toys. After this we went thrô another Gate far more beautifull than the former, and within this was a fair Garden, and indeed one of the faireſt I had hitherto ſeen; It was planted with all manner of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Herbs that might delight the Eie and Noſe, and all kinds of delicious Fruits to ſerve the Palat. Every Man has his freedom to walk and recreate himſelf, but upon a very ſtrict penalty not to pluck either Flower or Fruit. I was told how that 5 years before my being there, a drunken <hi>Perſian</hi> had hewn down a great bough with his Scymiter, but being taken was immediatly beheaded with the ſame Weapon. In this Gate hung alſo another great Silver Chain, which was given by the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Kentzay.</hi> Here they demanded our Weapons, which being delivered, my Patron went forward to another Gate, which entring he fell down and kiſſed the Threſhold, withall charging me not to touch it with my Feet, leſt I ſhould pollute that which many thought worthy a long Pilgrimage to com and kiſs: he told me alſo that it was a favour greater than ordinary, that I being a blind ignorant Chriſtian and an Infidel ſhould be admitted to pry into ſo glorious a Sanctuary. I was heartily content to obey his Will, rather than to deny my Curioſity, and followed him cloſe at the Heels, leſt coming into ſom Labrynth I ſhould looſe my Life by the Loſs of my Maſter. The next Place we came into was a ſtately Gallery, or rather an Antichamber, arched croſs wiſe, and neatly plaiſtered. On the right hand as I went in was a great Silver Cock which ran with Water that was conveyed thither by leaden Pipes from a fair Fountain about 4 [<hi>Engliſh</hi>] miles without Town. Right over againſt this is another Apartment paved with green and blew glazed ſtones: and on the Floor was ſpread a very rich Carpet: in the middle ſtood two huge Silver Candleſticks about 8 or 9 Foot high; round about were Seats as in our Chores, wherein ſat ſeveral Prieſts all in white Stoles, who ſung all the time, keeping good Harmony, and at the End of every Verſicle bowed all alike, one to another. This Place is called <hi>Tzichillachane,</hi> the Chappel or Oratory of the King; ſo called by reaſon of the 40 days, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> affirm that <hi>Scach Sephy</hi> ſpent here at one time, in Faſting and Prayer, not uſing any thing all that time, ſave only a Cup of Water once a day. Leaving this place we went into another Gate where a Silver Chain hung,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:33105:184"/>
that was preſented by <hi>Aly Chan.</hi> The Parlour, or Hall into which we now came was all paved and laid in with a ſplecked Stone; The Building its ſelf was round, like a Theatre; the Doors were laid over with Silver Plates and had two great Silver Rings like Wreaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Torſes. At the Entrance lay a coſtly and large Carpet, where we were to pull off our Boots, without which, none is admitted to go in, no not the King himſelf, who ſomtimes to be a Praecedent and Example of Zeal, pulls off his Boots at the firſt Gate, but that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

which was very ſpacious, yet without any Pillar. Here are kept all the Ancient Records of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with abundance of Manuſcripts in the <hi>Chaldean, Perſian, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Syrian</hi> Tongues, the Books were piled up one above another and moſt of them adorned with Gold and Silver; whence I concluded that they were more for ſhow, than for dayly uſe and recourſe. In this ſaid Library were ſeveral leſs Appartments, where were many Porceline Diſhes, Cups and other Utenſils, for the Kitchin and Table, which are uſed when the King or any other great Perſonage comes to Eat there, whereas they ſay it is not conſiſtent with the Humility they profeſs, to be ſerved in Gold or Silver: the more becauſe that the great <hi>Schach Sephy</hi> himſelf did eat altogether out of Wooden Diſhes. From hence we went out and came into the Kitchin, the Doors whereof were covered with Silver Leavs by the aforeſaid <hi>Schach Abas,</hi> and the Room within very neat and handſom. The Cooks were all the time very ſtill and quiet, as if it were ſom Religious Duty they were about, and each one according to his Office had a place allotted him, to wit, thoſe that roaſted and thoſe that boiled, baked, fried, ſtewed, &amp;c. each by themſelvs. The Cauldrons were ſet faſt in the Walls, and the Water they uſed was brought ſom Miles by an Aqueduct, and let in by Silver Cocks. In this Kitchin is provided Victuals for more than a Thouſand People, one day with another, to wit, Prieſts, Pilgrims, and other Poor People which have here their Maintenance. They eat three times a day, at 6 in the Morning, at 10 before, and 3 in the afternoon. The two firſt Meals were given by <hi>Schach Sephy,</hi> and the laſt at the Charges of the preſent King. Before the Meals do begin, they beat 2 Kettle-drums, which they ſay their great Prophet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet made uſe of when he was in the Camp, and were brought from <hi>Medina</hi> by <hi>Schach Sedredin.</hi> They have not much variety in their Diet, and uſe moſtly Rice and Mutton, which is diſtributed very liberally to all the Appendents, who ſeldom com ſhort but leav of their Commons.</p>
               <p>Coming out of this famous Kitchin, we went into a large Court where were interred 12 <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, to wit,

               <p>FOurteen Days we ſtaid in <hi>Ardebil,</hi> during which time I had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee what was worthy of Remark, and Opportunity beſides, being apparreled like a <hi>Perſian</hi> ſo that none diſtruſted me to be a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman,</hi> but allowed me acceſs over all. When theſe 14 days were expired, the <hi>Caravan</hi> made preparation to break up, and purſue the Journey for <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> for which end many freſh Camels and Horſes were taken in. When the <hi>Caravan</hi> was ready, we obſerved that the Company was conſiderably increaſed with new Paſſengers and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
               <p>On the 25 by ſound of Trumpet all was warned to joyn themſelvs with the <hi>Caravan,</hi> that intended for <hi>

                     </gap>ſpahan</hi>; and accordingly left <hi>Ardebil</hi> and came to <hi>Buſun</hi> which lies about 14 Miles from <hi>Ardebil,</hi> where we ſtaid that night.</p>
               <p>The day following we broke up, and had that day a very rocky and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:33105:186"/>
uneaſy Way, inſomuch that moſt, or all, allighted from their Horſes and Camels and went a foot. By the way we met ſeveral Troops of Robbers, who probably had underſtood what a Prey and Purchaſe we had, yet finding the <hi>Caravan</hi> ſo very numerous durſt not aſſail us. At night we came to <hi>Sengoa</hi> a beautifull Village, where we had very good Wine, and made our ſelvs merry, but not to exceſs, for that is in general odious to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Here I ſaw the beſt Beauties and moſt comly Faces that I have ſeen in all <hi>Perſia:</hi> their Women ſeem to have a greater Liberty than in moſt places, where they do not only go covered abroad, but are alſo denied the converſe with Men; for here they go bare with their Face, and are very familiar with thoſe of the Maſculine Gender, and if I be not miſtaken were too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with ſome, who within a few daies after began to ſcratch their Heads, and this is the firſt time I knew that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>French.</hi> In ſum, our Company enjoy'd themſelvs here ſo contentedly and well, that ſom of'em thought the Sun had miſtaken himſelf and was riſen an hour too ſoon.</p>
               <p>The day following leaving <hi>Sengoa,</hi> we had high and rocky way, but towards the Evening came into a moſt ſweet and pleaſant Dale or Plain, through which a River glided very ſwiftly. This Valley was very pleaſant, and notwithſtanding the ſeaſon, appeared as if it were in <hi>May.</hi> This River is called <hi>Kiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>loſeyn,</hi> having a very fair Stone Bridge over it, over which we paſſed and pitched on the South ſide, in the open Field, for there were no Houſes to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>On the 28<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> we broke up and went over the famous <hi>Taurus,</hi> being a very rough and dangerous way, inſomuch that all the Company were fain to allight and lead their Camels and Horſes, till we came into a Valley where we took our Reſt for an Hour, or two. This Valley is very deep and a Neſt of Robbers and Vagabonds, who find many lurking Places to hide themſelvs in, out of which they aſſail and ſurpriſe Travailers, if they think themſelvs ſtrong enough: but we, as was ſaid before, being increaſed to a conſiderable Number knew our ſelvs ſufficiently out of peril. Out of this Valley ariſeth the River <hi>Kiſiloſeyn,</hi> which running very ſwiftly and beating thorow the Rocks makes a very hideous Murmur, ſo that one cannot hear another ſpeak: thus receiving as it were inlargement runs through the Champain Countrey of <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:33105:187"/>
celerity into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Lake, into which it empties it ſelf. On the Banks of this River is a Village bearing the ſame name, where is a fair Stone Bridge of 9 Arches, or Bows. All along the Way ſide grow great plenty of Almond, Cypreſs and other Trees, which ſerved us all the way in ſtead of <hi>Paraſols:</hi> but when we were come over the River found the Way very bad, being forced to clamber over Rocks, the Path being ſo narrow that only one Camel at once could go on it. On each ſide were many great Clefts and deep Caves, which with the rattling of the Horſes feet made a dreadfull and horrid Eccho; and being come to a place which was the fulleſt of thoſe Caverns, all the Company gave a Shout, which with an Eccho reſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from one Place to another, that it ſeemed as if there had been 10 or 12 Troops of Men in ſo many ſeveral Places calling to one another. On this way it happened that a Camel broke the Leathers wherewith his Pack was faſtened to the Crutchet or Saddle, being juſt at the Brink of a wide and deep Pit, where no Bottom could be ſeen. It coſt the Slaves who attended him much labour to ſave him, and were in ſtruggling once in great hazard themſelvs of tumbling down, Camel and all, yet at laſt, with loſs of the Pack which in ſpite of all they could do fell down, they got clear. The Pack was very rich, and the loſs thereof ſo concerning to the Merchant, that if others had not hindred him he had thrown the Slaves after it, for their Negligence. This ill way much detarded us on this Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for we were more than 5 Hours in travailing one Mile. Being got over this bad way we found a Village where it was deſigned that we ſhould take our nights reſt; The name of the Town was <hi>Keyntze,</hi> being very poor and not in a Condition to ſupply us with ſuch Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as we deſired for our Money.</p>
               <p>On the 29 we broke up, and had that day very good way, coming at night to the village <hi>Hortzimur,</hi> where we were very ill at eaſe being cold Weather and the Place not able to ſupply us with Houſe-room.</p>
               <p>The next day leaving <hi>Hortzimur</hi> we travailed thrô a very dry and barren Heath, meeting by the way with ſom Robbers, who being but few in number durſt not make any attempt upon us: However night coming upon us here, we were fain to ſet down on the Heath, and for fear of Robbers forced to watch all night, but were ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed with cold that we many times wiſhed for break of day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:33105:187"/>On the firſt of the next Moneth we came into a litle City called <hi>Senkan,</hi> which is reputed the beſt Refreſhing place between <hi>Derbent</hi> and <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> there being plenty of Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, Melons, divers ſorts of huge Grapes and many other Fruits then out of ſeaſon. Veal and Mutton was here very cheap, as alſo Bread. Thus finding Proviſion here very cheap, we bought what we thought neceſſary. As for the City it ſelf there is not much worthy of Remark about it, ſave onely a very fair and beautifull <hi>Metzid.</hi> It is ſituated in a Plain, and a flat Ground, but near the Town very barren and dry. It has been formerly a great Emporium, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed more than 4 Centuries of years in Traffic and Commerce with the circumjacent Countreys, but ſince it was demoliſhed by the great <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> is ſo run to decay, that it is out of Hopes, ever to arrive to it's priſtin State.</p>
               <p>On the 2 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> we ſet forward and came in good time to <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie,</hi> a City lying in 36 <hi>degr.</hi> and 30 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly Latitude. It is ſituated between two rows of very ſteep Mountains, and toward the Weſt we ſaw the Mountain <hi>Keydar Peyamber,</hi> whoſe lofty top ſeems to ſupport the Heavens, this being, next to <hi>Ararat,</hi> the higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I have ever ſeen. The City <hi>Sultany</hi> affoards a moſt noble Proſpect from abroad, by reaſon of her many lofty Piles, magnificent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, high Towers, Pyramids, Obeliſks and Cylinders which ſtill remain, notwithſtanding the furious Irruption of the ſavage <hi>Tartars</hi> under conduct of the valiant <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who with many other Towns, laid this level with the Ground, ſave the great and ſtupendious Fabrics, even now remembred, which when one is within Town, look like a ſet of Nine-pins, or the Stones on <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain: ſo that this which was reputed one of the Royal Cities is meaner than moſt villages. It was built by <hi>Sultan Choddabende</hi> a very rich and potent Prince, who beſides many famous Conqueſts in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Uſbec,</hi> ſubdued the greateſt part of <hi>Turky,</hi> and many <hi>Indian</hi> Kingdoms and Provinces, ſom of which ſtill remain under the ſubjection of the <hi>Schach</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This City he called <hi>Sultanie</hi> from the <note n="*" place="margin">

Wherefore they alwaies lead a Camel thrô the ſtreets for 3 daies together before this Feaſt, adorning it with Garlands of Leavs and Flowers, if there be any to be had, and on the Feſtival ſlay it, with many Ceremonies. Firſt comes the <hi>Mulla,</hi> who is one ſkill'd in the Law, and reads certain Paſſages out of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> when he is ſilent they play upon Trumpets, Flutes and Drums. In the mean while the Common-People run and crowd in to the Camel, to get ſom of the Hair, every one pulling as much as he can, which is kept for Relicts, and reputed good for Women in Childbed who cannot eaſily be delivered; inſomuch that the Beaſt is almoſt bare before he com to be Offered. When they have led him 3 days about Town he is brought out of the City to a place thereto appointed, where all the greateſt Perſonages are preſent and immediately make a Ring. The Beaſt being brought in, one of the moſt eminent Perſons runs him thrô with a Spear, upon which all the People run with Hatchets, Bills, and Knives ſtriving every one to get a piece, which they carry home, ſom boyling it, and other preſerving it till the year after, reckoning it a certain and ſure token of Happineſs to that Houſe, where there is but a ſmal Morſel of this Camel. Thoſe who are ſlow or impotent muſt be content with the Entrails, Skin, and Blood, which they gather up ſo clean, that nothing of it appears upon the Place where the Sacrifice is done. The whole night continues this Feaſt with Muſic, Drinking and Banquetting.</p>

It lies in 34 <hi>degr.</hi> 17 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly Latitude, and is ſituate on a level flat Ground having on the right hand the Mountains of <hi>Elivend</hi> whence iſſue two Rivers which run thrô this City, firſt uniting themſelvs a litle above the Town. In the Winter they lay a Bridge over it, but in the Summer it is ſome times dry.

The <hi>Perſians</hi> have alſo a ſpecial vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for this Female Saint, and make long Pilgrimages to kiſs her Tomb. However the City <hi>Khom</hi> has many fair and ſpacious Streets, with many Piazzas and Galleries, to defend from Sun and Rain. They have alſo great plenty of Fruit, as at <hi>Saba,</hi> as alſo Cotton and Tobacco, which grows here in no leſs plenty than at <hi>Saba</hi> aforeſaid. Beſides the many rare Fruits and Plants they have, there is an excellent ſort of Melons, having the outward form and colour of an Orange, and is oftentimes taken for one, but being cut up appears within as another Melon. Theſe they commonly carry in the Hand for the delicate
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:33105:191"/>
flavour, but have no very acceptable or delicious Taſt. They have alſo an odd kind of Cucumber about 18 or 20 Inches long but ſmall, which they pickle much after the manner we do ours, and uſe'em for Sauce. They have alſo the common ſort of Melons which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call Muſk-millions, that far ſurpaſs ours for Delicacy. <hi>Khom</hi> is a place very conſiderable in regard of Traffic this being eminent for Swords, Knives, Armorers and Cutlers Works. Some of our Company bought here Scymiter Blades, for which they paid to the value of 20 Crowns a piece, yet were not thoſe of the beſt ſort. The Steel they have from <hi>Niris</hi> near <hi>Iſpahan</hi> where are ſeveral Mines. Beſides the Smiths work their chief Manufactory is Potts, there being many Fullers, who are eſteemed the beſt in <hi>Perſia</hi> and their work prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Porceline, which is tranſmitted all over the Countrey. The Inhabitants are ſociable and friendly enough to converſe withall when you have not much to looſe, but we were warned to look well about us, for they ſay that they are brought into the World with their Fiſt doubled. My Patron loſt here 2 new Scymiters he had lately bought, and I a Tobacco box. Six days long ſtay'd the <hi>Caravan</hi> here, during which time there was much Merchandiſe negotiated. Here I was cruelly peſtered with a <hi>Greek</hi> Renegado, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually rail'd upon me, crying, <hi>You faithleſs Dog, you Infidel,</hi> &amp;c. The Fellow had ſo often affronted me with theſe and the like Words that I was no longer able to endure him, but finding an opportunity I graſp'd him by the Collar, and trounc'd him luſtily off with my Fiſt, and at laſt getting him down I pummeld him back and ſides, ſaying, <hi>You varlet, now you ſhall find the Fiſt of a Man, and not the Paw of a Dog.</hi> He ſeeing himſelf unable to get up again, drew out his Knife which he indeavored to run into my Belly, but I obſerving got it wreſted out of his Hands, althô not without a litle ſlaſh, or two, on the Palm of my Hand: with which I gave him an Excellent Croſs in the Cheek that he looked like St. <hi>Agnes</hi> of <hi>Monte Sante,</hi> withall tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that althô he was a <hi>Muſulman</hi> I would give him a Chriſtian Token.

But this is alſo concomitated with other Annoyances, to wit, the Extreme Heat of the Climat, and the Multitudes of Scorpions which haunt the Town, thoſe being both great and dangerous, yet both in ſhape and colour differing from thoſe in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Inhabitants for fear of that venemous Animal dare not ly upon the Floor, as in other Places, where they only throw a Quilt upon the Tapeſtry, but have high Couches hanging from the Roofs of the Rooms, like Hammocks: and althô this Creature be very venemous and many are ſtung by it, yet few die, they having found out a ready Medicin againſt it, which is made of the Filings of Copper tempered with Vinegar and Honey, which is a very ſpeedy remedy, yet if neglected the Party ſtung is in danger of his Life. This I preſume has bin firſt found out by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathetical quality which ſeems to be between thoſe Scorpions and Copper, for not far from the City is the Copper-mint, where if one of theſe be brought it dies immediatly.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Scorpions, they are peſterd with another venemous Creature which they call <hi>Enkurekan,</hi> being very much like a Spider,<note place="margin">A great and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſort of Spider.</note> but bigger than a Mouſe, ſom of theſe are ſpeckled, and ſom have long ſtreaks over the Back.

So ſoon as the Patient is touched he falls imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into a deep ſleep, in ſuch ſort that all the calling and beating him, will not avail or awake him; or if by chance it do he remains ſtill ſenceleſs. The beſt and ſpeedieſt Remedy for this, is the <hi>Enkurekan</hi> it's ſelf, pounded into a Cataplaſm and applied: but when theſe are not to be had, they uſe another mean, which is thus. The Patient is laid upon his Back and his Mouth ſet open, into which they pour much Milk as they can make him digeſt; which done, they put him in a ſquare Cheſt, having on each ſide a Ring, through which are four Cords put and made faſt at one Ring on the Cieling. This Cheſt thus hanging, they whirl it about for a quarter of an Hour together, till the Patient breaks up and vomits all he has within him. This commonly lucks, if the Patient can be brought to ſwallow the Potion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they feel the vigorous force of the Poyſon for a long time after.

                  </note> we ſet forward again, and on the 19 we came to the long-wiſhd-for <hi>Iſpahan.</hi> Where being arrived I longed greedily to ſee my Countrey-men, and went to my good Maſter <hi>Hadſi Byram</hi> to take my leav of him, with a Thouſand Thanks for his many Favours: I deſired him alſo to let ſom go with me to ſhow me the <hi>Dutch</hi> Lodge, which he with great willingneſs aſſented to, and ſent one of his Slaves with me.</p>
               <p>Thus I went with Monſr. <hi>Lewis Fabritius</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Brandt</hi> to the Lodge, where for that time the Heer <hi>Frederic Bent</hi> of <hi>Enkhuyſen</hi> was Chief Factor for the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, Monſr. <hi>Kaſenbroot</hi> of <hi>Rhee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> Second, or Under-Factor, and Mr. <hi>Hubert Balde</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Aſſiſtant.

All theſe the young Man declined, ſaying, that neither Promiſes nor Threats ſhould ever praevail with him and therefore begg'd of him to reſt contented.

Yet ſtill continued this Frenzy with him, till he died, only ſom ſay that by certain Expreſſions he made, about the Eternity of the Soul, he was ſenſible of himſelf a little before his Death. He was buried with a more than ordinary Pomp, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the meanneſs of his Perſon, as to outward Eſtate; but was highly ſet by for his perſeverance and conſtancy in the Chriſtian Faith. His outward Qualities were very commendable being of a handſom ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fair Complexion and in every Way and Geſture very taking: nor was he leſs to be praiſed for the internal Faculties of the Mind and Soul, being very conſcientious and juſt in all his dealings, and withall pious.

Matches, which is held for the principal Divertiſement uſed at Court, as Tilting was formerly in moſt Courts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 23 of <hi>January</hi> was a great Match which I had the Fortune to ſee. It was appointed at the Interceſſion of the <hi>Uſbec</hi> Ambaſſador by the King who was himſelf preſent, and was mounted on a ſtately <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſe richly cappariſon'd, for the Sadle and Saddle-cloth were very richly embroydered and ſo thick beſet with Rubies and other Precious Stones that one could hardly view it. The Court and Royal Retinue were alſo well mounted and appeard very ſplendid. When they were ready to try their Dexterity one went up to the Top, and ſet up a Cup of Gold, which who could hit and bring it down, ſhould not only have it for his Pains, but alſo be preferred to great Honour, and take place among the Princeſs of <hi>Perſia,</hi> The King gave the <hi>Tartars</hi> the Advantage of ſhooting firſt who after they had ſhot more than an hour, were fain to give over: for it was to be don on Horſe back, and the Horſe in a full carier, and furthermore not to ſhoot till they came to a certain Place where they had the maſt directly on the left ſide. The Ambaſſador ſeeing that none of his men were ſo dexterous gave over, and deſired the King that he would vouchſafe to try the ſkill of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Upon which the King orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certain Perſons, who, without doubt, were very expert Marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ride in a circle, one for one, where the third that ſhot had the Fortune to bring it down, upon which the <hi>Perſians</hi> gave a ſhout that the Palace rang again. Upon this he was ſent for by the King and brought into the Palace with as much Triumph as if he had won ſom ſignal Victory; the Cup, Bow, and Quivers were like Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phys carried before him, by certain Heraulds thereto appointed, and he himſelf althô but a poor Mans Son of <hi>Keylan,</hi> promoted to great honour and reckoned in the Degree of a <hi>Chan.</hi> Beſides this the King gave him a conſiderable Penſion out of the Treſury to maintain his Grandour.</p>

a great Stone Bath where every one that will enter the ſaid Temple is firſt obliged to waſh. Leaving this Paſſage you go up two Stepps which leads you into a broad Plain, and about 8 hundred Foot directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another ſtep which brings you into the Church. The Gate which enters the <hi>Meſquite</hi> is of fair Marble and about as high as that of the <hi>Meſchaich</hi> of <hi>Choddabende</hi> in <hi>Sultanie.</hi> The Doors of this Temple are laid ore with Silver Plates, and ſet in with Flowers of Gold. Entring within the Gate, you com into a pompous Antichamber, the Floor whereof is beſpred with very fine Matts, upon which they fall down on their Knees, and make a ſhort prayer. From hence on each hand is a ſtately Gallery, each leading into another ſpacious Court, having in the middle a great Fountain, with a Bath. Above theſe great Galleries are ſom leſs, which are ſupported by marble Pillars, the Chapters and Foliage whereof are neatly gilded. When you are paſt theſe Galleries and the Courts, you come into the Temple i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Temple its ſelf is very large and ſumptuous, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with huge marble Pillars. On the right hand at going out of this Church, you enter thrô an Arch into a magnificent Hall, where ſtands a Pulpit and an Altar, which ſaid place, for ſumptuouſneſs and uniformity of ſtructure, is reputed the moſt coſtly Building and moſt glorious Fabric in the whole <hi>Emarath.</hi> All the Marble where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is built, ſeeming to outvy the Snow its ſelf for whiteneſs, is brought hither, not without vaſt trouble and Charges, from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Elivend.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Palace.</note>The Kings Palace, called <hi>Dowlet,</hi> or <hi>Schach Chane</hi> is alſo a very ſtately Houſe. Before you enter the outer Gate is a large Plain, on which are many Pieces of old Braſs Ordnance, unfit for uſe, and are only thrown together on heaps, and out of order: a true Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of ſuch Perſons as have in the Flower of their Youth been ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to their Prince and Commonwealth, but growing old and impotent becom Abjects; and are laid aſide. The Palace, 'tis true, is munited on every ſide with a Wall, but ſo meanly, that it would not reſiſt a Cannon ball, much leſs ſecure the Perſon of the King, if attacqued with any ſudden Force, which is the leaſt thing they dread. By day the utmoſt Gate is only guarded with 4 Sentinels but
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:33105:198"/>
at night, by 15 Halberdiers: and in the Bed-Chamber of the King 30 young Gentlemen, being moſtly the Sons of great Perſonages; in whom the King repoſes moſt Confidence. Every night the <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchiktzchi,</hi> or Captain of the Guards, brings the King a Liſt of their Names; who are to ſtand upon the Ward the night following. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Palace are ſeveral great Halls or Appartments, amongſt which the <hi>Tabchane</hi> and the <hi>Diwan-Chane</hi> are the chiefeſt: The former being the Banquetting Houſe, and the latter the Court of Juſtice. In the <hi>Diwan-Chane</hi> Ambaſſadors are always received and thence introducted into the Chamber of Audience, the more becauſe the Glory of the Cavalcade and other Solemnities can be here the better ſeen. Another Appartment which is not much inferior to thoſe already made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, is the <hi>Haram-Chane,</hi> where the King diverts himſelf with his Wives and Concubines. The <hi>Dekay</hi> is the Place where the King retires, and has his Reſidence, when not ingaged in any important Affair, holding here his Table with his legitimat Wives. In ſhort there are many other Appartments within the Palace for inferior Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Behind the Palace is a Garden which they call the <hi>Chobbadar</hi>; in the middle whereof is a beautifull little Chappel. Here is alſo the great Sanctuary, or Place of Refuge, which they call <hi>Allycarpi,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Gods Gate</hi>; in which Place a Malefactor is free from Juſtice. There is alſo another ſuch Place of Refuge, on the other ſide of the <hi>Maydan,</hi> called <hi>Tzechil Sutun,</hi> ſo called from 40 huge maſſy Beams that reſt upon one Pillar ſtanding in the middle, and ſo ſupport the Roof. Hither it was whither the <hi>Perſians</hi> fled when the Town was taken in by the great <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and oppoſed him again, but he breaking in with violence put all to the ſword, ſave thoſe that had got into the interior Temple, or <hi>Metzid,</hi> for which he had ſuch a veneration that he would not violate the Inſtitutions of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or pollute the Sanctuary with Blood.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide of the <hi>Maydan,</hi> are many Taverns and Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and among thoſe a Houſe greatly frequented by Traders, called the <hi>Tzaychatti-Chane</hi> or Thee-houſe, which they prepare quite after another manner than the <hi>Indians,</hi> of whom the <hi>Europeans</hi> firſt had it; for here they put in ſo many aromatical Ingredients, that one can neither perceiv any Taſte or Smell of Tee in it. In drinking Tee they alſo accuſtom themſelvs to Play, and eſpecially at Cheſs, at which
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:33105:199"/>
they are very quick and expert. The Coffee-houſes they call <hi>Cahwa-Chane,</hi> where they only go to drink Coffee and ſmoke Tobacco, with which they are ſo deeply affected that they ſomtimes ſmoke in the Church. When they are within doors they have a great Glaſs, full of water, thrô which they put their Pipes and ſmoke, much after the manner of an Alembric Still, which renders it very cool. When they draw, the water bubbles up as if it boyled, yet by reaſon of a ſtinking vapour that riſes from it, is very annoyſom. But when they ſmoke along the ſtreet have only ſuch a Pipe as thoſe which are now grown common in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> being of ſeveral joynts, and the Head of Earth.

The private Dwelling-Houſes of thoſe <hi>Armenians</hi> do equal, or rather ſurpaſs thoſe within Walls for ſplendid ſtructure. On the one ſide of the River <hi>Senderut</hi> is another Place, called <hi>Tabri</hi>- or <hi>Abas-Sabath</hi> for that <hi>Schach Abas</hi> had allotted the People of <hi>Tabris</hi> this Part of the Town to dwell in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Another Ward, or Quarter of the Suburbs is called <hi>Haſſenabath,</hi> which is moſtly inhabited by the <hi>Georgian</hi> Chriſtians, commonly called <hi>Trurtzi,</hi> Theſe as well as the <hi>Armenians</hi> are great Merchants, being alſo highly in favour with the King, not only for the vaſt Tribute which they pay, but aſwel for their Loyalty and good deportment: and theſe are the only Chriſtians who are tolerated to live within the Walls, and have a Quarter of the Town allotted them near the <hi>Meſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zid

Mehedi,</hi> althô they rather chuſe to dwell in the Suburbs, that they may be retire from the Calumny of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the better enjoy the Benefits of a Chriſtian Society. The <hi>Kebrabath</hi> is a Diſtrict of the Suburbs lying on the Weſt ſide of the City, ſo called from the <hi>Kebbers,</hi> which are a ſort of ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> Pagans, who following the old opinion of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> when they were yet Heathens, will not embrace <hi>Mahometaniſm.</hi> Theſe differ from the reſt in Habit, as well as in Cuſtoms and Religion, wearing looſe Drawers, with a long Coat only faſtned at the Collar, open at the ſhoulders: Their Hair they let grow, all over their Head and Face. The Women are attired as the Men only with this difference, that they wear a long Silk or Cotton Scarf which trails on the Ground. The Language they ſpeak is ſtill the ancient <hi>Lingua Perſica,</hi> for they are very curious in preſerving their ancient Tongue without any Innovation, inſomuch that the <hi>Perſians</hi> who ſpeak the modern Language cannot underſtand them [as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> cannot underſtand the old <hi>Brittiſh,</hi> or <hi>Welſh</hi>] yet theſe can both underſtand and ſpeak the preſent <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue. They retain alſo the Ancient Characters, and adore the Sun and the Elements for Deïties performing Monethly Sacrifices. Beſides the veneration they have for the Sun, they do worſhip to the Starrs, but have little or no Judgement in the courſe of the ſame. Snakes and all other venemous Animals they hold for unclean, ſo that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever touches any of thoſe, whether voluntarily, or by accident, muſt not enter into their Temples till he be purified. Their Dead they do not burn as moſt Pagans do, but when any Perſon dies, whether it be an Infant, or one com to full growth and Maturity, they waſh the Body very clean, and carry it to a Place far diſtant from any Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and there ſet it upright againſt a Poſt, where they wait till the Ravens com and pick out the one Eie, which if it be the right Eie, they are of opinion that the Soul of the Departed is in Paradiſe, and therefore interr him very decently; but if the Bird pull out his left Eie firſt, then they hold it for a ſure Token, that he is damned, and for his wicked Life to ſuffer perpetual Torments, and therefore eſteem him not worthy of ſuch ſolemn Exequies, but caſt him head-long into a deep Pit.</p>
               <p>Without the City of <hi>Iſpahan</hi> are many fair Gardens and Summer-houſes, belonging to the King and divers great Perſonages. The
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:33105:201"/>
moſt eminent of all theſe is the <hi>Tzarbag,</hi> not far from the great Bridge, being 4 ſquare, and about 2 [<hi>Engliſh</hi>] Miles in circuit. This (as was ſaid before) is watered with an Aquaeduct that is conveyed under Ground by ſeveral ſmall leaden Pipes from the Main, and here and there vented by Fountains, which force the Water ſomtimes 36 or 40 foot high. On each corner ſtands a noble Summer Houſe, of an admirable rare Fabric. The Garden it's ſelf has the moſt and greateſt varieties of Fruit-Trees and Vegetables that ever I have ſeen, althô it was then Winter when I was there. And indeed the <hi>Perſians</hi> are great Lovers of Planting, Gardening, and all manner of Tillage; ſo that there is hardly a Houſe in all <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> but has ſomthing of a Garden behind it, more or leſs, whence it coms that this City is ſo great in compaſs.</p>
               <p>As to the manner of their Hous-keeping and other peculiar Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, I hold it needleſs to treat any thing about, ſince it may be collected out of what I have already ſaid in the foregoing Chapters. They are in general very ſociable, and for their Urbanity towards ſtrangers, draw many Forreigners thither. They are alſo Lovers of all kinds of Diſcipline, and the Gentry very ambitious in Arts and Sciences. The Land about <hi>Iſpahan</hi> is very fertile, and affoards all that is neceſſary for human ſuſtenance in good plenty. But the Town being very populous thrô the great concourſe of Strangers from all parts of the World makes all things very dear, but eſpecially Fewel, inſomuch that Wood and Charcoal are ſold by the Pound, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it may ſeem to be in a warm climat, yet in the Winter it is very cold, or at leſt ſo ſeeming to them, who are uſed to the great heat of the Summer Solſtice. During the time of my being there they were very buſy about gathering their Ice, which is got and preſerved after this manner: Firſt they dig a great Pit in the Earth, about 40 Foot deep, which they encompaſs with a Wall, about 10 Fathom high which is commonly made of Clay, but that ſide next to the North is lower than the reſt, that the cool North Winds may allay the violent Heat of the Sun: then they dig or plow certain furrows in the Plains round about, which when it freezes, they ſet all over with Water, and ſo gather the Ice, and when they have enough cover it with ſtraw. This Ice is very common in uſe among the richer ſort in the Summer time, not only for cooling the Wines,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:33105:201"/>
but aſwell for lying upon their Diſhes of Fruit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>FEB.</hi> 1672.</note> when they are brought up to the Table, which is only laid on a heap in the middle of the Diſh, and ſo diſſolves it ſelf, through all the Fruit. This is reckoned for a good commodity if it be a hot Summer, and is ſold as well along the Streets, as in Houſes.</p>
               <p>On the 16 of <hi>February,</hi> was the Epiphany celebrated by the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Georgian</hi> Chriſtians. So ſoon as I heard what was the matter, I roſe pretty early in the morning with intent to ſee the Solemnity of the Day. The firſt I met was the <hi>Jeſaulcor,</hi> or Great Marſhal with all his ſubordinat Officers, who were ordered to prevent Tumults, and not to ſuffer Horſes and Camels with any Burthens to paſs over the Bridges and thrô the Streets that lead to <hi>Tzulfa</hi> and <hi>Tzarbag</hi>; which was not only don for the ſake of the Chriſtians, but upon the account of one of the Kings legitimat Wives, whom he entirely loved, being a <hi>Georgian</hi> by birth and educated in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and had a deſire to go and ſee the Solemnities performed, which the King would not deny her, for that ſhe was great with Child. About 8 in the morning were all the Chriſtian Ladies in Balconies, which were all hung with Tapeſtry, and thoſe of the greateſt rank with Canopies over head. Thoſe of meaner degree ſate on each ſide the River <hi>Senderus,</hi> and had a Guard of Soldiers under the Command of an Officer, to ſecure them from being abuſed by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and to ſuffer no Men to crowd in upon them. About 9 aſſembled all thoſe under Spiritual Orders and the Clergy belonging to the 10 Churches of <hi>Tzulpha,</hi> and the 2 Churches of <hi>Iſpahan.</hi> Thoſe were all attired in white Stoles and Capps of Cloth of Gold upon their Heads, with long Labels hanging down to their middle, but more gorgeous was the Attire of the Patriarch, being all over richly embroydered with Gold and adorned with coſtly Gems. Every Prieſt carried a Silver Croſs hung with litle Silver Bells and Baſons. The Croſſes which were carried by thoſe of higher degrees and in the formoſt Ranks were ſupported, each by 3 Men. The Inferior Clergy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after with lighted Tapours in their Hands, accompanied with the moſt eminent of the Laïty. The Superior Monks of <hi>Iſpahan</hi> adjoyned themſelvs to the Patriarch, 5 of them bearing up his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Robes, 2 on each ſide and one behind. About one a clock came the King mounted on a ſtately <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſe, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:33105:202"/>
Retinu ſave only the Chancelor and Grand Marſhal, the the Guards and the reſt of the Court having order to keep behind the Proceſſion. The <hi>Begum,</hi> or Queen before mentioned was carried before as a privat Gentlewoman in a Sedan to a great Merchants houſe, accompany'd only with one Gentlewoman, the Maſter of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs and 4 of his Company: for the King ever repoſes great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Chriſtians, and eſteems them as the moſt loyal of all his Subjects, as appears by his adventuring his perſon among them, without any Guards. But before the Proceſſion was ended it began to ſnow very hard, which did not only cauſe the King to leav them but put a ſtop to the further Celebration of this great Feſtival, which, by the preparations, ſeemed to be intended to be ſolemnized with very great Pomp: for beſides the Contribution of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who, as I have elſewhere noted, are very rich, the King ſends the Patriarch a conſiderable Sum of Money ſom time before, in order to the carrying on and maintaining this anniverſary Cuſtom. The Patriarch and Superior Clergy ſeeing there was no hopes of the Weather growing better, they departed without performing the ritual Ceremonies: but the Laïty continued Dancing and Singing all the Night long.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Caravan</hi> was in a readineſs to depart for <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron,</hi> and the Heer <hi>Bent</hi> gave order for Horſes and Camels to be bought up for us, to carry our Proviſion and Baggage. He alſo took care to buy us all Neceſſaries we had occaſion for on our Journey and was pleaſed to appoint me as <hi>Caffil Abaſsi,</hi> or Overſeer of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. About this time it froſe very hard, and as I not without won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſaw Ice 3 Foot thick, which was averred never to be known in that Countrey in any mans Age. How hard a ſeaſon it was for poor People may be gathered from what I have already ſaid how ſcarce all kind of Fewel is is <hi>Iſpahan.</hi>

               <p>ON the 17 of <hi>February</hi> we had order to make ready for our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>FEB.</hi> 1672.</note> wherefore that morning I went to return my hearty Thanks to my good Maſter, <hi>Hadzi Byram,</hi> where coming and finding him at home I ſaluted him after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, withall manifeſting my gratefullneſs to him for his many Favours, which he had ſhown me, althô without the leſt deſerts; but he interpelling me in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, forbad me to talk any more of that, ſaying, <hi>I have not yet him ſo worthy as to give you the Reward I promiſed you: which was to ſet you free when you came to</hi> Iſpahan, <hi>and now I underſtand you have redeemed your ſelf with your own Money: however I ſhall make it good to you by an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</hi> With that he opened a Cheſt and gave me 100 Dollars, ſaying, This I give you as part of Reward, for your care to ſave my life when I was in danger of looſing it at the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. This extraordinary great Bounty coming ſo beſides my expectation, put me to a ſtand what reply to make at firſt, but conſidering how he might look upon it as an Ingratitude to be ſilent, I expreſſed my ſelf after this manner, <hi>Sir, I am not able ever to do you ſuch ſervice as may recompenſe your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but I hope that</hi> GOD <hi>will remember your Bounty don in ſecret, which is the trueſt Charity, notwithſtanding the unworthineſs of my ſelf on whom it is ſhown.</hi> Great reaſon it is that I ſhould record the worthy Deeds of this <hi>Turkiſh Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Turk:</hi> not only as don to me, but as don to one of another Faith, and that without vain Glory, a thing he ever hated: his calling me aſide and forbidding me to make it known, manifeſt the Abſoluteneſs and Integrity of Charity, well knowing that I was juſt upon my departure, and conſequently not

likely to be his Trumpeter: but the more he charged me to conceal it the more I reckon it my Office to publiſh it, that Chriſtians whoſe firſt and chief Duty towards their Neighbour is Charity, and that the remiſsneſs of that Duty may be convinced by thoſe who hold it as a voluntary and not an injoyned Act. In ſum his fair Carriage towards me, unfortunately thrown from a Condition of Freedom to a State of Slavery, had ſo far ingaged me to love and honour him, that (had it not been for the Reſtriction and Care of a Wife and Children who lived all this time as Widdow and Orphans) I could have bin more content to ſerv him all my Life as a Slave, than to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which I have before and ſince enjoyed, with ſuch Anxiety. When, with a faint Heart and Eies full of Tears, I took my laſt leav of him he embraced me, and told me he had yet hopes to ſee me once again, and when I was at a diſtance, cried out, GOD <hi>in the higheſt Heavens conduct you:</hi> GOD <hi>Almighty bring you in ſafety home</hi>: which were the laſt words I heard him ſpeak.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mayar.</note>The ſame day we travailed 8 Leagues and about 10 a Clock came to a village called <hi>Majar,</hi> where we took up our nights Lodging. We had alſo in our Company ſom of thoſe <hi>Perſians,</hi> of whom I have already made mention that live ſtill in Heatheniſm, whom I found very civil and faithfull in all their Doings.</p>
               <p>On the 18 it was very cold weather and ſnowy, that we could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep a Horſeback. The ſnow was here thicker than ever I have ſeen it (to my knowledge) in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> being between 4 and 5 Foot deep upon the Ground, and the Path ſo narrow, that the Horſes oftentimes going out of the Way, tumbled down in the ſnow with the Packs, which happening ſo often mainly detarded that days Journey. Before night we got the hilly Countrey and ſet down in the village <hi>Caniſcha,</hi> where, by reaſon of bad Weather, we reſted 3 days with the <hi>Caravan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the 22 we ſet forward again and had very hilly way, which
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:33105:203"/>
proved ſo incommodous that we travailed that day no more than 6 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles, and took our Nights reſt at a <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> where we met another <hi>Caravan</hi> coming from <hi>Gammeron</hi> richly loaden with all ſorts of <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities, and bound for ſeveral Markets in <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 23 we broke up and the ſame day had bad and ſlippery way inſomuch that ſom of our Camels and Horſes fell, whereby the Cheſts and Goods were much endamaged. The Heer <hi>Bent,</hi> as I ſaid before, having appointed me as <hi>Caffil Abaſsi,</hi> or Overſeer, it was my duty to look to the reparation of this Damage, and to ſee the Cheſts effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mended, and therefore I went to ſee if I could meet with any Perſon who could help me in the Village, letting the <hi>Caravan</hi> remain ſo long in a <hi>Carawanſera.</hi> At laſt after much enquiry I found one, but coming back underſtood that my Portmantle and my Money was ſtole, which put me in a great ſtrait for I had not above the value of 25 <hi>gild.</hi> [or 55 <hi>ſh. ſterling.</hi>] left I ſuſpected that ſom of our Company was the Party that had committed the Theft, and had alſo a privat hint given me of it. The matter concerned me ſo far, that I forthwith began to tax the Party with it that I had in ſuſpicion, but he ſtoutly denied it, and was ſo diſpleaſed at me for blemiſhing his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he intimated the matter to ſom of his Companions, who unanimouſly ſwore to be revenged on me and taking their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity fell all together upon me, and uſed me in moſt cruel manner. It was the Brother of the Party that told me, averring that he had ſeen it, but when he came to confront him; denied every word he ſpoke to me, inſomuch that I was fain for the time being to be patient, yet fully reſolved to have it out of his Hide the firſt opportunity. That day we travailed 7 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles and came at night to a Village formerly called <hi>Jurgeſtan,</hi> now <hi>Ieſegas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 24 we broke up again, and that morning met a Poſt coming from <hi>Gameron,</hi> and intending for <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> of whom I underſtood that the Director <hi>van der Duſſen,</hi> who had remitted the Money for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was gone for <hi>Batavia.</hi> Theſe Tidings I muſt confeſs, were very unwelcom to me, becauſe I knew it would be 4 Moneths before any Ships would go for <hi>Batavia,</hi> the more becauſe I was to endure the hot ſeaſon at <hi>Gameron.</hi> This day we travailed 6 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles and at night came to a fair new-built <hi>Carawanſera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day we broke up and paſſed thrô a fair Town called
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:33105:204"/>
                  <hi>Surina.</hi> About 12 a clock it began to ſnow very hard, ſo continuing till the Evening when we met with a good <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> which was no ſmall comfort to us, having no ſtomach to lie ſuch weather without a Roof in the open Field. The ſame day we travailed 7 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles.</p>
               <p>On the 25 we had very good weather, and the Way alſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good ſo that in good time we got to a <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> which lay about 8 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles, or ſomthing more from the other. Near this place are divers Ponds of ſweet Water affoarding alſo great plenty of Fiſh: wherefore we went to Angle, and took about 40 Carps, which becauſe of the Novelty were very acceptable, having eaten nothing all the way but ſalt Meat. Theſe Ponds as well as the <hi>Carawanſera</hi> were made, as we underſtood from an Inſcription over the Door, at the Charges of the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi> Company.</p>
               <p>On the 26 we had very high Hills to clamber over, ſo that the hollow places in the way being fill'd with ſnow, put us (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the care and vigilance we could uſe) to a great deal of trouble, for the way being very ſlippery, the Camels, Mules and Horſes often ſtumbled and fell, which greatly endamaged the Cheſts which were but newly and very looſly repaired. Beſides that it ſnew very thick all the Forenoon, which made us long for a <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> that we could not reach till late at night coming to the Village <hi>Gufti,</hi> where we reſted for that night, having made no more than 5 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles the whole day. That night and the next day it continued ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that we reſolved to continue under roof till the weather grew better. About noon came a <hi>Caravan</hi> from <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Caravan</hi> ſurprized by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note>On the 27 the weather grew better and the Sun ſhone, ſo that we proceeded on our Journey, but having travailed an hour or two, we were ſurprized by ſom Robbers, who all on a ſudden aſſail'd us and beſet the <hi>Caravan</hi> round, and fell a tearing all they could com at. Our Company, being affraid of their lives deſerted the Camels and left me alone to ſtand out the brunt of all. One of the Robbers thruſt his hand into a Bag in which were 3 or 4 Flitches of Bacon and ſom Hams, who, when he came to know what it was, fell a curſing and menacing me, that I did not warn him, for he was thereby unclean, and according to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superſtition not to com into the Society of others, or enter the Temple.

That day we travailed 24 [<hi>Engliſh</hi>] Miles, and at night came to a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and ſtately <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> ſuch as I had not met with all the way unleſs in ſom great City, being all round with Galleries.</p>
               <p>On the 28 we ſet forward on our Journey and came to a fair Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Meſtzid,</hi> where we had a very commodious <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> and ſtay'd there that night. The ſaid <hi>Carawanſera</hi> was nothing inferior to that we had the night before, aſwell in reſpect of Conveniency as ornament, having much variety of Carved work, as Foliage, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturage, &amp;c. after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner: the Walls alſo were covered with a neat ſort of white glazed Tiles. Near to this Place is the Sepulchre and Tomb of the Mother of <hi>Schach Solyman,</hi>

Having ſtay'd there that night we went in the Morning to buy up ſom freſh Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Fruits, that place being very famous for Winter-growth of Fruits, both as to plenty and Cheapneſs.</p>
               <p>On the <note n="*" place="margin">For it was Leap year.</note> Nine and Twentieth of <hi>Febr.</hi> we came to a little village called <hi>Siwa,</hi> having that day travailed 5 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles.</p>

The next morning I took a turn without Town on Horſe-back, with one of our Company; where having rode about 2 Miles to the Eaſtward from the Town, we deſcried a huge fair Pile of Building, which afterwards by ſom Pilgrims that we met, we underſtood was a Sepulchre.

               <p>The third day after my arrival at <hi>Scyras</hi> I went without the Town to walk, and accidentally found the Thief who had ſtole my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and with the help of his Brother had ſo miſuſed me, as was ſaid before, bathing himſelf in the River, ſo that ſeeing ſo fair an opportunity to revenge the Villany, I ran towards him and with a <hi>Damaſkin</hi> Scymiter I alwaies wore, gave him an excellent Croſs on the Cheek, and beſides that lent him a few ſlaſhes about his back and ſhoulders, which don I took his clothes and cut them all to patches, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I threatned him alſo to write to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and make complaint at Court, and in order thereto to addreſs my ſelf to the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Scyras</hi> to diſpatch the Letters. This it ſeems put him into ſuch Conſternation as well as his Companions, that he durſt not appear abroad to challenge me for any injury don him, fearing, perhaps, upon my addreſs to the Deputy that they would be ſecured till further Information: nor did I ever ſee him ſince.</p>
               <p>Beſides the gentle Reception and the great kindneſs theſe Friars ſhowd me, I was kindly treated by one Doctor <hi>Robin,</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> which the <hi>Perſians</hi> called <hi>Hakim Robin,</hi> for <hi>Hakim</hi> in their Tongue is as much as to ſay Doctor: but his firſt name I cannot remember. This ſame Gentleman, I muſt confeſs, ſhowed me great friendſhip, and ſent a Letter for me to Holland incloſed in his own. So that in the hardeſt and greateſt extremities I ever found ſom Friends, and when I was almoſt in deſpair of ever returning to my priſtin State, and plunged in the moſt grievous Miſeries, obtained nevertheleſs by the Providence of Almighty GOD, ſom unexpected Sublevation;

that I ſhould know what it is to be miſerable, and what it is to be thankfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scyras</hi> as moſt other Towns in <hi>Perſia</hi> lies in a Valley, environed on every ſide with Hills. On that ſide towards <hi>Iſpahan</hi> is only one Thorowfare or Paſſage, which is laid ore with an Arch all over painted with variety of Beaſts and Animals, and inſcribed in ſeveral Places with <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Rhymes and Mottos. When one is paſſed thrô the ſaid Arch is a fair and ſpacious ſtreet, which leads to the City, being plain, wide, eaven, and planted on each ſide with Trees [like the Palmal in <hi>Saint James's</hi> Park] which with the great number of Gentlemens Houſes on each ſide renders it as an amiable Paradiſe. At the end of the way is a ſtill ſtanding pool or pond, which is drawn off with a Trench on each ſide: having paſt this we come over a Plain or Flat field, and juſt before the Gates of the City to a great long Stone-bridge which lies over a Ditch, which in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time is dry, but in the Winter gives the Inhabitants work enough to keep it in with damming, for ſomtimes when it ſnows and the Water falling unexpectedly from the Mountains it overflows the whole champain Land, between the aforeſaid Pool and the Ditch, is a little Chappel founded by a <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friar, which is often viſited by the Chriſtians that live in <hi>Scyras.</hi> The <hi>Maydan</hi> or Market of <hi>Scyras</hi> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Walls, which they ſay is by reaſon that this Place is of great Importance and in danger of being ſurprized or taken in by the Boors that live without the <hi>Perſian</hi> Juriſdiction, who have more than once attempted to make themſelvs Maſters of the Town and Fort. On each ſide the Town appear the Ruins of Old Walls, Gates, Towers, Pillars and other great Buildings, which is a fair argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Scyras</hi> has bin formerly much larger than it is now at this day, which is nevertheleſs a Town of conſideration, in reſpect of the preſent Trade and number of Inhabitants. The greateſt part of the City Walls are of Marble, for that is there in greater plenty than Friſe [or <hi>Portland</hi>] Stone with us: but as for the Streets they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fair nor ſpacious, but void of elegant building and uniformity of ſtructure, and by reaſon that they lie unpav'd very foul and hardly to be paſſed in bad and rainy Weather. There alſo many <hi>Meſtzids,</hi> or Churches but thoſe very mean and hardly worth our taking notice of: onely one which they call <hi>Sadur,</hi> being as the Cathedral or

Minſter may paſs for an eminent Building, in which they ſay that one of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Succeſſors lies interred. Within it appears with great magnificency, and is very well ordained as to it's ſtructure and Order of Colums; in the middle is a Chore, or Quire, which receives it's light from a Lanthorn or Tower of Glaſs above. The next remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temple is that of <hi>Aga Riza</hi> a very rich <hi>Indian</hi> Merchant who founded it at his proper Charges and left a conſiderable ſum to erect him a Tomb at the Eaſt and thereof. There is a very fair <hi>Baſar</hi> round about with rich Shops and many Galleries. There is alſo an Academy which may take place with the beſt public Edifices about Town, in which are taught the Literature there in uſe, beſides variety of other diſcipline and ſciences. Theſe are all the Buildings that are of any note in <hi>Scyras</hi> ſave only the Palace of the Deputy, which is environed with a thick ſtone Wall, and has on each ſide ſeveral ſpacious and fair Galleries.</p>
               <p>The Land round about <hi>Scyras</hi> is very fertile, produces great plenty of Corn and Fruit, but abov all is eminent for the rich Vineyards; inſomuch that this Place and Countrey has got the name beyond all the Provinces in <hi>Perſia</hi> for delicate Wine, ſurpaſſing not only the Candian and Canary-Wines but all the Wines in the World for a delicate taſt, reliſh, and flavor. From hence the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> and all the great Perſonages at <hi>Iſpahan</hi> have their Wine, and hither repair the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to market: nay, ſuch is the eſteem thereof, that notwithſtanding the great abundance of the yearly product, it is as dear here as <hi>Canary</hi> Sack in the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> This Trade in Wines which they of <hi>Scyras</hi> have is at preſent ſo conſiderable that there is not ſo much as half an Acre together of waſt ground, or hardly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in any other uſe, for the Vineyards com ſo cloſe to the Town that one may throw a ſtone from the Walls into them. Such ground as is not proper to nouriſh the vine they convert to Orchard uſe, and have many fair Arborets or Nurſeries for young Fruit-Trees of all ſorts, which are tranſported hence to other Places, the Fruit of this Countrey being nothing inferior to their Wines. They have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Oranges, Cittrons, Pomegranats, Almonds, Dates, Apples, Pears and almoſt all Fruits that I have ſeen elſewhere, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Town of <hi>Scyras,</hi> as one beholds the Countrey from ſom high building or Tower ſeems to ſtand in the Center of an Earthy

Paradiſe. Without the City is a Ward inhabited by a People that came from <hi>Babylon,</hi> when that City was taken in by the <hi>Turks.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtands a fair Houſe built for charitable uſe, where all the Poor of the City that are deſtitute of a Meals meat may have their needs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed at the Kings charges, if they have the humility to fetch it: this Houſe is called <hi>Aly Kapin</hi> where there are ſeveral perſons in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to dreſs Victuals for the ſaid uſe, and have as good cuſtom as all the Inns in <hi>Scyras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſtaid here a conſiderable time, and ſo nobly entertained by the ſaid <hi>Carmelites</hi> all the while I was in <hi>Scyras,</hi> I went to take my leave of them, giving them many Thanks (the only Treſure I had by me) for their many Civilities, and ſetting forward on our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney came at night to a good and very commodious <hi>Carawanſera,</hi> where we took our Reſt. Near this Place was a Fiſh-pond in which ſom of our company got great ſtore of Fiſh on a ſudden, with a Hook and Line, for they were alwaies provided therewith to uſe when occaſion and opportunity concurred.</p>
               <p>The next day it blew hard and was intermixed with ſhowers of Rain, ſo that we had very bad travailing and almoſt wearied out. Towards the Evening I happened to eſpy ſom perſons driving on very hard after us, and coming nearer, to my great joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I deſcryed that it was Father <hi>Feliſello</hi> the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Robine,</hi> who were going for <hi>Gameron</hi> to direct ſom affairs they had there.</p>
               <p>Beſides my good Fortune to enjoy the Company of ſuch Friends I was further obliged by freſh kindneſſes, they offering me alwaies to eat with them, till we came to our Journeys end, which was no ſmall happineſs for me, conſidering my mean Condition, and great ſtrait, being very ſhort of Moneys and almoſt in deſpair of coming to <hi>Gameron</hi> with the Charge I had upon me. I cannot but tell you how much I was aſhamed to be ſo careſſed by Strangers, who had nothing to expect from me, and loath I was to be ſo burthenſom to them of whoſe hands I had not deſerved the ſmalleſt friendſhip and kindneſs that they manifeſted towards me, yet being ſo cruelly ſtraitned on every hand I was forced to accept of their Offer. They held a very noble Table, and had taken along with them a great Caſe of Bottles full of <hi>Scyras</hi> Wine, which they ſpared not ſo long as it laſted.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:33105:213"/>
The Doctor had with him 3 Men to attend him and was every where highly reſpected, being a Gentleman of a ſweet Temper, diſcreet and and ſociable, ſo that my Journey ſeemed much ſhorter for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. This day, being as I ſaid very bad weather, we hardly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed 6 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles.</p>

This Man as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood afterwards was one, that lived a Heremitical and auſtere Life, being reputed for a Saint among the Inhabitants.

We called at a Boors houſe and would have bought of them ſom Milk, but the People would take no Money for it. They aſked me from whence I came, I told them from <hi>Surwan Scamachy</hi>; but that being a place they had never heard of in their lives, aſked me further if that were as far as <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> I told them it was more than twice as far, at which they greatly wondred thinking that I muſt needs com from the utmoſt bounds of the World, theſe being a poor ignorant People and never travail farther than their Market Town, which is a little Grange in the Valley, and never heard tell of any Countrey than their own; in ſhort they would have had me to ſtay longer with them, but my Time was too precious to ſpend in anſwering all they would have aſked me. At night we came to the City <hi>Laar,</hi> where we took up our Reſting place in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Lodge, where we found very good Convenience, and only an old Man and a Woman to look to the Houſe and aſſiſt the <hi>Caravans,</hi> who were ſet there by the Company. Here I got the Cheſts and Caſes repaired that were broken and endamaged, by the often falling of the Camels thrô the rocky way.</p>

                  <hi>Laar</hi> or <hi>Lar</hi> is a pretty big Town; but has no Walls to reſiſt or endure a ſtrong ſiege, ſave only ſuch as are made of Bricks that are dry'd in the Sun, but is reaſonably ſtrong in reſpect of its Scituation, as well as for the Fort or Caſtle, which is built upon a Hill on the North-ſide, the Walls thereof are of ſolid ſtone, and the Fort it ſelf ſo ſeated that it can command the whole Town, having one nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paſſage to enter it, which is very ſteep: it is ſupplyed with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces of great Ordnance, which the King ſent hither from <hi>Ormus,</hi> when by the help of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he took that City in. About <hi>Laar</hi> grow abundance of Date-trees, but no Wine, and by reaſon that they have no Commerce or Traffic abroad but poor, muſt ſupply themſelvs with Water, which, as well as the Air here about, is very unwholſom, inſomuch that many times Strangers who are to make uſe of it for want of Wine fall ſick, and are tormented with a ſmall Worm, but long, which breeds between the Skin and the Fleſh, and cannot be taken out without great pain. They ſhow'd me one that was above 5 Foot long, and not ſo thick as an ordinary Goos-quill.

The Inhabitants of <hi>Laar</hi> are very free and ſociable to converſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and great Lovers of Sciences and Learning.

The ſaid Rock from whence it coms is continually guarded with a ſtrict Watch, by Order of the King, and none is ſuffered to touch it upon pain of Death. This Oil is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned and well known by experience to be the greateſt Antidot againſt Poyſon in the World, althô never ſo ſtrong; and is therefore held by the King as an ineſtimable Treſure, and never ſuffered to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of his Dominions. The King alſo willing to ſhow any of his Subordinat Princes and Deputies an extraordinary and high Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, always ſends them a few drops thereof, to make it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in eſteem and value, and with one injoyns them, not to ſend it out of the Kingdom, upon pain of his diſpleſure.

We had no ſooner diſburthened the Camels, but had 50 or 60 Women who came and proffered us Milk to ſell, and were ſo importunat and troubleſom, that we could not get rid of 'em, till we ſet the Doggs upon them.

               <p>On the 25 we had a great and weariſom Mountain to travail over at the Foot whereof was a River which we were forced to wade thrô, by reaſon that the ſtone-bridge which had formerly lain over it was broken down.

               <p>On the 26 towards night we came to a Grange of Fiſher-men of whom we bought a few for our uſe. We were no ſooner ſet down but came Monſr. <hi>Kaſenbroot</hi> with his Slaves riding into the Town, being ſent for from <hi>Iſpahan</hi> to <hi>Suratte.</hi> The night being very ſtill we could eaſily hear the ruſhing of the main Ocean.

               <p>On the 27 we went onwards, and about Noon came to a <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanſera</hi> which lay cloſe to the ſhore, and could ſee Ships a ſailing, which filled me with a more than ordinary Joy, not having ſeen ſuch a comfortable ſight in a long time.

               <p>Eight days before our Arrival there had the <hi>English</hi> taken in the Iſland, being forced to put in there for want of Water: not knowing
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:33105:225"/>
any thing to the contrary,<note place="margin">

However the <hi>English</hi> were reſolved to com aſhoar ſom way or other, for they were deſtitute of Water, all the 7 Ships of War and the Merchant-men with the Fire Ship hardly able to make out 15 Hogſheads of Water, and were beſides that at a great loſs for Refreſhments, having been long off at Sea to and again. The Admiral therefore gave command to attempt an entrance at the South ſide of the Iſland, where it was ſo narrow that they could not go abov 4 in a rank, inſomuch that if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> could have miſſed ſo many men out of the Fort, might have knockt them all down with Stones, with 50 or 60 Men, ſo that the <hi>English</hi> invaded the Iſland unmoleſted. The Governour ſeeing that they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and he unable to defend himſelf againſt ſo great a Power, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred upon Articles and Compoſition. This was the Relation of the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 4 of <hi>June</hi> the <hi>English</hi> got two Ships more of the 5 that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us with another coming from <hi>Ceylon,</hi> who, not knowing any thing to the contrary but that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ſtill Maſters of the Iſland, came ſailing without any dread directly thither from the Cape. For the <hi>English</hi> had planted the Princes Flag aloft, and a Red Flag on the High way, which was a privat Token that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had among themſelves. When I remarked what the meaning of all this was, and how eaſily our Ships would be deceived, I went to the Shore, where I eſpied the Ships not abov half a <hi>Dutch</hi> league diſtant, and immediatly pulled of my Shirt and ſet it upon a Stick, that at leſt they might begin, if they ſhould have the Fortune to ſee it, to conſider well with themſelvs, what ſuch might import; but it ſeemed that they took no notice of it, or elſe did not ſee it, otherwiſe it had bin time enough for them to have ſcap'd the Scouring. 'Twas not long before I was ſpied by two <hi>English</hi> Sentinels, who came in all haſt, and beat me after a moſt lamentable manner: which when they had don brought me before the Governour, who asked me, what I meant by that Token, I told him with great liberty, <hi>That I thought it my duty to warn my Nation from the Peril which they were ready to run in, and that I ſuppoſed that if, I had bin an</hi> Engliſhman <hi>and had
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:33105:226"/>
known them under the like Circumſtances I ſhould have don no more than what I was bound to do.</hi> To which the Governour ſmiling replied; That I did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and deſerved to be commended, but withall charged me not to tranſgreſs any more, and ſo let me go without any further Trouble. Whence we may learn what difference there is, between drinking at the Fountain, and drinking at the Current.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Ships came on undauntedly; and were hardly ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Bay, but deſcryed a <hi>Lyon</hi> in an <hi>Aſſes Skin,</hi> in ſtead of an <hi>Aſs</hi> in a <hi>Lions Skin,</hi> and diſcerned a Wolfs Body with a Sheeps Voice, the Colours they ſaw ſpoke good <hi>Dutch,</hi> but the Ships danced an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jig, wherefore they thought it beſt to tack about and make all the ſail they could: which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> perceiving, out after them all in a Body, and took the Admiral and Vice-Admiral, but the Rere-Admiral and the other 2 made their Eſcape, and could not be overtaken. The Admiral behaved himſelf with good courage, and had probably not bin taken if his Mizzin Peek had not bin brought by the board. The Ship that engaged and took him was the <hi>Weſt-Freezlandt,</hi> being formerly a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship and taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the year .1665, and was now mounted with 54 Guns. Our Admiral would fain have boarded her but could not, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poured inceſſantly upon them with ſmall ſhot, inſomuch that he was fain to yield, the Commander himſelf being wounded in the Leg.</p>
               <p>The next day we were ordered to go aboard directing our Courſe for <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> Iſland, which ſerv the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for a Rendezvous, where we arrived on the 19 of <hi>Iune.</hi> Here the Men went to take Tortoiſes, which are there in very great abundance, ſom of 200 and ſom 300<hi rend="sup">lb.</hi> weight. Theſe Creatures are Amphibious, that is to ſay, living as well by water as by land; but by night com upon the Strand where they lay their Eggs, which are by the heat of the Sun engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the ſand.</p>
               <p>The Iſland <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> lies in 8 <hi>degr.</hi> and 30 <hi>min.</hi> Southerly Latitude about 40 Leagues from <hi>Saint Helena.</hi> It is altogether rocky and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces nothing of growth, having in it high Hills, yet not ſo high as thoſe in Saint <hi>Helena.</hi> The whole Iſland is white with the Dung of Mews, Cormorants, and a ſort of Wild-geeſe that com thither to build and breed, as alſo to prey upon the dead Fiſh which lies in heaps upon the ſhore, and in the ſmall Inlets, and Creeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:33105:226"/>There is no freſh Water upon the Iſland, which if there had we had bin very unhappy, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had intended to leav us there with a little Proviſion, till our own Ships ſhould come to fetch us off: but ſeeing there was none, they were ſo kind as to carry us for <hi>England.</hi> The reaſon of their deſign to do ſo, was becauſe they had very many ſick aboard, and grew every day weaker and weaker by the Death of their Men: fearing therefore that we ſhould riſe and make our ſelvs Maſters of the Ship when we found an Opportunity, being about 300 <hi>Dutch</hi> in all.</p>
               <p>On the 23 of <hi>June</hi> we left <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> Iſland, and ſet our Courſe N.W. till we came under the Aequinoctial, and then North till we came in 13 <hi>degr.</hi> which is the height of the <hi>Barbados,</hi> then ſteered N. and by E. till we came in 43 <hi>degr.</hi> where we altered our Courſe N.

Being arrived here the Captains gave us liberty to go where we liked, ſo that ſom of our Men went over Land for <hi>Kingſale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 26 we had news of the Engagement between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> The day following I ſet forward with ſom of our Company afoot over land, paſſing through many fair Towns, as <hi>Balthamore, Top, Roſs</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>On the 28 we came at the Caſtle <hi>Til Britton,</hi> where we ſtay'd all night, and the next morning betimes ſet forward on our Journey, and about noon came to <hi>Kingſale,</hi> being one of the moſt commodious Havens and ſtrongeſt Place that I had ſeen in all <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Haven is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to contain a conſiderable number of Shipping, as at our being there were 80 or 100 ſail laying at Anchor, all Ships of a great Burthen. The City it's ſelf is alſo ſtrongly Wall'd and has an impraegnable Fort. We tarried here 10 days, and ſet forward again for <hi>Cork,</hi> where we happily found a Ship ready to ſail for <hi>Briſtol. Cork</hi> is a fair City and the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of the Province of that name, being alſo a Biſhops Seat.

            <p>HAVING the advantage both of Wind and ſtream we arrived the Firſt of <hi>July,</hi> before the mouth of the River <hi>Caſanka,</hi> which is about a mile from <hi>Caſan.</hi> Here we broke our Cables, and with much ado made faſt to the ſhore with a ſingle Rope: We had alſo loſt our Bowſpriet among the Trees in falling down the <hi>Occa.</hi> The <hi>Waywods</hi> name of <hi>Caſan</hi> was <hi>Iurien Petrovitz Trobieskay,</hi> a liberal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and not at all incomitable; he treated us ſeveral Times at his own Houſe, and upon our Departure gave us ſom Proviſion aboard us.

            <p>IN <hi>Perſia</hi> they had taken in and demoliſhed 3 Citys, and moſt barbarouſly maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred the Inhabitants, and growing both in number and power were becom very formidable, both to the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> and the Great Duke.

            <p>ON the 19 came 3 <hi>Coſacs</hi> into <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> in very coſtly Attire and with great pomp, whereof the youngeſt was the Orator. The <hi>Waywood</hi> after a long Treaty aſſured them of being eſtabliſhed in the Great Dukes Favour. But it ſeemed that they had ſom diſguſt, becauſe they were not formally introduced, as is cuſtomary with all Ambaſſadors and Legates.
The <hi>Waywod</hi> excuſed it, ſaying 
<q>That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a <hi>Bojar,</hi> and reſided there in quality of <hi>Waywod,</hi> yet at his firſt taking that Dignity upon him was not introducted by his Predeceſſor, nor the Nobility of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> which was Argument and Token that he was not to do the like to others.</q>
When the Conference was over, the <hi>Waywod</hi> invited them to his Houſe and gave them a ſplendid Treat.</p>
            <p>ON the 21 early in the Morning came the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Fleet before the Town conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of 53 <hi>Stroegs,</hi> or Rowing-Barks: upon each <hi>Stroeg</hi> was only one Piece of Ordnance, but thoſe in the Rere had 2, to wit, one before and another aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Aboard each were ſo many <hi>Strelitzers</hi> (which are the Soldiery) that they could not mov if there had bin occaſion, to do any execution. The ſaid Fleet by order of the <hi>Waywod</hi> came to Anchor on the other ſide of the River. About 3 in the Afternoon came the <hi>Coſacs,</hi> conſiſting in 23 Sail and a conſiderable number of Men. Upon their Arrival we had an order from the <hi>Waywod</hi> to receiv 200 <hi>Strelitzers</hi> aboard under our Standard, who placed themſelvs in order round about the Ship. The <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Army then looſed and came before the City, giving the <hi>Salvo</hi> with all their great Guns at once, with abov 3000 Muſquets: which the <hi>Coſacs</hi> anſwered with their Cannons and Muſquets; upon which they in the City put out a white Flag, which was a Token for us to Fire, which we did with all our great Guns, and about 200 Muſquets. Mean while the Maſter of our Ship fell over board, but was taken up again, thô with much ado, for the weather was a little tempeſtuous. Soon after
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:33105:228"/>
the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> gave fire a ſecond time and came cloſe up to our Ship; upon which we gave fire for the laſt time with 13 Guns and 200 Muſquets. The <hi>Coſacs</hi> rowed off, and came to Anchor where the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Fleet rode at firſt.</p>
            <p>ON the 22 in the Morning betimes, the <hi>Coſacs</hi> rowed up the River, and were on a ſudden out of ſight: and that morning iſſued a Proclamation that none ſhould have any Commerce or Converſe with them. On the 23 came <hi>Radzin</hi> himſelf in Perſon into <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> and was ſaluted by all the Gentry: the <hi>Waywod</hi> was alſo council'd to bring the Ammunition and Standard of the Rebells into the City, which he reſolv'd upon. Mean while came news to the <hi>Waywod</hi> that <hi>Radzin</hi> was drunk, whereupon he gave order that they ſhould endeavor by good and gentle words to get him out of Town: he being very unruly when overtaken with Liquor, in which mood he had deſtroyed many Men, both of his own Rout and others. But the Inſolencies he had committed during this Uproar cannot be recounted, althô 'tis ſaid that beſides the many Thouſands of the Great Dukes Subjects he had cauſed to be maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, whereof himſelf boaſted to have diſpatched 8000 at one time, he had from time to time maſſacred above 40000 <hi>Perſians.</hi>

            <p>AFTER a taedious delay we finally received an Order from the Great Duke to imbark our ſelvs with the Ships Company, and com to <hi>Moſcou.</hi> Which being ſhown us I inſiſted continually that according to the ſaid Order I might go up, but it was thought good that the Ship ſhould be firſt put in Equippage, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Ammunition, and in caſe of neceſſity be uſed againſt the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who under the Conduct of one <hi>Stenko Radzin</hi> as chief, had already depopulated many fair Countreys upon the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and then reconciled to the Great Duke. But in the Moneth of <hi>March</hi> came news how that the <hi>Coſacs</hi> were again revolted, upon which Colonel <hi>Levonti Bogdonof</hi> was diſpatched by the Great Duke with a Band of 800 Men, to wit, 400 <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Cavalrie and 400 <hi>Nagaian Tartars,</hi> to march to <hi>Zarit a,</hi> a City lying about 80 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles above <hi>Aſtrachan</hi>; that being a City which abutts upon the Frontiers of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and commands the paſſage of the River <hi>Don,</hi> or <hi>Tanais</hi>; which River nevertheleſs doth not fall into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> as ſom have bin of opinion, and as moſt Maps do make it, for the <hi>Coſacks</hi> do come almoſt a days Journey with their Boats from the <hi>Don</hi> to the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which they bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with pieces of Timber, the better to endure the violence of the ſtream, for they are but of one entire piece, or Trunks of Trees hollowed out. Theſe people have the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Speech and the ſame Religion. They have alſo their <hi>Aſyla,</hi> or Places of Refuge, granted them by the Great Duke, whither they have recourſe when they have perpetrated any villanous Fact, or Enormity.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the 27, or 28 of <hi>April</hi> came a Narrativ by a Courier from the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Bogdanof,</hi> importing how that the <hi>Coſacks</hi> had taken in <hi>Tzaritza,</hi> and that about 1200 <hi>Moſcovians</hi> were kill'd and drown'd: but to give a full account of the Stratagems they had uſed to gain the Town, would make me more prolix and taedious than my preſent deſign is to be. Theſe 1200 <hi>Strelitzers</hi> or Soldiers, were a part of thoſe that were ſent from <hi>Moſcou</hi> to enforce the reſpectiv Garriſons upon the <hi>Wolga,</hi> but eſpecially this City, in which the Great Duke repoſed great Truſt, being able to check (as I have ſaid before) the main Paſſage of the Rebels, in their March for the South-Eaſt Countrey.</p>
            <p>THE ſame day came news how that the Field-<hi>Tartars</hi> were at diſcord and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among themſelvs, and being drawn into 2 Head-parties uſed all manner of hoſtile
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:33105:229"/>
Acts againſt each other, ſo that <hi>Bogdanof</hi> thought good to draw up and march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Chornojar,</hi> a City about 50 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles from <hi>Aſtrachan.</hi> He had alſo ſent down a Captiv <hi>Coſac</hi> to <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> who was put upon the Rack, and in ſuch manner tormented that all had compaſſion of him.</p>
            <p>MEANWHILE all things are made ready at <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> and the Shipping deſign'd for ſervice in this Expedition put in equippage. The <hi>Waywood</hi> alſo ſends a Perſon of Quality with a Body of Soldiery to joyn with thoſe under <hi>Boogdanof</hi>: theſe were then to be commanded by a <hi>Pole,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Ivan Ruſſinſki</hi> and a Proſelyte in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Church, and next to him one <hi>James Wondrong,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, born in <hi>Edenburg,</hi> aged about 33 years, and univerſally well ſpoken of, for his Piety and faithfull deportment. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers, were <hi>Paul Dolf</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and <hi>Engineer,</hi> with his Son in Law <hi>Lewis Fabritius,</hi> beſides Captain <hi>Robert Hind</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman, Nicholas Schaak</hi> my Lieutenant was alſo made Captain. There were alſo 2 <hi>Dutch</hi> Lieutenants ſent upon this affair who were baptized into the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Church. As alſo 2 or 3 Enſigns. The reſt of the Officers were moſtly <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Ruſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the 25 of <hi>May</hi> being Munday in Whitſun-week the Captains departed from <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> in about 40 <hi>Stroegs,</hi> all under the command of <hi>Knees Simeun Iva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowitz Elboof.</hi> Each <hi>Stroeg</hi> had one Piece of Canon and all neceſſary Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the whole number of the Men that were aboard this Fleet (as appeared by the Muſter-roll) did not exceed 2600 Men, whereof 2100 were of the <hi>Strelitzers</hi> of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> who have ſome manner of Diſtinction among themſelvs.</p>
            <p>THE ſame day the <hi>Coſac</hi> who had bin ſo cruelly tortured was hanged up in ſight of the whole Army. In the mean time the Inhabitants of <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> began to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and breath Rebellion, inciting one another againſt the Governour and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, which ſeemed to be a very bad <hi>Omen</hi> of ſome ill Conſequence, for from that time forward they continued bolder and bolder till at length it burſt out into palpable Rebellion. About this time arrived a <hi>Dutch</hi> Chirurgeon at <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> who had bin in the Retinue of the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> of whom I bought ſom Silk ſtuffs and 480 Hides of <hi>Turky</hi> leather, for which I immediately tendered the Money.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the beginning (I think the 4th day) of <hi>June</hi> came a Gentleman from <hi>Chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nojar</hi> with very unwelcom News. His Meſſage was that the ſame day that <hi>Knees Simeun Ivanowitz</hi> with the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Army was arrived before that City, the <hi>Coſacks</hi> appearing far more numerous and ſtrong, thoſe in the City revolted, declared themſelvs <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and ſurrendred up the Town to <hi>Radzin</hi> and the Rebells. He added further, That all the loyal Officers who indeavored to diſſwade them there from, were moſt inhumanly maſſacred. This ſad Expreſs, altho ſmothered as much as was poſſible by the <hi>Waywod</hi> and Council of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> was nevertheleſs come to the knowledge of the Townsmen, who were very impatient to bear the yoke of Obedience any longer. Upon this news I was ſent for by the <hi>Waywood,</hi> who aſked me if my Men were able to manage the Cannon, and gave order that in the firſt place all the Cannon ſhould be viſited that lay upon the Walls, and to repair thoſe that were defectiv which was forthwith done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:33105:230"/>ON Thurſday the 5th of <hi>June,</hi> we left the Ship, and brought all the Goods in the Fort, by order of the Governor, our Gunner alſo loaded a great part of the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe it would be an incumbrance: yet becauſe I had many coſtly Cloaths and other Goods, they reſolved to take as much as they could with them, and pack'd all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I weighing well the Enterprize with my ſelf, and conſidering the danger of adventuring with 22 Perſons more, in a Shallop of 26 Foot long I thought it not good to eſſay the matter. I had with me one <hi>Chriſtian Brand</hi>

               </gap> Mate aboard the Shallop to acquaint them with the Alteration of my Reſolution; but that night the Gates were ſhut ſooner than the cuſtomary hour; ſo that he could not get ſpeech to them. This put me into ſome doubt, fearing that they might p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ON the ſeventh of <hi>June,</hi> being Saturday early in the morning, I ſent a Seaman to the Ship again with ſom privat Inſtructions; but he making ſom delay, and I not have the patience to wait any longer went my ſelf, with the Chirurgeon, and found that

            </p>
            <p>THE ſame day came a Courier with an Expreſs from <hi>Moſcou,</hi> being the ſame Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had brought the news how that the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> about <hi>Zaritſa</hi> were revolted.

            <p>THE day following, being the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> I received an order from the Governour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Soon after came the <hi>Waywod</hi> himſelf in perſon and deſired our Advice what to do for Security of the Town. The <hi>English</hi> Gentlemans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was to make ſome Outworks without the Walls: but I adviſed him to make Proclamation that all ſuch as had any way revolted or engaged themſelvs to the <hi>Coſac</hi> Party ſhould be pardoned, and declared free Remmiſſionaries, in caſe they would come and ſubmit themſelvs to the Governour, and that the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould have ſome money diſtributed among them, and the moſt popular to be drawn in by promiſe of Advancement and the like; ſo that thoſe being leading Men might appeaſe the reſt: However my advice in that was rejected.</p>
            <p>MEAN while a narrow Watch was held, and the Soldiery lay all night upon the Walls, and 2 Men at every Port-hole, to be ready in caſe of a ſilent Attacque.</p>

            <p>ON Sunday, <hi>June</hi> 22 came the <hi>Coſacks</hi> within ſight of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> and ſent <hi>Coſac</hi> Trumpetter with a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Prieſt to demand the Town. The ſaid <hi>Coſac</hi> had alſo a Letter for me in <hi>Dutch,</hi> wherein I was adviſed not to fight with my Men, if I hoped for Quarter, or Mercy at their hands. The ſaid Letter was taken from me by the <hi>Waywod,</hi> before I had read it quite out, and torn in Pieces. The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petter and Prieſt had Gaggs put in their Mouths, that they ſhould cauſe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or alteration among the Commons; and were ſoon after beheaded.</p>
            <p>ON Munday came the <hi>Coſac</hi>-Army with about 300 Keels, great and ſmal cloſe to the City, puting in at a River near the Vineyards that ly about half a Leag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from the Walls of the Town. Upon this we ſet the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Tents on fire. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while I ſtood upon the top of the Governours houſe, with the Governour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and caſually eſpied ſeveral Boats in the River before the Town: I therefore adviſed the Governour not to let them tarry there for althô they were but Fiſhers Boats yet they might give intelligence to the Enemy; wherefore he gave order imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to ſink them, which was forthwith put in execution. That afternoon the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Circas-Tartars</hi> had taken 4 <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who were put to the Rack and after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, two were hanged up, and other two beheaded in preſence of the Governour.</p>
            <p>THE day following the Collonel would have confirmed me in the Office I the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſupplied, to wit, as Lieutenant Colonel which I nevertheleſs declined as before. This ſame day about noon the Great Dukes Factor preſented us with a Pipe of ſtrong
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:33105:231"/>
Beer, and a Quantity of Tobacco, which we diſtributed among the Soldiers to give 'em Courage and keep them content. In the forepart of the night I went with the Chirurgeon to do the Rounds, which don I lay me down to ſleep a little in my Tent but was quickly awaked with the Alarm, which gave notice how that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> approached to begin their firſt ſtorm, which happened about 3 a clock at the <hi>Woſnaſinſke</hi> Gate, where our Ship-maſter and the <hi>Waywods</hi> Brother had the watch. The firſt I eſpied was a ſquare Body of the Enemy who approached very near, upon which I gave fire with our 12 Pounders, and was ſeconded by thoſe of the next Poſt, who ſhot very faſt. <hi>Interim</hi> came the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonel <hi>Baily</hi> to me in great haſt with moſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Officers, bringing news how that the City was already betray'd. The Colonel was himſelf wounded on the cheek with a Pike, as alſo in two or three places on his Leg, for being all in Armour they could not hurt him elſewhere: and this he ſaid was done by our own Soldiery. He told me further that he had done his utmoſt indeavour to pacify them and if it were poſſible to caſt an <hi>odium</hi> upon the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> as Rebells; but was fain to ſmother all his reaſon ſore againſt his will and at laſt glad to come off with his Life. After a ſmall conference together I adviſed the Colonel to go again to his Poſt, and ſee if the perſwaſion of other Officers had wrought any thing upon the <hi>Strelitzers:</hi> but the next news I heard was that the <hi>Strelitzers</hi> had maſſacred all the Officers, which grieved me moſt highly, becauſe that they had adventured their perſons by my advice. Neither did this bloody Action hold up with that, for it came forward ſo far that Captain <hi>Wederos</hi> who had the next Poſt to me was taken by his own ſervant, pinion'd faſt and afterward in moſt cruel manner murthered by his Soldiers. The Chirurgeon of whom I have already made mention ſeeing this, would have thrown himſelf off the wall to avoid the danger of thoſe bloody Traitors; but I did all I could to with-hold him, and at laſt called to mind a certain Port-hole juſt under the Tower which might ſerve us for an <hi>Exitus</hi> out of all thoſe imminent dangers, in which we had certainly ſuffered if we had not taken care betimes. Thrô this we took our way and I charged the Chirurgeon with his Servant (being a <hi>Pole</hi>) to follow me, as alſo two of our Ships-Folk, to wit, <hi>James Trappen,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Brandt.</hi> Coming below we found there two <hi>Ruſſes</hi> who ſtood Sentinel, whom I charged to let us through. Theſe not knowing any thing of the Tumult let us thrô without much difficulty or Interrogations. The Chirurgeon went out before, and I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but knew not what became then of the two Seamen and the <hi>Pole.</hi> We were forced to wade thrô the Ditch to the neck, aiming at the Tartarian Field Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which, as I have ſaid, was burnd up that it might not be an advantage to the Enemy, which place we held for the moſt ſafe and ſecure. They ſhot at us mainly from the Walls, but all to little purpoſe for we were got pretty far without Cannon reach, at leſt for ſingle Bodies: But marching a little forward we met two men, whom we ſuppoſed to be <hi>Coſacks,</hi> the Chirurgeon having a Firelock reſolved to diſcharge as he alſo did, and ſo far ſurpriſed he was that he grew deſperate and throwing himſelf into the River fell a ſwimming. When I came up with them I underſtood that they were alſo fled for fear of being maſſacred by the Commonalty; upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I called out to the Chirurgeon that they were honeſt Men and under

We would have gone further, but the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> would not go with us. However I prevailed ſo far with the Chirurgeon that he was willing rather to go to Sea, than to truſt himſelf to the mercy of the <hi>Coſacks.</hi> But he was very loth to truſt himſelf in ſuch a ſmall Boat, being well acquainted with the danger by untemperate Winds, inconſtant Seaſons, and uncertain Tides. I had no more money by me than 7 <hi>Rubbels</hi> [about 3 lb. Sterl.] and bought a Mug-tent or Pavilion with a loaf of Bread weighing about 10 lb. and with that put off, truſting to the Providence of Almighty GOD, having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Tide. After two hours rowing we met 2 Fiſhers Boats, to whom we related how affairs ſtood at <hi>Aſtrachan.</hi> The Fiſhers gave us very good words and comfortable Language, promiſing to aſſiſt us in what they might. We rowed as hard as we could, and bare them company to their Fiſhing place, called <hi>Ivanow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> might, till we got the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, ſtill keeping near the Bank. After a little rowing we eſpied a Boat which rowed very hard after us: we alſo did all we could to outrow them, but they being more expert than we in general, gain'd room of us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near our boat, one of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Captains jump'd over board, and was afterwards taken up by them. All the Arms we had was my Piſtol, for the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon had thrown his into the Water, when he ſwam to ſave himſelf without <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> as I have already, mentioned. In the Keel or Veſſel that followed us were ſeveral Fiſhers, together with the <hi>Strelitzers,</hi> which were formerly under the Command of thoſe Officers that were with us ad left at <hi>Ivanowa Outzoug,</hi> who it ſeems ſo reſented the matter that they had declared themſelves <hi>Coſacks,</hi> thrô diſguſt that the Officers had not given them warning of the affairs of <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> who probably would have bin faithfull if they had bin ſo kind as to acquaint them with the matter. In ſhort they cloſed up with us, took, plundered, bound and brought us back again to the Fiſhing place, where the Colonel alone had the Liberty to exerciſe his Devotion in the Church, but we were ſecured with a ſtrong Guard all the night long.</p>
            <p>ON Thurſday the 25 of <hi>July</hi> they made preparation to bring us up to <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> and about noon we got ſight of the Town: and coming to a very convenient place
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:33105:232"/>
to land at, they went a ſhoar and divided the ſpoil, which they had taken from us. Being now alone I conſulted with the Chirurgeon how that we might eaſily make out eſcape being unbound and the Boat only made faſt to a half-pike which I could very eaſily manage. The Chirurgeon intimated the matter to the Colonel, deſiring that he would joyn indeavours with us to get free: but (whether out of fear, or in hopes of better uſage at the hands of the Rebells I cannot tell) he forthwith diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the deſign, and gave the Rebells warning to have a care: upon which they ſet a watch and guarded us ſo ſtrictly that we could not make our eſcape. Seeing that our Enterpriſe proved abortiv and ineffectual, I told the Chirurgeon that I would run a little up the Iſland and ſwim over the Water to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which I eſſay'd to do, but was follow'd and taken; yet had that attempt not bin in vain if I had not chanc'd to fall which was no ſmall diſadvantage to me: however I betook me to the Water which I found there very ſhallow, ſo that they with a little wading fetch'd me out. But having got me, I cannot expreſs with what cruelty they uſed me, beating me black and blew, which done, they bound me faſt and threw me into the Boat, ſo rowing up to the Town. By the way the Chirurgeon made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal to them that if they would ſave us alive, they ſhould have 100 <hi>Rubbels</hi> for my Ranſom and 70 for his own. They promiſed to do their Indeavour for us. In the Evening we arrived at <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> where we were brought up before the General of the <hi>Coſacs.</hi> I had no Cloaths about me ſave only a pair of leathern Breeches, which were full of holes. The General ſate at the Gates of the Biſhops Palace eroſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner drinking Brandy, and was ſo drunk that his Eies roll'd in his Read. He aſked the Chirurgeon who he was? and what his Function was? which when he knew, gave him his Life, and ordered him to take care of the <hi>Coſacs</hi> that were wounded. Afterward he aſked, who I was? the Chirurgeon made anſwer that I was his Companion: he further aſked me what I could do; but the Chirurgeon leaving me, I could not return him any anſwer. The <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel being examined, was immediately carried up to the top of a Tower called <hi>Rooſcat,</hi> and hurled headlong down. From the ſame Tower alſo was the Vice-roy, or <hi>Waywod,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Ivan Simeunowitz Proſorofski,</hi> after many Tortures thrown alſo praecipitantly from Top to Bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo the Vice-Chancelor with all the Officers, of what degree ſoever they were, either thrown down, or caſt into the Water.</p>
            <p>MOST dreadfull was this maſſacre which continued for ſome time together; but GOD Almighty gave me an undaunted ſpirit. The <hi>Coſac</hi> General looking earneſtly upon me commanded his Men to give me Brandy, and made me drink off 2 cups one after another, and then gave order to bring me into the Camp: But what became of the 2 <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Captains I cannot tell. As I paſſed by to the Camp being put in a Boat that lay next to the Generals, I was eſpied of a <hi>Ruſſian Strelitzer</hi> who brought news of my being ſtill alive to Madam <hi>Wonderham,</hi> the Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Widdow. I have already made mention how that among the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers that went out with the ſaid Lieutenant Colonel, was one <hi>Paul Rudolph</hi> his Son in Law who was the only Perſon that remained alive: feigning himſelf in ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to be a <hi>Coſac,</hi> for he was well acquainted with their ſpeech and manners. This
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:33105:233"/>
young Gentleman hearing that I was ſtill alive came to find me out in the Boat; and during this while were whole Boat loads of Men brought into the ſtream, and throw into the Water, being tied together ſo that they could not help themſelvs with ſwim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming. In this poſture I lay my ſelf till Friday <hi>June</hi> 27, expecting every moment my laſt Cataſtroph. That day they brought me into a Tower, and tied me ſo hard, that my blood for want of a natural reflux began to corrupt within my Body. My Arms were pinion'd, and my hands made faſt behind my Back: my feet alſo were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o hard bound that I never expected to have the uſe of them again. Lying in this Poſture and moſt lamentable ſtate I ſpent my Time in ſighing and groaning. The Chirurgeon of whom we have already ſpoke came to viſit me: I deſired them to ſollicit for my Death, but they ever diſſwaded me from it. Yet ſtill I inſiſted very hard that they would make interceſſion for me to the General that I might be diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, giving them a private reaſon for that my earneſtneſs. Now. there was a Rule among the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> that if any came to interceed for a Captiv that he ſhould dy himſelf for him, which the Chirurgeon told me alſo, yet promiſed he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture himſelf to the General, and for that time took his leave.</p>
            <p>THIS night I was moſt barbarouſly uſed by the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> and <hi>Gogelats,</hi> a People of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain</hi> ſo called. And in the mean time was moſt fearfully vexed with Toads and other vermin that continually ran over my Body and about my head in whole ſwarms. However I ſpent my time in prayer as one condemned to dy and aſſured of a ſpeedy Death, of which (I may truly declare) I was not in the leſt affraid, only feared that they would hang me up by the Heels, or put me to ſome ſuch lingr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, with which they continually threatned me.</p>
            <p>ON Saturday the 28 of <hi>June</hi> came the aforeſaid Chirurgeon, and told me that the General had ſent for me: and being untied I could hardly ſtand upright, yet made a ſhift to hupple after him. Being come in to the preſence of the General after a few idle impertinent Queſtions he aſked me bad me go home with the Chirurgeon. From Sunday to Thurſday I continued there in houſe with him, in which time I ſaw much cruelty commited, ſome hanging up by the Feet, others with their Feet and hands chopt off left in the open ſtreet to ſhift for themſelves, none daring ſo much as put forth a finger to help them.</p>
            <p>ON Thurſday <hi>July</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> I was again taken and carried to the Brink of the River where I expected to part with my Life. But the <hi>Coſacks</hi> told me, if I would pay the 100 <hi>Rubbles,</hi> which the Chirurgeon had promiſed them on my behalf, I might go free: which the Chirurgeon, who againſt his will feigned himſelf to be a <hi>Coſack,</hi> was content to diſburſe for me, which afterwards I was obliged to repay upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when able.</p>
            <p>ON Sunday I was ſent for by the General, who was then a Drinking at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Cellar, but nothing of moment paſſed at that time he being drunk, and forced me to drink off ſeveral Bowls of Brandy and Wine after one another, ſo that I was affraid to diſpleaſe him, being (as I have elſewhere remembred) very outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious when drunk; wherefore I took occaſion to ſteal out of his preſence.</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time happened many memorable paſſages, and cruel Examples of Tyranny, which would prove too tedious to relate. I ſhould want words to expreſs

the moſt barbarous and inhuman Acts and Torments, which the <hi>Coſacks</hi> ſtudied to kill and torture the Inhabitants and Loyal Officers, who did not forthwith ſubmit themſelvs to their unreaſonable and unjuſt Wills.</p>
            <p>On the Wedneſday following was the Secretary <hi>Alexo Alexowits</hi> hung up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Fleſh-hook by the Ribbs, and ſuffered much deſpightful uſage and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before he died. The ſame was done to a Noble mans Son of <hi>Gilan.</hi> Alſo two Sons of the Vice-roy, Deputy, or <hi>Waywod</hi> were hung up by the heels, the one being a very hopefull youth of about 16 years of Age, and the other a Child of about 7 or 8 at the moſt.</p>
            <p>The Day following they were both found alive, and the youngeſt at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and Mediator of ſome of <hi>Radzins</hi> Minions was taken down, and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alive, but the eldeſt was thrown down from the Top of the Tower, whilſt ſtill alive, which was the Death his Father ſuffered.</p>
            <p>The ſame day I had News how that <hi>Chriſtian Brand</hi> one of my Men was ſtill alive, and was conſtrained to feign himſelf as <hi>Coſac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of July the <hi>Coſac</hi> General <hi>Radzin</hi> departed with an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall Shipping and ſeverall Thouſands of Men, drawing 20 Men out of each Company to ſerve for the Garriſon at <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> and left there 2 Governors of equal Command and Power, the one being a <hi>Coſac,</hi> and the other a <hi>Ruſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the 2 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> began a New Maſſacre continuing for ſeveral days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where takeing one day with another, were 150 Perſons killed, ſparing neither ſex nor Age. For which reaſon I began to hunt out for a Cave in the Earth where I might ſave my ſelf in time of need, hearing of nothing but a perpetual and inceſſant maſſacre; and a general Lamentation of Parents for their Children, Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans for their Huſbands and Fathers, and that as well among thoſe who had bin inſtrumental and moſt forward to let in the Rebells, as others that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it; a juſt reward for their Treachery who had been aſſiſtant in the Bloodſhed of thoſe who under GOD ſhould have protected them from ſuch diſmal Calamities.</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time I diſpatched three Letter for <hi>Iſpahan</hi> and had notice how that <hi>Chriſtian Brandt</hi> was ſet free. It ſeems that he was taken for a <hi>Perſian,</hi> having a brown, ſwarthy complexion, and by ſuch means was ſpared in the maſſacre; for all the <hi>Dutch</hi> were hewn down, or otherwiſe diſpatched, ſave onely <hi>L. Fabritius</hi> Son in Law to Captain <hi>Rudolph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT the ſame time I had news by the Chirurgeon, how that my Ships-company that betook themſelvs to flight with the Shallop were run aſtrand on the <hi>Scemkal</hi> or <hi>Dageſtan</hi> Coaſt, a Countrey butting out againſt the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>ON the 22 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was much Tyranny committed in the City, and people of all ages maſſacred. The Chirurgeon after a long ſoliciting procured a Paſport to depart with a Servant to attend him, altho not without giving Security for his Return. This gave me likewiſe opportunity to leave the place under pretext of being his Servant.</p>
            <p>ON Munday in the afternoon being <hi>Aug.</hi> 25 we left <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> and imbarqued our ſelves aboard a Veſſel belonging to ſome <hi>Banjan</hi> Merchants, who were alſo pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged and robbed of all they had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:33105:236"/>ON Tuſeday we came to Sea, ſailing cloſe by the Coaſt and to the Southward. We alſo ſaw 3 ſmall Veſſels, or Barks which indeavoured to keep Company with us. Having paſſed <hi>Settinabo Gora</hi> the Wind was flat North, and about the Evening all was calm.</p>
            <p>THE Day following one of the above mentioned Shipping hail'd us, and ſaid that they were bound for <hi>Terki</hi> and came from <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> being laden with Salt. We kept them Company along the Coaſt near the broken Land which is all grown over with huge tall Reeds: we had 11 and 12 Foot Water. At night one of thoſe Veſſels ſtray'd about a Cannon ſhot from us: and the next morning 2 Barks made up towards us and gave Fire, without doing any Execution: But when they came near us the cowardly <hi>Banians</hi> fell upon their knees and begged their Lives. In each Boat were 9 Perſons and aboard of us were 46, ſome <hi>Perſians, Tartars</hi> and <hi>Bouchars,</hi> but moſt <hi>Banians.</hi> Coming to board us they plundered all to our very Proviſion. I had about 8 <hi>Rubbles</hi> in Money and my Seal-ring which had bin once already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the <hi>Coſacs.</hi> This Ring with the Money I gave to the Chirurgeon; but they threatning to put him to the Torture when it came to his turn to be pillaged; he confeſſed all and delivered up the Money and Ring, beſides 4 double Ducats of his own: but found an opportunity to hide 52 Ducats more after an eſpecial manner about his Body.</p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Coſacks</hi> had taken all and pillaged us of what they could find, they held a certain ſort of a Council among themſelves what they ſhould do with us. At laſt it was reſolved after a long debate, that we ſhould be ſaved alive but turned off to Sea, with charge not to come anigh the Coaſt any more, upon pain of being thrown over board if they came to take us again.</p>
            <p>UPON this they left us, and gave us opportunity to make uſe of the Wind, which was Weſterly, and about the Evening with a briſk Gale, and a dark moon we ſet ſail and bore up to the Sea.</p>
            <p>BUT after we had ſailed about 2 Leagues the Weather began to be ſomwhat boiſtrous, ſo that we were fain to put in at a ſmall Creek of an Iſland, where we lay at Anchor till Saturday following; at what time the Weather growing more calm and temperate we weighed and bore up again to the Coaſt, where we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly deſcried 2 Barks that made up to us, and at laſt came cloſe by the board. The Chirurgeon and I had taken our laſt Farewel of each other, expecting nothing more than Death. In ſhort, they fell a plundering us, and I to paſs for a <hi>Banjan</hi> had anointed my ſelf with Black tempered with Greace, and tied a Handhercheif about my Head, but it was ſo botchingly don that they found occaſion to aſk the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, what for a Black Devil that I was? In the mean while they ſearched very cloſe for Bread and Proviſion which I ſeeing pointed to my mouth, whereupon they were ſo merciful as to return me a part of the Proviſion back again. Two <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtan</hi> Merchants were thrown over board and the Chirurgeon who paſſed for a <hi>Pole</hi> was moſt ſeverely beat. They threatned that if they met us again near the Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that we ſhould have no Mercy at their hands. Meanwhile I had loſt my little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, ſo that we had no other help in directing our Courſe, than only the Sun and North-ſtar. Towards the Evening it began to blow hard again and the Pyrats left
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:33105:236"/>
us, bearing up cloſe to the Coaſt. The Surgeon had again hid his Gold in a place where they did not once make ſearch for it.</p>
            <p>THE Wind continued hard till Thurſday following, blowing moſtly from North-W. and by N. and now changed again into W. N. W. which was good and favourable for us; but the <hi>Banians</hi> would in no wiſe give their conſent that we ſhould weigh Anchor, for that they thought it too high and boiſtrous.</p>
            <p>BUT on Saturday the Wind continuing ſtill in the ſame point, we weighed, and with a freſh Gale ſteered away South and by Weſt; and ſoon after deſcried a ſmall Veſſel riding at Anchor, being one of thoſe that left <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> with us: thoſe aboard were <hi>Perſians</hi> and had the luck to eſcape the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> keeping off at Sea. When they ſaw who we were, they weighed and kept us company. Towards the Evening the Wind blew North-Eaſt, and I found that we had ſailed too much Weſterly, I preſs'd hard that we ſhould alter our courſe, but could not prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to ſteer another way: ſo that in the Morning we found our ſelves cloſe to the Coaſt, and had the Wind at Eaſt and by N. With this ſort of Shipping it is very difficult to ſteer without 12 points of the Compaſs Wind to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER we thought good to keep cloſe to the Coaſt, but towards the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it growing calm we rowed off to the Seaward and loſt the other Veſſel. Meanwhile we began to be diſtreſſed for want of Proviſion, and fed of the crums of moldy Bread: and the greateſt part of the Company had no more to eat. But the <hi>Banjans</hi> were beſt provided, and imparted to us ſuch as they had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>INTERIM,</hi> the Wind came about Eaſt, and E. and by S. ſo that we were conſtrained to drop Anchor, and ſo to ride three days at half a fathom Water. Yet growing calmer we ever now and then rowed a little. But having ſpent all our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ood were at a great loſs for Fewel to bake bread, of that little quantity of Meal which the <hi>Banians</hi> had left: and were fain at laſt to cut up ſome parts of the Ship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Chips, which ſtood us in very good ſtead. The Wind then continued Eaſterly and we ſteered as far Southerly as we could, till on the 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> towards the Evening we came to a good place of Anchorage, near the Coaſt, of 5 Foot water, where I ſtept aſhoar to ſeek up ſome Wood and Herbs, or what elſe I thought might be ſerviceable to us on our Voyage.</p>
            <p>ON Thurſday being the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> we ſailed cloſe by the Coaſt which we kept in ſight till Saturday following, when as the <hi>Banians,</hi> a poor and helpleſs People not able to endure ſuch hardſhip, preſſed very hard that we ſhould put aſhoar, which out of meer pity we were willing to do, being all wet and very cold.</p>
            <p>MEANWHILE we were ſet upon by a party of <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who now the third time plundered us: but the Chirurgeon not having time nor the conveniency to hide his Ducats as before, digged a hole and hid them in the Sand, and threw down his Muſquet about the ſame place for a token to find them again. I alſo being afraid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an and hid my ſelf among the Reeds; but they making a very narrow ſcrutiny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound me out: and having by me a Pſalmbook found that paſſage or Title of a Pſalm, where <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to have feigned himſelf mad before the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to eſcape them, I reſolved to do the like, by which means I eſcaped. When they had me
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:33105:237"/>
they diſputed what Countreyman I was, and ſome of them ſaid I was a <hi>Dutchman</hi>: but others ſaid I was a <hi>Georgian,</hi> and to my Happineſs the latter ſway'd it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (not without wounding and killing of ſome of our Company they let us go, and themſelvs departed from us: which the Chirurgeon ſeeing went and after much ſeeking found his Gold.</p>
            <p>ON the 20 of <hi>September</hi> it was very good Weather; we therefore made ready to ſet ſail. About noon being under ſail we ſaw about 30 <hi>Tartars</hi> on the Strand who called out to us that we ſhould come aſhoar: This unwelcom ſummons mainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our fear; inſomuch that one of the <hi>Banians</hi> ran aſhoar and fell down upon his Knees. The Boat was drawn aſhoar, and after they had conſulted a little together what they ſhould do with us they demanded Ranſom, which was agreed upon for 3 <hi>Rubbles</hi> each Man. They were <hi>Circas</hi> and <hi>Nagayan Tartars,</hi> and accepted of one of the <hi>Banians</hi> for a Pledge till the Ranſom was paid. We went about two Miles with them and left our Veſſel behind us. I had with me a little Coffer of Books which I carried along with me; and was fain to trudge a foot without either Shoes or Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings thrô Thiſtles and Brambles, inſomuch that my Feet were all bliſtered and bloody. Towards the Evening we came in a Bay where their Shipping lay. Here I met with an <hi>Armenian</hi> whom I had formerly known at <hi>Aſtrachan</hi> who treated me very kindly, as alſo my Companion the Chirurgeon: but we having in ſo long a time not eaten any thing which was fitting for human food, did Anatomize what was ſet before us at ſuch that the <hi>Armenian</hi> obſerving it, thought good to take away before we had half ſatiſfied ourappetite for fear we ſhould ſurfeit our ſelves.</p>
            <p>HERE we tarried three Days, waiting for a good Wind to go for <hi>Tarku,</hi> but that not falling out in this time are determined rather to go by land than to ſtay there Wind-bound, it being not above a Days Journey, yet very perillous for the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> who continually lay in wait for diſtreſſed, and ſtranded Paſſengers, in theſe unhappy Proceedings of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who made the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea very unſafe to ſail.</p>
            <p>ON Tuſeday being the 30 of <hi>September</hi> we ſet forward, and after a very tedious Days Travel thrô Boggs and Marſhes we got to a Village inhabited by <hi>Nagaya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tartars:</hi> where we took up our nights reſt in the <hi>Circas</hi> Quarter. Here we met with a Friend of the Chirurgeons, whom we offered 8 Ducats to conduct us to <hi>Derbent,</hi> which he undertook to do. Here I ſpoke alſo with <hi>Ivan Turken</hi> Agent to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty, who was a <hi>Turk</hi> born, but a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Proſelyte, and had a Brother at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcöu</hi> who was of the Reformed Religion and an intimate Friend of mine. This ſaid Gentleman intreated me to ſtay longer at <hi>Terku,</hi> but I declined their kind offer yet was fain to accept of it for 2 Days having ſo charged and overloaden my ſtomach with eating that I fell ſick upon it.</p>
            <p>ON the 6th. of <hi>October</hi> we ſet forward for <hi>Derbent</hi> in company with the <hi>Banians.</hi> Now by the way you are to note that every day we ſuffered ſuch hunger, a Mans ranſom was thrown into the water, which the ſuperſtitious <hi>Banians</hi> hold for a ſpecial act of Piety and a Religious Injunction. By the way we met ſom Thouſand of <hi>Tartars,</hi> for whom we were not a little affraid, they being <hi>Nagayans</hi> and noted Plagiaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:33105:237"/>AFTER three days travel we came to a Village called <hi>Andre Dereefad</hi> which was ſubject to one <hi>Chapelle,</hi> a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince. We ſtaid here till Munday following being the ſeventh of <hi>October.</hi> Here I happened to ſpy a <hi>Perſian</hi> who had my Pluſh-Coat on, which he ſaid he had bought at <hi>Terku.</hi> The Fur or Lining coſt me thirty five <hi>Rubbles</hi> at <hi>Muſcou</hi>; and the <hi>Perſian</hi> was willing to ſell it me again for five or ſix <hi>Rubbles,</hi> but I could not accompliſh ſo much Money as to purchaſe it. Here we alſo came to underſtand that my Ships<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk who fled in a Challop were ſtranded and taken ſlaves.</p>
            <p>ON Thursday the tenth <hi>ditto,</hi> we came into <hi>Terku,</hi> where we had two <hi>Armenians</hi> for our Friends; theſe alſo brought me to one of their Acquaintance for Protection, where I was adviſed to keep my ſelf very private, being a free Prize for the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Here we alſo found <hi>Lewis Faber</hi> of whom I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made mention, as alſo <hi>Chriſtian Brand</hi> one of my Ships-folk; who left <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> three Weeks after us, and had been eight Days at <hi>Terku.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the thirteenth we left <hi>Terku,</hi> and hired a perſon for eight Ducats to conduct us to <hi>Derbent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the ſeventeenth we paſſed by <hi>Boynak,</hi> where I underſtood ſom of our Men were in ſlavery, I ſent our Conduct up to the Town (not daring appear there my felf) with Letters to adviſe them to perſiſt in the Chriſtian Faith, if they were preſs'd upon to embrace Mahometaniſm with promiſe of doing my beſt to procure their Redemption. But my Squire the Courier, thought good to give us the Bag, having already got his Money in hand, nor did I ever hear a word from them, althô I gave them directions how to write to me at <hi>Derbent.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when I arrived there I found <hi>Cornelius de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ries,</hi> who had been my Gunner; and one <hi>Peter Arentſz</hi> of <hi>Sceveling,</hi> who gave me a perfect account of the Ships-Company, how they were taken Slaves, and whither they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſolicited by the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Derbent</hi> for the Redemption of our Men, who was pleaſed to diſpatch Letters on that behalf to the Prince of the <hi>Calmuc-Tartars</hi>; but having ſent two Poſts, and all to no purpoſe or effect, I went to tender my thanks to the <hi>Sultan</hi> for his Civility and Indeavours; to which he reply'd,
<q>That he was ſorry he could not prevail with the <hi>Tartars</hi> to anſwer my. Deſire, yet was willing to do us any kindneſs that lay in his power, if we could imagine any mean whereby they might procure their Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
I inſiſted further to have ſom Horſes for our uſe on the Journey which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but there was none to be had in all the Town, the <hi>Caravan</hi> being but newly ſet forward for <hi>Scamachy.</hi> Yet finding another ready to depart, the Seamen went afoot in company of the <hi>Caravan.</hi> I ſupplied them alſo with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Proviſions, and told them that I would ſtay a day, or two longer, to ſee if I could get ſom Horſes and then follow them. But it was in vain, for I could not get any, wherefore I followed the <hi>Caravan</hi> and coming at <hi>Scabran.</hi> which is reckoned the half way, we were informed that there were ſeveral Hackneys in the Town, which we hired.</p>
            <p>ON the twenty ninth we arrived at <hi>Scamachi:</hi> where we found <hi>John Struys</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:33105:238"/>
our Sail-Maker, who was bought by a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, whoſe Aſſiſtance I deſired in an Addreſs to the <hi>Chan</hi>; 'tis true he ſeemed willing to do us ſuch a favour if it could have been done without much Trouble. Here I delivered a Requeſt to the <hi>Chan,</hi> and had <hi>Audience,</hi> wherein I made a plain demonſtration of the Injury our Men ſuffered by the <hi>Calmucs, &amp;c.</hi> He promiſed me to do his beſt for them, but all was to no purpoſe, ſo that I was fain to take up ſeventy five <hi>Abbas</hi> upon ſecurity of a <hi>Banian</hi> Merchant, which was to be paid at <hi>Iſpahan</hi> within ſeven Weeks time and twenty five <hi>Abbas</hi> Uſe, or Intereſt; but in caſe of failure of payment in <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> to be paid at <hi>Scamachy</hi> within three Months with fifty <hi>Abbas</hi> Intereſt; the Chirurgeon being my ſecurity. Here I alſo reck'ned with the Chirurgeon, and gave him an Obligation under my hand for what I had received of him, as alſo for what he remained ſecurity for me at <hi>Scamachy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the fifteenth I left <hi>Scamachy</hi> having with me <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Gunner. <hi>P. Arentſz</hi> ſtaid with the Chirurgeon, and <hi>J. Struys, L. Fabritius</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Brand</hi> with the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Envoy.</p>
            <p>I had very much difficulty by the way to come to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> yet by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God arrived here the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> and have Reſidence for the time, in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Lodge: where I find Sr. <hi>Frederic Bent</hi> Preſident for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, to whom, as well as the Gentlemen his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, I am infinitely obliged to for many Civilities ſhown me. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Gunner they have ſent away for <hi>Gameron.</hi> I alſo cauſed <hi>J.
