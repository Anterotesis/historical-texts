            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>SIR, we are your friends: Theſe are to adviſe you to look to your ſelf, and to adviſe others of my Lord of STRAFFORDS friends to take heed, leſt they be involved in the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: Our adviſe is, to be gone, to pretend buſines, till the great Hubub be paſſed: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, leaſt you ſuffer among the Puritans. We entreat you to ſend away this incloſed Letter to M. ANDERTON, incloſed to ſome truſty friend, that it may be carried ſafely without ſuſpition, for it concernes the common ſafety; So deſire your friends in Coven-Garden. Jan. 4.</p>

                  <p>SIR, although many deſignes have been defeated, yet that of IRELAND holds well. And now our laſt plot workes as hopefully as that of IRELAND, we muſt beare with ſomething in the Man, his wil is ſtrong enough, as long as he is fed with hopes, the Woman is true to us, and real, Her Councel about Her is very good: I doubt not but to ſend you by the next very joyful newes, for the preſent, our rich Enemies, PYM, HAMPDEN, STROUD, HOLLIS, and HASLERIG, are blemiſht, challenged for no leſſe then Treaſon: before I writ next we doubt not but to have them in the Tower, or their heads from their ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>The SOLICITOR, and FYNES, and EARLE we muſt ſerve with the ſame ſauce: And in the Houſe of the Lords, MANDEVIL is touched, but ESSEX, WARWICK, SAY, BROOK, and PAGET muſt follow, or elſe we ſhal not be quiet. FAULKLAND, and CULPEPPER, are friends to our ſide, at leaſtwiſe they wil doe us no hurt. The Proteſtants and Puritants are ſo divided, that we need not fear them, the Proteſtants in a greater part wil joyne with us, or ſtand Neuters, while the Puritan is ſuppreſſed. If we can bring them under; the Proteſtant wil either fall in with us ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, or elſe, if they doe not, they are ſo indifferent, that either by fair, or foule meanes, we ſhal be able to command them. The miſchievous Londoners, and Apprentices, may doe us ſome hurt for preſent; but we need not much feare them; they doe nothing orderly, but tumultuouſly: Therefore we doubt not but to have them under command after one brunt, for our party is ſtrong in the City, eſpecially HOLBORNE, the new Buildings, and WESTMINSTER: We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of nothing, but the SCOTS appearing againe: But we have made a Party there, at the Kings laſt being there, which wil hold their hands behinde them, while we act our parts at home; Let us acquite our ſelves like men, for our Religion and Countrey, now or never. The Kings heart is Proteſtant, but our friends can perſwade Him, and make him beleeve any thing. He hates the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane party, and is made irreconcileable to that ſide; ſo that the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres, are for us. There are no leſſe then twenty thouſand Miniſters in ENGLAND, the greater halfe wil in their places, be our friends, to avenge the Biſhops diſhonour. Let our friends be incouraged, the worke is more then halfe done.</p>
