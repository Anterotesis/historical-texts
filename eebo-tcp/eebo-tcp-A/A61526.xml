            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO THE
First Paper.</head>
            <p>IF all men could <hi>believe as they pleased,</hi>
I should not have fail'd of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this <hi>First Paper;</hi> the Design of
it being to put an end to <hi>Particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes;</hi>
to which I am so little a Friend,
that I could have been glad to have found,
as much reason in it to convince, as I saw
there was a fair appearance to deceive.
But there is a <hi>Law in our Minds</hi> distinct
from that of our <hi>Inclinations;</hi> and out of a
just and due regard to That, we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100625:4"/>
the most plausible Writings, though
back'd with the greatest Authority, before
we yield our Assent unto them.</p>
            <p>If particular Controversies about <hi>Matters
of Faith</hi> could be ended by a Principle, <hi>as
visible as that the Scripture is in Print,</hi> all men
of sence would soon give over Disputing;
for none who dare believe what they see,
can call that in Question. But what if <hi>the
Church,</hi> whose <hi>Authority,</hi> it is said, <hi>they must
submit to,</hi> will not allow them to believe
what they see? How then can this be a
sufficient reason to perswade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Church, <hi>because it is as visible as
that the Scripture is in Print?</hi> unless we
must only use our senses to find out the
Church, and renounce them assoon as we
have done it. Which is a very bad requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of them, and no great Honour to the
Church which requires it.</p>
            <p>But with all due submission, it is no
more <hi>visible</hi> that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> than it is, that <hi>a part</hi> is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100625:4"/>
               <hi>the whole,</hi> and the most corrupt part, that
<hi>one Church, which Christ hath here upon Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed among all Christians, That
Christ can <hi>have but one Church upon Earth,</hi>
as there is <hi>but one Lord, one Faith, one Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.</hi>
And this is that Church <hi>we profess
to believe in the two Creeds.</hi> But if those, <hi>who
made those Creeds for our direction,</hi> had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> why was it
not so expressed? How came it to pass
that such a limitation of the sense of Christs
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> to the <hi>Roman,</hi> should never
be put to Persons to be Baptized in any
Age of the Church? For I do not find in
the Office of Baptism, even in the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> that it is required that they believe
the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> or that they
deny the validity of Baptism out of the
Communion of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> From
whence it is to me as <hi>visible as that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is in Print,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it
self doth not believe that it is, <hi>the one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church mentioned in the two Creeds.</hi>
For then it must void all Baptism out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100625:5"/>
of its Communion, which it hath never
yet done. And as long as Baptism doth
enter Persons into the Catholick Church, it
is impossible, that all who have the true
form of Baptism, though out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> should be
Members of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and yet
the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
be all one; as it must be if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> be the <hi>Catholick and Apostolick Church
professed in the Creeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we had been so happy to have lived
in those Blessed Times, <hi>when the multitude
of them that believed were of one heart, and of
one soul,</hi> it had been no difficulty to have
shewed that <hi>one visible Church, which Christ
had here upon Earth.</hi> But they must be great
strangers to the History of the Church,
who have not heard of the early and great
Divisions in the Communion of it. And
there was a remarkable difference in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of those Schisms, which happened in the
Church; which being not considered hath
been the occasion of great misaplication of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100625:5"/>
the sayings of the Antients about the <hi>One Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church.</hi> Some did so break off Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with other parts of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as
to challenge that Title wholly to themselves;
as was evident in the case of the <hi>Novatians</hi>
and <hi>Donatists;</hi> for they rebaptiz'd all that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
their Communion. Others were cast
out of Communion upon particular differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which were not supposed to be of such
a nature, as to make them no members of
the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> So the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>
excommunicated the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> for not
keeping <hi>Easter</hi> when They did; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
both of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> for not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Baptism of Hereticks. But is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to suppose, that upon these Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they shut out all those Holy Bishops and
Martyrs from the possibility of Salvation, by
excluding them from their Communion? If
not, then there may be different Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among Christians, which may still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
no one Member of such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
ought to assume to it self the <hi>Title</hi>
and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>One Catholick Church.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100625:6"/>
But if any <hi>One Part</hi> doth so, though never so
great and conspicuos, it is guilty of the
same Presumption with the <hi>Novatians</hi> and
<hi>Donatists,</hi> and is as much cause of the
Schisms, which happen thereupon in the
Church, as they were.</p>
            <p>For a long time before the Reformation,
there had been great and considerable breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi>
insomuch that they did renounce each
other Communion. And in these Differences
four <hi>Patriarchal Churches</hi> joined together
against the fifth, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But the Eastern Patriarchs sinking
in their Power, by the horrible Invasion
of the Enemies of the Christian Faith;
and the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> advancing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to so much Authority, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
they took from the kindness of
some Princes, and the <hi>Weakness</hi> of others,
They would hear of no other terms of
accommodation with the Eastern Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
but by an intire submission to the <hi>Pope as
Head of the Catholick Church.</hi> Which all the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100625:6"/>
Churches of the East refused, however diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
among themselves; and to this day look
on the Pope's Supremacy as an Innovation
in the Church, and Usurpation on the
Rights of the other Patriarchs and Bishops.
In all those Churches the <hi>Two Creeds are profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
true Baptism administred, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Succession of Bishops from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;
How then come They to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from being <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>One Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Apostolick Church?</hi> And if they be
not excluded, how can the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
assume to it self that glorious Title? So that
it seems to me <hi>as visible as that the Scripture
is in Print,</hi> that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> neither is,
nor can be that <hi>One Church,</hi> which Christ
left upon Earth.</p>
            <p>And this Principle being removed (which
ought to be taken for granted, since it
can never be proved) we must unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<hi>enter into the Ocean of Particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes.</hi>
And I know no reason any can
have to be so afraid of it, since we have
so sure a Compass, as the Holy Scripture
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100625:7"/>
to direct our passage. But the reason of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
<hi>particular Disputes</hi> is, because the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is too clear in them, that the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath notoriously deviated from this
infallible Rule. And it is as impossible for
a Church, which hath erred, to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as for a Church really Infallible, to err.
But if a Church pretend to prove her Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
by Texts, which are not so clear,
as those which prove her to have actually er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
then we have greater reason to recede
from her Errors, than to be deceived with
such a fallible pretence to Infallibility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well!</hi> But it is not left to every
phantastical mans head to believe as he
pleases, but to the Church.</p>
            <p>And is it indeed left to the Church <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as it pleases?</hi> But the meaning I suppose
is, that those, who reject the the Authority of
the Roman Catholick Church, do leave eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to believe according to his own fancy.
Certainly those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100625:7"/>
be liable to any imputaion of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For <hi>our Church</hi> receives the three Creeds,
and embraces the four General Councils, and
professes to hold nothing contrary to any U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Tradition of the Church from the
Apostles times. And we have often offered
to put the Controversies between <hi>Us</hi> and the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> upon that issue. And do not
those rather <hi>believe as they please,</hi> who believe
the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
without any colour from Scriptures, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or Reason? Do not <hi>those believe as they
please,</hi> who can believe against the most
convincing evidence of their own senses? Do
not <hi>those believe as they please,</hi> who can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the lawfulness of the Worship of Images,
with Gods forbidding it, the Communion in
one kind with Christ's Institution, and the
praying in an unknown Tongue with the
14 <hi>Ch.</hi> of the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all these and many other Absurdities
may go down by vertue of the Churches
Authority, <hi>to whom,</hi> it is said, <hi>Christ left the
Power upon Earth to govern us in matters of Faith.</hi>
We do not deny that the Church hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100625:8"/>
of declaring matters of Faith, or else
it never could have condemn'd the Antient
Heresies. But then we must consider the
difference between the <hi>Universal Church</hi> in a
General and free Council, declaring the sense
of Scripture in Articles of Faith, generally
received in the Christian Church from the
Apostles Times, as was done when the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Creed</hi> was made; and a Faction in the
Church assuming to it self the Title of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
and proceeding by other rules, than
the first Councils did, and imposing new
Opinions and Practices, as things necessary
to the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
And this is the true Point in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and those of the Roman Church
about the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> in matters of
Faith, since the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> For we
think we have very great reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
when a Party in the Church, the
most corrupt and obnoxious, takes upon it
self to define many new Doctrines, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Points of Faith, which have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture, nor Universal Tradition for
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100625:8"/>
It were a very irrational thing, <hi>we
are told,</hi> to make Laws for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and leave it to the Inhabitants
to be Interpreters and Iudges of those
Laws; for then every Man will be
his own Iudge, and by consequence
no such thing, as either Right or
Wrong.</p>
            <p>But is it not as <hi>irrational</hi> to allow an <hi>Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
to interpret the <hi>Laws</hi> to his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
against the just Title of the Prince,
and the true Interest of the People? And if
it be not Reasonable for any private Person
to be <hi>his own Iudge,</hi> why should a publick
Invader be so? But we hope it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to the Loyal Inhabitants of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
so far <hi>to interpret the Laws,</hi> as to be able
to understand the Duty they owe to their
King, and to justifie his Right against all
the Pretences of Usurpers. And this is as
much as we plead for in this case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100625:9"/>
Can we therefore suppose, That God
Almighty would leave us at those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,
as to give us a Rule to go
by, and leave every Man to be his own
Iudge?</p>
            <p>And can we resonably suppose, <hi>That
God Almighty should give as a Rule</hi> not capable
of being understood by those <hi>to whom it was
given,</hi> in order to the great End of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
the saving of their Souls? For this was the
main end of the Rule, to direct us in the
way to Heaven, and not meerly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Controversies. The Staff, which a
Man uses, may serve to measure things by,
but the principal design is to walk with it.
So it is with the Holy Scripture, if Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
arise: It is fit to examine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with this Infallible Rule; but
when that is done, to help us in our way to
Heaven is that which it was chiefly intended
for. And no Man can think it of equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to him, not to be mistaken, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100625:9"/>
not to be damned. In matters of Good and
Evil, every mans Conscience is his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Judge, and why not in matters of Truth
and Falshood? Unless we suppose mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
mistakes to be more dangerous
than their wilful sins.</p>
            <p>But after all, <hi>We do not leave every Man to
be his own Iudge,</hi> any further than it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
his own Salvation, which depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his particular Care and Sincerity. For
to prevent any dangerous Mistakes by the
Artifice of Seducers, we do allow the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of those Spiritual Guides, which
God hath appointed in his Church, for the
better insturcting and governing private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
We embrace the Ancient Creeds, as
a summary comprehension of the Articles
of Faith; and think no Man ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his own particular Fancy against Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
so universally received in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, from the Apostles Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100625:10"/>
I do ask any Ingenuous Man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not the same thing to follow
our own Fancy, or to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by it.</p>
            <p>If we allowed no Creeds, no Fathers,
no Councils, there might have been some
colour for such a Question. But do we
permit Men to interpret Scripture according
to their own Fancy, who live in a Church,
which owns the Doctrine of the Primitive
Church more frankly and ingenuously,
than any Church in the World besides,
without setting up any private Spirit against
it, or the present <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of it. And now I hope I may
have leave to ask some Questions of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Man; as, whether it be not the
same thing for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to make
the Rule, as to assume to it self the fole
Power of giving the sense of it? For what
can a Rule signifie without the sense? And
if this were the intention of Almighty God,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100625:10"/>
had it not been as necessary to have told us,
to whom he had given the Power of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
the Rule, as to have given the Rule
it self? Whether it be reasonable for the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to interpret those Texts,
wherein this Power of Interpreting, is to
be contained? For this is to make it <hi>Iudge in
its own Cause,</hi> which was thought an Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
before. And whether it be not as mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
to allow a Prosperous Usurper the
Power of interpreting Laws, according to
his own Interest, as any private Person, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own Fancy? Whether it be
possible to reform Disorders in the Church,
when the Person principally accused is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Judge? Whether those can be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Judges in Councils, who before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
take an Oath, to defend that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which is to be Debated? Whether <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
be not as uncertain a Rule, as Fancy,
when Men judge of Tradition according
to their Fancy?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100625:11"/>
I would have any Man shew me,
where the Power of deciding matters
of Faith is given to every particular
Man.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>deciding Matters of Faith</hi> be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the determining them in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as to oblige others, I do not know
where it is given to every particular Man,
nor how it should be. For then <hi>every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Man</hi> would have a Power over <hi>every
particular Man;</hi> and there would want a
new Decision, whose should take place.
But if <hi>by deciding Matters of Faith,</hi> no more
be meant, but every mans being satisfied of
the Reasons, why he believes one thing to
be true, and not another; that belongs to
<hi>every Man,</hi> as he is bound to take care of his
Soul, and must give an account both to God
and Man of the Reason of his Faith. And
what can be meant in Scripture by <hi>Proving
all things, and holding fast that which is good,</hi>
1 Thess. 5. 21. <hi>By trying the Spirits, whether
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100625:11"/>
they be of God,</hi> 1 John 4. 1. <hi>By judging of
themselves what is right,</hi> Luke 12. 57. unless
God had given to Mankind a Faculty of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
truth and falshood in Matters of
Faith. But if every Man hath not such a
Power, how comes he to be satisfied about
the Churches Autority? Is not that a Matter
of Faith? And where ever any Person will
shew me, that every Man hath a Power to
determine his Faith in that matter, I'le un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to shew him the rest.</p>
            <p>Christ left his Power to his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
even to forgive Sins in Heaven, and
left his Spirit with them, which they
exercised after his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But where then was the <hi>Roman-Catholick
Church?</hi> And how can it be hence inferred,
That these Powers are now in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> exclusive to all others, unless it
be made appear that it was <hi>Heir-General</hi> to
<hi>all the Apostles?</hi> I suppose it will be granted,
that the Apostles had some gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100625:12"/>
which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not in
Modesty pretend to; such as the Gift of
Tongues, the Spirit of Discerning, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
Miraculous Cures and Punishments.
Now, here lyes the difficulty, to shew
what part of the Promise of the Infallible
Spirit (for the ordinary <hi>Power of the Keys</hi>
relates not to this matter) was to expire
with the Apostles, and what was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the Church in all Ages. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Divine Assistance is denied by none
but <hi>Pelagians:</hi> But how far that extends, is
the Question. In the Souls of good Men it
is so as to keep them in the way to Heaven,
but not to prevent any lapse into sin; and it
were worth our knowing, where God hath
ever promised to keep any Men more from
Error, than from Sin. Doth he hate one
more than the other? Is one more disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Christian Doctrine than the other?
How came then so much to be said for the
keeping Men from Error, when at the same
time, they confess they may not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
great sins, but err very dangerously in
the most Solemn manner, in what relates
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100625:12"/>
to the Doctrine of Manners. Would any
have believed the Apostles Infallible, if they
had known them to be Persons of ill Lives;
or that they had notoriously erred in some
Rules of great Consequence to the Welfare
of Mankind? Now, all this is freely yielded,
as to the Pretence of Infallibility in the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is granted, that the
Guides of that Church have been very bad
Men; and that in Councils they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
erred about the Deposing Power,
being only a <hi>Matter of Practice,</hi> and not of
Faith. Whether it be so or not, I now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
not; but it is granted, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this Infallible Spirit, the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> may grosly err in a matter of mighty
Consequence to the Peace of Christendom;
and yet it cannot err in decreeing the least
Matters of Faith. As for Instance, it can
by no means err about the <hi>seven Sacraments,</hi>
or the <hi>Intention of the Priest about them;</hi> but
it may err about <hi>Deposing Princes,</hi> and <hi>Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Subjects from their Allegiance:</hi> Which in
easier terms is, They can never err about
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100625:13"/>
their own Interest, but they may about any
other whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I pass over the next Paragraph, the sense
being imperfect, and what is material about
the Creeds, hath been spoken to already.</p>
            <p>That which next deserves Consideration,
is,</p>
            <p>That the Church was the Iudge
even of the Scripture it self, many
years after the Apostles, which Books
were Canonical, and which were
not.</p>
            <p>We have a distinction among us of <hi>Iudges</hi>
of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Fact:</hi> The
One declare what the <hi>Law</hi> is, the <hi>Fact</hi> being
supposed; the Other gives judgment upon
the <hi>Fact,</hi> as it appears before them. Now
in this Case about the <hi>Canonical Books,</hi> the
Church is not judge of the Law. For they
are not to declare whether a Book appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be <hi>Canonical</hi> ought by it to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100625:13"/>
for <hi>Canonical;</hi> (which is taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among all Christians) but all they have
to do, is to give Judgment upon the Matter
of Fact, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether it appear upon suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Evidence to have been a Book written
by Divine Inspiration. And the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath no particular Priviledge in this
matter, but gives its Judgment as other
parts of the Christian World do: And if it
takes upon it to judge contrary to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
sense of the Christian Church, we
are not to be concluded by it; but an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
lyes to a greater Tribunal of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church.</p>
            <p>And if they had this Power, then
I desire to know, how they came to lose
it?</p>
            <p>Who are meant by <hi>They?</hi> And what is
understood by <hi>this Power?</hi> It is one thing
for a Part of the Church to give Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to a matter of Fact, and another to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100625:14"/>
the Power of making Books <hi>Canonical,</hi>
which were not so. This latter no Church
in the World hath, and therefore can never
lose it. The former is only Matter of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
and all parts of the Church are
concerned in it, and it depends as other
Matters of Fact do, on the Skill and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Reporters.</p>
            <p>And by what Autority Men sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselves from that Church?</p>
            <p>What Church? The Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick?
We own no Separation from that;
but we are dis-joyned from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that we may
keep up the stricter Union with the truly
<hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Church.</hi> And this
is no <hi>Separating our selves,</hi> but being cast out
by an Usurping Faction in the Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we would not submit to the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Conditions of Communion impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by it; the chief whereof is owning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100625:14"/>
all the Usurpation, which hath by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
been brought into it. To make this
plain by an Example: Suppose a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Usurper in this Kingdom had gained a
considerable Interest in it, and challenged
a Title to the whole, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of all the Kings Subjects, within his
Power, to own him to be Rightful King:
Upon this, many of them are forced to
withdraw, because they will not own
his Title: Is this an act of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and
not rather of true Loyalty? Schism in the
Church is like Rebellion in the State. The
Pope declares himself <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church,</hi> and hath formed himself a
kind of Spiritual Kingdom in the West;
although the other parts of the Christian
World declare against it, as an Usurpation.
However, he goes on, and makes the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Power a necessary Condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Communion. This many of
the Western Parts, as well as Eastern, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
and reject, and therefore are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Communion with that Church,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100625:15"/>
whereof he is owned to be the <hi>Head.</hi> The
Question now is, Who gives the Occasion
to this Separation? whether the Pope,
by requiring the owning his Usurpation,
or We, by declaring against it? Now,
if the Conditions, he requires, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and unreasonable; if his Autority,
he challenges, over the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
be a meer Usurpation (for which we
have not only the Consent of the other
Parts of the Christian World, but of
Scripture and the Ancient Church) then
we are not to be condemned, for such
a Separation, which was unavoidable,
if we would not comply with the Pope's
Usurpation. And upon this Foot the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
about Schism stands between Us
and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Pretence I ever heard
of, was, because the Church hath
fail'd in wresting and interpreting the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100625:15"/>
Scripture contrary to the true sense
and meaning of it; and that they
have imposed Articles of Faith upon
us, which are not to be warranted
by Gods Word. I do desire to know
who is to be Iudge of that, whether
the whole Church, the Succession
whereof hath continued to this day
without interruption; or particular
Men, who have raised Schisms for
their own advantage.</p>
            <p>The whole force of this Paragraph de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon a Supposition, which is taken
for granted, but will never be yielded by
Us, and we are sure can never be proved
by those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> That
in the new imposed Articles, the <hi>whole
Church</hi> in a continued Succession hath been
of the same judgment with them, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100625:16"/>
only some <hi>few Particular Men</hi> in these last
Ages have opposed them. Whereas the
great thing we insist upon next to the Holy
Scripture, is, that they can never prove
the Points in diference, by an Universal
Tradition from the Apostles Times, either
as to the <hi>Papal Supremacy,</hi> or the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
defined by the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> VVe
do not take upon our selves to contradict
the Universal sense of the Christian Church
from the Apostles Times in any one Point.
But the true Reason of the proceeding of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was this. VVhile
the Popes Authority was here received and
obeyed, there was no liberty of search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into abuses, or the ways of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. But when Men were encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to look into the Scripture, and Fathers,
and Councils, they soon found the state of
things in the Church extreamly altered from
what they ought to have been, or had been
in the Primitive Church: But they saw
no possibility of Redress, as long as the Popes
Autority was so absolute and inviolable.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100625:16"/>
This therefore in the first place they set
themselves to the accurate Examination of,
and the Result was, that they could find
it neither in the Scriptures, nor Fathers, nor
Councils, nor owned by the Eastern
Churches: And therefore they concluded it
ought to be laid aside, as an Usurpation.
Our Church being by this means set free
(even with the consent of Those, who
joyned with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in other
things) a greater liberty was then used in
examining particular Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
which had crept into the Church
by degrees, when Ignorance and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
prevail'd; and having finish'd this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
Articles of Religion were drawn
up, wherein the sense of our Church
was delivered, agreeable to Scripture and
Antiquity, though different from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and these Articles
are not the private sense of particular Men,
but the Publick Standard whereby the
World may judge, what we believe and
practise; and therefore these are the sense of
our Church, and not the opinions or fancies
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100625:17"/>
of particular Men. And those who call
the retrenching the Popes exorbitant Power
by the name of Schism, must by parity of
reason call the casting off an Usurper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
But certainly those who consider
the mighty advantages and priviledges of
the <hi>Clergy</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> can never
reasonably suspect any of that Order
should hope to better themselves by the
Reformation. And if we judge of Mens
actings by their Interest, one of the most
surprising considerations at this day is, that
the <hi>Clergy</hi> should be <hi>against,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> for
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO THE
Second Paper.</head>
            <p>IT is a sad thing to consider, what
a world of Heresies are crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Nation.</p>
            <p>But is it not a strange thing to consider,
that no distinction is here put between
the <hi>Religion by Law established,</hi> and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
disowned by it, and dissenting from
it? And yet many of these, though justly
liable to the charge of <hi>Schism,</hi> embrace no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100625:18"/>
Heresies against the Four or Six first Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils. But if the Dissenters were
guilty of never so many Heresies, how
comes the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to bear the
blame of them; when the weakning its
Power and Authority was the occasion of
such an overflowing of <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>
among us? And it is indeed a sad thing
to consider how many Ways and Means
have been used by all Parties to introduce
and keep up <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> amongst
us, and then how the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is
blamed for not being able to suppress them.
But if all Doctrines opposite to the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> be accounted <hi>Heresies,</hi> then we
desire to be informed, how the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> came to have this Power of defining
Heretical Doctrines; or how any Doctrine
comes to be <hi>Heresie</hi> by being contrary to
its definitions. For <hi>Heresie is an obstinate
opposing some necessary Article of Faith.</hi> It
must therefore be proved, that what the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> declares, doth thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a necessary Article of Faith, or it is
very unreasonable to lay the imputation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100625:18"/>
of <hi>Heresie</hi> upon us. And this can never
be maintained, without proving that the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a Power to make Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
not necessary before, to become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
by her Definition: which is the
same thing with making <hi>New Articles of
Faith.</hi> But these can never be proved to
be such by Universal Tradition; which the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends for all her Articles
of Faith.</p>
            <p>Every Man thinks himself as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
a Iudge of Scripture, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Apostles themselves.</p>
            <p>Doth <hi>Every Man</hi> among us pretend to
an infallible Spirit? And yet <hi>Every Man</hi>
owns that the Apostles had it. But
what is meant by <hi>being a Iudge of Scripture?</hi>
If no more be understood, then that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man</hi> must use his understanding about
it, I hope this is no Crime nor <hi>Heresie.</hi>
The Scripture must be believed in order to
Salvation, and therefore it must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100625:19"/>
for how can a Man believe,
what he understands not the sense or
meaning of? If he must understand the
sense he must be <hi>Iudge of the sense;</hi> so
that every Man, who is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture in order to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
must be Judge of the sense of the
Scripture, so far as concerns his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But if by being a <hi>Iudge of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
be meant giving such a judgment,
as obliges others to submit to it, then
among us no particular Man doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be a <hi>competent Iudge of Scripture,</hi>
so as to bind others to rely upon his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in expounding Scripture. We own
the Authority of Guides in the Church,
and a due submission to them, but we do
not allow them to be as <hi>competent Iudges
of Scripture as the very Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis no wonder it should be so,
since that part of the Nation, which
looks most like a Church, dares not
bring the true Arguments against the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100625:19"/>
other Sects, for fear they should be
turned against themselves, and confuted
by their own Arguments.</p>
            <p>This is directly level'd against the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> which is hereby charged
with Insincerity or Weakness in dealing
with the Dissenters. But we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the meaning of this charge. <hi>It is no
wonder it should be so,</hi> i. e. <hi>That every Man
should think himself as competent a Iudge of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as the very Apostles, because the</hi> Church
<hi>of</hi> England <hi>dares not use the true Arguments
against the Sects.</hi> Whence it appears that
this true Argument is the Churches <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Authority,</hi> and the Obligation of all
Members of the Church to submit their
judgments intirely thereto. I confess that
if the Church of <hi>England</hi> did pretend to
this against the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> they might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turn it against her; because in our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
though the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
yet <hi>Infallibility</hi> is denyed. If there
can be no Authority in a Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100625:20"/>
Infallibility; or there can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to submit to Authority, without
it, then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not
use the best Arguments against Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
But if there be no ground for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
if the Church which hath most
pretended to it, hath been most grosly
deceived; if the Heads of that Church
have been not barely suspected of <hi>Heresie,</hi>
but one of them stands condemned for it
in Three General Councils, own'd by
that Church; then for all that I can see,
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath wisely disowned
the pretence of Infallibility, and made use
of the best Arguments against Sectaries
from a just Authority, and the sinfulness and
folly of the Sectaries refusing to submit to it.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> (as 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
would fain have it thought, That
they are the Iudges in matters Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
yet dare not say positively, there
is no Appeal from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100625:20"/>
Is not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> really what
<hi>it is called?</hi> I would fain know what it
wants to make it as good a <hi>Church,</hi> as any
in the Christian World? It wants neither
<hi>Faith</hi> (if the Creed contain it) nor <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
(and those entire) nor <hi>Succession</hi> of
<hi>Bishops,</hi> (as certain as <hi>Rome</hi> it self) nor
a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (more agreeing to Primitive
Worship, then is any where else to be
found.) Why then <hi>the Church</hi> of <hi>England,
as 'tis called?</hi> Well! But what is this
<hi>Church</hi> now blamed for? <hi>They pretend to be
Iudges in matters Spiritual, and yet dare not
say there is no appeal from them.</hi> How then?
Are there no true Judges, but such as there
lies no Appeal from? There lies an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
from any Judges in the Kings Courts
to the Court of Parliament; are They
not therefore true Judges in <hi>Westminster-Hall?</hi>
There lay an Appeal from Bishops
to Metropolitans, from them to Patriarchs,
from Patriarchs to General Councils, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Antient Polity of the Church.
Were there therefore no true Judges, but
General Councils?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100625:21"/>
What follows relating to the <hi>Churches
Authority, and every Mans following his own
judgment,</hi> hath been answered already. I
proceed therefore, to what further concerns
this matter of Appeal.</p>
            <p>What Country can subsist in Quiet,
where there is not a Supreme Iudge,
from whence there can be no Appeal?</p>
            <p>The natural consequence from hence
appears to be, that every <hi>National Church</hi>
ought to have the <hi>Supream Power</hi> within
it self. But how come Appeals to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Jurisdiction to tend to the Peace and
Quiet of a Church? They have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
complained of in the best Ages of
the Church, and by the best Men; such
as S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the
whole <hi>African Churches.</hi> The worst Men
began them, and the worst Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
them, without regard to the Peace
of the Christian Church, so it increased its
own Grandeur by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:100625:21"/>
We have had these hundred Years
past, the sad effects of denying to the
Church, that Power in matters Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
without an Appeal.</p>
            <p>And our Ancestors for many hundred
Years last past, found the intolerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
of an Appeal to foreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
Whereby the Nation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
Justice obstructed, the Clergy
oppressed, and the Kings Prerogative great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diminished. <hi>But these were slight things
in Comparison to what we have felt these hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years past for want of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have not the Kings Courts been open
for matters of Law and Justice, which
have been fill'd with Men of as great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Integrity, since the Reformation,
as ever they were before? Hath not the
Appeal to the King in his High Court of
<hi>Chancery</hi> been as much for the King and
People, as ever the Appeal was to the
Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> Have not all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100625:22"/>
Princes been forced for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their own Dignity to set Bounds and
Limits to Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Orders
or <hi>Bulls</hi> that come from thence? How
then comes the want of such an Appeal
to be thought to produce such sad effects
here? All Christendom groans under the
sad effects of them; and it is a very self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
humour for those to be most sensible
of the want of them, who would really
suffer the most by them.</p>
            <p>Can there be any Iustice done, where
the Offenders are their own Iudges,
and equal Interpreters of the Law,
with those that are appointed to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Iustice?</p>
            <p>And is there any likelihood, Justice
should be better done in another Country,
by another Authority, and proceeding by
such Rules, which in the last resort, are
but the Arbitrary will of a Stranger. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100625:22"/>
must such a one, pretending to a Power
he hath no right to, <hi>be Iudge in his own Cause,</hi>
when he is the greatest <hi>Offender</hi> himself?
But how is this applied to the <hi>Protestants</hi> in
<hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is our Case, here in <hi>England,</hi>
in matters Spiritual; for the Protestants
are not of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
'tis the true Church, from whence there
can be no Appeal; but because the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
of that Church is conformable
at present to their fancies; which, as
soon as it shall contradict or vary from,
they are ready to embrace or joyn with
the next Congregation of People, whose
Discipline or Worship agrees with the
Opinion of that Time.</p>
            <p>The sense of this Period is not so clear,
but that one may easily mistake about it.
That which is aimed at, is, that we of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100625:23"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have no tie upon us, but
that of our own judgments; and when that
changes, we may join with <hi>Independents</hi> or
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as we do now with the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England.</hi> And what security can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than that of our Judgments? If it be
said <hi>to be nothing, but fancy and no true Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
we must beg leave to say, that we
dare Appeal to the World, whether we
have not made it appear, that it is not <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
but <hi>Iudgment</hi> which hath made us firm
to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Might it not as
well have been said, that <hi>the Protestants</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England, adhered to the Crown in
the Times of Rebellion out of Fancy, and not out
of Iudgment? And that if their Fancy changed,
they might as well have joined with the Rebels?</hi>
Will not this way of Reasoning hold as
strongly against those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi>
For why do any adhere to that, but because
it is agreeable to their Judgment so to do?
What evidence can they give, that it is
<hi>Iudgment</hi> in them, and only <hi>Fancy</hi> in us?
If Reason must be that which puts the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
we do not question, but to make
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100625:23"/>
ours appear to be <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and theirs <hi>Fancy?</hi>
For what is an <hi>infallible Iudge,</hi> which Christ
never appointed, but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is their
<hi>unwritten Word,</hi> as a Rule of Faith to be
equally received with the Scriptures, but
<hi>Fancy?</hi> What is giving honour to God by
the <hi>Worship of Images,</hi> but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is
making <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Intercession,</hi> besides the
<hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is
the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for half the Sacrament, but <hi>Fancy?</hi>
What is the <hi>substantial Change of the Elements
into the Body of Christ,</hi> but Fancy? for both
Senses and Reason are against it. What is
the <hi>deliverance of Souls out of Purgatory, by
Masses for the Dead,</hi> but meer Fancy? But I
forbear giving any more Instances.</p>
            <p>So that according to this Doctrine,
there is no other Church nor Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Scripture, but that which lies in
every Man's giddy Brain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100625:24"/>
Let <hi>Mens Brains</hi> be as <hi>giddy,</hi> as they are
said to be, for all that I can see, they are
the best faculties they can make use of, for
the understanding of Scripture, or any
thing else. And is there any Infallible
Church upon Earth, which must not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to Mens <hi>giddy Brains</hi> for believing
it? And it may be, never the less <hi>giddy</hi> for
doing it? For God-sake why do any Men
take the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Infallible?</hi> Is
it not, because their Understandings tell
them they ought so to do? So that by this
consequence, there is no <hi>Infallible Church,</hi>
but <hi>what lies in every Mans giddy Brain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I desire to know therefore of every
serious Considerer of these things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the great Work of our Salvation
ought to depend on such a Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
as this?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100625:24"/>
I thank God I have seriously considered
this matter, and must declare that I find no
Christian Church built on a more <hi>sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
than that, which pretends to be setled
<hi>upon a Rock;</hi> I mean, so far as it imposes the
<hi>new Faith of Trent,</hi> as a necessary Condition of
Salvation. Had we no other reason to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Christianity, than such as they offer for
these New Doctrines, I am much afraid Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self, to all inquisitive Men, would
be thought to have but a <hi>Sandy Foundation.</hi>
But what is this <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> we build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Every Man's private judgment in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
No understanding Man builds upon his
own Judgment, but no Man of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can believe without it. For I appeal to any
<hi>ingenious Man,</hi> whether he doth not as much
build upon his own Judgment, who chuseth
the <hi>Church,</hi> as he that chuseth <hi>Scripture</hi> for his
Rule? And he that chuseth the <hi>Church,</hi> hath
many more Difficulties to conquer than the
other hath. For the <hi>Church</hi> can never be a
Rule without the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
may without the <hi>Church.</hi> And it is no such
easy matter to find the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100625:25"/>
               <hi>Scripture.</hi> But suppose that be found, he hath
yet a harder <hi>Point</hi> to get over, <hi>viz.</hi> How the
Promises relating to the Church in general,
came to be appropriated to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
Which a Man must have an admirable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
at discerning, who can find it out, either
in Scripture, or the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Ancient
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The places of Scripture which are brought
about <hi>Christ's being with his Church to the end of
the World,</hi> about <hi>the Power to forgive Sins;</hi>
about the Clergy being <hi>God's Labourers, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
Building, having the Mind of Christ;</hi>
do as effectually prove <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern the least inclination in any of them
to favour one against the other.</p>
            <p>And pray consider on the other side,
that those who resist the Truth, and
will not submit to his Church, draw
their Arguments from Implications, and
far-fetch'd Interpretations, at the same
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100625:25"/>
time that they deny plain and positive
Words: which is so great a Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
that 'tis not almost to be thought
that they can believe themselves.</p>
            <p>This is a very heavy Charge; <hi>To resist the
Truth, to deny plain and positive Words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
to be guilty of great Disingenuity, so as not
to believe our selves,</hi> are faults of so high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as must argue not only a bad Cause,
but a very bad Mind. And <hi>God forbid,</hi> that
those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> should ever be
found guilty of these things. But to come
to Particulars; <hi>Is it resisting Truth, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Implications, and denying plain and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Words of Scripture,</hi> to say, <hi>We must not
worship Images; We must make God alone the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Holy Worship;</hi> We must give the Eucharist
in both kinds according to <hi>Christ's express Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi>
We must understand our Prayers, when
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words are so clear about it? So
far at least we have <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>positive Words</hi> of
<hi>Scripture</hi> on our side. And for <hi>Implications,
and far fetch'd Interpretations,</hi> commend me
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100625:26"/>
to the <hi>Pope's Bulls,</hi> especially when they have
a mind to prove their Authority from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which they can do from <hi>In the beginning,</hi>
to the end of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But that which
seems to be aimed at here, is, <hi>This is my Body;</hi>
wherein the words seem to be <hi>plain and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
on their side, and our sense to be <hi>from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
or far-fetched Interpretations.</hi> To
which I Answer, That there are Expressions
in Scripture as <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>positive</hi> as this, which
none think themselves bound to understand in
their literal sense. For then we must all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God hath <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> a <hi>Face,
Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> as firmly, as that the Bread
was then turned into Christ's Body, when he
spake those words. And I would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Christian Church rejecting the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Those <hi>who made God to be like to Man,</hi>
was not chargeable with the same <hi>resisting the
Truth,</hi> and <hi>denying plain and positive Words of
Scripture,</hi> as we are? And yet I hope the
Christian Church <hi>did then believe it self.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any should assert, That <hi>the Rock in the
Wilderness, was really changed into Christ's Body;</hi>
would not he have the very same Things to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100625:26"/>
say against those who denied it? For are not
the Words <hi>as plain and as positive,</hi> That Rock
was Christ? But <hi>Sacramental Expressions,</hi> by the
consent of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and the very
Neture of the Things, are of a different sense
from Logical Propositions. And if this had
been intended in the plain and literal sense,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have as plainly and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
called it <hi>Bread</hi> after Consecration; nor
the <hi>Cup</hi> be said to be the New Testament in
his Blood.</p>

               <head>The Conclusion is:</head>
               <p>Is there any other Foundation of the
Protestant Church, but that if the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate pleases, he may call
such of the Clergy as he thinks fit for
his turn at that time, and turn the
Church either to Presbytery, or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,
or indeed what he pleases?
This was the way of our pretended
Reformation here in <hi>England.</hi> And
by the same Rule and Authority, it
may be altered into as many Shapes and
Forms as there are Fancies in Mens
Heads.</p>
               <p>This looks like a very unkind Requital to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for her Zeal in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Magistrate's Power against a Foreign
Jurisdiction; to infer from thence, that the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100625:27"/>
Magistrate may change the Religion here
which way he pleases. But although we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the <hi>Supream Iurisdiction</hi> to the King;
yet we do not question, but there are <hi>inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rights of the Church,</hi> which ought to be
preserved against the <hi>Fancies</hi> of some, and the
<hi>Usurpations</hi> of others. We do by no means
make our Religion mutable, according to
the Magistrate's pleasure. For the Rule of
our Religion is unalterable, being the <hi>Holy
Scripture;</hi> but the Exercise of it, is under the
regulation of the Laws of the Land. And
as we have cause to be thankful to God,
when <hi>Kings are Nursing Fathers to our Church;</hi>
so we shall never cease to pray for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
so; and that in all things we may
behave our selves towards them, as becomes
<hi>good Christians,</hi> and <hi>Loyal Subjects.</hi>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO THE
Third Paper.</head>
            <p>THE Third Paper is said to be written
by a Great Lady, <hi>for the satisfaction of
her Friends,</hi> as to the Reasons of <hi>Her
leaving the Communion of the Church of</hi> England,
<hi>and making her self a Member of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church.</hi> If she had written nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, none could have been a competent
Judg of those Reasons or Motives she had for
it, but her self: but since she was pleased <hi>to
write this Paper to satisfy her Friends;</hi> and it is
thought fit to be published for general Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
all Readers have a right to judg of the
strength of them; and those of the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> an Obligation to vindicate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of it, so far as it may be thought to suffer
by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100625:28"/>
I am sensible how nice and tender a thing it
is, to meddle in a Matter wherein the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of so <hi>Great a Lady</hi> is so nearly concern'd;
and wherein such Circumstances are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which cannot fully be cleared, the Parties
themselves having been many Years dead:
But I shall endeavour to keep within due
bounds, and consider this Paper with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the main Design of it, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of other Particulars so far as they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to it.</p>
            <p>The way of her <hi>Satisfaction</hi> must needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very extraordinary; for towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
she confesses, <hi>She was not able, nor would
she enter into Disputes with any Body.</hi> Now where
the Difference between the two Churches lies
wholly in Matters of Dispute, how any one
could be truly satisfied, as to the Grounds of
leaving one Church, and going to the other,
without <hi>entring into matter of Dispute with any
body,</hi> is hard to understand. If Persons be
resolved before-hand what to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will hear nothing said against it, there is
no such way, as to declare they will <hi>enter into
no Dispute about it.</hi> But what <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is to
be had in this manner of proceeding? How
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100625:29"/>
could <hi>one bred up in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and
so well instructed in the Doctrines of it,</hi> ever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
her self in forsaking the Communion of
it, without enquiring into, and comparing the
Doctrines and Practices of both Churches? It
is possible for Persons of Learning, who will
take the pains of examining things themselves,
to do that, without <hi>entring into Disputes with
any Body;</hi> but this was not to be presumed of
a Person of her Condition. For many things
must fall in her way, which she could neither
have the leisure to examine, nor the Capacity
to judg of, without the Assistance of such
who have made it their business to search into
them. Had she no Divines of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> about her, to have proposed her Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to? None able and willing to give her
their utmost Assistance in a Matter of such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
before she took up a Resolution of
forsaking our Church? This cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
considering not only her great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that just esteem they had for her whilst
she continued so zealous and devout in the
Communion of our Church.</p>
            <p>But we have more than this to say. One
of the<note n="*" place="margin">Morley <hi>Bp of</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</note> Bishops who had nearest Relation to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100625:29"/>
her for many Years, and who owns in Print,<note n="*" place="margin">Preface to his Treatise. <hi>P.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>That he bred her up in the Principles of the Church
of</hi> England, was both able and willing to have
removed any Doubts and Scruples with respect
to our Church, if she would have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to have communicated them to him. And
however she endeavoured to conceal her Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
he tells her, in his<note n="†" place="margin">Letter to her Royal Highness from the Bp of <hi>Winton. P.</hi> 3, 4.</note> Letter to her (which
he since printed for his own vindication) <hi>That
he had heard much Discourse concerning her waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Religion, and that he had acquainted her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with it, the Lent before the Date of this Paper;</hi>
and was so much concerned at it, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Promise from her, That if any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
were put into her Hands by those of the
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that she would send it
either to him, or to the then Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Blandford,</note>
whom he left in Attendance upon her. After
which, he saith, <hi>She was many Days with him at</hi>

to him of any Doubt she had about her Religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note>
And yet this Paper bears Date, <hi>Aug.</hi> 20. that
Year, wherein she declares her self changed in
her Religion: So that it is evident she did not
make use of the ordinary Means for her own
Satisfaction, at least as to those Bishops who
had known her longest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100625:30"/>
               <hi>But she saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sheldon <hi>A. B. of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terb.</note> That she spoke severally to two
of the best Bishops we have in <hi>England,</hi> who both
told her,<note place="margin">Blanford <hi>Bp of</hi> Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> there were many things in the Roman Church,
which it were much to be wished we had kept; As
Confession, which was no doubt commanded of God;
that Praying for the Dead, was one of the Ancient
Things in Christianity; that for their parts they did
it daily, though they would not own it. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,<note place="margin">Blandford <hi>Bishop of</hi> Worcester.</note>
pressing one of them very much upon the other
Points; he told her, That if he had been bred a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
he would not change his Religion; but that
being of another Church, wherein he was sure were
all things necessary to Salvation, he thought it very
ill to give that Scandal, as to leave that Church
wherein he received his Baptism. Which Discourses,
<hi>she said,</hi> did but add more to the desire she had to
be a Catholick.</p>
            <p>This, I confess, seems to be to the purpose;
if there were not some Circumstances and
Expressions very much mistaken in the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of it: But yet suppose the utmost to
be allow'd, there could be no Argument from
hence drawn for leaving the Communion of
our Church, if this Bishop's <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi>
did signify any thing with her. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
he did say, <hi>That if he had been bred in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100625:30"/>
the Communion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>he would
not change his Religion:</hi> Yet he added, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of another Church, wherein were all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, he thought it very ill to give
that Scandal, as to leave that Church wherein he
had received his Baptism.</hi> Now why should not
the last words have greater force to have kept
her in the Communion of our Church, than
the former to have drawn her from it? For
why should any Person forsake the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of our Church, unless it appears necessary
to Salvation so to do? And yet this yielding Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
did affirm, <hi>that all things necessary to Salvation
were certainly in our Church; and that it was an ill
thing to leave it.</hi> How could this <hi>add to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of leaving our Church?</hi> unless there were
some other Motive to draw her thither, and
then such small Inducements would serve to
inflame such a Desire. But it is evident from
her own words afterwards, that these Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Bishop could have no Influence
upon her: for she declares, <hi>and calls God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that she would never have changed her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
if she had thought it possible to save her Soul
otherwise.</hi> Now what could the Bishop's words
signify towards her Turning, when he declares
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100625:31"/>
just contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> not only that it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for her to be saved without turning, <hi>but
that he was sure we had all things necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that it was a very ill thing to leave our
Church?</hi> There must therefore have been some
more secret Reason, which <hi>encreased her Desire
to be a Catholick after these Discourses:</hi> unless the
Advantage were taken from the Bishop's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the Catholick Religion;
If he had been bred a Catholick, he would not have
chang'd his Religion.</hi> But if we take these words
so strictly, he must have contradicted himself;
for how could he <hi>he sure we had all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation,</hi> if we were out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church? Was a Bishop of our Church,
and <hi>one of the best Bishops of our Church,</hi> as she
said, so weak as to yield, <hi>That he was sure all
things necessary to Salvation were to be had out of the
Communion of the Catholick Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again; there is an inconsistency in his
saying, <hi>That he thought it very ill to leave our
Church;</hi> which no Man of common sense
would have said, if he had believed the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick,</hi> exclusive of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that do not join in Communion with
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100625:31"/>
The utmost then that can be made of all
this, is, That there was a certain Bishop of
this Church, who held <hi>both Churches</hi> to be so
far <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that there was
no necessity of going from one Church to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But if he asserted that, he must over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not believe our <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homiles,</hi>
and so could not be any true Member of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the late Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> hath made
a shorter Answer to all this; For he first doubts,
<hi>Whether there ever were any such Bishops who made
such Answers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 2. p. 4.</note> And afterwards he affirms, <hi>That
he believes there never was,</hi> in Rerum Naturâ, <hi>such
a Discourse as is pretended to have been between this
Great Person, and two of the most Learned Bishops
of</hi> England. But, God be thanked, the Cause
of our Church doth not depend upon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Opinion of one or two Bishops in it,
wherein they appareently recede from the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Doctrine of it. And I am sure those
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> take it ill from us, to
be charged with the Opinion of Particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
against the known Sentiments of their
Church. Therefore supposing the Matter of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100625:32"/>
Fact true, it ought not to have moved her to
any Inclination to leave the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, <hi>She protests, in the Presence of
Almighty God, that no Person, Man or Woman, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly, ever said any thing to her (since
she came into</hi> England) <hi>or used the least Endeavour
to make her change her Religion; and that it is a
Blessing she wholly ows to Almighty God.</hi> So that
the Bishops are acquitted from having any
hand in it, by her own words; and as far as
we can understand her meaning, she thought
her self converted by immediate Divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
We had thought the pretence to a
<hi>private Spirit</hi> had not been at this time allowed
in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I observe, that
many things are allowed to bring Persons to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in those who go from it. As the use of
Reason in the Choice of a Church; the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sense; and here, that which they
would severely condemn in others as a Private
Spirit, or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> will pass well enough if
it doth but lead one to their Communion. Any
Motive or Method is good enough which tends
to that end; and none can be sufficient against
it. But why may not others set up for the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100625:32"/>
Change as to other Opinions upon the same
Grounds, as well as this Great Person does, as
to the Change from our Church to the Church
of <hi>Rome?</hi> And we have no Pretenders to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi>
among us, but do as solemnly ascribe
<hi>the Blessing wholly to Almighty God;</hi> and look on
it as the Effect of such <hi>Prayers</hi> as she made to
him in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I wonder a Person, <hi>who owed her Change
so wholly to Almighty God,</hi> should need the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of an Infallible Church; since the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
they can pretend to, is no more than to
have such an Immediat Conduct; and the least
that can be meant by it, is, that she had no As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
from any other Persons. Which may
not exclude her own <hi>Endeavours:</hi> but suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to be employed, and an Account to
be here given of them; yet there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between any of the <hi>Premisses,</hi> and the
<hi>Conclusion</hi> she drew from them; and therefore
it must be Immediate Impulse, or some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
Motive which determin'd her Choice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> was, That <hi>she would never have
changed, if she could have saved her Soul otherwise.</hi>
If this were true, she had good Reason for her
Change; if it were not true, she had none;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100625:33"/>
as it is most certain it was not. Now let us
examine how she came to this <hi>Conclusion;</hi> and
I will suppose it to have been just in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
she sets it down in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, she saith,</hi> She never had any Scruples till
the November before; and then they began upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History of the Reformation;
which was commended to her as a Book to settle her;
and there she found such abominable Sacriledg upon
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Divorce, King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Succession, that she
could not believe the Holy Ghost could ever be in such
Counsels.</p>
            <p>This was none of the best Advices given to
such a Person, to read Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History for
her Satisfaction. For there are two distinct
Parts in the <hi>History</hi> of our <hi>Reformation;</hi> the one
<hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> the other <hi>Political:</hi> the former was
built on Scripture and Antiquity, and the
Rights of particular Churches; the other on
such Maxims which are common to States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at all Times, and in all Churches, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to turn all Revolutions and Changes to
their own Advantage. And it is strange to me
that a Person of so great Understanding,
should not distinguish these two. <hi>Whether</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100625:33"/>
Hen. 8. <hi>were a good Man or not; Whether the D. of</hi>
Somerset <hi>raised his Estate out of the Church Lands,</hi>
doth not concern our present Enquiry; which
is, Whether there was not sufficient Cause for
a Reformation in the Church? And if
there was, Whether our Church had not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Authority to reform it self? And if so,
Whether the Proceedings of our Reformation
were not Justifiable by the Rules of Scripture
and the Ancient Church? These were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Points for her to have considered, and not
the particular Faults of Princes, or the Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of Ministers of State. Were not the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> and many other Heads
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a whole Age toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the Confession of their own greatest
Writers, as great at least as those of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>8th?</hi> And were these not thought sufficient to
keep her from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet
the others were sufficient to make her think of
leaving our Church? But <hi>Henry the Eighth's
Church</hi> was in Truth the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>a Political Head,</hi> much as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
is under the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> All the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> took it as his own
Right; the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> pretends to have it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100625:34"/>
from the Pope, by such Concessions, which the
Popes deny. And suppose the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Pretence were unlawful to that Jurisdiction
which he challengeth in the Kingdom of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
were this a sufficient Ground to justify the
thoughts of Separation from the Church of
<hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> raised his Estate out
of Church-Lands, and so did many Courtiers in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are there not Miscarriages of the like nature
in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> What is the <hi>Popes
making great Estates out of the Church-Lands,</hi> for
their Nephews to be Princes and Dukes? a
thing not unheard of in our Age. And is it
not so much worse to be done by the Head of
the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These she confesses</hi> were <hi>but</hi> Scruples; <hi>but
such as occasioned</hi> her examining the Points in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
by the Holy Scripture. <hi>Now she was in
the right way for Satisfaction, provided she
made use of the best Helps and Means for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
it;</hi> and took in the Assistance of her
Spiritual Guides. <hi>But it seems, contrary to the
Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, she found
some things so easy there, that she wondered she had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100625:34"/>
been so long without finding them out. <hi>And what
were these? No less than</hi> the Real Presence in
the Blessed Sacrament; the Infallibility of the Church,
Confession, and Praying for the Dead.</p>
            <p>These were great Discoveries to be made <hi>so
easily,</hi> considering how those of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have been most vers'd in these
Matters, have found it so difficult to make
them out from thence.</p>
            <p>(1.) As to the <hi>Real Presence;</hi> as it is in the
Dispute between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
it implies the Real and Substantial Change of
the Elements into the Body and Blood of
Christ. But where do our Saviour's words,
in <hi>calling the Sacrament his Body and Blood,</hi> imply
any such thing? The wisest Persons of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have confessed, that the bare
words of our Saviour can never prove it;
but there needs the Authority of the Church
to interpret them in that sense. How then
could she so easily find out that, which their
most Learned Men could not? But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
goes so far in such Discoveries as a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Mind.</p>
            <p>(2.) As to <hi>Confession.</hi> No doubt the Word
is often used in Scripture, and therefore <hi>easily
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100625:35"/>
found.</hi> But the Question between us, is not
about the Usefulness or Advantage of <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
in particular Cases, but the Necessity of it
in all Cases, in order to Remission of Sins. And
I can hardly believe any Bishop of our Church
would ever say to her, <hi>that Confession</hi> in this
sense <hi>was ever commanded by God.</hi> For then he
must be damned himself if he did not confess
every known Sin to a Priest. But some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Expressions might be used, that Confession
of Sin was commanded by God; <hi>Confess your
Sins one to another:</hi> But here is nothing of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Confession to a Priest, necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Forgiveness of Sin.</p>
            <p>(3.) As <hi>to praying for the Dead;</hi> It is hard to
find any place of Scripture which seems to have
any tendency that way, unless it be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the <hi>Day of Iudgment,</hi> and that very
doubtfully. But how came this Great Person
to think it not possible to be saved in our
Church, unless we prayed for the Dead? How
did this come to be a Point of Salvation? And
for the <hi>Practice</hi> of it, she saith, <hi>the Bishops told
her they did it daily.</hi> Whether they did it or not,
or in what sense they did it, we cannot now be
better informed: But we are sure this could
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100625:35"/>
be no Argument for her to leave the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of our Church, because she was told by
these Bishops they did it, and continued in the
Communion of it.</p>
            <p>(4.) Lastly; As to <hi>the Infallibility of the
Church.</hi> If this, as applied to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
could be any where found in Scripture, we
should then indeed be to blame not to submit
to all the Definitions of it. But where is this to
be found? Yes, <hi>Christ hath promised to be with
his Church to the end of the World.</hi> Not with his
<hi>Church,</hi> but with his <hi>Apostles:</hi> And if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to them, then <hi>the end of the World</hi> is no
more than <hi>always.</hi> But suppose it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the Successors of the Apostles; were
there none but at <hi>Rome?</hi> How comes this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be limited to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and the Bishops of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
all the other Eastern Churches (where the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
as certainly succeeded the Apostles, as at
<hi>Rome</hi> it self) not to enjoy the equal Benefit of
this Promise? But they who can find the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of the Church of</hi> Rome in Scripture, need
not despair of finding whatever they have a
Mind to there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100625:36"/>
But from this Promise she concludes, <hi>That
our Saviour would not permit the Church to give the
Laity the Communion in One kind, if it were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
so to do.</hi> Now in my Opinion, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is stronger the other way; The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> forbids the doing of that, which
Christ enjoyned; therefore it cannot be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
since the Command of Christ is so
much plainer than the Promise of Infallibility
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, from all these things laid together, I
can see no imaginable Reason of any force to
conclude, that <hi>she could not think it possible to
save her Soul otherwise,</hi> than by embracing the
Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
the Publick will receive this Advantage by
these Papers, that thereby it appears, how very
little is to be said by Persons of the greatest
Capacity, as well as Place, either against the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> or for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
