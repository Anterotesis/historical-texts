            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

priuiledges as to your wisedome should be most approueable; But such are the turbulent spirits of some men, that no curtesies can win faire correspondency, but as profest enemies to the ingenious search of worthy minded Gentlemen, proclaime warres against their indeuors, if they tend to merchandizing, thereby intermedling (as they terme it) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their secret mistery, although in their perticulars to begin such an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, they can no wayes paralell the meanest of your true experience and well grounded desigments, but it might have bin hop'd, that there would haue beene some better respect towards you, in regard of your persons, and not to deale in that nature as to euery ordinary Gentleman, or other by them imployed, by whose industry after the way is opened to any profitable businesse, and that hee hath made plaine the discouery, then

they doe find occasion to cauill and turne them off, and presently imploy seruants of their owne, many times very vnfitting, in regard they will not requite deserts, nor allow of any society in an apparant way of gaine: All which is indeuored towards you, for whilst you haue bin suffered to disburse your monies in the first discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and as it were beating and laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the way, where and how this Golden Trade should rise, you haue quietly past one, but now there can be no more euasions, but that the profit plainly appeares; what complaints have bin framd? what combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and plotting together?

world, shalbe perpetuall witnesse, spending therein (as he rightly termeth it) his talent for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries seruice, and being likewise incouraged by him, after he had seene and read my iournall breefly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting each dayes particular, in my trauailes, into this great and spacious Country: whereof by Gods grace I entend to write, laying as it were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande vpon me, not to conceale that, which by publishing may first tend, vnto the aduancement of Gods glory, and next vndoubtedly the honor, wealth, and preferment of our owne nation: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hauing beene still earnestly inuited by all sorts of people, and especially by some of worthy note, (as occasions haue fallen out at any time, whereby I haue beene drawne into discourse of these tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes) that I ought not, nor might not without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence leaue vnpublished, that which doth proffer so apparant hopes of so great a golden Trade, which at this time seemes so needfull, that by the generall complant of our great want, the earth hath shut vp her rich bowels toward vs in other places, the rather to enuite vs to seeke after that, which lies as it were vnder our noses, in respect of other trauailes, and hath beene lest as a concealed busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vntell our time of neede, that then it might be more effectually followed, and more seriously regarded: For apparant proofes whereof, first there is no Historian but will accord, that in all ancient Histories discoursing of the inward parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi> assurely alwayes called by the name of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> it hath beene noted for the golden region, in the whole conquests of <hi>Alexinder,</hi> as <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> sets it downe, lie onely had a great desire to
<pb facs="tcp:8205:6"/>
visit these parts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but neuer came there. The <hi>Romans</hi> likewise, carefull Relaters of their great victories, doe speake little of the interior parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi> their greatest entrance being in the wars of <hi>Iugurth,</hi> and in pursuite of him, onely mention is made, of a great desire they had to search the South parts, in regard they were thereunto inuited, by those rich and golden armes, they found those blacke people to come against them withall, where of so many golden shields, were carried to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City, in their so glorious triumphs, but in their discoueries they had no successe: Returning with the losse of most of their people, in regard as is alleaged, they met with diuerse drie and sandy deserts to passe, wherein as many were lost and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-whelmed, so againe the parching heate, and continuall droughth was cause of the perishing of many others, and inforced their returne, without any satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The selfe same causes continue still, for which we neede not search written bookes, but talke or discourse with any Marchant of this City of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who haue yearely trade and commerse in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> being the nearest parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi> adioyning vnto vs, and many times from our Country, into their principall Harbours, runne in twelue dayes, and in the like time againe, from them to vs, and inquire of them, whence the <hi>Moore</hi> of <hi>Barbary</hi> hath that rich gold, he makes his Chequens of, and they will tell you, there is no gold growing, within the confines of <hi>Morocco,</hi> or <hi>Fesse,</hi> at least that is knowne, or made vse of, but that the great aboundance of <note place="margin">The trade of the Moores in in Barbary for their gold.</note> that rich gold they haue, is fetcht and brought into
<pb facs="tcp:8205:7"/>
the Country, by the naturall inhabitants, for which they vndergo great trauailes, onely by land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do passe great desertes of sand, with much danger, as appeares by the losse they receiue many yeares, of diuerse both of their people, and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, yet so commodious is their trade, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with such great dilligence and gouernment, that amongst themselues, none are admitted but principall persons, and by especiall order, without entertaining any other nation, what respect or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity so euer, they haue gained amongst them.</p>
               <p>This in effect hath beene the sole ground, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto that knowledg, which I presume here to write for my Countries seruice, wherein duety es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially requires me, to manifest the care and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, of those noble and worthy Gentlemen, who are the grounds, and originals of this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke, vnto whom these my labours, as their owne proper rights are dedicated, whose vertues ayming at good actions, in this our blessed and peacefull time, and cessation from those sea affaires, they were wont to be bufied in summond them vp, to in quire and make search after the goldnest hopes, and vpon good grounded conferances with such principall Merchants of <hi>Barbary</hi> as their wisdomes could make choyse of, attaine some better satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to their former knowledge of the Moore of <hi>Barbarios</hi> Marchandizing, as I lightly haue toucht before, wherein their practise and true vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Mathematiques assured them, the Moors vnknowne trauaile must be to the South-west, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes our Quotidian trade, into all and euery part of the Mediterrane sea, must needes haue had

               <p>THIS Riuer, whereof I now take in hand, (by Gods grace) to write, is scituate in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 13 degrees and ½, by all or the most part of Mappes and Cardes, and by some called, by the name of <hi>Gambia,</hi> by others <hi>Gamba,</hi> and by another sort set downe <hi>Gambra,</hi> to which latter name being most frequent, I doe apply my selfe, for by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inhabitants, either belowe in the mouth of it, neither it aboue to the farthest I haue trauelled, being vpon the truest accompt I could keepe, some 320 leagues, or 960 miles, could I euer heare any proper name, but only the word <hi>Gee,</hi> which in their language, they vse to all riuers, and waters: It hath one sole entrance, which in the very mouth, is about some 4 leagues broad, and in the channell 3 fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome water, at the least, without any barre, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the setting of it formerly forth, where it is generally noted to haue a barre, and much sholer water then we haue found: After we are run some 4 leagues in, it doth spread it selfe, into so many riuers, bayes, and creekes, that for the space of some 30 leagues, vnto a Towne called <hi>Tauckro valley,</hi> it is so intricate, thar many months might be spent to search each particuler within that limit; but for that my occasion of writing, is grounded vpon the great hopes, and expectations, that are from aboue I entend not to make any stay there, but refer what is to be sayd, vntil I speake of the inhabitants, only, as I proceed to let you know, that the maine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, is not to be mistaken, except within the limit

aforesayde, and then also thorough great neglect, or rather some wilfull ignorance.</p>
               <p>Thus with a faire streame, this braue riuer shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in flowing from his mouth, into the land, neare vpon 200 leagues, vnto a Towne called <hi>Baraconda,</hi> or some little aboue, &amp; that is the vttermost bounds of his flowing, euen in the lowest season of the yeare: For as in all riuers, running into the sea, the increase of the inland waters, occasioned by raines, or snowes, doe abate of the seas in draught; so much more, in this great Riuer, who swels vpright 30 foote, obseruing one due time, and season of the yeare for euer, must the seas force in those swelling times, be mightely driuen backe; whereby a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge is attaind, which are the setled times, to be followed eamestly, to meete with no impediment, in passing vp, which impediment, is onely want of water to passe ouer flats, which in the lowest season of the yeare, in certaine places, are met withall, as is commonly seene, in all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, of such mighty inlets, which bankes as it were being past, presently a faire passable Riuer continues, for many leagues; and as we expect our seasons of Winter, and Sommer, so do these inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants these times of floods, occasioned by aboun dance of raine, which raines alwayes proceed forth of the South-east, and haue their beginnings, much sooner in the inland, then at the Riuers mouth, so as in those parts, where we haue had aboade, they begin to fall in the latter end of May, and at the <note place="margin">These are all more largly written of, where the til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the ground is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled.</note> Riuers mouth, not vntill the end of Iune: These raines continue very violent, for three moneths, comming downe with great winds, and very much

thunder, and lightniug, not perpetually, but as we say, in suddaine gustes, and stormes, the violence whereof being ouerpassed, the people continue their labour, as where I write of their manner of Tillage, is more largely set downe, as also a more free discription of these contagious times: The increase of the Riuer likewise, in the beginning of the yeare, before any raine is seene to fall where we aboade, did make it propable, that raine wasfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, within the land, before we tasted any, all which affirmes the great inlet of this hopefull Riuer, and giues an assurance, that it is passable, if times and seasons be obserued, and with dilligence followed, with boates, and vessels fitted accordingly, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in trauelling it already so farre, may some wayes warrant a sufficient director.</p>
               <p>Next to shew a continuance of this great streame, when we had rowed beyond the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and 12. dayes against the currant, which wee trauailed in the moneth of Ianuary, when the water was at the lowest of his nourishment, and then the shole we met withall, and stopped our further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, had 9. inches water, which shallownesse continued not aboue to yards, wherein if we had <note place="margin">We were 10 of our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that went vp in a shallop, and 4 Blacke that I hired to carry vp a Canoe.</note> beene an able company together, being onely 10. of vs, and likewise had had prouision of tooles wherewithall, and beene assured of a commodius trade, and so friendly a people to conuerse withall, as after we found, any encouragement would haue made vs worke a gut thorough that little distance, and being past that place, the riuer shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe againe, with faire promising, so farre as wee bad occasion to looke, neare a league, and how far

he might so continue, we are ignorant, and in those places aboue did we see sea-horses, whosenature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires deep waters, as where I write at large of him, you may better perceiue, likewise the higher still, more store of Crocodiles, which addes incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the largnesse of the Riuer; and likewise a faire breadth betweene the shores: I follow these probabilities, to encourage the farther search of the Riuer, which dilligently followed, may euen in one season, giue a full satisfaction to the forward Aduenturer, and if it so fall out, we can meete with any towne aboue, standing by the Riuer side, it will assuredly proue a commodious place, to make our aboade in, to take the aduantage of the seasonable times, and to make returnes, to, and againe, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience must leade, to the greatest aduantage. And for trade there is no question, but a maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous recourse would be vnto vs, which is already testified, in that so many hundreds of them came downe vnto vs, to the remote place where we were enforced to stay, building them houses of reads on both sides the shore, and the recourse still more, and more increasing, in so much as we had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the people were comming, from a great Towne called <hi>Iaye</hi> in their language, and wee doe conceaue it to be <hi>Gago,</hi> if wee had beene furnisht with commodities enough for them, and likewise knowne the seasonable times for our passage in the <note place="margin">These <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

lay downe, belikewise vpon the Riuer, if so, how great an aduantage, might it bring vnto vs, if wee were minded to stay there, when the Moore of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> come, for at this towne the Carauan from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> doth stay and abide, we know their whole trade is for gold, but what quantity they haue here, or what people it is, they trade withall, we are as yet ignorant, and this aduenture vp the riuer, would vndoubtedly discouer, that the gold is there, wee are assured of, hauing battered, and had trade for some, and vpon triall the same in goodnesse, that <hi>Barbary</hi> affords our Countries, hauing the riuer to friend, we should be able, though but few of vs, to defend our selues, from the rage of the <hi>Barbary</hi> Moore, if he should attempt any thing against vs, for vndoubtedly, when he shall see vs entered into his trade, he will appose what may be, to affront vs; And although I haue beene promised safe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by the country people, yet a boat is a certaine retreate, and the Riuer a constant friend, to trust vnto.</p>
               <p>Againe, what know we, whither the Riuer may bring vs within the confines of those people, who will not be seene, and are those to whom our salte doeth passe, of whom in the relation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in his place, as it followeth I write, and if it be as in all descriptions that are set out, it is layd downe, that the Riuer of <hi>Senega,</hi> and this Riuer do meete, yet cannot be in any probability, but a few dayes iourney, aboue the place, and heigh, we haue already beene at, must needes reach to it, and no doubt afterwards, that which affordes two such branches, must containe within himselfe, a faire

               <p>And lastly, if the inhabitants aboue, be enemies amongst themselues, as we see in the mouth of the Riuer, and heare likewise of them, what aduantage our force in the Riuer, may worke, will easily be considered, in regard they haue not the vse of any <note place="margin">The Country people haue no boates or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noos aboue the ebbing and flowing.</note> boates, aboue where it ebbes and flowes, so farre as we haue hetherunto beene, which is about 120. leagues, or 360. miles, which we were trauelling, as I haue sayd before, onely 12. dayes, wherein is to be vnderstood, we laboured not the whole day, but setting forward so soone as it was day light, we continned working vntill 9. or 10. of the clocke, <note place="margin">We laboured to get vp the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer onely 7. houres in 24.</note> resting the heate of the day, and againe from 3. vntil the euening shut in, and not at all in the night when it was coole, and conuenient, for auoyding of trees sunke, rockes, and sholes, which in the day time we could see, and haue now taken notice of, and perfectly writ downe, that vpon any second at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, we may be much bolder, and thereby aske lesser time for performance, how beit our returne downeward, for those 12. dayes trauaile, was in 6. and God be praised, both going, comming, and staying there, without sicknesse, or losse of any one man; Nay more (to our great comfort wee found) the higher we went, the more healthfull our bodies. And it is likely, if townes were found againe, neare <note place="margin">No townes neare the River side after wee past the ebbing and flowing.</note> the Riuer, they do so continue, for from <hi>Baraconda,</hi> whither the Riuer flowed, we neuer hard, nor saw

of any Towne, or plantation, nor recourse of any people vnto vs, but what we sent for, neither shew of any boate, onely some two, or three bundles of Palmeta leaues, we found bound vptogether, which our Blackes would tell vnto vs, some of the people had made shift to passe the riuer vpon, so as our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage then must needes afford more discouragement to the Actors, then any that can, (by Gods grace) happen hereafter, for we were discouraged, that the people aboue were of a bad condition, if we could passe vnto them, which the inhabitants held, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, in regard they did affirme, the riuer was full of trees suncke, and drifts, wee should meete withall, and our time in passing, being vncertaine, our prouision which was small, might faile vs, and poorely (God knowes) we were prouided of those materials, that would haue helpt to maintaine that principall, in respect the place, and way affordeth it; and what experience hereafter, can direct in that kind to doe, which being good comforts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers to the Aduenturer, I will not by any meanes leaue vnwritten.</p>
               <p>There is abounding in this Riuer, who are bred and liue therein, two sorts especiall, as I may terme them monstrous, the one deuouring as the people report, and the other daungerous, as I haue found: The deuouring is the <hi>Crocodile</hi> or <hi>Alegatha,</hi> because they carry one, and the same resemblance, but <note place="margin">The Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, whom the Country people call Bumbo.</note> doubtlesse, I am perswaded, there is no other Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, but such as wee haue seene in this Riuer, whom the people call by the name of <hi>Bumbo,</hi> sundry times when we haue driuen them from the shore, where they haue beene lying in the morning, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

forth of the water, when wee haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the print they leaue behind them, vpon the foft sand, we haue found by measure of rule, his whole length, from the point of his nose, to the end of his tayle, containe thirty three foote; The people of the Country, stand in such dread of these, that they dare not wash their hands in the great Riuer, much lesse, offer to swimme, or wade therein, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">How the people do feare him.</note> vnto vs many lamentable stories, how many of their friends, and acquaintance haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by them: neither do they at any time bring any of their Cattle, to passe the Riuer, as within ebbing, and flowing, they haue diuerse occasions to doe, but with great dread, and ceremony: for at all Townes within that compasse, they haue small boats, which we call Canoos, to ferry ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which cannot receiue a liue beefe, onely some fiue or sixe of the people: but when they passe a beefe ouer, he is led into the water, with a rope to his hornes, whereby one holds him close to the boate, and another taking vp his tayle, holds in the like manner; the Priest, or Mary-bucke, stands ouer the middle of the beast, praying and spitting vpon him, according to their ceremonies, charming the Crocodile, and another againe by him, with his bow and arrowes ready drawne, to expect when the <note place="margin">The manner they passe their cattle ouer the Riuer, for foare of Bumbo.</note> Crocodile will ceaze, and in this manner, if there be twenty at a time, the passe them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neuer thinking them safe, vntill they be on the toppe of the Riuer bancke: One thing more, to shew the feare they haue of him, when I was going in my discouery vp the Riuer; hauing as I sayde, onely nine of our owne people with me, I did hire

Blacke-men, as I had occasion to vse them, to serue as Interpreters, likewise to send abroade, and to helpe to row, and get vp the boate, so that when I came to passe the flowing, and to goe all against the currant, I did furnish my selfe, of foure able Black-men: the first place we found a stiffe gut to resist vs, the water being not aboue foure foote deepe, for speedier and more easier passing our men went into the water, and laying hands, some one the one side of the boate, and some likewise on the other, waded along, and led her through, which we found a good refreshing; the Riuer being sweete and cleare, was comfortable in the heate, by no meanes I could not make any of my blacke people, go out of the boate, denying flatly to go into the water, saying that <hi>Bumbo</hi> would haue them; after some <note place="margin">The Blackes would not goe into the Riuer.</note> two of these ages, there was another streight, where was a necessity of more hands, so that striping my selfe, I leapt into the water, the Blackes seeing me prepare, seeme much to diswade me, but when they saw me in the water, they presently consulting together, stript themselues, and came likewise in, the businesse ended, and we all aboord againe, I askt of them the cause made them come in, hauing so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly denied it before, they made answere, they had considered amongst themselues, the white man, <note place="margin">Their answere when they went in.</note> shine more in the water, then they did, and therefore it <hi>Bumbo</hi> come, hee would surely take vs first, so that after they neuer refused to go in, yet in all our whole passage, did we neuer receiue any assult, but to the contrary, where we haue seene great companies of them, lying vpon the sands, they haue perpetually auoyded vs, with the same

He is in fashion of body, a compleate horse, as round buttock'd as a horse of seruice, and in his whole body answerable: his head like vnto a horse with short eares, but palpably appearing which he wags, and stirres, as he shewes himselfe, onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his mouth, he growes broade downe like a Bull, and hath two teeth standing right before vpon his lower choppe, which are great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in regard he strikes with them: his crye, or neighing, directly like a great horse, and hath in the same manner foure legges, answerable to his body, whereupon hee goes, and wherewith hee likewise swimmeth, as a horse doeth, yet in these is his greatest difference, for they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what shorter in proportion, then horses are, and where they should be round hoofte, it deuides it selfe into fiue pawes, vpon euery which hee hath a hoofe, the whole foote, containing a compasse of great breadth, as the beast is in growth, insomuch as I haue taken the measure of some prints they leaue, where they walke, of twenty ynches ouer: His manner of feeding likewise, resembles the horse, for although he liue

all day in the Riuer, yet euery night hee goeth duely on shore, in diuers places feeding vpon their Rice, and Corne, doing the Country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple much spoyle, but his generall feeding, is vpon low marish grounds, where the grasse or sedge is <note place="margin">The sea-horse feedes in the night vpon the shore.</note> greene, to which they resort in great companies, &amp; in those reaches of the Riuer, which haue deepest water, and lie nearest, and conuenienst, to such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grounds, do wee alwayes finde greatest store: in some places, they go a mile from the shore side to their feede, hauing trackes that are beaten as hard and palpable, as London high way; he returnes by the breake of day to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, where he is very bold, when our boates come by, hee will hold his head aboue the water, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times store of them together, and so neare as within Pistolls shot, snorting, neighing, and tossing the water, making shewes of great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and sometimes attempting it, for in my passage too and againe in the Riuer, my boate was stricken by them three times, and one of the blowes was very daungerous, for he stroke his tooth quite through, which I was enforced, <note place="margin">A daungerous blow, by a sea-horse.</note> with a great deale of dilligence to stoppe, or it had daungered our sinking; but the hazard of them may be well auoyded, if men be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to shoote at them, when they presse ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold, which wee could not do, in regard out allowance of powder was small, and we were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to put it to other vses, neither had wee <note place="margin">A neglect to be hereafter, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prouided for.</note> peeces accordingly, thorough the neglect of some ill wishing persons, who deceiue

               <p>Hauing spoken of these, I now returne to matter of sustenance, which the Riuer affordeth, there is variety of good fish, among which great store of Mullet, if men haue nets, and prouision to take

               <p>Amongst the rest, one time hauing made a draught, we had not such plenty as vsually, onely some fish, in the cod of the net, which being taken vp, were shakt into a basket standing in the boate, with which we rowed aboord, &amp; the basket being handed in as the custome is, the fish were powred vpon the Decke, whereof many rude Saylers will be their owne caruers, amongst which fish, there was one, much like vnto our English breame, but of a great thicknes, which one of the Saylers thinking for his turne, thought to take away, putting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>In the vpper part of the Riuer, there are store of fish, and more conueniently to be come by, if men go prouided.

each pinion of his wing, a sharpe spur, in euery point resembling a Cockes spurre of the largest size, with which they are apt, not being shot dead, to giue offence: but for foule that liue naturally by the shore side, as Hernes, Corlews, Storkes, Pluffer and the like, it doth yeeld plenty, so that whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall go vp well furnished of peeces, and powder, shalbe sure to mend their fare, and light vpon many a dainty dish.</p>
               <p>The people of the Country haue likewise diuers wares, which they make vse of in the time of raines, and when the Riuer is ouer-floude, at which times, they kill much fish; and they haue also, a strange maner of fishing, in their lakes and ponds, of which there are many that are very broade, and containe much circute, but are not deepe, to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort <note place="margin">The manner of the peoples fishing.</note> as they desire to fish, a whole towne or planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together, only the men, euery one hauing a kind of basket, with the mouth open, which hee holds downeward, and so going into the water, close on by another, they ouer spread the pond, whereby the fish is moued; and so clapping downe the mouth of their baskets before them, they hit vpon the fish, and in this manner they take so many that most of them go loaden home, and if at any time we be neare those places, they will louingly impart them to vs, vpon returnes from vs of poore valew: These things which now we know, and can tell how to prouide for, may serue as incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to proceede vpon a farther discouery, but in that which followes, concerning the loue of the people, what trade we already haue found, and what reliefe they bring vs, and at what rates, as

many times, when he knowes the other out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to speake many disdainfull words against him: And of these people the Country is very full, being disperst and spread in such manner of families, as I sayd before, ouer the whole Country; and higher vp in the Country, as we here, and I shall shew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, they are in on part principall, and haue exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Blackes, holding domination amongst themselues, and for the most part continually in warre. The language the <hi>Fulbie</hi> speakes, is different from the black-men, the women are our chiefest customers, for in most places, within the ebbing and flowing, where we did lie for Trade, we should be sure to haue their custome euery day, which was to bring vs new milke, sowre milke, and curdes, and two sorts of butter, the one new and white, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard and of an excellent colour, which we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led refined butter, and is without question, but for a little freshnes, as good as any we haue at home: all which they brought vnto vs, in great and small gourds like dishes, made vp very handsomely, and one thing let me not forget to giue them due praise in, that in what someuer you receiued from them, you should haue it so neate and cleane that in your milke you shold not perceiue a mote, nor in her but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any vncleanlines nay the gourds, ordishes, they <note place="margin">The cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the Fulby women.</note> brought it in, on the very outsides would shine with cleanlinesse, and one the inward parts, without any nastinesse, and if at any time, by any mischance, there had beene a mote, or haire, which you had shewed vnto her, she would haue seemed to blush, in defence of her cleanely meaning.</p>
               <p>In noting of which, I haue diuerse times sayd,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8205:23"/>
there was great difference betweene them, and the Irish Calios, although their manner of liues had great resemblance in following of their Cattle, and as they were out of heart in one ground, to remooue whole Townes together, which but few yeares since was the Irish Kernes true course of life; but-with cleanlinesse your Irish woman hath no acquaintance, and therefore I returne backe to my Tawny <hi>Fulbie:</hi> the commodities shee askt for were small beades, and poore knifes of 16 <abbr>d</abbr> a dozen, with other trifling things, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they once saw and vasted of salt, which in their language they called <hi>Ram-Dam,</hi> there was no other thing could so well please them, although it were neuer so little; we found the variety of these things many times agreeable to our natures, and therefore gaue faire recourse vnto the people, for if we denide but one day to buy of them, we should want their company a weeke after, what earnest occasion som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we had to vse them; and these things were to be had from none but them, because the <hi>Maudin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> or Blacke-man applies himselfe, at no time, in keeping or preseruing of Cattle, but leaues it to this painefull <hi>Fulby,</hi> whom I likewise leaue looking to his Heards, and come to the commanding Blacke.</p>

temper well themselues, might the better gouerne the rest, whose ill carriages may be thought to bee great prouokers for shortning other mens dayes: I will example it in this last voyage of ours. The Maister was a man knowne, for an excellent Arts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but in the gouernement of himselfe, so farre from knowledge, that after our passage from <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> which was in October, vntill the middle of March after, about which time he dyed, it will be iustified, he was neuer twenty dayes sober, in which time he went not alone, but our Chirurgion, with sundry other officers that were of his societie, with their liues payed for their riotous order. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas wee were diuided into two shallops, to goe vp the Riuer, the bigger whereof, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Factor was to follow his trade in, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore in the same a Butte of Sacke, and a Hogges-head of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> making choice of such men as were the most able, and likeliest bodies to hold out, and he in himselfe carefull enough, as his experience might well aduise him, hauing spent many yeares, and made many voyages vpon that continent, to obserue both his diet of eating and drinking; yet towards his people, hee carried at sometimes, such an ouer-sparing hand, that they fell to practising how they might deceiue him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vse of all aduantages, to steale those hot drinkes from him, which being purchased, as it were from his niggardly nature, they would diuide as a spoyle with great greedinesse amongest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and thereby wrought their owne confusions, that of those people he carried with him, they ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died before hee came backe to the shippe, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8205:25"/>
shortly after, some two at the most excepted, who escaped with dangerous sickenesse, whereas to the contrary (with thankefulnesse to God be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) my selfe going vp in the other shallop, and wherein I must take such men as were giuen me, not such as I desired, obseruing amongst our selues, a louing and orderly course of diet, wherein euerie man had his equall share, notwithstanding I went one hundred and fortie leagues aboue the other shallop, returned without the losse of any one man; nay, in all my going to the highest, and in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Pinnace, I neuer had any man sicke, but vpon a second returne vp some part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, some of my olde men being changed, two or three fell sicke, howbeit (with comfort be it spoken) there was not one man died that went with mee, and for my owne part, through the whole voyage, I was neuer one quarter of an houre sicke (blessed be the name of God.)</p>
               <p>Now for my opinion concerning our diet, I hold well with the Blacks, that to feed at noone, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holesome thing, for that the Sunne, being then in his extremitie of heate, and by his neerenes hauing such power ouer vs, the moisture that lies within the body, is exhaled to the exterior parts, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note place="margin">The Writers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dyet.</note> and refresh that, which the heate doth drie, and then are the interior parts most cold, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for nutriment, wherein experience makes vs see, that in the height and heate of the day we can with great facilitie, and without offence, drinke off such a draught, or quantitie of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or hot waters, as if we should drinke heere in our natiue countrey at one time, would certainely burne out our harts;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8205:26"/>
nay more, wee finde our bodies naturally desiring, and longing for the same, (wherein I might heere <note place="margin">The Cauneat must be lookt carefully to, in the setting forth.</note> shew some reason, partly to blame a neglect in our owne prouisions, but that I assure my selfe, it hath beene rather ignorance, to know what was good, then want of wil to prouide it) whereas in the coole of the morning, and againe in the euening, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with much more temperance, and a little gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth satisfaction, so that my conclusion is, that to vs that haue able, and working bodies, and in our occasions are stirring, and labouring in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earely, and after the heate of the day, are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test &amp; conuenientst times to receiue our sustenance, wherin I shal euer submit my selfe to those of more able iudgement; and returning to the Blackes, let you know, that their vsuall and ordinary drinke, is, either the Riuer water, or from some Spring, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they haue growne from trees, seuerall sorts of wine, or drinkes, as also the making of a kinde of liquor they call <hi>Bullo,</hi> made and compounded of their countrey corne; whereof more conueniently else-where I shall effectually satisfie you: and now goe on to shew you, the manner of their building, and fortifications.</p>
               <p>They place themselues in their habitations round together, and for the most part haue a wall, though it be but of Reede, platted and made vp together, some sixe foot in height, circling and going round their Towne, with doores of the same, in the night time to be orderly shut, some of the houses within their walles, likewise are made of the same Reedes; <note place="margin">The manner of their building:</note> but the better sort do build the walles of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of loame, which after it is tempered, and layde
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8205:26"/>
vp together, carrieth a kinde of red colour with it, and doth remayne with an extraordinary hardnesse, that doubtlesse (as I haue carefully diuers times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued) it would make the most excellent and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablest Bricke in the world, the whole countrey, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept vpon the mountains, yeelding the same earth, whereof I will not forget to report one thing, which (in my opinion) deserues admiration: we doe finde in most places, hills cast vp by Ants or Emmets, which we heere call Ant-hills, some of them twenty foote of height, of such compasses, as will hold or <note place="margin">Strange Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils.</note> containe a dozen men, which with the heate of the Sunne is growne to that hardnesse, as wee doe vse to hide and conceale our selues in the ragged tops of them, when wee take vp stands, to shoote at the country deere, or any other manner of wilde beast; the forme of their houses, whether it be loame, or Reed, is alwayes round, and the round roofes made lowe, euer couered with reedes, and tyed fast to raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they may be able to abide, and lie fast, in the outragious windes and gusts, that come in the times of raine; for which purpose also they build their houses round, that the winde may haue the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser force against them; and the walles enclosing and keeping them in, is to auoyde those rauening and deuouring beasts, which in the night time range and bustle about, wherewith diuers times notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they are much affrighted, and by making fires, and raising cries at midnight, to chase and driue them from their mansion dwellings. This for the meaner Townes or countrey Villages, but they haue likewise Townes of force, according vnto the manner of warre, they vse amongst them, fortified,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8205:27"/>
and trencht in, after a strong and defencible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whereof (they say) the countrey within is full, especially where the Kings are seated, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whereof wee haue seene in some two or three places, whereof I will instance onely one: which is the Towne of <hi>Cassan,</hi> against which (as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the shippe which was betrayed did ride, and we in our last voyage, did make it our highest port for our bigger shippe. This Towne is the Kings seate, and by the name of the Towne hee holdes his title, King of <hi>Cassan;</hi> It is seated vpon the Riuers side, and inclosed round neare to the houses, with hurdles, such as our shepheards vse, but they are <note place="margin">The towne of <hi>Cassan</hi> with the manner of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</note> aboue ten foot high, and fastned to strong and able poles, the toppes whereof remaine aboue the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; on the inside in diuers places, they haue rooms, and buildings, made vp like Turrets, from whence they within may shoot their arrowes, and throw their darts ouer the wall, against their approaching enemies; on the out-side likewise, round the wall, they haue cast a ditch or trench, of a great breadth, &amp; beyond that againe a pretty distance, the whole Towne is circled with posts and peeces of trees, set close and fast into the ground, some fiue foot high, so thicke, that except in stiles, or places made of purpose, a single man cannot get through, and in the like manner, a small distance off againe, the like defence, and this is as they do signifie vnto vs, to keepe off the force of horse, to which purpose, it seemes to be very strong and auaileable; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what armes and Weapons they haue in vse, which in this place is necessary to be knowne.</p>
               <p>They doe vsually walke, with a Staffe or Iauelin
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8205:27"/>
in their hands, which they call an <hi>Assegie,</hi> being a Reede of some sixe foote long, the head whereof is an Iron pike, much like our Iauelines, but most of them very artificially made, and full of danger; others they haue also made, to throw like Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens darts, with heads all barbed, full of crueltie to the receiuer: each man likewise, about his necke <note place="margin">The armes or weapons the people haue in vse.</note> doth weare, in a Bandeleere of red or yellow cloth, a short Sword of some two foot long, with an open handle, which Swords they make of the Iron is brought vnto them, as you shall heare when I speak of their Trades, and also the better sort of them, doe carry their bowe in their hands, and at their backe a case, very artificially made, which may hold within it some twenty foure of their arrowes, it is the smallest arrow vsed by any Nation, made of a Reed, about the bignesse of a Swans quill, and some two foote in length, there is fastned in the end, a small Iron with a barbed head, all which Iron is dangerously poisoned; the arrow hath neither nock nor feather, but is shot from the bowe, which is also made of a Reede, by a flat string, or rather sticke smoothed and made euen, and fastned to the bow, so that the bowe and the string, are one and the selfe-same wood, whose force is small, and therefore the offence lies in the poyson, which neare hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their cotten garments, may make an entry, but to a Buffe Ierkin, or any other sleight garment of defence, except it be very neare, can be little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue: we haue seene of them likewise on horse backe, the horses being of a small stature, bridled and sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the Spanish fashion, each man hauing his <hi>Assegie</hi> in his hand, and vpon the right side of his

horse a broad Buckler hanging; and this is all the weapon in vse amongst them.</p>
               <p>The Kings house is in the middle of the Towne, inclosed by it selfe, onely his wiues seuerall houses about him, to which you cannot come, but as it were through a Court of Guard, passing through an open house, where stands his chaire empty, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for any but himselfe to sit in, by which hangs his drummes, the onely instruments of warre which we see amongst them, neither are these drummes without dayly imployment, for this is their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall custome euery night after it seemes they haue filled their bellies, they repaire to this Court of Guard, making fires both in the middle of the house, and in the open yard, about which they doe continue drumming, hooping, singing, and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hethenish noyse, most commonly vntill the day beginnes to breake, when as we conceiue dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepes take them, by which meanes sleeping one <note place="margin">The inhabitans custome in the night.</note> part of the day, it makes the other part seeme shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vntill the time of feeding come againe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is done to that purpose in the night, to feare and keepe away the Lyons, and rauening beasts from about their dwellings, who are at that season ranging and looking out; for this manner of course is held amongst them, not only in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Townes, but also in euery particular village, and habitation, whereof sew of them is without such poore drums they vse, and if they be, yet they continue the custome, through hooping, singing, and vsing their voyces, but when it happens mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slcke is amongst them, then is the horrible din, as I shall signifie when I ouertake their fidlers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:8205:28"/>But first I am to meddle with matter of state, and acquaint you concerning their Kings, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, for so I haue promist, the better to bring my worke together: In following of which, I shall entreate your patience to obserue with me, that the better to distinguish of their gouernments, I must deuide the Country by the Riuer, that how soeuer the Riuer trends, which in his windings is surely all points of the compasse, I shall alwayes call that part, which lies to the southward in our intrance, the southside, and the other the northside, of both which sides, although we haue seene diuers petty Kings, and other Commanders, to whom we payd a kind of poore custome, which in the mouth of the Riuer, where the <hi>Portingall</hi> hath vsed, is not onely greater, but perremptorily demaunded, whereas aboue it is lesse, and rather taken as a curtesie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, which morall kindnesse requires all stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, comming in the way of amity, to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to a principall person, then any manner of cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, that is (as we say) exacted, but how someuer both below and especially aboue, it is of that poore quantity, it hardly deserues the paines of so long a rehersall, whereby you may be drawne to conceit of a greater valuation: Those petty Kings I say, where of I both saw, had conference, and did eate and drinke within sixe seuerall places, who had the title of <hi>Mansa,</hi> which in their language, is the proper name for the King, haue all reference to their greater Kings, who line farther from those places; on the southside, the whole Country <note place="margin">The great King of <hi>Cantore</hi>

related, they being for the most part bare-head, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bedecked or hang'd ouer with gregories, as they <note place="margin">The manner of their apparrell.</note> are likewise ouer their bodies, legges, and armes, which word I will presently expound vnto you, but first tell you their onely garments are a shirt, and a paire of breeches, their shirts made downe to their knees, wide in manner of a Sirplace, and with great sleaues, the which when he commeth to vse his bowe or armes, he rowleth vp and it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fast at the shoulder, his breeches are made with so much stuffe gathered iust on his buttockes, that he seemeth to carry a cushion, and after a manner makes him stradle as he goes, bare-legged, and without shooes, except it be some few of them, who haue a peece of leather vnder their foot, cut like a shooe-sole, butned about the great toe, and againe about the instoppe. The Gregories bee things of great esteeme amongst them, for the most part they are made of leather of seuerall fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wounderous neatly, they are hollow, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them is placed, and sowed vp close, certaine writings, or spels which they receiue from their Mary-buckes, whereof they conceiue such a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous respect, that they do confidently beleeue no hurt can betide them, whilst these Gregories are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and it seemes to encrease their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition; the Mary-buckes do deuide these blessings for euery seuerall and particular part, for vppon their heads they weare them, in manner of <note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Gregories, which are tharmes they receiue from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-buckes.</note> a crosse, aswell from the fore-head to the necke, as from one eare to another, likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neckes, and crosse both shoulders about their bodies, round their middles, great

               <p>To countenance his state, he hath many times two of his wiues sitting by him, supporting his body, and laying their hands vpon his naked skin, aboue the wast, stroking, and gently pulling the same, wherein he seemes to receiue content, and because I haue named two of his wiues, before I proceed to any thing else, I will acquaint you with the manner of their women, the multiplicity of <note place="margin">The number of their wiues.</note> their wiues, and the wonderfull great subiection they liue vnder. The King hath an orderly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of seuen women, which are called wiues; that is which are esteemed, and acknowledged, and with a setled ceremony amongst them, distinguisht from other women which he hath vse of, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely tied, to attend his only pleasure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8205:31"/>
in relating of them according to our proper phrase, can giue them no other title but wife, of which it seemes he cannot exceede the number of seuen: for he hath the vse of other women, who are not of that esteeme, but rather as we may terme them Concubines, who are of a lower birth then his wiues, and these likewise are tyed vnto him, but <note place="margin">Allowance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women for necessitie sake.</note> not with that manner of strictnes the other are, so as it may appeare, they are rather taken for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then that it is a setled course amongst them, which word necessity I must better explaine, and therefore tell you, that it may and doth diuerse times fall out, that of his seuen wiues he hath none to accompany him in the nature of a wife; For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly these people originally sprung from the race of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ham,</hi> who discouered his father <hi>Noahs</hi> secrets, for which <hi>Noah</hi> awakeing cursed <hi>Canaan</hi> as our holy Scripture testifieth, the curse as by Scholemen hath beene disputed, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his ensuing race, in laying hold vpon the same place, where the originall cause began, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of these people are witnesse, who are furnisht with such members as are after a sort burthensome vnto them, whereby their women being once conceiued <note place="margin">The reason of that necessity.</note> with child, so soone as it is perfectly discerned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the man no longer, because he shall not destroy what is conceiued to the losse of that, and danger of the bearer neither vntil she hath brought vp the child, to a full and fitting time to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which euery woman doth to her owne childe is she allowed, in that nature, the mans society, so that many times it falles out, he hath not a wife to lie withall, and therefore as I said, bath allowance of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8205:31"/>
other women, for necessities sake, which may seeme not ouer-strange vnto vs, in that our holy Writ doth make mention therof, as you may reade in the 23. chap. of the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where lerusalem and Samaria, being called by the names of the two Sisters, <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>Aholibah,</hi> being charged with fornication, are in the twentie verse of the same chapter, said to doate vpon those people, whose members were as the members of Asles, and whose issue was like the issue of horses, therein right and amply explaining these people.</p>
               <p>And for the chastitie of the wife, their lawes and customes are in that kinde very seuere, for, being <note place="margin">Strict punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity.</note> taken or found an offendor, both she and the man shee shall offend withall, are without redemption sold away, in this sort they punish all great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, putting none at all to death, and such as these are the people the <hi>Portingalls</hi> buy, and ttansport for the west <hi>Indies,</hi> as before I shewed you; and this is the course held amongst them all, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <note place="margin">The men buy then wiues.</note> euery man cannot haue so many wiues, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath means to keep them, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to buy them: for first, euery man must compound or haue the Kings or chiese Couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors consent, for any wife or wiues he shall take, to whom he must giue some gratification; and next he doth buy, with some commoditie, the woman of <note place="margin">The widdowes buy their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> herfriends, and what hee giueth, doth remayne as we say in banke, if he should die, which shee hath for her better maintenance, or if shee please to buy a husband; for as euery man when he takes a maid, must buy her, so euery widdow, if shee will haue a husband, must buy him, through which occasion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8205:32"/>
of buying the women, may be coniectured, they yeeld themselues to that subiection, but whence soeuer it growes, I am sure there is no woman can be vnder more seruitude; for first they doe in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with such great staues wee call Coole-staues, <note place="margin">The subiection of the women.</note> beate and cleanse both the Rice, and all manner of other graine they eate, which is onely womens worke, and very painefull: next, they dresse both that and all other manner of victuall the men do eeate; and when it is so ordered, they do bring and set it downe vpon the Matte before them, presently withdrawing themselues, and are neuer admitted to sit and eate with them; nay I can confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that notwithstanding I haue eaten sundry times, both at the Kings, and other mens houses, where the men and wee haue put our hands in a gourd and fed together, yet neuer could I see any woman allowed to eate, albeit I haue earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the same, for amongst their many wiues, there is none of them, but haue one especially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, which hath a greater priuiledge by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him, and more conuersant then the rest, which by vs (though strangers) is easily discerned, and therefore amongst vs we call her his hand wife, to whom wee vse alwayes to be more free, in those <note place="margin">No outward daliance seene amongst them.</note> gifts we bestow, yet this wife is not allowed to eate in sight, but in another house, although she be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged of many other labours: neither are the men euer scene to vse any manner of familiar dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, insomuch as I thinke, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">A strange report.</note> any Englishman can say, he euer saw the Blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kisse a woman.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8205:32"/>
many of them of an equalitie liuing together, it is neuer heard, that they doe brawle, or scold, or fall out among themselues, how beit it may be thought in matter that neare concernes them, they cannot chuse but haue many aggreeuances, contrary to our English prouerb that sayes, <hi>Two women in one house, &amp;c.</hi> but there indeede I will make answer, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue recourse all day together, in his great or more spacious haunt, yet for the night e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery woman hath a seuerall house, whether she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires herselfe, to giue attendance as his desires shall leade him: and as they appeare before him, in the morning, their salutations are vppon their knees, laying their hands vpon his thigh. And lastly, for her apparrell, it is loose clothes party-coloured, blew and white, of the same cotton stuffe the men weare, whereof the women commonly we are but one tuckt about their middles, and from the waste vpward, bare, in regard they are, for the most part, wrought, or rather printéd vpon the backe, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the higher parts we were at, insomuch as we haue scene some of them, with workes all ouer <note place="margin">The womens clothing.</note> their backes, resembling right the printed lids and couers which wee see layd and set vppon our baked meates: whereof it appeares they take extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pride, because they will turne themselues, wee should take notice of it, and be very well pleased, wee should touch or handle it, as a matter to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed or set by; otherwise they cast another like cloth as they weare below, vppon their shoulders, which hangeth loose, and those be their garments, and without question, many, or the most part of them, very chary or nice in shewing of their secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;

and to conclude, concerning women which the country vse they serue in marriages: the man doth commonly bespeake the woman vvhile she is young, and not of abilitie, vvhich is done and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <note place="margin">The manner of taking away their wines, which in some sort is vsed in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this day.</note> by the friends consent, yet vvhen the time of her full age is come, or aftervvards, as they agree amongst them, the man getting his friends, which are all the youth; and younger sort of men hee can procure come to the Towne where the Maide is dwelling, in the beginning of the night, when the Moone shines, and as it were by violence lift her vp amongst them, and carry her avvay, vvho makes a noyse, skriking, and crying out, which is seconded by the other young maides of the place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">The modesty of a new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman</note> the younger sort of men that are dvvellers in the place gather themselues together, and (as it were) in reskew of her, vvhile the other with great shouts and cries of reioycing, carry her quite away, to his place of abode, vvhere she remaines vnseene for a certaine time, and vvhen shee doth come first forth, for certaine Moones, she doth not shew her open face, but with a cloth cast ouer her head, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers all but one eye, after the maner of the Spanish vaile, obseruing herein a shamefast modestie, not to be looked for, among such a kinde of blacke or <note place="margin">These people stand much vpon their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> barbarous people.</p>

And the Kings sonne also performed his word, for in the morning he came to the Riuers side, and called for a boate to passe ouer, bringing a liue biefe with him, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto me from his father, as he was many times accustomed to send, and there came likewise with him diuerse people, and all with armes. I was very doubtfull some hurt would arise, and laboured <hi>Boo Iohn</hi> to goe away: but all I could gaine of him, was, he would only sit downe in our yard, vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of our houses, with his people about him, and if no wrong were offered him, hee would not stirre nor giue no offence; and by meanes I wrought so with the Kings sonne, carrying him and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie into my house, and vsing them curteously, that for that time I pacified them, and they parted quietly, howbeit not without threatning vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

               <p>The King of <hi>Cassan,</hi> who was dwelling in the Towne, as wee came vp the Riuer, with whom I spake, drunke two or three bottles of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and had much familiar conference, who had liued in that place many yeares, howbeit hee was a lame man; after we returned downe the Riuer, and made stay at that Towne we found him nothing so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inclined, as he was at our going vp: whereupon demanding among some of the rest the reason, they told vs, hee was to be put out of his kingdome; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <note place="margin">The deposing of Kings.</note> wherefore, they replied, there was another to come who had more right then hee, for sayd they, this was the Kings sonne, but begotten of a base woman, such as I described their concubines to be: howbeit the King left behinde him a sonne, who was right borne, but very young, which childe being now come to yeares, craues his rightfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the King of <hi>Bursall,</hi> vnder whom they hold, they could not deny, but had taken order to send him forward, so as he was lookd for euery day, and indeed, the second day after I was gone from the Towne, he came thither, bringing abundance of people with him, to whom the people of the Town resorted, leauing the old King, to whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the yong King sent, willing him to depart, and goe away with his wiues and family before he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8205:35"/>
came, or if he<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> found him there, hee should suffer death, which at the first he refused to doe, saying he would enclose himselfe in his dwelling, and die ther: but vpon better aduice, when he savv himselfe quite forsaken, he passed himselfe and wiues crosse the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and left the Tovvne to this yong Commander, who after his entrance, our pinnace riding there, and being ready to come away, he sent for the Factor, to whom after some familiar conference, hee sayd, this tovvne and kingdome hath been lost, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you shall see it found againe, promising at all occasions his friendly assistance.</p>
               <p>But before I leaue them, it were necessary I should acquaint you, vvhat manner of ceremony doth passe betvvixt them and vs as we meet together; the King is commonly sitting on his mat, laid on the ground, vvhich in our entrance he obserueth, not offring to rise; and in regard he hath nothing but his Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on his head, vvhich are fast and cannot stirre, We do not vse to mooue our hatts, or vncouer our heads vvhen vve come to him, but dravving neare, <note place="margin">The ceremony vsed betwixt the King and vs, when first we meet.</note> somevvhat bending our bodies, vvee lay our bands vpon our breasts, vvhich he also performs to vs, and vvhen vve come neare, he holding foorth his hand, vve first take hold on the vpper part of one anothers hand, next on the lovver part, and the third time ioyne palmes, and with a full hand shaking one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, downe wee sit by him, and after some small parlee concerning the cause of our coming, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the kings part is performed in state, whatsoeuer he speakes being related ouer by another: out goes our bottle of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> which must not be wanting, and a botle of Sacke too, it is so much the better, &amp;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8205:35"/>
calling for a small gourd to drinke in, which is their richest Plate; I first beginne, and drinking off a cup, present both the cup and bottle vnto the king, the botle he deliuers presently to some one of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall regard with him, who by his appoyntment, after the king hath first drunke, and he himselfe not failing of his next turne, distributes it to the whole attendance, who for the most part stand round by the wall of the house, one after another taking his cup, and then to the king againe. In their drinking I obserue one thing, that in regard of the goodnesse or the strangenesse of the liquor, when he receiueth <note place="margin">He giues his chiefe Gregory drinke first.</note> the first cup, before hee drinke himselfe, with the same liquor, he wets one of his principal Gregories: The king many times calling for a cup, breakes the square, otherwise they neuer leaue vntill the bottle is out, and so all the bottles we bring, wherein we haue one priuiledge, for after we haue tasted the first cup, which must be of euery botle to secure them of danger; we need not vnles we please, take any more, <note place="margin">Their women not allowed to drinke in publike, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they loue it well.</note> but shaking of our heads when they offer a cup, it stands for a faire refusall, and so passeth to another; neither doe they suffer their women publiquely to drinke amongst them, except some especially respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, who may sometimes haue a cup, but euen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it among themselues, so long as the bottle will run, and their brains hold out, which being the true and proper element, they delight in, I will heere in in their hearts desires leaue them, and proceed to a more ciuill; I am sure soberer sort of people.</p>

               <p>Being entered the Towne, and come vnto his house, I found without many people, demaunding <note place="margin">Both Priest &amp; people weare one manner of apparrell.</note> of him what they were, he told me they were all as he was, Mary-buckes: for by their habite they are not to be discerned, being all clothed in one and the same manner, as the common people are: I was intreated to sit downe vnder their open shades, which are made by the better sort of people, on the out-side of their houses, to take the ayre in; and in the meane time my <hi>Alchade,</hi> for by that name my hired Mary-bucke was called, went into his house, and in my name presented my present, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting of him that I was the Captaine, and Commander of our people, whereupon he caused himselfe to be lifted vp from his bed, or mat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he lay, sitting on the side whereof, supported and helde vp by three of his wiues, he sent out to haue me brought vnto him, and after our salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons past, he held me fast by the hand, giuing me many thankes, for that great present he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, bemoneing much his sicknesse hindered him, he could not accompany me, thereby to shew his respect vnto me, during our conference he caused <note place="margin">The chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-bucke, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously sicke.</note> a dinner to be made ready: I did conceite him to be daungerously sicke, for his hand wherewith hee held me, did burne with that extremity, as the heat

houses, did not containe any great thicknesse, but as we may say, the breedth of a reasonable faire street, ioyning their houses or walles of their yards and barnes close together, the diameter whereof, that is from the North, to the South, or likewise from any one point to his opposite, we did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to be neere an English mile, within which Circute was much Cartle, especially store of Asses, whereby it may be coniectured, that they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their towne in that sort, to keep out the raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beasts, and securing those Cattle they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, whereof at this place they had the greatest vse, I meane of their Asses, as I will relate vnto you, but first I must take leaue of the high Priest: after I had satisfied my selfe in looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, I returned vn o him into his house, where I found him layd along, in extremity of paine, he seemed to labour much in his desire to haue had conference with me, saying he had earnestly wished to see me, that we might haue spoken together, concerning our lawes, and something he spake, but what came from him, was very vnperfect, which I imputed to the paine he endured, only I noted when he wold haue spoken of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; so I tooke notice of the names, in that manner hee might well perceiue, we had knowledge of them, he seemed to take pleasure therein, but the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">The chiefe Mary-bucke wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suous to confer with me about our Religion.</note> with him, was to no purpose, nor worth reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall: So that after he had made me to eate by him, a dish of excellent creame drest with corne after their best fashion, &amp; a solemne farewel past betwixt vs, I left him.

and what they conceit of vs. They do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the same as we do, the true and only God, to whom they pray, and on his name they call, in their <note place="margin">They worship the true God aboue, whom they call Alle.</note> language, expressed by the word <hi>Alle,</hi> insomuch as if he see any thing which begets in him admiration, casting his eyes to the Heauens, hee cries <hi>Alle Alle;</hi> neither haue they amongst them, any manner of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or picture, or resemblance of any diuine things <note place="margin">They haue no manner of Image.</note> but as far as we can perceiue, such things are distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them: They doe acknowledge <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and are all circumcised, the manner of their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, I refer to speak of in another place: their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both or the seuenth day is vppon the friday, and haue distinctions, and proper names for seuen dayes in their weeke, they reckon their age or times, by the raines, in saying hee hath liued so many raines, as we say so many yeares, howbeit, we doe neuer heare them call vpon the name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> neither haue they amongst them any Churches, nor places they dedicate to holy vses, so farre as we can <note place="margin">They haue no Chuches.</note> perceiue, neither do we finde that they celebrate or solemnize them Sabboth day, for euen on that day will they follow any Trade, they will haue with vs, and their owne occasions: without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <note place="margin">They obserue not their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both.</note> they haue certaine round houses built o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and are spacious, according to their fashions, wherein they teach their youth, the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this: All the male children that proceedes <note place="margin">The manner of teaching their male children to write, and reade.</note> from these Mary-buckes, are taught to write and reade, and in regard they haue no paper amongst them, but what wee or others bring them in the way of Trade; and therefore is of esteeme, they haue for their bookes a small smooth boord, fit to

hold in their hands, on with the childrens lessons are written with a kinde of blacke incke they make, and the pen is in a manner of a pensill. The <note place="margin">The manner of their character.</note> Character they vse, being much like the Hebrewe, which in regard I vnderstood not, I caused my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-bucke to write in paper, some part of their law, which I brought home with me, that some of our learned Schollers might peruse, if wee might by that meanes come to any better knowledge, then the small practise we haue hetherto had, and by <note place="margin">Their law is not written in the publicke</note> men of our capacities cannot so easily be attained, onely this much wee discerne, that the religion and law they teach, is not writ in the same tongue, they publickly speake, and moreouer, that none of the temporall people, of what dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity soeuer, are traded vp to write, or reade, or haue any vse of bookes or letters amongst them. And whether these open houses, they teach their children in, be places for their religious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and for their publike meetings, in their holy exercises, because they are euer placed, neere the principall mans dwelling, and as it were ioyning vnto him, wee cannot well resolue, but rather conceite the contrary, in regard they lie open, and are not swept, and kept with any manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and therefore do rather thinke they make vse of the open fields, where vnder some spacious <note place="margin">We suppose they performe their religions ceremonies, vnder the shady trees.</note> shady tree, they obserue their meetings, some part of the manner whereof, as an eye witnesse, I will readily recite.</p>
               <p>The place where we had houses built, and walled with straw for our owne vses, was seated by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer side, vpon the top of the banke; and by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and laying his hand on his breast, his face directed toward the East, kneeled downe, and there mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or vttered foorth, after a decent manner, it should seeme, certaine prayers, wherein, after hee had continued for a space, kissing the ground, hee <note place="margin">Their manner of devotion.</note> rose vp, and turning himselfe about, with his face directed to the West, hee performed the like cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which ended, after hee had stayed, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a while vpon vs, hee returned to his place of lodging.</p>
               <p>One ceremony more of their Religion, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, if you please to remember, where and how I left the chiefe <hi>Mary-bucke</hi> sicke and full of danger, it did manifest no lesse, for in the euening, the day after I came from him, he died, the report whereof, was immediately spread ouer the whole countrey, <note place="margin">The death of the chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-bucke.</note> who from all parts came in, after that abundant manner, to solemnize his funerall, so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of men and women gathered together, as in such a desart and scattered countrey might breed admiration, which I thinke was rather increased, in regard at that time he died, the moone was high, and gaue her light, and they in whole troupes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, eyther the whole night, or most part of the <note place="margin">The great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> same together; the place or port whereat my boat did ride, was a Passage or Ferry to the towne, from the whole countrey, on the further side, whereunto belonged a great Canoe, which I had hired, hauing likewise another of my owne, both which neuer stood still, but were vsed, night and day in passing the people, none of them came emptie, some brought beeues, others goates, and cockes and henues, with rice, and all sort of graine the country

were so much delighted; another ceremonie was, that euery principall Mary-bucke and men of note amongst them, would take of the earth, which came forth of the place his graue was digged, and with the same water, which was in the pot, standing in the same roome, would moysten the said earth, and so forme therof a round ball, which they would <note place="margin">A Relique of great esteeme.</note> carry away with them, and esteeme of as a great Relique: whereof my <hi>Alchade</hi> or Mary-bucke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those perfumes I sent, was admitted to haue one, which he so highly esteemed, I could not at any rate purchase it from him, although I made him offers, of more then I meant to giue.</p>
               <p>This Assembly held, for the space of ten dayes, with a continuall recourse, of comming and going, but not altogether for the buriall of the dead; for after certayne dayes were spent in the celebrating of his Obsequies, then beganne a great solemnitie, for the establishing and inuesting of his eldest sonne in his place and dignitie: whereunto came agayne <note place="margin">The inuesting of the eldest sonne in the fathers place.</note> many gifts, and presents: amongst those that passed by me, I tooke notice of a great Ramme, which was carried betweene two, bound fast and layd vppon a hurdle. In the whole time I was in the Country, I neuer saw any Ramme, or Sheepe, but that which <note place="margin">A Ramme for sacrifice.</note> was brought very farre, his wooll might more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called haire, it was of that hardnesse: I did vnderstand by my Mary-bucke, he was to be vsed, after some manner of sacrifice, and I vnderstood likevvise, that in their high Priesthood, the sonne succeeded the father, &amp; this course is held amongst their Religious orders, wherein they differ from the temporall gouerments.</p>

them, or amongst a whole company, a quier of paper, which cost three pence, yet to them it is a rich reward, out of which they question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse doe rayse the greater part of sustenance to trauell withall, and what else may be auaileable vnto them, making thereof, by writing in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their blessed Gregories, which they giue and bestow as they sinde occasion, and to confirme vs herein, this wee note, that if wee haue occasion to send any of the Countrey people, of any message or employment for vs, after he hath agreed for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he will oke to haue a sheete or two of paper giuen him, which is to buy him sustenance, as hee passeth from towne to towne: so as you shall neuer meete with any of this profession, but in discourse they can speake of more Countries then their owne natiue places: one chiefe reason to encourage their trauell, we haue learned, which is, that they haue <note place="margin">The Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucke free to trauaile in all places.</note> free recourse through all places, so that howsoeuer the Kings and Countries are at warres, and vp in armes, the one against the other, yet still the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-bucke is a priuiledged person, and many follow his trade, or course of trauelling, without any let or interruption of either side. Notwithstanding there is none of these Mary-buckes but goe armed, and are as compleatly furnished, as any of the other people, and haue the manner of vse and exercise of their weapons, in as ample manner as they haue, where unto I thinke they are rather inuited, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those wilde and rauening beasts, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is stored withall, that vpon any occasion, they may be able to defend themselues, and offend their offensiue enemies.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8205:44"/>
tell you of those two ancients Mary-buckes, who were our neighbours, in the towne where our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <note place="margin">Their report of gold.</note> stood, who both of them would relate vnto vs, of infinite store of gold, which they had seene the Countrey aboue to abound withall, wherein the more auntient man, whom wee found so louing a friend, would speake maruellous confidently, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he would tell vs, there were a dangerous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to passe, before wee came vnto them, and that the Riuer was so full of trees, we should not be able to get our boate along; and in token of feare, when I was to beginne my iourney vpward, and came in the euening to take my leaue of him; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my right hand betwixt both his, hee vttered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it, diuerse vnknowne words, and euer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none, would sparingly spatter, with his spettle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, after which laying his mouth close to my <note place="margin">Old Mahome he ceremony at my going vp</note> necke, ouer my right shoulder, hee would after the like manner performe there: which his superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeale being assuredly done in loue, I did not contemptuously refuse, because I was ignorant of any offence therein, but with a friendly curtesie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, and my returne backe was to him as ioyfull; the other who was a more, or as I may say, most subtile fellow, promised to be my guide along, and to passe in the boate with mee, and thereby wrought vpon my willingnes, to embrace his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to the seruing his owne turne, and getting from me many such gifts and curtesies, as otherwise <note place="margin">The subtilty of his neighbour Hammet.</note> hee could neuer haue attained, holding me in hand, hee would meet me at a Port aboue, but there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued mee, to my further trouble, and at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne preuented, his cause was feare of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8205:45"/>
aboue, which (God be praised) fell out to the contrary, whereof forthwith it will fall right to tell you; onely I must first say something, concerning the great Tovvne of <hi>Setico,</hi> and of the trade they follow, with those same number of Asses, whereof before I told you.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants heere, who are all Mary-buckes, are the onely people, who follow a continuall trade from their owne houses dovvne to the King of <hi>Bursall,</hi> whose dvvellings (as you may remember) <note place="margin">The trade and trauaile of the mary-bucks of Setico.</note> is sayd to be by the Sea side; at which place, the Sea shoare doth naturally yeeld great store of Salt, but it is a course and durty kinde, insomuch as the greatest part, which we haue seene, and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, doth rather looke like durt, or Sea-coale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, then resemble the Salt we haue in vse, or make our trade withall; to buy which they carry downe, as their chiefest commoditie, the slaues or people of the Countrey, whereof the King of <hi>Bursall</hi> doth <note place="margin">Wherewith he maintaines his greatnesse.</note> make such profit, as it is supposed to be a principall of the reuenew, wherevvith he maintaines his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. This commoditie the people doe carry like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise farre vp into the Country, for amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, we can perceiue they make little vse thereof, so as their trauell is long and tedious: the returne they make, is not discernd to be any thing but gold, and a kinde of Nuts they call <hi>Cola,</hi> which is in great esteeme amongst them, thevertue whereof I shall hereafter tell you: and for that it may be here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, what becoms of the gold by them brought dovvne, I will shevv you vvhat by report is told vs; These Mary-buckes doe hold an opinion, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death they shall appeare in another world,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8205:45"/>
vvherein this gold wil be of great esteem, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore striue to furnish themselues all they can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith, <note place="margin">An ill opinion of the Mary-buckes, to bury their golde.</note> vvhich either in their life time, they secretly in the ground doe hide, or by their dearest friends cause to bee buried with them, esteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues happiest, that can with greatest quantitie be furnished: another vse they make, is, to buy from the <hi>Portingals,</hi> a sort of faire, long &amp; square blew stones, which stones their women weare about their mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to keepe them from bloudy issues, vnto which they are generally subiect, the occasion rising from the men, as may be well supposed, if you but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or call to your minde, after what sort they are discribed, and this is seene, by that esteeme <note place="margin">A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.</note> the <hi>Portingalls</hi> make of that commoditie which brings (as I obserued) so great a store and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of gold amongst them; other vse within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they haue none, but that the women weare it hanging in their eares, in rings, and pendants, made vp with little Arte, and as vnhansome work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship. These people of <hi>Setico</hi> were the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing we should proceed in the search of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, of any other, not onely telling vs themselues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many dangers, but at all townes where we came, and amongst our familiars, had left their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it could haue preuailed to discourage vs; or whether they did verely thinke, our boate could neuer haue found passage, in regard it was neuer <note place="margin">The reason of looking after Buckor Sano.</note> attempted by any such vessell before, or as I incline vnto, fearing we might be hinderers to the Trade, they had so long followed, and whereunto they were setled, being wel prouided with such numbers of Asses, as beasts of burthen, to proceed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

the same, so as from them, wee could get no comfortable intelligence, vvherein reason leades the way, that euery mans profit is nearest to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but as it shall please God, to encourage you the noble Gouernour and Company, to prepare and settle your selues, with a serious resolution, to <note place="margin">Note.</note> follow the farther search of this rich expectation: These people of <hi>Setico,</hi> of all other are the likeliest, and dvvell the most conuenientest, to be brought to a more setled, and commodious trade, which vvill fall vppon them vvith a great deale lesse trouble, and infinite lesse trauell, and vvithall be made espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall instruments of our good, whereunto as yet their grosse vnderstandings cannot ascend, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient customes are harsh to be altred, how beit these were the considerations that made me endeuour to settle a league vvith the high Priest, and establish a perfect course of amitie betvvixt vs: which course of mine, I shall more boldly commend to your faire acceptance, vvhen you shall see it grounded vpon the experience of my vvhole trauel and trade in the Riuer, and after my discourse and conference vvith that great blacke Marchant <hi>Bucker Sano,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom and all my proceedings aboue, I novv am come to make a full relation.</p>

and trauelling some way by land recouered <hi>Tinda,</hi> but found not his blacke Merchant, in regard he was trauelled higher into the Country, in the sale and vttering of his salt Commodity: <hi>Thompson</hi> returned, but found his expectation so satisfied, in that he had hard of the Moores of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> and was come so neere where they frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hee talkt of nothing, but how to settle habitations, and fortefie the Riuer to defende themselues, and keepe out other nations; but these his desires died in his vnhappy end, and this was all our acquaintance; which now I came to second, by sending vnto this <hi>Buckor Sano</hi> to come downe vnto the Riuer to vs, as the onely man we were willing to sell, and commend our commodities vnto.</p>
               <p>And by this time Sunday night is come, and none of my blackmen returned, monday likewise all spent in expectation, on twesday our men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grumble, and my especiall consort to speake out, there was no reason wee should hazard our <note place="margin">Some of our men grew fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> selues by staying any longer, in regard it was fallen out, as we were told below, that they were a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and dangerous people, and therefore those people we sent vp were murdered; and if we stayed our turnes would be next, and likewise that we had no flesh left, and our other prouisions were very scanty.

with ali manner of wild beasts, we would try our indeauors, and on the wednesday morning I <note place="margin">As bigge in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as a great Stagge, and had wreathed bornes.</note> went out with two more, and killed a great and goodly beast, which was no sooner brought downe &amp; cut out, &amp; hanged to coole vnder the shady trees on shore, but there appeared in sight three black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the one was one of those we sent, who had brought with him <hi>Buckor Sanus</hi> brother, and the King of <hi>Tindas</hi> seruant, and they came before to <note place="margin">The returne of one of our messengers.</note> see vs, and what commodities wee had, bringing word that the next day <hi>Buckor Sano</hi> would be there himselfe; I had them aboord my boate, and made them curteous entertainment, giuing them some small commodities, and when the euening came, we feasted with our Venison.</p>
               <p>The next day about noone, came <hi>Buckor Sano</hi> with his musicke playing before him, with <note place="margin">The comming of Buckor Sano.</note> great solemnity, and his best clothes on, and about some 40. more, armed with their bows and arrowes with him, hee shewed no more at first, bowbeit within two houres after, there were two hundred men and women come thither: he sat downe vpon the banke vnder a shady tree: after a little stay, I went a shore to him, and our salutations being past, I desired him to go aboord, whereof he kindly accepted; and withall shewed me a beefe he had brought to giue me for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I had sent him, diuerse goates the people had <note place="margin">Prouision the people brought</note> likewise brought, and corne, and cockes, and hens, so as there was no neede to doubt any more want of victuall: He carried no more aboord with him, but two after he was in the boate, I shot off three such guns as I had to welcome him, at the noyse

whereof he seemed much to reioyce, calling the report of the powder; by the name of the white mens thunder, and taking notice of the head, and the hide of the Deare which we had killed, which we shewed him was slaine by one of our guns, they <note place="margin">His going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the boat and report of our powder.</note> sent, with admiration, from one place to another, and certified, that there was a people come, who with thunder killed the wild beasts in the wood, and the fowles in the ayre: Which for it was our dayly vse to kill one sort of fowle called a Stalker, which is as high as a man, and hath as much meate <note place="margin">A Stalker.</note> of his body, as is in a Lambe, which diuerse times we vsed to kill, and eate, more especiall we desired to haue his feathers, which grew on his tayle, which are of vse, and such as are worne, and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of here at home amongst vs: I had of my owne prouision good Rosa-solis, taking forth a glasse, I dranke vnto him, after he had dranke he tooke off <note place="margin">The saying of Buckor Sano aboord the boate.</note> his sword and gaue it me to lay vp, saying defend me here in your boate, and I will secure you on shore, he liked our drinke so well, he suckt it in, and as it seems not knowing the strength of it, took more then he would haue done, insomuch as he fell asleepe, the people that came with him, in the meane time cutting of reedes, made them houses, others fetching in wood, made fires euery where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, so as it seemed a little towne; <hi>Buckor Sano</hi> slept foundly vpon my bed by me in the boate, and in the morning complained of his head, and this much I must iustifie in his behalfe, that during <note place="margin">Hee was but once ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with our strong drinkes.</note> the time we were together, he was neuer ouertaken by drinking after, but obserued the course he saw we vsed, to take a small cup before meate, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

difference, and held so long, that many of them seemed to dislike, and made shew, that they would goe away, but after we concluded, there was no more difference, euery man bringing his commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our salt went away, and as they dispatcht, they likewise returned in companies together, and still others came, that we had the place continually sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: We neuer talked vnto them of golde, the <note place="margin">Warning not to take notice of their gold.</note> principall we came for, but wayted opportunitie, and notwithstanding we saw it worne in their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens eares, warning was giuen, none of our people, should take any great notice of it, as a thing wee should greatly desire, vntill occasion was giuen, by <hi>Buckor Sano</hi> himselfe, who taking note of our guilt swords, and some other things wee had, although but poorely set out, with some shew of gold trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, did aske if that were gold: hee was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Yes: it should seeme sayth he, you haue much of this in your Countrey: Wee affirmed the same, and that it was a thing our men did all vse to weare, and therefore if they had any, wee would buy it of them, because wee had more vse then they for it, you shall haue sayd he, what is amongst our women here; but if I did know you would esteeme of that, I would be prouided, to bring you such quantitie, as should buy all things you brought: and if you would be sure to come still vnto vs, I would not faile to meete you.

which made their tongues freer, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fuller of agility; wherein alwayes they did striue to shew a desire they had to giue content vnto vs: I may not omit one principall manifestation: some three nights before we had finished all our occasions in this place, <hi>Buckor Sano</hi> being aboard at supper, by way of desire, spake that hee might bee called by the name of the white mens <hi>Alchade,</hi> in regard hee did performe the same manner of office for vs; that is, to make bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines, to deliuer and receiue, according to the trust reposed vpon him: I tooke it very kindly hee would accept the name, and to inuest him therein I tooke a string of Currall, and another of Christall, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke: he had likewise a small chaine of siluer put vpon him; then causing three gunnes to bee shot off, with a cup of Rosasolis drunke vnto him, with a <note place="margin">Buckor Sano made the white mens Alchade.</note> great shot we cryed out, Alchade Buckor Sano, Alcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Buckor Sano, that all the shore did ring of vs: hee presently calling to the shore, commaunded the Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to meete him at the water side, and that his wiues should bring him thither, all the nuts he had, (which be of great esteeme amongst them,) I brought him on shore with as much grace as wee could, as soone as he landed, the people being all come forth to meete him, he gaue his nuts frankely, Distributing them about, in <hi>teste</hi> of his new honour, his musicke playing before him, he went vp to the kings house, whom wee found <note place="margin">The acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his new title.</note> sitting vpon a matt without doores, with a fire of reeds before him, which is still maintained, by the light whereof they performe their ceremonies, and haue vse of no other candles: he placed me vpon the matt by the King, and going himselfe a certaine distance off, made a speech vnto him, the effect whereof was, that

               <p>The next day amongst many that came vnto the place, we did obserue some, who were markt vnder both their eyes, with three blewe stroakes, resembling <note place="margin">A people markt in the face.</note> stripes, all after one manner, demaunding therefore what they were, it was answered a people who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a King further vp in the Countrey, and by those markes they were distinguished and knowne <note place="margin">Obserue this Mary-Bucke.</note> from other people: This day likewise came vnto vs, an ancient Marybucke, taking acquaintance of our people, to whom he was very well knowne, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what hee was, and they told me, it was a Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucke, who did vse to Ferambra, and was acquainted <note place="margin">

remaine, or if he finde there is to little left, diuides his commodity into another part; for which he will haue more, at the vnknowne peoples returne, they take to themselues, where they see the gold is gone, and either lay more gold or take away what was laid before, and remaines in suspence: so that at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants third time, his bargaine is finished, for either he findes more gold, or the first taken away, and his commodity lest, and this it is saide, they haue a iust manner of trading and neuer see one another: <note place="margin">The report of the people with the great lippe.</note> to which is added, that the reason why these people will not be seene, is for that they are naturally borne, with their lower lippe of that greatnesse, it turnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and couers the greater part of their bosome, and remaines with that rawnesse on the side that hangs downe, that through occasion of the Sunnes extreame heate, it is still subiect to putrifaction, so as they haue no meanes to preserue themselues, but by continuall casting salt vpon it, and this is the reason, salt is so pretious amongst them: their countrey bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so farre vp in the land, naturally yeeldes none.

               <p>I haue set downe before, where I report the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our going vp the riuer, that I carried with me foure blackes; whereof the one was a boy, or young youth, whom I call by the name of <hi>Samgully;</hi> who in reguard of his continuance with <hi>George Tompson,</hi> and after him with the rest of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, had learnd to speake pretty Englis; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all had taken such an affection towards vs; that he did seeme euen hartely to neglect father and mother, and his owne home, in his desires to follow vs: he was about the age of 17. yeeres, a straight youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and of a handsome grovvth; yet was he not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised: how beit hee should haue beene the yeere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8205:59"/>
but his absence with the white people, which was some of our company, when the time of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision came, was the only cause he mist cutting them: and this yeere hee was to bee circumcised, or else there was some great penalty to light vpon his friends, or danger to himselfe; which appeared in their earnestnesse to keepe him from going vp with vs; notwithstanding, hee was stollen beyond the towne his friends dwelt in with vs, as farre as our boate would goe in two tides; and there ouertooke vs his mother: who on the shore made grieuous <note place="margin">The affection of Saingulley our blacke boy vnto vs.</note> moane to haue him sent backe, the boy had spide her, and hid himselfe in the boate, bidding vs say that he was gone backe, and albeit her moane vvas great, because shee saide, he would be absent againe in the time of circumcision, which would bee the next Moone; and if vvee vvould not put him on shore, she vvould throw her selfe from the banke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuer; the boy lying along in the boate, said, she will not drowne, shee will not drowne, let vs bee gone; and alongst he went with vs: It was the eight day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> when his mother made this moane, and the ninth day of <hi>February</hi> after we came by that place againe, and that euening, as the Sunne set, came to an anker at the port that belonged to the towne where the boyes friends dwelt, which was called <hi>Boo Iohns</hi> towne, a man whom we did well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <note place="margin">This Bo Iohn was brother to Ferambra.</note> the towne stood some mile from the water side to carry the boy home, and refresh our selues, wee were willing to walke on shore.</p>
               <p>So taking our Chirurgion, and one more of my consorts, with our blacke Alchade, who wee hired from this town, wherein his mother likewise dwelt,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8205:60"/>
and our blacke boy, ashore we went, the bakne was high from the riuer; which the boy first gat vp, where presently ascended, he began to leape and sing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great shewes of ioy, holding vp his hand, and pointing towards the towne, which as I said was a <note place="margin">The feast of their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</note> mile from vs: but when wee likewise ascended, wee heard a great noyse of musicke and shooting, where at the boy so much reioyced, and said it was the cutting of Prickes; for so hee cald it, and that hee was come time enough: vvee vvalkt towards the towne, and as the euening went in came thither, I had an intent to haue gone to the Maister of the towne his house; but my Mary-bucke told mee, hee had a world of strangers, and vvas earnest vvith mee to goe to his mothers house; vve vvere also to passe by the house vvhere our blacke boies father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwelt: the father in regard he vvas blind, and kept house, vve saw not; but his mother being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and hearing one call her sons name, came forth and met him, and presently turning her head to the side of the house, fell into a bitter vveeping, calling onely vpon his name, <hi>Samgulley, Samgulley;</hi> I vvould haue had the boy alongst vvhere I lay, but hee vvas <note place="margin">Samgulley ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs to be circumsised.</note> taken from vs, and not suffered to goe; howbeit I charged him he shold not be cut, which as they told vs, was to be done in the morning; vntill I came to see him, which he promised, and so we departed to our lodging: at which place likewise was many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and much musicke; but after a while that wee had beene there, they all quitted the place, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of modesttie, not to disturbe vs. There was no housing, nor dwellings, but was full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nay likewise, vnder euery shady and conuenient

               <p>Amongst the rest of these dispersed companies; I tooke speciall notice of one, who stood more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and was closde and seuered in, vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy trees, which reedes, and bowes set vp together like a hedge, from whence proceeded, a greater noyse of voyces; as also drumming, and thumping, mor clamorosly: demaunding what it meant, I vvas answered, in that place remained those youthes that <note place="margin">They that were cut, kept all to gether.</note> were cut, and they were to continue vntil such time as they were recouered of their sorenes, and that the greatnesse of the noyse did come from those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vvho kept them company, vvhich vvere the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort of people, aboue their age; who had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy past, and receiued their circumcision: I went likewise that night, after vve had supt, to the maister of the townes house; vvho had sent vnto mee to mend my supper, a brace of Partidges, and finding
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8205:61"/>
there the Ballards, or best musicke, and the younger sort of women gathered together beheld their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and for that they might see we had such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures amongst vs; I tooke one of them by the hand, and daunced with her, whereof th y gaue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">The curtesie and muth that past betwixt vs.</note> of great gladnes, inuiting the rest of my company to doe the like: <hi>Boo Iohn</hi> the maister of the place, excusing himselfe that we lay not at his house, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of much company and noyse: but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, because one of his wiues was lately deliuered of a child, vnto whom he carried me within a house by herselfe, where she lay after their fashion vpon a mat handsomely; I gaue vnto the mother for the childe, a few poore beades, which were very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken, and he said, if it had beene a man child, it should haue had one of our co upanies name, with whom he had beene longest acquainted; but saith he, my wife <hi>Dowry</hi> is vvith child, and if shee bring a man child, it shall carry your name; for so shee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desires: these familiarities past betwixt vs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvhich wee betooke our selues to our seuerall lodgings, and were nothing frighted vvith the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cry of their diuell; vvho at these ceremonious meetings so soone as euening comes is conuersant by his roaring voyce amongst them, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues all, or the most part of the night, vvhereof I shall presently giue you relation: But first, I must conclude of their circumcision; for the sight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as euen now I told you, we did reserue our selues to receiue aduertisement of our Samgulleyes cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was to be done in the morning. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the Sunne some two houres high, we had a messenger came to entreate we would send him a white cloath, and that hee would pray vs to come
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8205:61"/>
&amp; see him. As soon as we came, he was broght forth into the open field betweene the houses, and the place where they remained, who were cut the day before they had taken away his clothes, they broght him ashore in; vvhich was shirt, breeches, and a cap of stript stuffe, after the brauest fashion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and onely brought him with a vvhite cloath close about him: whereas we did expect some great ceremony after a religious manner to be performed: He was first set downe vpon a little mole-hill, diuers people comming foorth to see him, amongst the which were most women, who stood directly a little <note place="margin">women looke vpon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</note> distance off, looking on: the maister of the towne was likewise there, and three of vs; amongst which our Chirurgion was one to comfort him not to feare: hee was very confident, entreating me to lay my hand vpon his shoulder; from amongst the blackes came foorth an ordinary man, with a short knife in his hand, which he whetted as he came, like one of our butchers vnto a beast; and causing the boy to stand vp, he tooke of his cloath, giuing it to a stander by to hold, so as he was starke naked, and set his hands vpon his sides, being neither bound nor held: how beit there were some by, who offered to hold his armes, but because hee promised not to moue, they let him alone, the executioner taking hold of his members, drawing the skinne ouer very farre, as we conceiued, cut him largly, and had three seuerall cuts afore hee had done, whereat the boy <note place="margin">Our boy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcisised, and the manner thereof.</note> shrunke very little; insomuch as the maister of the towne who stood by told vs, hee had very seldome seene any abide it with so great a courage: to our thinking it was exceeding feareful and full of terror,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8205:62"/>
insomuch as I told the doer in a very angry manner he had vtterly spoyled him; when he askt wherein, I replyed, in cutting him so deepe: His answere vvas, it is so much the better for him, and vvithout any curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity taking vp his cloath shewed his owne members, that it might appeare he vvas cut as farre; howbeit my distaste vvas such vpon him, that I could not yeeld to giue him any thing in the vvay of gratuitie to vvash his hands vvithall, and as the manner of the countrey is to doe by such as are friends, to the party circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: the thing performed, the boyes white cloath vvas cast ouer him, and by two men, vvho held his armes, he vvas hurried apace to the same quarter, where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that vvere cut remained: We made first a request that they vvould let vs goe along to the place vvith him, and vvere going vvith some of the people; but presently in hast ouertooke vs foure ancient men, who did not onely stay our going, but made shew of much <note place="margin">We were not suffered to go amongst the new circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> displeasure to such as vvere going vvith vs, and would by no meanes suffer vvee should come amongst them: then vve desired vve might haue the boy away with vs, telling them vvee had better meanes to cure him, and to make him sooner vvell, then they had, shewing our Chirurgion vnto them, vvho they knew had healed <note place="margin">No vse of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to cure them.</note> vvounds and sores amongst them; but vvee could not preuaile, by the interposing of these auncient men some of the rest seeming to consent vnto vs: so as wee vvere there driuen to leaue our boy, vvho amongst the restof his conforts, had vvithout doubt no other chirur gery to cure their tender maladies, but onely to attend the expectation of time, who by the helpe of their youth &amp; nature might weare it out, which appears the rather to vs, in regard at these times, there is vnto these
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8205:62"/>
youthes allowed a certaine licentious liberty, whereby they may steale and take away peoples hennes, or powltry; nay from the Fulbies, a biefe or cattle to eate and banquet withall amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues without any offence to the lawes, or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the countrey; which at other times is strict in that behalfe, thereby animating, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their spirits to more alacritie, and according to the condition of their wanton age by these stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len delights to draw them more willingly from the thing, and make the time of their recouery lesse te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to themselues, and discourageable to others. And if I might bee worthy to deliuer my opinion, considering this their circumcision, as I haue care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obserued I should conclude, it were done of meere necessitie, as a morrall lawe for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their liues and healthes, and so found out by their precedent auncestors, and by strict obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid peremptorily vpon them, wherein I should submit my selfe in the account I could giue to more able iudgement: onely this you may please to note, it is done without any religious ceremony, and the word in their language is expressed vnto vs by no other signification, then cutting of prickes; and this is done in certaine bigger townes of the countrey, whether the smaller townes and habitations make their resorts, bringing their youth to be all cut toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And to make vp the number at all these meetings, there is one sure card that neuer failes, which is their <note place="margin">The discourse of their diuell Ho-re.</note> roaring deuill, that before I spake of, whose atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance may seeme to keepe the youth in awe, and he is called by the name of <hi>Ho-re,</hi> whose strange report I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8205:63"/>
proceede vnto: There is at all these meetings, some distance of from the place, heard the noyse of a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring voice, resembling the greatest base of a mans voice; when we demand of them what it is, they will answer, with a kinde of feare, it is Ho-re, and then describe him to be a fearefull spirit, that none may come neere, without danger of being destroyde, carryed away, or torne in pieces: there is at all their meetings, vpon the first notice of his voice, a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for him of all manner of victuals, they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, euery one imparting somewhat, all which is carryed towards the voyce, and there vnder <note place="margin">He is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous cater.</note> a tree set downe, and within small time, bee it of what quantitie soeuer; it will bee found deuoured, and not so much as a bone to bee seene, vneaten, or left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and if they be not ready forthwith to carry him such prouisions, as shall content him, some of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised sons are instantly taken away; females he meddles not with, and saide to remaine in Ho-reyes belly, some of them nine or tenne daies, from whence <note place="margin">Sumetimes 8 or 9 atonec, are carried away, and sayd to be in his belly.</note> they must be redeemed with some belly prouision: and it is strange to heare, how confidently they will report vnto you, that they haue beene carryed away, and beene abiding there: wherein this is obserued, that looke how many dayes he hath beene kept away, or remaining, as they say in Ho-reyes belly, so many dayes after they returne, it must be, before they will, or dare open their mouths, to speake a word. For confirmation of vvhich, this I haue seene: as I walkt one day into the countrey from our dwelling to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rambras</hi> house, distant some foure mile, in the vvay vve vvere to passe through a towne of the Fulbies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people that lookt vpon vs, I vvas shevved a

youth of some eighteene yeares of age, vvho they said, came but the night before out of Ho-reyes bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I vvent tovvards him, and vrged him to speake <note place="margin">Comming forth they speake not for certaine daies.</note> vnto me, but still he vvent backe from mee, and kept his finger before his mouth, and notwithstanding I made vvhat meanes I could, by pulling and pinching of him, and more to terrifie him, making proffers vvith a false fyer to shute at him, beeing naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fearefull of our gunnes, I could not preuaile, neither make him open his mouth: notwithstanding afterwards, the same fellow did often come, and haue commerce amongst vs: nay our people, vvho vvere lying, and dwelling in the countrey, had beene at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times frighted with the voyce of this Ho-rey, for hauing staide in their fowling, or being abroade, vntill night hath ouertaken them, in their comming home, as they haue saide, they haue heard the voyce of Ho-re, as they might conceiue, some mile from them, and before they could passe tenne steppes, hee hath seemed to be in their very backes, with fright whereof, maintained by their imagination, of their report went of him, they haue not, without a gastly dread, recouered home: vnto which place of dwelling, he neuer was so bold to make any attempt: and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my opinion is, that it is onely some illusion, either by the Marybuckes, or among the elder sort, to forme and keepe in obedience those younger sort: for better approbation of what I suppose, I will craue the patience, to set downe vvhat I obserued at the circumcision of our blacke boy: The nights vvere <note place="margin">Our opinion concerning Ho-re.</note> very light, the Moone being then about the full to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards midnight, comming from <hi>Bo Iohns</hi> house to the place at Faye, Ho-reyes voyce vvas wondrous

to this place, the 14. of December, betweene eight and nine in the morning, and notwithstanding, the dwelling houses were somewhat remote from the riuer, we found standing vpon the banke at the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place this <hi>Consaluos,</hi> who in friendly sort salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, and carryed vs vp to his housing, where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently we found ready a very good breakefast of hens, and other good refreshing, which he said, was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for vs: we seemed to maruell he should know of our comming thither, but aster he told vs, that the euening before, he was at another towne within the land, and had no meaning to come home, when as there came vnto him a Iuddy ot Fidler, which dwelt in the towne with him, and did likewise shew vs the man, who told him that Ho-re had acquainted him, that the next morning, and at such an houre, there would be so many white men at <hi>Pompetane,</hi> naming the number that were in our boates, and that there they would land: but to what purpose, either to doe good or hurt, the Deuill was ignorant; and vpon <note place="margin">The Diuell could not tell the Portingall where we were friends or foes.</note> this intelligence, I retyred my selfe, and came away hither to meete you, whereat wee seemed much to wonder, beeing altogether our selues vncertaine of any houre, in regard, we diuers times went a shoare, and shooting at fowle and such like occasions diuers times lighted vpon vs; notwithstanding the diuells intelligence, we were no wayes discomforted; for he did confesse, hee was altogether ignorant of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended actions, and the conclusion was, how by his intelligence, the worst hurt we had, was a better, and more readier breakefast.</p>

three: the first and chiefest is the Ferraro or Smith, who holds a good repute: notwithstanding, they haue no Iron of their owne making, but what is <note place="margin">The trades or occupations they haue in vse, their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full season of thunder and lightning, also what fruites &amp; plants the Country yeeldes, and are growing there amongst them.</note> brought vnto them, whereof they haue most neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull vse, and neither may, or can liue without it: for first of the Iron we bring vnto them, they doe fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and make all those short swords they were, next the heads of their Assigies, or Iauelings, as also the heads of their throwing darts, and the barbed heads of their shooting arrowes, which are couered ouer with their deadly poyson: in many of these the Smith doth shew a pretty kind of art and making: but the most needfull vse amongst them, is the toole or instrument, wherewith they till their ground: without vse of which, they could hardly haue their <note place="margin">The Smith.</note> being, and therefore Iron, a principall commodity, that they doe call vpon; at the lower part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, where the Portingall frequents, they haue more for exchange then aboue, whereas we are vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine trade: for wee cut our Iron of twelue ynches, and that is the proportion lookt after, and so high as it flowes, the Kings and Gouernors will call for that length: but passing aboue eight yuches will goe as friendly; which in either of them, is gaine enough, the returne euen in the worst, yeelding tenne for one, carrying our yron in barres, we are inforced to make vse of their Smiths, to cut it to the proportion, wee must vse, and therefore sending sor him, he comes to the water side, bringing his shop with him, that is his bellowes, and a small Anuill, which hee strikes into the ground vnder a shady tree, and onely of one kind <note place="margin">An excellent charcole to worke their Iron,</note> of red wood, amongst them, they can make artificiall Charcoale, which will giue our Iron his true heate,

as any seacoale, his boy blowing the bellowes, that lye on the ground, the nose of them, through a hard earth, made of purpose with a hole in it, and in this manner with a hammer and a toole, they cut it for vs, receiuing satisfaction, to vs easie enough, but what it is consists of Iron; and chary we must be to looke to our measuring, or he will vse his best vnderstanding to purloyne; and this for the Smith and his esteeme amongst them: The next is he whom we call a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero;</hi> one that doth make all their Gregories, wherein <note place="margin">The Sepatero they of this trade are most ingenious.</note> truely is a great deale of art shewen, they being made and fashioned of leather into all shapes, both round and square, and triangle, after that neate manner as might be allowed for workemanship, euen amongst our curious handicrafts: these men are likewise they that make their saddles and bridles; of which bridles I haue seene so neately made vp, as with leather, euen here in our owne countrey, could hardly be mended: whereby appeares, they haue knowledge to dresse their leather. Howbeit I conceiue, onely their goats and deare skinnes, which they can colour and dye: but to greater beasts hides, their apprehension can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine, and some of these are held for curious persons, and deepe capacities: for they will bee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of some stuffe garments we weare, and do thinke, and will boldly say, that wee doe make them of the hides, we buy from them, and will not doe it in their sight, because they shall not learne; and for our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we bring, they absolutely conclude, it is made of the hyde, and likewise many other things they see vs vse, they will say, comes and is framed of those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants teeth we carry from them, allowing much of a more deeper knowledge in vs, then themselues in

Maie following, almost nine moneths, they neuer taste any showres of raine, so as their ground is so hard, through the extreme heate of the Sunne, that they can make no vse thereof, but are compelled to stay vntill raine doth fall, to moysten the earth, that their instruments may enter, to prepare the same: which raines, at the first come gently, now and then a showre, but not without thunder, and lightning; Towards the end of Iune, it then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more forcible, powring it selfe violently foorth with such horrible stormes, and gusts of winde, and with such fearefull flashes of lightning, and claps of thunder, as if (according to our phrase) heauen and earth would meet together: in all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <note place="margin">The times of their raines &amp; the fearefulnes thereof.</note> the miserable people are driuen to worke and labour, in the open field, for Ioosing the season of the grounds softnesse; and as it doth beginne, after a more gentle manner, in the same nature and distance of time it passeth away, the most extreame force being from the middle of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vntill the middle of August, and the abundance of raine that then doth fall, may bee supposed, in that it doth raise the Riuer from his vsuall height, directly vpright thirty foote, and where it hath not banke to defend it ouer-flowes the shoares, and therefore they prepare their habitations, in their owne discretions, accordingly, and in some yeares not without danger: Now in regard many people of our Country, haue beene lost, and that our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men directly charge the vnholsomnesse of the ayre, to be the sole cause, I would presume a little to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it, deliuering my opinion, hoping it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite some abler vnderstanding, to search into it,

               <p>It is certaine, in regard of the grounds hardnesse in those nine moneths when the raines are past, that the superficies, or vpper part of the earth, doth receiue all that venome, or poysonous humours which distill ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from trees or plants, whereof there is store, as we see by the aboundance they vse in poysoning their Arrowes, and some of their Launces; and likewise, what doth issue from their venemous Serpents, and Snakes, of which kindes there are very many, both great, and exceeding long; also Toades and Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the poyson doth remaine and continue in the <note place="margin">The great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of poyson.</note> drynesse of the ground, and rakte vp in the dust and sand, which vpon the first raines, being moystned, and the earth wet, by the exhalation of the hot Sunne is drawne vp, and in short time in the next showres fals downe againe; in my poore iudgement, some reason appeares that those first times must be very pestilent, and full of danger; which in some sort testifi is it selfe, in regard those first raines, lighting vpon the naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, doe make blaines and spots, which remaine aster them, much more then after the raines haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more perfectly washt, and cleard the supersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and not onely vpon the bodies, but in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">The nature of the first raines.</note> or clothes worne; who being laide by, after they are wet with the first raines, doe sooner, and in greater number breed and bring foorth vntoward wormes; whereas other wayes, after the raines are more common, it doth not produce any such effect, or if it doe, very little.

               <p>I would willingly also venter here, and speake my opinion, what naturally may bee saide, concerning these contagious times; but with this prouiso, it is done to animate others, who if they knew the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine course and season, with the true manner of each particular circumstance, would be able to demonstrate better, and so rectifie me in that where I shall doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse. These seasons I say, begin gently in the end of <hi>May,</hi> when the Sunne drawes to the end of his Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne progresse, in the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> whose power, as it may appeare, draweth vp after him those <note place="margin">An obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous times.</note> great and clowdy vapours, which directly, come per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually out of the Southeast, and from no other place or point, which following after the force of the Sunne, as they rise higher, and neerer the heate, begin to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue; but as the Sun turnes backe againe, and comes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8205:69"/>
in his reuerse to meete with these massie vapours, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his forceable raynes amongst those clowdy substances, compels them to giue way, and breake in sunder, the violence whereof produceth that terrible thunder, and fearefull lightning which followeth, and great abundance of raine which falleth: which as it doth appeare, is most terrible, when the Sunne, and those vapours are as it were incorporate; for from the middle of <hi>Iuly,</hi> vntill the middle of <hi>August,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity is, and by that time in <hi>September,</hi> the Sunne is againe in his equinoctiall the aire doth cleare, and all the stormes doe end; and so it appeares, that as the Sunne, after his comming from the Equinoctiall, in his whole Northern progresse is raysing, and drawing these vapours after, so in his reuerse againe from the Tropicke, vntill he comes to the Equinoctiall he is dissoluing, and clearing the same againe, all which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing as a naturall man, I commend to the ingenious practitioner, either to amend, or make vse of; And in <note place="margin">They heare &amp; speak of Christ but will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</note> my selfe, with humble thankefulnesse giue glory to God, who shewes his almighty power to thesevnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing people, that in regard, they will not accept of that pleasing, and peacefull intelligence of our louing and meeke Sauiour his blessed Sonne; they shall feele and feare his omnipotent power, in trembling vnder those incomprehensible terrours, which as hee saith in <hi>Iob,</hi> are prepared for his enemies: Againe, if it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to appoint certaine places vpon the earth, where more especially those great and fearefull workes of his shall appeare, thereby to daunt and keepe down the hawty aspirings of sinnefull man; how much are <note place="margin">Gods mercy to vs.</note> wee bound to praise, and acknowledge his euerlasting goodnesse, in not seating vs and our habitions vnder

               <p>And now to adde comfort vnto vs that are, or shalbe called to trauell these parts: first, the times and seasons are certaine, that men may either auoide them by leauing the countrey, when they are to come, or by preparing themselues with things necessary, bee the better able to endure them, when they are come; of which now wee haue had such experience, as wee can expound things outwardly, by Gods permission requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit and auailcable, and inwardly frame our bodies and dispositions to the countrey and seasons agreeable: and this is encouraged with a comfortable resolution, that the continuance is not long, and that wee know the ends, and termination of the season, which before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <note place="margin">A comfort to the traueller.</note> was a fearefull discourager: So I returne backe, to speake of the naturall plants, which following the laborious courses, I was driuen to omit.</p>

especially, wee note Palmeta trees, and in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there are whole grounds or groues of them, the vse whereof is to draw from them a most sweete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant drinke, which we call Palmeta Wine, and as wee approue and like of it to bee toothsome, so likewise in <note place="margin">Good wine sorth of a tree.</note> operation, wee find it wholesome; the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, they do cut into the body of the tree holes, in some more, in some lesse, as the tree is in substance, to whichholes, they place a hollow cane cut sloping to goe the neatlier in, into which the iuyce of the tree distilleth, and is conueid, as in pipes, vnto gourdes set handsomely into the ground reddy to receiue it, which is in lesse then twenty foure houres taken away, and as they please disposed of: now this is of that esteeme, that the vulgar sort may not meddle with, but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall persons, and therefore they will send of this vnto vs, foure or fiue miles distance, as a curteous present; the tast whereof, doth truely resemble white Wine when it comes first ouer into England, hauing the same sweetnes of tast, and in colour, if they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not to be distinguished; onely this is the misery, it will not keepe aboue one day, for if you reserue of it vntill the morning it will grow sowre, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any dilligence that can be vsed; and of this kind there are seuerall sortes and tastes, as there are in white Wines, which the people themselues distinguish by seuerall names; calling some <hi>Sabbagee, Bangee, Tangee,</hi>

making a compounded drinke, which wee can afford to tast, and accept of; and it is made of some corne, <note place="margin">Amade drinke, called Dullo.</note> boild and ordered as wee doe our Ale; they call it <hi>Dullo,</hi> it is not common amongst them, but when the King or principall person will make a feast, he calles all the inhabitants about him, and hauing a great gourd or two, sometimes three, of this liquour in his presence they drinke round, and it is deuided amongst them, making an end of all before they part, and it is of that operation, it will warme their braines, and set their tongues a working: the poore <hi>Fulbye</hi> finding that wee affect it, will many times watch for a priuate conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but if the Blackes meete with him, they will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinke it, and send him home againe, hauing lost his market; Now because I speake of gourdes, which are growing things, it is fit I tell you, they doe grow, and resemble iust that wee call our Pumpion, and in that manner are placed, and carried vpon their walles and houses, being of all manner of different sorts; from <note place="margin">Gowrdes.</note> no bigger then an egge, to those that will hold a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell, and the necessary vse they haue of them, to eate, and drinke, and wash their clothes in, with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very fit occasions, giues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iust cause to preserue them although the meate, or substance that growes within them is to bee throwne away, in regard of the extreame bitternesse, whereof the shell it selfe so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, as no vse can be made, vntill it be perfectly sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned; and they haue likewise growing Pumpions in the selfe same manner wee haue, and in like case they doe conuert to sustenance: But to rise higher from <note place="margin">Locuste.</note> the ground; they haue likewise great store of Locust trees, which growing in clusters of long cods toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> growes to his ripenes,

which the people will seede vpon, especially the younger sort, if they can make shift to get them downe, the trees beeing bigge, and of a good heigth, with this I must ioyne hony, which doth appeare likewise to growe; and the countrey is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full, wherein the people vse one of the ingenious parts I see amongst them, for vpon those great trees, which are growing about their houses, in many places you shall haue them make baskets of reedes and sedge, which they will make fast, on the out bowes of the tree, and in those the Bees <note place="margin">Wild hony.</note> will come and breede, whereof in time they receiue the profit, hauing so many baskets on some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient trees, that in our ignorance, before wee knew it, being distant of, we might conceit it was some fruit the tree had yeelded; also in holes of hollow trees, amongst the woods still bees are plenty, so that another <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> if any were, might in this place and that with plenty, receiue his full of Locust and wild hony.</p>
               <p>And for trees of great and large bodies, they be here, especially one sort, which doth carry vpon a long stalke, a great and round fruite, yeelding a kinde of pleasing pith within: Whereupon the Baboones <note place="margin">Munkies meat.</note> and Munkyes vse to feede; whereof there had neede be store, in regard of their number, as I shall declare hereafter: and some of these trees retaine that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that sixe men by fadoming can hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe: there are other huge trees, one whereof doth carry a stony apple, which being through ripe, to eate is tolerable, and serues if hee fall to feede the wilde <note place="margin">A stony apple.</note> swine, but that is in place, where the Baboone is a stranger: And I will conclude their fruites, with that

which is in most esteeme amongst them; which is a fruite in proportion, much like our bigger sort of chesnuts, flat on both sides, but hath no hard shell on the outside, they call them <hi>Gola,</hi> and we Nuts: the tast of him, when he is bitten, is extreame bitter, but the <note place="margin">This fruite is of great esteeme.</note> operation of him, is with them so set by, that ten is a present for a King: this operation we finde, that after we haue eaten of him downe, notwithstanding his bitter taste, the water wee drinke presently after, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it he out of the Riuer, shall haue a relish like white wine, carrying that sweetnesse, as if it were mixt with suger; and likewise the Tobacco wee take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after, shall haue that sweetenesse one would much admire: other operation we finde none, yet so doe they esteeme them that the auncient persons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lost their teeth, and not able to bite it, haue mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherewithall carryed to bruise it, that they may not be bard of the Iuice, and comfort of it; neyther are they for the common people: Fifty, of these nuts in the habitation where we dwelt, presented to the King, would buy a wife, and many times as a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great present, I haue had sixe of them sent me, howbeit, we neuer sawe any of them grow, neither are they, as they say amongst them, but brought from <note place="margin">They are not growing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limit we saw.</note> another people, and they are of most valew, still the lower, and neerer the mouth, yet there they bee, and the Portingals will make, as if they bring them into the Riuer, by a trade they haue in a great baye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Cacho,</hi> where they meete with a people, that <note place="margin">Great store brought vs, when we were aboue.</note> brings them gold, and many of these nuts; and this we can say, that when we were at the highest part of the riuer, the people brought them abundantly vnto vs, and did wonder much, we made no more esteeme

               <p>The first where of is the Elephant, whose presence indeed, as he is a wilde beast, may euen to a strong person giue a iust amazement; and such is the feare, the countrey people in generall, haue of them, that by all possible meanes, they seeke to shunne and flie from them, yet such is the great abundance the <note place="margin">The Elephant.</note> Countrey doth yeeld of them, that they are ouer all places, and wheresoeuer you come, you shall find the footing and apparent shew they haue been there, though not presently to be seene: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those great abundance of wilde ones, they haue not any of them tame, or vnder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. as in other places of the world they haue, which certainely proceeds from the feare they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of them: much, and great is the spoiles they doe them, both among their corne, and especially in their Cotton grounds, going in small compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies together, whereof I haue seene sixteene verie great ones, besides young ones that suckt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were of middle statures; the proportion <note place="margin">The stature of the great ones.</note> of the greatest I leaue you thus to coniecture of: the reeds or sedge, that grows naturally in euery place, is higher aboue our heads, then the arme of a tall

In the rear comes vp a great company of the biggest sort, as a guard, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any persuing enemy, and in this manner doe they march along: they are very bold, and as we passe in the riuer, when we come neare their troupes, they will get vp into the trees, and stand in gaze vpon vs, and in a kind of collericke humour the great ones will shake the trees, and with his hands clatter the boughes in that fashion, as it doth exceed the strength of a man, to doe the like, barking, and making a noyse at vs, as if they were much offended, and in this manner, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they will follow vs along, and in the night time, where wee ride at an ancker take vp their stands, or lodgings on the mountaine toppes, or on the trees that are aboue vs, whereas we heare their gouernment: <note place="margin">A gouerment amongsts them</note> for many times in the night you shall heare such a noyse of many of their voyces together, when instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one great voyce exalts it selfe, and presently all are

hush, and the noyse is dasht, so as we were wont to say, Maister Constable speakes; likewise when wee are a shore and meete with these troupes, on a sudden the great ones will come forward, and seeme to grin in our faces; but offer vp a gunne, and away they packe. One of our people one day as we came neare the shore in our boate, and a troupe of these shauers, being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on vs, made a shot and kild one of them, which before the bote could get on shore, the others had taken vp betwixt them and carried quite away, but we haue kild of them, which the countrey people doe much desire, and will eate very heartely; wherein I hope neuer to take their part: And lastly let mee tell <note place="margin">The people of the Country eate them.</note> you that wee haue seene in the desert places they vse, trees and plants, wound and made vp together in that artificiall manner, and wrought together with that thicknes ouer head, to keepe away the sun, and shade the ground, which hath bin beaten, &amp; smoothed vnder neath, and all things in the manner and shape of an excellent arbour, which place they haue only vsed, and kept for their dancing and recreation; that no man liuing that should haue come by chance, and seene the same, without knowledge of these vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky things, but would haue confidently supposed, it had, and must haue beene the handy worke of man; which some wayes confirmes the opinion the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard <note place="margin">The Spaniards opinion of them.</note> holds of them, and doth not sticke to write it, that they are absolutely a race and kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in regard they will not bee brought to worke, and liue vnder subiection, refuse to speake, and so he reports of them.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, amongst their multitude of wilde beasts, we haue enquired amongst them: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8205:79"/>
when I was at the highest in the countrey, whether they could tell or report of a Vnycorne, setting foorth vnto them a beast, with one onely horne in his forehead, and certainely they haue told me, that higher within the land there is a beast, which hath one onely horne in the same manner, but describe the beast, to be both about the colour and bignesse of a vallow Deare, and the horne to <note place="margin">The pleoples report of a Vnicorne.</note> be about the length of their arme, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, which is nothing like to the description of a Vnicorne, as he is with vs set out, if there bee any such beast; whereof indeed I am very doubtfull, and so I am come to the last, which is to deliuer, what land fowle, and of that nature, there doe remaine wilde as we haue seene amongst them.</p>

               <p>There is infinite store of another sort of excellent birds which wee call Ginney Hennes, in bignesse <note place="margin">Ginney hens.</note> much about our Phesants, and in beauty answerable; his feathers being all laid ouer him like vnto eyes, in a pleasing fashion, they are all the countrey ouer, and in flockes of many hundreds together; their food is vpon their corne grounds, keeping close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, insomuch as we haue killed eight of them at one shoote, they are an excellent meate, and many of these are brought into England, and giuen as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to those of note, and worthy persons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and keepe them for their rarenesse, as birds of pleasure: And in the very like abundance they haue Patridges, whose colour is not beautifull, so much as our Patridges here; but onely of a darke feather, and these are likewise all the countrey ouer, where it

               <p>And for a finall end doe earnestly desire, that what

Againe the course we run, is allowable by our Lawes, fitting and agreeing with the peacefull time we liue in, opposite to no neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly loue or amity, neither confronting any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Prince, by entring, or intermedling within any forbidden territories, neither is it done in any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or hostile manner, but by the auncient and free Commerse, that vniteth nations, the course of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, a commodious exchange answering to either side, wherein an especiall animation is, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge we haue gained in discouering the golden trade of the Moores in Barbary, which was the first incourager and beginning of this businesse, and for which the Aduentures hitherto haue beene laide, through the vncertainety whereof, those losses and mischances that haue hapned, fell out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now should with a more setled resolution be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

to regaine, by knowledge, what ignorance miscarryed in. And I may ioyne with this, the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conuersation, faire acceptance, and mutuall ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we finde the natiues to embrace vs withall, not onely celaring our owne doubts, which before know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge must of necessity be, but likewise disproouing, and altogether confounding the report and speeches of all those, who, to serue their owne ends, gaue out, the people aboue to bee a bloody and dangerous nation.</p>

               <p>And further we may take into consideration, how the times and seasons of the yeare, are vnto vs disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, that the turbulent and infectious seasons may bee prouided for, and men aduised the better to beare them, and prouide for themselues, whereby (as it shall please God to giue a blessing) those incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences may bee auoyded, which formerly haue beene fallen into, and things more necessary carryed along, which through ignorance heeretofore haue beene neglected, together with diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuses, that by experience, no doubt, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>

And if it please you examine the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is past, which, if I mistake not, may bee this set downe. The first aduenture was lost, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried through want of Care and Iudgement of

those Sea-men and Merchants who had the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, by ouer-much trust of supposed friends, who should at the very best haue beene no otherwise thought and conceited of, then suspicious enimies, <note place="margin">The vagrant Portingall.</note> who haue novv discouered themselues, which will euer stand for a warning to auoyde the like, and trusting them any further: And that is all you haue for that mony.</p>
               <p>The second may some-wayes be laid vppon the Sea-men, whose vnderstanding should haue auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnseasonable times, and especially Discretion should haue led them to haue shunned watering in the very height of vnseasonablenesse; but it may be excused for want of experience, insomuch as there had neuer beene any triall made, so high in the Riuer before to any effect, to discouer the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holsomnesse, with the operation thereof, whereby so many of them lost their liues, and brought again another losse vpon you, wherein the power of God was manifested, by whose onely hand they fell, and those few that returned, were sent to testifie, what they had felt and fallen into, whereby you haue gained a perpetuall knowledge, for obscruing sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable times, for your better proceeding heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the valuation whereof being truly vnderstood, may aduance the imployment, which onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in that losse, to make you satisfaction.</p>
               <p>And for this third and last, wherein mine eyes haue beene a witnesse, how accounts are brought in, and perfected with you, I am ignorant, but I presume, as bad as it was, what with the returne that was made, and the remaynes brought home, of the <hi>Cargazon</hi> that was sent, you cannot (being
