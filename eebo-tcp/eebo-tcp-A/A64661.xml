            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

eight yeares agone, and now upon the desire of such, whose judgements I subscribe unto, and the prevention of other mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Copies,</hi> which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly might be produced, I have been hastened to the printing of them. That which hath given the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, is the mistake late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly published of the <hi>change of his Judgement</hi> in it, <hi>a little before his death:</hi> But by the view of these, I believe the <hi>Authour</hi> will receive satisfaction.

In the vindication of which <hi>two Letters,</hi> being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from me long agone, (which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deferred the publick) I have been importuned to permit them to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>

the Church: this question hath been moved <hi>sub iisdem terminis quibus nunc,</hi> and hath received contrary resolutions; the reason is, that in the <hi>two extremities</hi> of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions held in this matter, there is somewhat true, and somewhat false; <hi>The one</hi> extremity <hi>extends</hi> the benefit of Christs satisfaction <hi>too farre,</hi> as if hereby, God, for his part, were <hi>actually</hi> reconciled to all mankind, and did <hi>really</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge every man from all his sins, and that the reason why all men do not reap the fruit of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, is the want of that faith whereby they ought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that God in this sort did love them: Whence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that God should <hi>forgive</hi> a man his sins, and <hi>justifie</hi> him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he believed, whereas the <hi>Elect</hi> themselves, before their effectuall vocation are said to be <hi>without Christ, and without hope, and to be utter strangers from the Covenants of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> Ephes. 2. 2.</p>

the riches of Christs satisfaction into <hi>too narrow</hi> a room; as if none had any kind of interest therein, but such as were <hi>elected</hi> before the foundation of the World; howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by the Gospel, <hi>every one</hi> be charged to receive the same: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it would follow, that a man should be <hi>bound</hi> in conscience to <hi>believe</hi> that which is <hi>untrue,</hi> and charged to take that wherewith he hath nothing to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Both extremities</hi> then, drawing with them unavoidable absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: The Word of God <hi>(by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, faith is begotten,</hi> Eph. 1. 13.) must be sought uuto by a <hi>middle</hi> course, to avoyd these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
                  <p>For finding out this <hi>middle course,</hi> we must, in the matter of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> carefully put a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of Christ <hi>absolutely</hi> considered, and the <hi>application</hi> thereof to every one in particular: The <hi>former</hi> was <hi>once</hi> done for all, The <hi>other</hi> is <hi>still</hi> in doing: The <hi>former</hi> brings with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41259:9"/>
it <hi>sufficiency</hi> abundant, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the whole debt; the other addes to it <hi>efficacy.</hi> The <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Christ, onely makes the sinnes of mankind <hi>fit for pardon,</hi> which without it, could not well be; the injury done to Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty being so great, that it could not stand with his honour to put it up without amends made. The particular <hi>application</hi> makes the sins of those to whom that mercy is vouchsafed to be <hi>actually pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> for, as all sins are mortal, in regard of the stipend due thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Law, but all do not <hi>actually bring forth death,</hi> because the gracious Promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel stayeth the <hi>execution:</hi> even so all the sinnes of mankind, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>venial,</hi> in respect of the <hi>price</hi> paid by Christ to his Father (so farre, that in shewing <hi>mercy</hi> upon all, if so it were his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, his <hi>justice</hi> should be no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,) but all do not obtain <hi>actual remission,</hi> because most offenders do not <hi>take out,</hi> nor plead their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41259:9"/>
pardon as they ought to do. If Christ had not assumed our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and therein made satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the injury offered to the divine Majesty, God would not have come unto a <hi>Treaty of peace</hi> with us, more than with the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> whose nature the Sonne did not assume: But this way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, God holds out unto us the <hi>golden Scepter</hi> of his Word, and thereby, not onely signifieth his pleasure of <hi>admitting</hi> us unto his presence, and accepting of our <hi>submission,</hi> which is a wonderful Grace, but also sends an <hi>Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi> unto us, and <hi>entreats us that we would be reconciled unto him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>Hence, we inferre against the <hi>first</hi> extremity, that by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this blessed Oblation, God is made <hi>placable</hi> unto our <hi>nature</hi> (which he never will be unto the <hi>Angelical nature</hi> offending) but not <hi>actually</hi> appeased with any, untill he hath received his son, and <hi>put on the Lord Jesus.</hi> As also against

the <hi>latter</hi> extremity, that <hi>all men</hi> may be truly said to have <hi>interest</hi> in the merits of Christ, as in a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> though all do not enjoy the <hi>benefit</hi> thereof; because they have no <hi>will</hi> to take it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>well-spring</hi> of life is set open unto all <hi>(Apoc. 22. 17.) Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him take of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely,</hi> but many have <hi>nothing to draw with;</hi> and <hi>the Well is deep,</hi> Faith is the <hi>vessel</hi> whereby we draw all vertue from Christ, and the Apostle tells us, That <hi>Faith is not of all, (2 Thes.</hi> 3. 2.) Now the <hi>means</hi> of getting this Faith is the <hi>hearing of the word of truth, the Gospel of our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (Ephes. 1. 13.) which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth this general ground for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to build his Faith upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Syllogisme.</hi> What Christ hath <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> for thee, and the Gospel <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth</hi> unto thee, that oughtest thou with all thankfulnesse to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> to the comfort of thy own Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41259:10"/>
But Christ by his death and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience hath <hi>provided</hi> a sufficient remedy for the taking away of all thy sinnes, and the Gospel <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth</hi> the same unto thee. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> thou oughtest to accept, and apply the same to the comfort of thine own Soul.</p>
                  <p>Now this Gospel of salvation many do <hi>not hear</hi> at all, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the Ministery of the Word; and many hearing do <hi>not believe,</hi> or lightly regard it; and many that <hi>do</hi> believe the truth thereof, are so <hi>wedded</hi> to their sinnes, that they have no desire to bee <hi>divorced</hi> from them, and therefore they <hi>refuse</hi> to accept the gratious offer that is made unto them. And yet notwithstanding their refusal on their part, we may truly say, That good things were provided for them on Christs part, and a rich <hi>price was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of a Foole, howsoever he had no heart to use it</hi> (Prov. 17. 16.)</p>

Our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> by that which he hath performed on his part, hath procured a <hi>Jubilee</hi> for the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> and his Gospel is his <hi>Trumpet,</hi> whereby he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim <hi>Liberty to the Captives, and preacheth the acceptable yeare of the Lord</hi> (Luke 4. 18, 19.) If for all this some are so well pleased with their Captivity that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no deliverance, that dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates nothing from the generality of the freedome annexed to that year. If one say to <hi>sinne</hi> his old Master, <hi>(Levites 25. 24. Exod. 21. 5. Deut, 15, 26:) I love thee, and will not go out free,</hi> he shall be <hi>bored</hi> for a slave, and <hi>serve for ever.</hi> But that slavish disposition of his, maketh the extent of the priviledge of that yeare not a whit the <hi>straiter,</hi> because he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the general Grant as well as others; howsoever, he was not <hi>disposed</hi> to take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it: <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is like to a certain King that made a marriage of his Son, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41259:11"/>
sent his servants to those that were bidden to the Wedding with this message; <hi>Behold,</hi> I <hi>have prepared my Dinner; my Oxen, and my fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are killed, and all things are ready, Come to the Marriage,</hi> (verse 4.) If we look to the event. They they that were bidden made light of their entertainment, and went their wayes; <hi>one to his Farme, and another to his Merchandize.</hi> (verse 5.) but that neglect of theirs doth not falsify the word of the King (verse 4.) <hi>viz.</hi> That the Dinner was prepared, and these unworthy Guests were invited thereunto; For what, <hi>if some did not believe, shall their unbelief disannull the Faith, and</hi> truth of God? (Rom. 3. 3, 4.) <hi>God forbid; yea, let God be true, &amp; every man a lyar, as it is written, that thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and overcome when thou judgest. Let not the house of</hi> Israel <hi>say, the way of the Lord is unequall.</hi> For when he cometh to judge them, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality will be found on their side,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41259:12"/>
and not on his. <hi>O house of</hi> Israel, <hi>are not my wayes equal, and your wayes unequal? saith the Lord,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 18. 29, 30.) <hi>The Lord is right in all his wayes, and holy in all his works. All the wayes of our God are mercy and truth;</hi> when we were in our sinnes it was of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy that any <hi>way,</hi> or <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> should be prepared for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. And when the remedy is prepared, we are never the nearer, except he be pleased of his free mercy to <hi>apply</hi> the same to us, that so the <hi>whole praise</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, from the beginning to the end thereof, may intirely be attributed to the <hi>riches of his grace,</hi> and nothing left to sinfull flesh wherein it may rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>freeing</hi> of the Jewes from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of that great deliverance, which the Son of God hath wrought for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Fersia,</hi> who was <hi>Christus Domini</hi> (and herein but a shadow of <hi>Christus Dominus,</hi> the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41259:12"/>
Authour of our Redemption) pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his Proclamation in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Who is amongst you of all his people, the Lord his God be with him,</hi> and let him go up, (2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 36. 23. and 1 <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.) Now it is true, they alone did follow this Calling, whose spirit God had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to go up, <hi>(Ezra</hi> 1. 5.) But could they that remained still in <hi>Babylon,</hi> justly plead, That the Kings Grant was not large enough, or that they were excluded from going up by any clause contained therein? The <hi>matter</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchased by our Saviour Christ lieth open <hi>to all,</hi> all are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to it, none that hath a mind to accept of it, is excluded from it. <hi>The beautifull feet of those that preach the Gospell of peace, do bring glad tidings of</hi> good things to every house where they tread. The first part of their Message be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, Peace to this house, <hi>(Rom. 10. 15. Luke 10. 5. Luke</hi> 17.) But, unlesse God be pleased out of his abundant mercy <hi>to guide our feet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41259:13"/>
into the way of peace,</hi> the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of our Nature is such, that that we run head-long to the <hi>wayes of destruction and misery,</hi> (Rom. 3. 16.) <hi>and the wayes of peace do we not know.</hi> They have not all obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 16. all are not apt to entertain this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of peace, and therefore, though Gods <hi>Ambassadours</hi> make a true ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender of it to all unto whom they are sent, yet <hi>their peace only rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the sons of peace,</hi> but if it meet with such as will not listen to the motion of it, <hi>their peace doth again return unto themselves,</hi> (Luke 10. 6.) The <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the Gospel runneth thus: Apoc. 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is a thirst come,</hi> for him this Grace is speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provided, because none but <hi>he</hi> will take the paines to come; But least we should think this should abridge the largenesse of the offer, a <hi>Quicunque vult,</hi> is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added, and <hi>whosoever will, let him take of the water of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> yet withall this must bee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41259:13"/>
yielded for a certain truth, that it is God who must work in us <hi>to will and to do, of his good pleasure;</hi> and though the call be never so loud and large, yet none can <hi>come except the father draw him, (John</hi> 6. 46.) For the <hi>universality</hi> of the satisfaction derogates nothing from the <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>speciall</hi> Grace in the application: neither doth the speciality of the one any wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the generality of the other. Indeed Christ our Saviour saith <hi>(Joh. 17. 6.) I pray not for the world,</hi> but <hi>for them that thou hast given me:</hi> but the consequence hereby inferred may well be except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against, <hi>viz.</hi> He <hi>prayed</hi> not for the world, Therefore, He <hi>payed</hi> not for the world; Because the latter is an Act of his <hi>satisfaction,</hi> the former of his <hi>Intercession:</hi> which being divers parts of his Priest-hood are distinguishable one from another, by sundry differences. This his <hi>satisfaction</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly give contentment to Gods <hi>justice,</hi> in such sort as formerly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41259:14"/>
hath been declared: His <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> doth solicit Gods <hi>mercy.</hi> The first containes the <hi>preparation</hi> of the remedy necessary for mans salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The second brings with it an <hi>application,</hi> of the same. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the one may well apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the <hi>common nature,</hi> which the son assumed, when the other is a <hi>speciall</hi> Priviledge vouchsafed to such <hi>particular</hi> persons onely, as <hi>the father hath given him.</hi> And therefore we may safely conclude out of all these premisses, That the <hi>Lamb of God offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a sacrifice for the sinnes of the whole world,</hi> Intended by give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient satisfaction to Gods Justice, to make the <hi>nature of</hi> man, which he assumed, a fit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for mercy, and to prepare a <hi>medicine</hi> for the sinnes of the whole world; which should be denied to none that intended to take the benefit of it: Howsoever he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by <hi>applying</hi> this all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent remedy unto every person in particular to make it <hi>effectual</hi> unto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41259:14"/>
the salvation of all, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thereby <hi>actual</hi> Pardon for the sins of the <hi>whole world.</hi> So, in one respect hee may be said to have <hi>died for all,</hi> and in another respect <hi>not</hi> to have died for all; yet so as in respect of his mercy he may be counted a <hi>kind of universal cause</hi> of the restoring of our Nature, as <hi>Adam</hi> was of the depraving of it; For as far as I can discerne, he rightly hits the naile on the head that determineth the point in this manner.</p>

                  <head>AN Answer of the said Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> to some exceptions taken against his aforesaid Letter, as followeth.</head>
                  <p>ICannot sufficiently wonder, why such exceptions should be taken at a <hi>Letter of mine,</hi> which without my privity came to so many mens hands, as if thereby I had confirmed <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisme, Arminianisme,</hi> and I know not what error of Mr. <hi>Culverwels,</hi> which (as you write) is, and hath been, opposed by <hi>many;</hi> yea, <hi>all good men.</hi> The <hi>Papist</hi> (saith one) doth thus distingnish; A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41259:16"/>
of <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) divides the satisfaction and application of Christ. To which, what other <hi>Answer</hi> should I make but this? To hold that <hi>Christ</hi> is the onely Mediator of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the <hi>Saints</hi> are also Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of Intercession, That <hi>Christ</hi> by his Merits hath made satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Father in grosse, and the <hi>Pope by his indulgence,</hi> and his Priests by their Oblations in the Masse do make a particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to particular persons. To joyne thus <hi>partners</hi> with Christ in this manner in the Office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is Popery indeed; But he who, attributing the entire work of the Mediation unto Christ alone, doth yet <hi>distinguish</hi> the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the act of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, the Satisfaction made by him unto God, from the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof communicated unto men, is as far from <hi>Popery,</hi> as he that thinks otherwise is from the <hi>grounds of the Catechisme;</hi> For
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41259:16"/>
that Christ hath so died for all men (as they lay down in the <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Hague) ut reconciliationem cum Deo, &amp; peccatorum remissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem singulis impetraverit,</hi> I hold to be untrue, being well assured, That our Saviour hath obtained at the hands of his father Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Forgivenesse of sinnes, not for the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> but <hi>Elect onely;</hi> and not for them neither, before they be <hi>truly</hi> regenerated, and implanted into himselfe. For, <hi>Election</hi> being nothing else but the purpose of God, resting in his own minde, makes no kind of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the party elected, but onely the <hi>execution</hi> of that Decree and Purpose, which in such as have the use of reason is done by an <hi>effectual calling,</hi> in all by spiritual regeneration, which is the <hi>new birth,</hi> without which no man can <hi>see the Kingdom of God.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>Impetration,</hi> whereof the <hi>Arminians</hi> speak, I hold to be a fruit, not of his Satisfaction, but Intercession; and seeing I have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41259:17"/>
learned from Christs own mouth, <hi>Joh. 17. 9. I pray not for the</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate <hi>World:</hi> I must needs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it a great folly to imagine that he hath impetrated <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and Remission of sinnes for that world. I agree therefore thus farre with Mr. <hi>Aimes</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against <hi>Grevinchovius,</hi> That <hi>application</hi> and <hi>impetration,</hi> in this latter we have in hand, are <hi>of equall extent;</hi> and, That forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes is not by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour impetrated for any unto whom the merit of his death is not <hi>apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in particular. If in seeking to make straight that which was crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Arminians</hi> opinion, he hath bended it too farre the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, and inclined too much unto the <hi>other</hi> extremity, it is a thing, which, in the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>disputation,</hi> hath befallen many worthy men before him; And if I be not deceived, gave the first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to this <hi>present</hi> controversie. But I see no reason why I should be tied to follow him in every step,

                  </p>
                  <p>The main error of the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (vid. Corvin.</hi> in <hi>Defen. Armini.</hi> cap. II.) and of the patrons of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal grace is this, <hi>That God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth</hi> unto every man those means that are necessary unto salvation, both <hi>sufficiently and effectually;</hi> and, That it resteth in the <hi>free will</hi> of every one to receive, or reject the same; For the proof thereof they alledge, as their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, that received Axiome of Christs <hi>dying for all men,</hi> which being rightly understood, makes nothing for their purpose. Some of their <hi>opposites</hi> (subject to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights as well as others) more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward herein then circumspect, have answered this Objection, not by <hi>expounding</hi> (as was fit) but by flat <hi>denying</hi> that famous Axiome: Affirming peremptorily, that <hi>Christ died onely for the Elect,</hi> and for others <hi>nullo modo:</hi> whereby they gave the adverse party advantage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41259:18"/>
to drive them unto this extream <hi>absurdity, viz.</hi> That seeing Christ in no wise died for any, but for the <hi>elect,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> men were bound to believe that Christ died for <hi>themselves,</hi> and that upon pain of damnation for the contrary <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;</hi> Therefore all men were bound to believe: that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were <hi>elected,</hi> although in truth the matter were nothing so:
<q>
                        <l>Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is their hope that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> will be drawn to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>error</hi> of their position, as long as they are perswaded the contrary opinion cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without admitting that <hi>an untruth</hi> must be believed, even by the commandment of him that is <hi>God of truth,</hi> and by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that word, which is the <hi>word of truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Endeavouring therefore to make
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41259:18"/>
one truth stand by another, and to ward off the <hi>blow</hi> given by the <hi>Arminians</hi> in such sort that it should neither bring hurt to the <hi>truth,</hi> nor give advantage to <hi>error,</hi> admit I failed of mine intent, I ought to be accounted rather an <hi>oppugner</hi> than any wise an <hi>abettor</hi> of their <hi>fancies.</hi> That for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</hi> Now for Mr. <hi>Culverwell,</hi> That which I have heard him charged withall, is the <hi>former</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, which in my Letter I did condemne, <hi>viz. That Christ</hi> in such sort did die for all men, that by his death he made an <hi>actuall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement between God and man; and, That the special reason why all men reap not the <hi>fruit</hi> of this reconciliation; is the want of that <hi>faith,</hi> whereby they ought to have believed that God in this sort did love them. How <hi>justly</hi> he hath been charged with this error, <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> can best tell; But if ever he held it, I do not doubt, but he was driven thereunto by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, which he discerned in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41259:19"/>
the other extremity; For what would not a man fly unto rather then yield, that Christ no <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of way died for any <hi>Reprobate,</hi> and none but the <hi>elect</hi> had any kind of title to him, and yet so many <hi>thousand</hi> Reprobates should bee <hi>bound</hi> in conscience to <hi>believe</hi> that he died for them, and <hi>tied</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him for their Redeemer and Saviour; yea, and should be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> to everlasting torments for <hi>want of such a faith,</hi> (if we may call that faith, which is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the word of truth) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they should have <hi>believed</hi> that which in it selfe was most <hi>untrue,</hi> and laid hold of that in which they had no kinde of interest; If they, who dealt with Mr. <hi>Culver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> laboured to drive out one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity by bringing in another, or went about to stop one hole by making two, I should the lesse wonder at that you write, that though he hath been <hi>dealt withall by many brethren,</hi> and for many yeares, yet he could not be drawn
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41259:19"/>
from his errour. But <hi>those stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-blocks</hi> being removed, and the plain word of truth laid open, by which faith is to be begotten, I dare boldly say he doth not hold that <hi>extremity</hi> wherewith hee is charged, but followeth that safe, and <hi>middle course,</hi> which I laid down; for after he had well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what I had written, he <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily thanked the Lord and me,</hi> for so good a resolution of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which for his part he whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved, not seeing how it could bee gainesayed. And so much likewise for Mr. <hi>Culver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for Mr. <hi>Stock's</hi> publick op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be induced to believe that he aimed at me therein; If he did, I must needs say he was deceived, when hee reckoned me amongst those <hi>good men,</hi> who make the universality of <hi>all the elect,</hi> and <hi>all men</hi> to be one; Indeed I wrote but even now, that God did <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> his Decree of Election in <hi>all</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41259:20"/>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41259:20"/>
omnibus mortuus est, tamen specia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter pro nobis passus est, quia pro Ecclesia passus est.</hi> Yea, and in my former writing I did directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; That as in <hi>one respect</hi> Christ might have been said to die for all, so in <hi>another</hi> respect truely said not to have died for all: and my beliefe is, That the <hi>principall</hi> end of the Lords death, was, <hi>that he might gather together in one the Children of God scattered abroad;</hi> (John 11. 52.) and, That for their sakes he did <hi>specially sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himselfe,</hi> that they <hi>also might be sanctified through the truth</hi> (John 17. 19.) And therefore it may be well concluded, That Christ in <hi>a speciall</hi> manner died for these; but to inferre from hence, that <hi>in no manner</hi> of respect he died for any others, is but a very weak colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, specially the <hi>respect</hi> by me expressed being so reasonable, that no sober mind advisedly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, can justly make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of it, <hi>viz. That the Lamb of God offering himselfe</hi> a sacrifice for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41259:21"/>
the sinnes of the world, intended by giving satisfaction to Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to make the <hi>nature</hi> of man which he assumed, a fit <hi>subject</hi> for mercy, and to prepare a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne <hi>medicine</hi> that should, not onely be a sufficient cure for the sinnes of the whole world, but also should be <hi>laid open</hi> to all, and denied to none, that indeed do take the benefit thereof: For he is much deceived that thinkes a preaching of a <hi>bare sufficiency,</hi> is able to yield sufficient ground of <hi>comfort</hi> to a distressed Soule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving a further way to it, and opening a further passage.</p>
                  <p>To bring newes to a <hi>bankrupt</hi> that the <hi>King of Spain</hi> hath trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enough to pay a thousand times more than he owes, may be true, but yields but cold comfort to him the miserable <hi>Debtor:</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency indeed is <hi>requisite,</hi> but it is the word of <hi>promise</hi> that gives comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41259:21"/>
If here exception bee taken, That I make the whole <hi>nature</hi> of man <hi>fit</hi> for mercy, when it is as <hi>unfit</hi> a subject for grace as may be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I answer,</hi> That here <hi>two impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments</hi> do occurre, which give a stop unto the peace, which is to be made betwixt God and man. <hi>The one</hi> respects God the <hi>party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> whose justice hath been in such sort violated by his base Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, that it were <hi>unfit</hi> for his glorious Majesty to put up such an injury without a good <hi>satisfaction. The other</hi> respects <hi>man</hi> the party offending, whose <hi>blindnesse, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,</hi> and <hi>hardnesse of heart</hi> is such, that he is neither sensible of his own <hi>wretchedness,</hi> nor Gods <hi>goodnesse,</hi> that when <hi>God offers</hi> to be reconciled unto him, there must bee much intreaty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to be <hi>reconciled to God,</hi> (2 Cor. 5. 20.) In regard of the <hi>latter</hi> I acknowled with the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, That the naturall man receives not the things of the spirit, for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41259:22"/>
they are foolishnesse to him; neither can he, because spiritually discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (1 Cor. 2. 14.) And this impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not taken away by Christs <hi>satisfaction</hi> (which is a work of his <hi>Priestly</hi> function) but by the <hi>enlightening</hi> of the mind, and <hi>soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> the heart of the sinner, which are effects issuing from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Prophetical,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office</hi> of our Redeemer. When therefore I say, <hi>That by Christs satisfaction</hi> to his Father he made the Nature of Man a fit subject for mercy, I mean thereby, that the <hi>former</hi> impediment arising on Gods part is taken away, that if it were not for the <hi>other</hi> (for the having whereof we can blame none but our selves, and in the <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,</hi> whereof, wee cannot say God hath done us any <hi>wrong)</hi> there were no <hi>let,</hi> but all men might be saved: And if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to extend his mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>all,</hi> as he keeps his <hi>freedome</hi> therein, in <hi>having compassion on whom he will have mercy,</hi> and leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41259:22"/>
others in blindnesse, naturall hardnesse of their own heart, yet the <hi>worth</hi> of Christs satisfaction is so <hi>great,</hi> that his <hi>Justice</hi> herein should be no <hi>loser.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this <hi>Justice</hi> (you will say) be <hi>satisfied,</hi> how comes it to passe that God <hi>exacts payment again</hi> from any? <hi>I Answer,</hi> We must take heed we stretch not our <hi>similitudes</hi> beyond their just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, least at last we drive the matter too farre, and be forced to say (as some have done) That wee cannot see how <hi>satisfaction and forgivenessè can stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and so by denying Christs <hi>satisfaction</hi> be injurious to Gods <hi>justice,</hi> or by denying <hi>remission of sinnes</hi> become injurious to Gods <hi>mercy.</hi> Wee are therefore to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the end of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Gods <hi>Justice</hi> is to make way for Gods <hi>free liberty</hi> in shewing mercy, that so mercy and <hi>Justice</hi> meeting: and embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, God <hi>may be just,</hi> and the <hi>justifier of him that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41259:23"/>
believes in Jesus, (Rom.</hi> 3. 26.) Now the <hi>generall</hi> satisfaction of Christ, which was the <hi>first</hi> act of his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, prepares the way for Gods mercy, by making the sinnes of all mankinde <hi>pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi> the interposition of any barre from Gods Justice notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and so puts the sonnes of men onely in a <hi>possibility</hi> of being justified, a thing denied to the nature of fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> which the sonne was not pleased to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume; But the <hi>speciall application</hi> of this satisfaction vouchsafed by Christ unto those persons onely whom his Father hath <hi>given him out of the world,</hi> which is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, or appertaineth to the <hi>second</hi> Act of his Priest-hood, <hi>viz. his intercession,</hi> produceth this <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia in Actum,</hi> i. e. <hi>procureth</hi> an <hi>actuall</hi> discharge from Gods anger; And maketh <hi>justification,</hi> which before was a part of our <hi>possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> to be a part of our presenr <hi>possession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41259:23"/>
If it be said, It is a great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to the dignity</hi> of Christs death, to make the sinnes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde onely <hi>pardonable,</hi> and brings in a <hi>bare possibility of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, It is a most unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian imagination to suppose the merit of Christs death, being <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applyed</hi> to the Soul of a sinner, produceth no further ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than this. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us that we be not onely <hi>justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but <hi>justified by his bloud,</hi> (Rom. 5. 9.) yet not <hi>simply</hi> as offered on the Crosse, but <hi>through faith in his blood,</hi> (Rom. 3. 25.) that is, through his bloud <hi>applyed by faith. The bloud of Jesus Christ his Sonne,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 1. 17.) <hi>cleanseth us from all sinnes,</hi> yet cleanse it doth not by being <hi>prepared,</hi> but by being <hi>applyed,</hi> prepared it was when hee <hi>poured</hi> it out once upon the Crosse, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> it is when he <hi>washeth</hi> us from our sinnes therein, (Rev. 1. 5.) It is <hi>one thing</hi> therefore to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41259:24"/>
speak of Christs <hi>satisfaction,</hi> in the generall <hi>absolutely</hi> considered; and another thing, as it is <hi>applyed</hi> to every one in <hi>particular;</hi> The consideration of things as they are in their <hi>causes,</hi> is one thing; and as they have an <hi>actuall existence,</hi> is another thing. Things as they are in their <hi>causes,</hi> are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise considerable, but as they have a <hi>possibility</hi> to be. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>Agent</hi> to the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> with all <hi>circumstances</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily required, is it that gives to the thing an <hi>actuall</hi> being. That <hi>disease is curable</hi> for which a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne medicine <hi>may</hi> be found, but <hi>cured</hi> it is not till the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine be <hi>applyed</hi> to the patient; and if it so fall out, that, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine being <hi>not</hi> applied, the party miscarries, We say, He was lost, <hi>not,</hi> becanse his sicknesse was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,</hi> but, because there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>care to apply</hi> that to him that might have helped him.</p>

All <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes have taken a <hi>mortall sicknesse</hi> from their <hi>Father,</hi> which, if it be not remedied, will, without faile, bring them to the <hi>second death:</hi> no medicine under heaven can heale this disease, but onely a <hi>potion confected</hi> of the blood of the Lamb of God, who came <hi>to take away the sinnes of the world;</hi> which, as <hi>Prosper</hi> truly notes, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet quidem in se ut omnibus prosit; sed si non bibitur non medetur.</hi> The vertue thereof is such, that if all did <hi>take</hi> it, all without doubt should be <hi>recovered,</hi> but without takeing it there is no recovery; In the <hi>former</hi> respect it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, That no mans state is so <hi>desperate,</hi> but by this means it is <hi>recoverable,</hi> (and this is the first comfortable newes that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel brings to the distressed Soule) but here it resteth not, nor feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man with such a possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he should say in <hi>his heart, Who shall ascend into heaven to bring Christ from above?</hi> but it brings the word of comfort <hi>nigh

                  <p>IAm much your debtor for those large expressions of your affection to the late. <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and the readinesse to cleare him from some injury done him by Mr. <hi>Thomas Pierce,</hi> in his Answer to a Book of yours. Two eminent men of each <hi>University,</hi> before I heard from you, had sent unto me for their private satisfaction. And now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Letter and directions I have viewed the severall passages tending that way, <hi>Chap. 1. Sect.</hi>

3. 5. <hi>Chap. 3. Sect. 17. 7. Chap. 4. Sect.</hi> 13. which in sum I finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, <hi>viz. That the late Primate of</hi> Armagh <hi>was, though a late, yet a serious Convert: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, a little, or not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death to severall persons, that he utterly rejected all those opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of</hi> Calvin. <hi>That there were evident marks of a change in him. That a little before his death he professed an utter dislike to the whole Doctrine</hi> of Geneva, <hi>in those affairs,</hi> &amp;c. First; it is possible Mr. <hi>Pierces</hi> enformers might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the Doctrine for the <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> which by some in their Sermons hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced accordingly: or if it were of <hi>the Doctrine,</hi> he hath taken a great latitude in saying, <hi>All the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the whole Doctrine.</hi> And the Restriction. <hi>viz. In those affaires,</hi> is somewhat obscure, being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced occasionally upon the speech of one or two of them.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41259:27"/>
howsoever, as to <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> how could he be said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, when <hi>in terminis</hi> he did not professe the defence of either.

with him of most of the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life, as of the several <hi>Books</hi> he had wrote, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Subjects</hi> of them, the occasion of their writing, when some such points (as Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> possibly may meane) came into discourse. And then there was not the least change in him. And it is to be presumed, in that <hi>last Act</hi> of winding up his <hi>whole life,</hi> if there had been any, he would have then mentioned it, and this was but about <hi>five weekes</hi> (which is <hi>a little,</hi> or <hi>not long)</hi> before his death. And it hath bee confirmed to me by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who was at <hi>Ryegate</hi> a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before, as by some Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons, who spake with him of these Subjects a few dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; so that I believe Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> hath not been well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised in publishing this his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>And it is no new thing to have <hi>bookes,</hi> as well as opinions, <hi>laid to his charge which he knew not:</hi> It was presumed in his <hi>life,</hi> and so
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41259:29"/>
the lesse wonder if it be practised after his <hi>death.</hi> There is a book entitled a <hi>Method of Meditation,</hi> which was printed in his name, <hi>Anno</hi> 1651. And, though by his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> to me, it was then publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to be none of his, yet <hi>since his death</hi> (this 1657.) it is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed,</hi> and, notwithstanding the renewing of that Declaration by the <hi>same way</hi> wherein I found him abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it is still sold under his <hi>name</hi> to the great dishonour of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The passage</hi> which Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> is most clear in, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. Where, speaking of <hi>Universal grace</hi> and <hi>redemption,</hi> he saith, <hi>the most Learned Anti-Arminians have been fein to assert it, as well as Arminius. Among us, the late Bishop of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> He should have done well to have named <hi>where</hi> he hath asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in any of his works, <hi>Next, What,</hi> or <hi>who</hi> compelled him, that he was <hi>fein</hi> to do it; and if by that speech <hi>as well as Arminius</hi> he means (according to common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41259:30"/>
As <hi>full,</hi> or in the <hi>same terms</hi> as <hi>Arminius;</hi> it will be the hardest proof of the <hi>three;</hi> whom he scarce ever names in his works: his aime being against <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Disciples. Unlesse that passage in his <hi>Pelagian History</hi> may be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed (wrapped up under the Title of <hi>Britanniae Antiquitates, Pelagius</hi> being a <hi>Britain,</hi> which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have taken out, and printed as a Treatise by it selfe) where he having given us at large the bold and rugged language, with which <hi>Julian,</hi> one of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in defence of his Doctrine, greets the most <hi>mild and meek</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> he addes this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 312.) <hi>Cujus idcirco ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba hic describenda putavi; ut in hoc speculo contemplaretur lector, consimiles nostrorum temporum arde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liones; Thrasoni huic adeo gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, ut in eos, hujus spiritus quasi per Pythagoricam quandam</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Universall</hi> Redemption I have cause to believe there was not any <hi>change</hi> in him from what his judgement was many yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone: and if he were not <hi>totally</hi> according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> must it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be argued, he was <hi>wholly</hi> for <hi>Arminius?</hi> Might not there be a <hi>mean</hi> wherein he might tread more safely according to the <hi>ancient</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Church?</hi> And indeed to deal clearly with you, his <hi>judgement</hi> in this point was in <hi>a middle way</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, both from <hi>yours,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> which if it might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to both your pens and censures, but be a reconciliation between you, (the latter of which I see little hope of;) I might be moved the more willingly to declare it. I do the rather mention this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, As Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> saith, <hi>you call it the chief head of Arminianisme, So</hi> he saith, 'tis that <hi>with which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions in debate must stand, or fall:</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 15. excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his prolixity on it, because <hi>if

this error be once disclaimed by the adversary, all the rest will tumble of their own accord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In a word, I am sorry to find that <hi>heat</hi> between you, which beng <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> and <hi>Neighbours,</hi> is the more <hi>unseemly.</hi> I shall advise you in your reply to endeavour rather to <hi>heal</hi> up the breach, than make it wider; the fruits of the spirit appearing much in <hi>meeknesse</hi> and <hi>Gentlenesse,</hi> &amp;c. and laying aside all <hi>verball a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities</hi> and personal reflections, calmely to fall upon the matter, And so I commend you and your labours to Gods blessing and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and rest</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have lately received from you another book of Master <hi>Pierces,</hi> which I saw not before, <hi>viz. A Correct Copy of Gods decrees, &amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>Postscript</hi> of which I find a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger confirmation of what had been affirmed by him, in relation to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41259:32"/>
late <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> which, at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, I cannot refuse to return you my sense of also.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Authour</hi> is a Stranger to me, but appears to be a man of very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts and <hi>abilities,</hi> and I am sorry he hath been moved to employ them in this particular, in a continued confident declaring the change of opinion in so <hi>Learned and pious a Prelate</hi> (as himselfe worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly styles him,) to whom for ought I know he was a <hi>stranger,</hi> and adding, That what he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affirmed to be <hi>upon a just ground and mature deliberation,</hi> and yet I find no other foundation upon which this is built, than the report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The frequent experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>failing</hi> of which, when it comes to the proof, hath wrought it out of reputation, with prudent men, to depend upon.</p>
                  <p>That which I find in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> of his Postscript, I must <hi>begin with,</hi> wherein he doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, viz. <hi>That whosoever shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41259:32"/>
to hold the Negative, That my Lord Primate of</hi> Armagh <hi>did not declare his rejection of these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which I resist, and which himselfe formerly embraced, will wrong the memory of the Bishop.</hi> As I do not (according to his caveat) take upon me to <hi>prove a Negative,</hi> so I do not understand the ground of this definitive Sentence, upon whomsoever shall adhere to it. I am sure his meaning is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>he doth resist them;</hi> and lesse shew is there, because <hi>the Primate had formerly embraced them;</hi> for a changeablenesse in Doctrine carries in it self a shew of dishonour, <hi>that with him there should be yea and nay:</hi> surely there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of grosse corruption, or dangerous consequence formerly taught and professed by this good <hi>Primate,</hi> that should incurre this censure; And it is too early a conclusive, while they are yet in Dispute between you, and the matter not heard on the <hi>Primates</hi> side; Which I expected not from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41259:33"/>
a person so <hi>ingenuous,</hi> as I read Master <hi>Pierce</hi> to be. And howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the whole implies that the <hi>Primate</hi> had wronged <hi>himselfe,</hi> if not his hearers and readers, in preaching and writing of untruths so long; but much more if he had died without <hi>retracting</hi> them; and that the injury done to him, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>decreed</hi> to lye upon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that shall affirm otherwise of him in either: yet this must not <hi>deterre</hi> or <hi>discourage</hi> me in this service of his vindication, leaving it to the judgemnent of others, Which may be thought lesse <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> The averring his <hi>constancy,</hi> or <hi>inconstancy</hi> in matters of such weight and moment. I shall be contented he do enjoy his opinion, if he will not censure me for not forsaking my own, <hi>viz.</hi> That I think <hi>I should wrong him and my selfe, at least do neither right,</hi> if I should silently let this belief of him passe without putting it to a stand, by producing those <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities</hi> which have prevailed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41259:33"/>
with me to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> which Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> professeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That he published it to the <hi>Immortall honour of that great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> doth not well suit with the expressions in the next breath, calling it an <hi>error which had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest him,</hi> and intimating it to be a <hi>retraction of his aberrations,</hi> or a <hi>penitency of his sins,</hi> which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no sense of, or not expressing it till then, he must have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a great guilt all his life, both in <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> to the subversion, possibly, of many. This if he had found himself guilty of, a <hi>verball retraction</hi> would not have sufficed, but he should have given satisfaction also by his <hi>pen:</hi> His <hi>judgement</hi> having been by that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>beyond the Seas,</hi> which one Sermon in a Church in <hi>London,</hi> or opening his mind to a few in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, could not have <hi>expiated:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would so good a man as he, have rested in it, but with S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> humbly have revoked his error in that way also; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41259:34"/>
none of those pretended <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his change</hi> will say that he gave them that promise or that they did so much as <hi>request</hi> it of him, though they had time enough to have wrote unto him, if omitted in the conference. And certainly Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> (to use his own expression) had <hi>in singlenesse of affection done him more right and honour,</hi> if he had left him wholly to his <hi>works;</hi> which do sufficiently <hi>testifie of him,</hi> rather than thus to bring him upon the Stage after his <hi>death,</hi> and give sentence on him onely upon <hi>hear-say:</hi> There being no necessity in this dispute to have so much as named him. Neither can I think those, any Cordial <hi>friends of the Bishops</hi> (as he stiles them) who have been the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of putting him upon it. And I do remember that the last time he was in <hi>London,</hi> he did expresse a <hi>suspition</hi> of some that came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit him, that they would by <hi>wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his words, make some such use of them, as now appears: who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41259:34"/>
discourses of the like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to him, and whereupon he did confirm at full that which had been his judgement of them formerly.</p>
                  <p>For that of Mr <hi>Pierces</hi> offer of proof <hi>by some learned and grave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who had conference with the Bishop, and will</hi> (as he saith) <hi>be glad to attest the same under their hands:</hi> As I know not what cause there should be of <hi>gladnesse,</hi> or forwardnesse in this Testimony; So when they shall meet with <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> attestations by the like of their own profession, it makes me <hi>sad,</hi> to foresee what a <hi>fire</hi> this may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly kindle among us, (to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of those of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> which I have no mind to <hi>burn</hi> my fingers in, onely I stick firmly to my perswasion in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letter confirmed there by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral probable <hi>Testimonies,</hi> that there was no such <hi>change</hi> as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in him near his death. And if this of Mr. <hi>Piercies</hi> affirmation
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41259:35"/>
should prove to be the <hi>raising of a false report,</hi> (which he ingenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesseth to be <hi>so great an evill,</hi> and doth <hi>so hate and condemne, whether through ignorance, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity:)</hi> this must be of <hi>the first magnitude,</hi> when it hath for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject so eminent and pious a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>whose praise being through the Churches,</hi> and in special, for those his labours tending to those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the whole <hi>Reformed Church</hi> are concerned in it.</p>
                  <p>I find him still puuctually obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his former expression, <hi>viz. rejecting all the Doctrines of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> in which besides the <hi>latitude,</hi> there is this <hi>ambiguity,</hi> whether it be meant according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Beza;</hi> for both were of <hi>Geneva;</hi> between whom in some of these points there was the like difference as between Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> and <hi>Bishop Abbot,</hi> with us, <hi>viz.</hi> In the <hi>Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsarian</hi> opinion, which <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9. 21s Annotat. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Beza</hi> was for, but <hi>Calvin</hi> held it otherwise, as hath been shewed in the <hi>former</hi> Letter. It had been better to have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41259:35"/>
                     <hi>instanced</hi> the particulars of those Doctrines, than thus by <hi>clouding</hi> them in the <hi>Generals</hi> to put us upon <hi>conjectures,</hi> which they should bee.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>onely</hi> point which he names here, is, <hi>That the Primate embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Doctrine of Universal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> and saith, <hi>in that he doth as good as say all.</hi> He doth not assert it from his own knowledge, but saith he hath it from <hi>many most unquestionable persons which had it poured into their eares, by the Primates own mouth.</hi> If it were in a Sermon of his at a Church in <hi>London,</hi> the last he preached in that City, and many moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; (which I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by others is the sense of it) I was present at it, and with me there was no <hi>new thing</hi> observed to have been uttered by him, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from what his judgement was <hi>many yeares</hi> agone, since I had the happinesse to be known unto him. It may be some of these persons produced for witnesses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41259:36"/>
                     <hi>strangers</hi> to him and taking him to be of the other <hi>extremity</hi> might apprehend it as a <hi>retractation,</hi> If they heard him affirming, That by the death of Christ <hi>all men</hi> receive this benefit that they are <hi>salvabiles</hi> or put into a <hi>capacity</hi> of sulvation; That <hi>terms of peace</hi> are procured for <hi>all mankinde,</hi> That <hi>all mens sins are become pardonable, mercy attainable,</hi> (in which state those of the <hi>Angelical</hi> nature which fell, are not.) That there is some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to be made between his <hi>satisfaction</hi> (rightly understood) and his <hi>intercession,</hi> according to that of our <hi>Saviour, I pray for these, I pray not for the world, &amp;c.</hi> It is possible, for ought I know, some such expressions might be his then. But that by this <hi>Universal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> should be understood such an <hi>Universal grace, that the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it, without any distinction, should equally, and alike, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and aplied to</hi> Judas, <hi>which was to</hi> Peter; <hi>and that the onely difference, was, The free-will of</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41259:36"/>
                     <hi>in accepting, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause of thanks to God for his grace in inclining him accordingly,</hi> &amp;c. This I suppose will not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to have been professed by him, either in <hi>this,</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or private <hi>conference</hi> with him. And in this present enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I would not be understood to interpose my selfe in the <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;</hi> or to <hi>affixe</hi> thus much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Piercies</hi> judgement, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to averre, That the <hi>Primate</hi> at his last in this particular differed not from what he had declared for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, which the former tractate, I suppose, will confirm, now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, but not resolved on, when this was first written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> which he saith, <hi>is the summe of what he had said,</hi> viz. <hi>That the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend</hi> Primate <hi>did conform his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the fathers of the Church for the first four Centuries after Christ,</hi> This he might averre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation to these points in controversie, it being the term, or thereabouts, which he accepts of in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41259:37"/>
his answer to the <hi>Jesuit Malones Challenge</hi> in the justfying, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning those twelve points of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, between us and the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> of which one concerning <hi>Free will</hi> is of this <hi>fraternity.</hi> What the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement was of that, is sufficiently declared there, and he continued in the same without any <hi>change</hi> the last time I saw him, by the discourse I had then with him of it: and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we be over-strict) may be admitted within that compasse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted by the <hi>Primate,</hi> at the time when he was consecrated a <hi>Bishop,</hi> to be but in <hi>Anno</hi> 410. and <hi>Prosper</hi> reckons his death, in 433. being then of age, 76.

have been his <hi>glory and honour in preferring truth before error,</hi> in that his supposed imaginary retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I may without offence return the <hi>application</hi> to himselfe; which, with all prudent men, will be much more, his own <hi>commendation,</hi> and though, according to his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he be <hi>innocent,</hi> as to any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary injury; thinking <hi>he did God and him good service:</hi> yet it being a wrong in it selfe, will deserve some <hi>Apology.</hi>

                  <p>I was very glad to hear of your <hi>Grace</hi> his coming over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and now I have a faire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to expresse my thankfull acknowledgement of that great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour wherewith you were pleased to honour me, in bestowing one of your books upon me, <hi>de origine Britannicarum Ecclesiarum;</hi> which I
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41259:52"/>
received from Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudierd</hi> in your <hi>Grace</hi> his name, about the end of Summer last, wherein I do observe not onely your <hi>great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and various reading</hi> manifested at full, but your singular <hi>wisdom</hi> also in reference to the necessitous condition of these times; taking so fair an occasion to insert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the <hi>History of the Pelagian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> so opportunely coming in your way. Your History of <hi>Goteschal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was a piece of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which came forth most seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably; we know what meetings there were in <hi>London</hi> thereupon by some; and to what end, to relieve the reputation of <hi>Vossius,</hi> who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not a little when he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to have alleadged the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Pelagius,</hi> for the <hi>confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Austin:</hi> As also in father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Adrametine Monkes,</hi> the Original of the <hi>Praedestinarian Heresie:</hi> I was at that time upon answering <hi>Corvinus</hi> his defence of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and had dispatcht one digression upon the same argument,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41259:52"/>
and in the issue concluded that it was but a trick of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> to cast the Nick-name of the <hi>Praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinarian</hi> Heresie, upon the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctrine of St. <hi>Austine:</hi> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coming forth of your Gotes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalcus, I was not onely confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, but upon better, and more evident grounds, enabled in a second digression to meet with the <hi>Dictates</hi> of—who endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to justifie the conceit of <hi>Vossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> but upon very weak grounds. Thus I have observed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the hand of God to have gone along with your <hi>Grace,</hi> for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of the cause of his truth, in so precious a point as is the glory of his <hi>Grace.</hi> And I nothing doubt, but the same <hi>hand of our good God</hi> will be with you still, and his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will appear in all things you undertake, whether of your own choice, or upon the motion of others: There being never more need of hearkening unto, and putting in practice our Saviours rule, Be ye wise as Serpents, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41259:53"/>
innocent as Doves. And have I not as great cause to return your <hi>Grace</hi> most hearty thanks, for the <hi>kind Letters</hi> I received in <hi>answer to the motions</hi> I was emboldned to make; had it been but onely to signifie the great <hi>satisfaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereby in divers particulars,</hi> but especially in <hi>two</hi> principal ones; the <hi>one,</hi> the mystery of the <hi>feasts of first fruits opened</hi> to the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantage <hi>of the honour of the Lords day</hi> in the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>the other,</hi> in correcting <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> by a Latine Manuscript of <hi>Caies Colledge;</hi> which since I have gotten into my hands, and taken a Copy thereof, and have caused it to be compared with two other Copies, Manuscripts in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the one in <hi>Magdalene,</hi> the other in <hi>Baliol</hi> Colledge Library; I take no small comfort in the hope I conceive of seeing your <hi>Grace</hi> before your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture into <hi>Ireland,</hi> I heare of a purpose your <hi>Grace</hi> hath to see <hi>Oxford,</hi> and abide some time there, the Lord blesse you, and keep

you, and make his face to shine upon you.</p>

                  <p>FOr mine own part, I never yet <hi>doubted</hi> but took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that as the setting of some whole day apart for Gods solemne Worship was <hi>Juris Divini natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> so that this solemne day should be one in seven, was <hi>juris Divini positivi,</hi> recorded in the fourth <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</hi> And such a <hi>jus divinum positivum,</hi> here I mean, as <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>the Lords Supper</hi> are established, both which lie not in the power of any man, or Angel to change, or alter, wherein me thinks, your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond position is a little too wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, <hi>viz. That this Doctrine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41259:54"/>
then the contrary is to be held the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>And may well be gathered out of her publick liturgy, and the first part of the Homily concerning the place, and time of prayer.</hi> Whereas, you should have said that this is to be held <hi>undoubtedly</hi> the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For if there could be any reasonable doubt made of the meaning of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her <hi>Liturgy,</hi> who should better declare her meaning, than self in her <hi>Homily?</hi> where she pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily declareth her minde. <hi>That in the fourth Commandement God hath given expresse charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath day, which is now our Sunday, they should cease from all weekly and work-day labour, to the intent, that like as God himself wrought six dayes, and rested the seventh, blessed and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified it, and consecrated it to rest, and quietnesse from labour, even so Gods obedient people should use the Sunday holily, and rest from their common, and daily businesse,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41259:55"/>
and also give themselves wholly to heavenly exercises of Gods true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and service;</hi> Than which, what could you devise to say more your self?

                     <hi>relation,</hi> concerning our <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is much <hi>mistaken.</hi> For first where he saith, they did passe when his <hi>Majesties Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> were imployed about the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Church, Anno 1615. and chargeth them with <hi>this strict austerity</hi> (as he termeth it) in the prescript observation of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> he sheweth himself very <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,</hi> there having been no such
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41259:56"/>
Commissioners here at that time, and our Articles having been publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Print <hi>divers years before</hi> the Commissioners (whom hee meaneth) came hither, as Sir <hi>Nathaniel Rich</hi> (who was one of them himself) can sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you. Secondly, where he saith, he is <hi>sure, that till that time the Lords day had never attained such credit as to be thought an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the faith,</hi> he speaks very <hi>inconsiderately.</hi> Hee that would confound the ten <hi>Commandements</hi> (whereof this must be accounted for one, unlesse he will leave us but nine) with the <hi>Articles of the faith,</hi> he had need be put to learn his Catechisme again: And he that would have every thing, which is put into the <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> (agreed upon in the Synod <hi>for the avoyding of diversity of opinions, and for the maintenance of peace, and uniformity in the Church)</hi> to be held for an <hi>Article of the faith,</hi> should do well to tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee hath as yet admitted

                     <note n="a" place="margin">These <hi>two</hi> here instanced were not by way of <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for he did highly approve of <hi>both,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excellent composures, but because they are either for the most part to be reckoned among the <hi>Agenda,</hi> rather then the <hi>Credenda,</hi> or that in both there are some <hi>circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> observed, and exhorted unto, only <hi>for decency</hi> and order, according to the wisdom of the <hi>Church,</hi> which come not within the compasse of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as upon the view of them, without descending to particulars, may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</note> the <hi>Book of the ordination of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and the two volumes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> into his Creed, for sure I am he shall find these received in the Articles of Religion, agreed upon in the Synod held at <hi>London,</hi> 1562. To which Doctor <hi>Heylen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having subscribed, I wonder how he can oppose the conclusion, which he findeth directly laid down in the <hi>Homily</hi> of the <hi>time and place of prayer in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> viz. <hi>God hath given expresse charge to all men that upon the Sabbath-day which is now our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> (for these are the plain words of the <hi>Homily,</hi> which the Doctor with all his Sophistry will never be able to elude) <hi>they shall cease from all weekly, and week-day labour, to the intent thot like as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wrought six dayes, and rested the seventh, and blessed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated it to quietnesse, and rest from labour, even so Gods obedient people should use the Sunday holily, and rest from their common and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse, and also give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41259:57"/>
wholly to the heavenly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Gods true Religion and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> By the verdict of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I am sure the Lords day had obtained such a pitch of credit, as nothing more could be left to the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their Articles, afterward to adde unto it. Thirdly, he shameth not to affirm, That <hi>the whole Book of the Articles of Ireland is now called, in</hi> (which is a notorious untruth.) And lastly, that <hi>the Articles of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>were confirmed by Parliament in this Kingdome,</hi> Anno 1634. where it is well known that they were not so much as once <hi>propounded</hi> to either House of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, or ever <hi>intended</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. The truth is, that the House of Convocation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Canons, <hi>for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of their agreement with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in the confession of the same Christian faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments</hi> (as they themselves professe) and for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in the world, did receive
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41259:57"/>
and approve of the Articles of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but that either the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> were ever called in, or any <hi>Articles,</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> at all, were ever here confirmed by Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> may well be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Doctor <hi>Heylins fancies.</hi> Which shews what little credit he deserves in his <hi>Geography,</hi> when he brings us newes of the <hi>remote</hi> parts of the world, that tells us so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths of things so <hi>lately,</hi> and so <hi>publickly</hi> acted in his <hi>Neigbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41259:58"/>
that some such presumptious affections have been lately published,</hi> and stiling that person a <hi>presumptuous (I</hi> may say also <hi>uncharitable) observator,</hi> that should presume to enter into the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> breast, and aver that the <hi>abrogating</hi> of them (to use his own term) was the cause of his <hi>carrying a sharp tooth,</hi> bearing <hi>a grudge</hi> (and that a mortal one) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the L. <hi>Lieutenant Strafford.</hi> The Language with which through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he pleaseth himselfe, might have been easily returned, but in regard such <hi>pen-combats</hi> are unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and unfitting betweene those of the <hi>same profession</hi> (onely gratefull to the adversary of both) I have left it to the <hi>prudence</hi> of a <hi>third</hi> person, who hath a <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> opportunity in his History to clear the whole, in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <hi>moderation</hi> of all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages between Mr. L. <hi>Strange and him.</hi>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41259:59"/>
calling it a rescue from the <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowes</hi> of Dr. <hi>Bernard;</hi> Indeed as to the person smitten, if they were <hi>any,</hi> they could be <hi>no other,</hi> for he then <hi>turned the back, and not the face,</hi> being an <hi>Anonymus,</hi> and so appearing in that <hi>disguise,</hi> I might be excused as he was that smote a <hi>Clergy man,</hi> riding without his <hi>Priestly habit,</hi> A man that walks in the dark, may meet with a <hi>knock</hi> by such as <hi>mean</hi> him <hi>no harm.</hi> And indeed the apprehension of the Authours <hi>disaffection</hi> so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to this <hi>Eminent, and pious Primate</hi> in the endeavours thus to <hi>blemish</hi> him, (whom <hi>the whole refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church</hi> hath an high esteem of,) gave it suspected, both to my self, and others to have been some <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or <hi>Agent of the Sea of</hi> Rome, though as yet, not any one (as I hear of) hath <hi>moved his tongue against that true</hi> Israelite <hi>at his</hi> Exit <hi>hence,</hi> and I am sorry to see his sole <hi>enemies to be those of his own house,</hi> and profession.</p>
                  <p>But for the <hi>confirmation</hi> of what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41259:59"/>
is here affirmed by the <hi>Primate,</hi> that the <hi>Articles of</hi> Ireland <hi>were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in,</hi> though his above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Letter is <hi>sufficient</hi> to all uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed persons, yet for the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> more full satisfaction, I shall give you a brief <hi>Narrative</hi> of the whole matter, being then a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Convocation.</p>
                  <p>First in the <hi>House of the Clergy,</hi> which was then in the <hi>Cathedrall of</hi> St. <hi>Patricks Dublin,</hi> there was a motion made for the <hi>reception anew</hi> of the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all unanimous were for the <hi>affirmative,</hi> excepting <hi>two,</hi> who went out. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time the whole house of the <hi>Clergy</hi> being called into the <hi>Quire,</hi> where the <hi>Bishops</hi> sate, and the same thing again <hi>propounded</hi> to them, they all stuck to their former vote, excepting <hi>seven.</hi> The intent of the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> being by this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently understood, and it appearing, there was no need of any such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> having been An. 1615. fully and formally established, <hi>(viz.</hi> signed by <hi>Arch-Bishop Jones,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41259:60"/>
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> of the House of the Bishops in Convocation, by the <hi>Prolocutor</hi> of the House of the Clergy in their names, and signed by the then <hi>Lord Deputy Chichester,</hi> (by order from <hi>King James</hi> in his name) that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was no more <hi>repeated,</hi> onely the <hi>Primate</hi> was consulted with, concerning the <hi>approving</hi> and <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of the Articles of <hi>England also,</hi> to which he readily consented, there being no <hi>substantial</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, to which he had subscribed himself voluntarily, long before in <hi>England,</hi> and conceiving it to be without any prejudice to the other.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the <hi>first Canon</hi> (being all that was done in relation to them) was drawn up, the <hi>Primate approved</hi> it, and <hi>proposed</hi> it selfe (as <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Synod)</hi> in the House of the Bishops, commended it to the House of the Clergy, where by his motion many assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more readily, they all gave their Votes, <hi>man by man,</hi> excepting
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41259:60"/>
one person, who suspended his, out of the <hi>suspition</hi> that some might make that construction, which is the <hi>observators</hi> conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Now the chief argument, which the <hi>observator</hi> (if I may not call him Dr. <hi>Heylin)</hi> spends himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is from what he hath <hi>picked</hi> out of the words of the Canon, where they do not onely <hi>approve,</hi> but <hi>receive</hi> the Articles of <hi>England,</hi> from thence he inferres a <hi>superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing</hi> of those, and so an <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating</hi> of these of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I answer, there was not a reception of the one <hi>instead</hi> of the other, but the <hi>one with the other,</hi> and there being no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>substance,</hi> but onely in <hi>method</hi> number of subjects deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and other <hi>circumstantials,</hi> it argues no more an abrogation than that doth of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> by our reception of the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s, wherein some points are more <hi>enlarged,</hi> or that the reception into our use the form of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> according to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41259:61"/>
Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> abrogates that of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> being the <hi>shorter;</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I see, but if for the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation</hi> of our <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>other reformed Churches;</hi> We should <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> and <hi>receive their</hi> Articles of Religion, and they receive <hi>ours,</hi> it were no abrogating of <hi>either.</hi> And the <hi>difference</hi> in them being onely in <hi>circumstantials,</hi> and not in substance, all might be called <hi>one confession,</hi> That as of <hi>many</hi> Seas <hi>one</hi> Ocean, of many <hi>National</hi> Churches one <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, so of many forms of Canfessions, but one faith amongst them.</p>
                  <p>That Argument from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles speech of <hi>making void the old Covenant by speaking of a new,</hi> or taking in the <hi>first</hi> day of the week to be the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> instead of the <hi>last,</hi> when but one of the seven was to be kept, doth not fit the case: for in these there was a <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induction,</hi> and reception of the one <hi>for</hi> the other: but in the <hi>Canon,</hi> the Articles of <hi>England</hi> are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not <hi>instead,</hi> but <hi>with</hi> those of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41259:61"/>

                     <hi>A Letter of the late</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Grayes Inne,</hi> containing his judgement of the ordination of the Ministry in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Received this following Letter from the late <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> not long before his death, which (at the desire of some <hi>prudent men,</hi> and of <hi>different</hi> opinion in the subject of it) I have been moved to <hi>publish,</hi> which indced was <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to me by him for that <hi>end,</hi> and I do it the rather <hi>now,</hi> in regard somewhat hath been <hi>mistaken</hi> in the discourse of it, to his prejudice on <hi>both sides:</hi> So that without <hi>breach of trust</hi> I could no longer detain it. The <hi>occasion</hi> of it was this, there was given
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41259:62"/>
me by an <hi>Honourable person</hi> a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, containg a report raised of the said <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> concerning his <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>ordination beyond the Sea,</hi> which he prayed me to send unto him, which is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <q>Mr.—asked the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> upon occasion of an ordination, what he thought of them that were ordained by Presbyters? he said he judged their ordination to be null, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them as Lay-men. He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, what he conceived of the Churches beyond the Sea. The Bishop answered, he had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable thoughts of them in <hi>France.</hi> But as for <hi>Holland,</hi> he questioned if there was a Church amongst them, or not: or words fully to that purpose. This Dr.—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently reports. </q>This paper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the earnest desire of the said person, I sent inclosed to the <hi>Lord Primate,</hi> being then <hi>out</hi> of Town, from whom immediately I received <hi>this answer,</hi> containing <hi>his judgement</hi> of the <hi>ordination</hi> of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41259:63"/>
Ministery <hi>of the reformed Churches</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                     <q>Touching Mr.—<hi>I cannot call to mind that he ever proposed unto me the Questions in your Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, neither do I know the Doctor—who hath spread that report;</hi> But for the <hi>matter it self,</hi> I have ever declared my opinion to be, That <hi>Episcopus &amp; Presbyter, gradu tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum differunt, non ordine;</hi> and consequently, that in places where Bishops cannot be had, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Presbyters standeth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, yet on the other side holding as I do, that a Bishop hath supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in degree above a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you may easily judge that the ordination made by such Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as have severed themselves from those Bishops, unto whom they had sworne Canonical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, cannot possibly by me be excused from being Schismatical; And howsoever, I must needs think that the Churches, which have no Bishops, are thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41259:63"/>
very much defective in their Government, and that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>France,</hi> who, living under a Popish power, cannot do what they would, are more excusable in this defect than the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that live under a free State: yet for the testifying my Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with these Churches (which I do love and honour as true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church Universal.) I do professe that with like affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I should receive the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament at the hands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ministers, if I were in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as I should do at the hands of the <hi>French</hi> Ministers, if I were in <hi>Charentone.</hi>

That wherein the Discipline of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> is defective, they would by all possible means redresse, and reform it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselves to the ancient custome of the Discipline of Christ, which hath continued from the Apostles time, that so they may remove all opinion of singularity, and stop the mouth of malice it selfe,</p>

                  <p>In a word, If the <hi>ordination of Presbyters in such places where Bishops cannot be had,</hi> were not <hi>valid,</hi> the late Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> had a hard task to maintain themselves to be <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> who were not <hi>Priests,</hi> for their Ordination was no other, And for this, a passage in the <hi>History of

Scotland,</hi> wrote by the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> is observable, <hi>viz.</hi> That when tke <hi>Scots Bishops</hi> were to be consecrated by the <hi>Bishops of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Bath,</hi> here at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don house,</hi> An. 1609. he saith, A question was moved by Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> touching the consecration of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops, who, as he said, <hi>must first be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Presbyters, as having received no ordination from a Bishop.</hi> The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Doctor <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft,</hi> who was by; maintained, <hi>That thereof there was no necessity, seeing where Bishops could not be had, the ordination given by the Presbyters must be esteemed lawfull, otherwise that it might be doubted if there were any lawfull vocation in most of the reformed Churches, This applauded to by the other Bishops,</hi> Ely <hi>acquiesced, and at the day, and in the place appointed, the three</hi> Scottish Bishops <hi>were consecrated by the above-said three English Bishops,</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> forbearing for another cause there mentioned.</p>

Now though the <hi>ordination of Presbyters</hi> in this case of necessity be granted to be valid, yet I have heard this <hi>learned Primate</hi> wonder at the neglect found in the <hi>late Presbyterian</hi> way of ordation, <hi>viz.</hi> That at <hi>imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands,</hi> they neither used the ancient form of words, with which the first framers of it were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ordained, nor used any other to that sence in their room, at least there is no order, or direction for it. For suppose the words of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> to the Apostles, (John 10. 21, 21.) at their ordination were scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled at, <hi>viz. Receive the holy Ghost, whose sins thou dost forgive are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given: and whose sins thou dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are retained,</hi> (which rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, gave no just cause) yet why might not the next words have been continued? <hi>viz. and be thou a faithfull dispenser of the word of God, and of his holy Sacraments, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost:</hi> or the other words upon the solemne delivery of the <hi>Bible,</hi> into the hands of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41259:68"/>
ordained; <hi>Take thou authority to preach the word of God, and to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the holy Sacraments in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where thou shalt be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi> I can imagine no cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the use of one of these, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be because they had been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there, as if in this sense, <hi>old things must be done away;</hi> and <hi>all must be new.</hi> To impose hands (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the injunction of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and to have it accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prayer and thanksgiving for the person, is <hi>well done</hi> (wich in the <hi>former constitution</hi> was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly observed before, and after it) but why should the formal trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Authority also in the name of Christ for the power of officiating <hi>be left undone,</hi> if the scruple in the <hi>instrumental</hi> cause be satisfied, why might it not have been prevented in the <hi>formall,</hi> who might have <hi>freely given</hi> what they had <hi>received.</hi> Now to give the <hi>seal</hi> of ordination (as some please to call <hi>imposition of hands)</hi> without any expresse <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> annexed, or <hi>grant</hi> of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

                  <p>Now for the <hi>other clause</hi> of his <hi>judgement,</hi> which he leaves unto me to <hi>judge,</hi> what in reason I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be <hi>his,</hi> I leave it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to the judgement of others: All that can give any offence, is that term of <hi>Schisme.</hi> But in regard it is not <hi>directly</hi> determined, but onely that he could not be an <hi>Advocate</hi> to <hi>excuse</hi> it; and being delivered in that <hi>Latitude,</hi> that it is dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous whether <hi>forreigne</hi> (to which the question chiefly relateth) or <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick, former</hi> times, or <hi>latter,</hi> may take the application.

                  <p>IN <hi>Doctrine</hi> he did fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the same more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in the <hi>Articles of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The <hi>discipline</hi> and <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> of both, he did also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the publick prayers, as while he lived at <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheda</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41259:72"/>
observed in his <hi>family,</hi> so he had them in estimation to his <hi>last;</hi> And the last time he was in <hi>London</hi> upon the occasion of some rash groundlesse rumours raised of him to the contrary, (to his <hi>no small grief)</hi> he gave his judgement accordingly to an <hi>Honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> wrote with his <hi>owne hand,</hi> which he shewed unto me; He had constantly prayers in his family <hi>four</hi> times a day; At <hi>six</hi> in the <hi>morning,</hi> and <hi>eight</hi> at <hi>night,</hi> they were such, wherein the <hi>gifts</hi> of those, who were his <hi>Chaplains</hi> were exercised, but before Dinner and Supper in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> was the forenamed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so observed; Indeed he was not so <hi>rigid,</hi> as to tie all men in the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> to an absolute necessary use of it, or in the <hi>publike,</hi> that a Sermon was not to be heard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that did precede; And for the <hi>healing</hi> or <hi>preventing</hi> of those distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and divisions, which have been among <hi>Ministers</hi> as others, and the moderating of each <hi>extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in relation to the use of it

whereby there might be a return of that wished-for <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> which of late years we have been <hi>strangers</hi> to, He conceived some prudent moderate <hi>accommodation</hi> might have been thought of (and yet may) by <hi>wise men,</hi> in order to the present continuance of the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi> part of it, (each side yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding somewhat, after the example of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>circumstantials)</hi> which might have better borne the name of a <hi>reformation,</hi> than thus to have a <hi>totall suppression</hi> of it, whereby <hi>with the intention of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up the Tares, the Wheat hath been rooted up also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for some arbitrary <hi>innovations,</hi> not within the compasse of the rule, and order of the book, he did not affect, and <hi>often wished</hi> they had not been introduced, as foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the issue of it, what was <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> he readily observed, but did not take upon him to introduce any <hi>Rite,</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi> upon his own opinion of <hi>decency,</hi> till the Church had judged it so; and thought they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41259:73"/>

                     <hi>And for bowing at the Name of Jesus,</hi> though he censured not those that did, either in <hi>our,</hi> or other <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, according to the <hi>custome</hi> of each, yet he did not conceive the <hi>injunction</hi> of it could be founded upon that of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> Phil. 2. 10. and wondred at some <hi>learned</hi> mens assertions, that it was the <hi>Exposition of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> upon it, And as the wise composers of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> gave no direct injunction for it there, so in <hi>Ireland</hi> he withstood the putting of it into the <hi>Canon,</hi> Anno 1634.</p>

                  <p>For <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> he was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Saint <hi>Paul to magnifie his own office,</hi> by two several <hi>Tractates</hi> he hath published, (none being more able to defend the <hi>ancient</hi> right of it) for which he was by Letters <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned,</hi> by some of the most <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> persons of his own <hi>profession,</hi> yet how <hi>humbly</hi> without any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> to himself, and the eminent <hi>degree</hi> he had obtained in it, did he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41259:75"/>
declare his judgement, is evident by the above-said <hi>Tractates,</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> before mentioned, And his <hi>prudence</hi> in the present <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation</hi> of things in that Treatise of his, viz. <hi>The reduction of it to the form of Synodical Government,</hi> for the <hi>prevention of that disturbance, which did afterwards arise about it,</hi> is as apparent also; if others concerned in these transactions had been of that <hi>moderation, humility,</hi> and <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> the wound given, might have been <hi>healed</hi> before it grew <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Annual Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Articles of the faith, such as the <hi>Nativity, Passion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> of our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were fit to be observed (which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, in his time were <hi>in use through the whole Catholick Church</hi> of Christ) and is now in some <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> as a means to keep them in the <hi>memory</hi> of the vulgar, (according to the <hi>pattern</hi> of Gods injunction to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Old Testament, for the

                     <hi>Types</hi> of them) appeared sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be his judgement, by his <hi>then constant preaching</hi> upon those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Friday</hi> before <hi>Easter</hi> (i e. the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> East <hi>in old Saxon,</hi> signifying <hi>rising)</hi> appointed for the remembrance of the <hi>Passion</hi> of our Saviour, he did duely at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> observe as a <hi>solemn fast,</hi> (inclining the rather to that <hi>choice</hi> out of <hi>Prudence, and the security from censure,</hi> by the then custome of having Sermons beyond their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary limit in <hi>England;)</hi> when (after the publick prayers of the Church) he first preached upon that subject, <hi>extending</hi> himselfe in <hi>prayer</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beyond his ordinary time, which we imitated, who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the duties of the day, and which being known to be his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> custome, some from <hi>Dublin,</hi> as other parts, came to partake of it; which most excellent <hi>Sermons</hi> of his upon that occasion, he was by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Godly Religious</hi> persons importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much for the publishing of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41259:76"/>
them, and his <hi>strict</hi> observation of this <hi>fast</hi> was such, that neither <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> that extraordinary paines would he take the least <hi>refreshment,</hi> till about six a Clock, and which did not excuse him from Preaching again on <hi>Easter day,</hi> when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly had a Communion.</p>
                  <p>That Tractate of his, entitled, <hi>The Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> was the summe of two, or three Sermons, which I heard him preach at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> at that <hi>Festivall,</hi> when we celebrate the <hi>birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he was for the often publike reading of the <hi>ten Commandements,</hi> and the <hi>Creed,</hi> before the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, according to the custome of other reformed Churches, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose none can doubt of, and not onely that, which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> but the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> his book of the <hi>three Creeds</hi> sufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade it.</p>
                  <p>What his judgement was of the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> his practice
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41259:76"/>
shewed it in the constant conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his prayer before Sermon with it. And his approbation of that gesture of <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was often apparent before many witnesses.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>confirmation of Children</hi> (which <hi>Calvine, Beza, Piscator,</hi> and others do much commend, and wish it were restored among them) he was not wanting in his observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an ancient laudable <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> by which was <hi>occasioned</hi> the more frequent having in <hi>memory</hi> the principles of religion, with the yonger sort. At his <hi>first publike</hi> giving notice of the time of that his intention, (it having been long <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used</hi> in <hi>Ireland)</hi> he made a large speech unto the people of the <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> of it, the <hi>prudence</hi> of the first reformers in purging it from <hi>Popish superstitions,</hi> with the <hi>end</hi> of it, and then such youths presented to him, who could repeat the publike <hi>Catechisme</hi> were confirmed, and so often afterwards, and indeed the apprehension of his <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:41259:77"/>
moved the <hi>Parents</hi> much, to desire that their Children might <hi>by him</hi> receive <hi>that Benediction,</hi> which was seconded with <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> instruction, that stuck to them when they came to further yeares.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>publike Catechisme,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the summe of the <hi>Creed,</hi> the 10. <hi>Commandements,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of the Sacraments,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised by some for its <hi>plainnesse,</hi> he thought <hi>therefore</hi> to be the more profitable for the <hi>vulgar;</hi> And at <hi>Drogheda</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> gave me or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders every Lords day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, (beside the Sermon which was not omitted) to explain it.</p>
                  <p>He was very exemplary in the careful observation of the <hi>Lords day</hi> in his <hi>family;</hi> The Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him in the forenoon, being constantly <hi>repeated</hi> in the <hi>Chappel</hi> by his Chaplain, about five of the Clock in the <hi>afternoon,</hi> unto which many of the <hi>Town</hi> resorted.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Habits,</hi> he observed such, which were <hi>accustomed</hi> by those of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41259:77"/>
his profession; for the <hi>Organ,</hi> and the <hi>Quire,</hi> he continued them as he found them in use before him. And as in <hi>all things,</hi> so in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wearing <hi>Garments,</hi> he was a <hi>Pattern of gravity,</hi> approving much of a <hi>distinctive</hi> Apparel in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that way.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for the <hi>Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as he was in <hi>An.</hi> 1634. (being then the <hi>Primate)</hi> the chief guide in their establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so before he was a Bishop, <hi>An.</hi> 614. being then a Member of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> he was employed as a principal person for the <hi>Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and drawing up such <hi>Canons</hi> as concerned the Discipline, and Government of the Church, and were to be treated upon by the Arch-Bishops and Bishops, and the rest of the Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (divers taken out of the Statutes, Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunctions, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>England,</hi> 1571.) which I have lately found, <hi>written then with his own hand.</hi> The <hi>two first</hi> of which being in these words.</p>

1. <hi>That no other form of Liturgy, or Divine service, shall be used in any Church of this Realm; but that, which is established by Law, and comprized in the book of Common-Prayer, and Administrations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, &amp;c. 2. That no other form of Ordination shall be used in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but which is contained in the book of ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, allowed by Authority, and hitherto practized in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, make it apparent that his judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many of the above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned subjects, was the same in his <hi>yonger,</hi> as <hi>Elder years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet notwithstanding all this, there were <hi>alwayes</hi> some, and <hi>still</hi> are too many, who are apt to <hi>blurre</hi> him with the title of a <hi>Puritane,</hi> (which is is one occasion of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement) though in none the sense of it is more <hi>uncertain</hi> then in his <hi>application,</hi> and from none a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lustre would be given unto it than by his <hi>reflexion.</hi> In whom, with his conformity to the <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,

Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> labour in <hi>writing,</hi> constancy in <hi>preaching</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the errours of <hi>Popery,</hi> and such as <hi>border</hi> upon it, so much <hi>humility, holinesse,</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> and other fruits of the spirit did so eminently shine. Indeed I have seen divers <hi>Letters,</hi> wrote unto him from those, who heretofore were so aspersed, full of respect, and large expressions of their <hi>love</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and many receiving <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> have concurred with him in the abovesaid particulars, his humility and meeknesse prevailing more then others strict austerity, but how that said <hi>Title</hi> could be fixed on <hi>him,</hi> I am yet <hi>to seek,</hi> unlesse it bear a <hi>better sense</hi> than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of it will own.</p>
                  <p>Nay, some of the <hi>simpler</hi> sort, hearing of a conjunction of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> have thought they could not be parted in him, though most of his <hi>Sermons,</hi> as well as his <hi>writings,</hi> sufficiently clear him that way. I remember many yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41259:79"/>
the late Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> wrote unto him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> of a strong rumour then raised of him here at <hi>Court,</hi> That he was <hi>turned a Papist</hi> (presumed to be by a Letter of some Popish Priest from thence.) But it fell out to be at the <hi>same</hi> time, or <hi>immediately</hi> after he had in two Learned <hi>Sermons</hi> given his judgement at large, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> was meant by <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the 17, and 18, of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which in the <hi>return</hi> of his answer to that report he did <hi>affirm,</hi> and was his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his last, though the reply made to him did not consent in that.</p>
                  <p>I am not a stranger to such a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> of some of the <hi>Romish party,</hi> a little before his death, for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the <hi>like rumour,</hi> by some <hi>Letters</hi> wrote unto him from some of eminency among them, which I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain any further to mention.</p>
                  <p>And thus upon this occasion I have endeavoured to prevent for the <hi>future,</hi> any more injurious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of him, by an <hi>impartial</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, according to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

For the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of which, it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that such as do consent in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials,</hi> for matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> would consider of some <hi>conjunction</hi> in point of <hi>Discipline,</hi> that private interest and <hi>circumstantials,</hi> might not keep them thus far asunder.</p>

               <p>For his <hi>small Catechisme</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to take notice, that there was a false one Printed without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and is still sold for his.
