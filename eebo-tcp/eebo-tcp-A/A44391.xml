            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. How a childe may be helped in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation of his Letters.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y aim being to diſcover the old Art of teaching Schoole, and how it may be improved in every part ſuteable to the years and capacities of ſuch children as are now commonly taught; I ſhall firſt begin my diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a petty-Schoole, &amp; here or elſe where I ſhall not buſie my ſelf or Reader about what a childe of an extraordinary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſs, and having a teacher at home, may attain unto, and in how ſhort a ſpace, but onely ſhew how a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of various wits may be taught all together with abundance of profit and delight to every one, wch is the proper and main work of our ordinary Schooles.</p>
            <p>Whereas then, it is uſual in Cities and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32573:3"/>
greater Towns to put children to Schoole about four or five years of age, and in Country villages, becauſe of further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not till about ſix or ſeven; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>The ſooner a child is put to School, the better it is,</hi> both to prevent ill habits, which are got by play and idleneſs, and to enure him betimes to affect learning and well doing. Not to ſay, how the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of parents lives, ſhould make them careful of their Childrens early e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, which is like to be the beſt part of their patrimony, what ever good thing elſe they may leave them in this World.</p>
            <p>I obſerve that betwixt three and four years of age a childe hath great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to peep into a book, and then is the moſt ſeaſonable time (if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may be had otherwiſe) for him to begin to learn; and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps then he cannot ſpeak ſo very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, yet the often pronouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his letters, will be a means to help his ſpeech, eſpecially if one take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in what organ or inſtrument he is moſt defective, and exerciſe him chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly in thoſe letters which belong unto it.</p>
            <p>Now there are five organs or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſpeech, in the right hitting of which, as the breath moveth from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32573:3"/>
through the mouth, a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of every letter is made, viz. the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the roof of the mouth, and the throat; Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which if one rank the twenty four letters of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Alphabet, he ſhall find that <hi>A, E, I, O, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> proceed by degrees from the throat, along betwixt the tongue and the roof of the mouth to the lips contracted, and that <hi>Y</hi> is ſomewhat like <hi>I,</hi> being pronounced with other let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but if it be named by it ſelf, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſome motion of the lips. <hi>B, F, M, P, W,</hi> and V conſonant, belong to the lips. <hi>C, S, X, Z,</hi> to the teeth. <hi>D, L, N, T, R,</hi> to the tongue. <hi>B, H, K, Q,</hi> to the roof of the mouth. But the ſweet and natural pronunciation of them is gotten rather by imitation then precept, and therefore the teacher muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give every letter its diſtinct and clear ſound, that the childe may get it from his voice, and be ſure to make the child open his mouth well as he uttereth a letter, leſt otherwiſe he drown or hinder the ſound of it. For I have heard ſome foreiners to blame us <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men</hi> for neglecting this mean to a plain and audible ſpeaking, ſaying, that the cauſe, why we generally do not ſpeak ſo fully as they, proceeded from an ill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32573:4"/>
habit of mumbling, which children got at their firſt learning to read; which it was their care; therfore to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy betimes, and ſo it ſhould be ours, ſeeing <hi>Pronounciation is that that ſets out a man, and is ſufficient of it ſelf to make one an Oratour.</hi>

         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>Chap. II. How a childe may be taught with delight to know all his letters in a very little time.</head>
            <p>THe uſual way to begin with a child, when he is firſt brought to Schoole, is to teach him to know his letters in the Horn-book, where he is made to run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the letters in the Alphabet or Chriſt-croſs-row both forwards &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, until he can tel any one of them, which is pointed at, and that in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> character.</p>
            <p>This courſe we ſee hath been very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in a ſhort time, with ſome more ripe witted children, but othres of a ſlower apprehenſion (as the moſt and beſt commonly are) have been thus learning a whole year together, (and though they have been much chid and beaten too for want of heed) could ſcarce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32573:4"/>
tell ſix of their letters at twelve moneths end, who, if they had been taught in a way more agreeable to their meane apprehenſions (wch might have wrought more readily upon the ſenſes, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their mindes with what they did) would doubtleſſe have learned as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if not as faſt as the quickeſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore mention ſundry ways that have been taken to make a childe know his letters readily, out of which the diſcreet Teacher may chuſe what is moſt likely to ſuit with his Learner.</p>
            <p>I have known ſome that (according to Mr. <hi>Brinſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y's</hi> direction) have taught lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones to pronounce all the letters, and to ſpell pretty well, before they knew one letter in a book; and this they did, by making the childe to ſound the five vowels <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> like ſo many bells up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fingers ends, and to ſay which finger was ſuch or ſuch a vowel, by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. 2 Then putting ſingle conſonants before the vowels, [leaving the hardeſt of them till the laſt] and teaching him how to utter them both at once, as <hi>va, ve, vi, vo, vu, da, de, di, do, du.</hi> 3. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by putting the vowels before a conſonant to make him ſay, <hi>as, es, is, os, us, ad, ed, id, od, ud.</hi> Thus; they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſyllables of two or three, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32573:5"/>
more letters, till a child hath been pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nimble in the moſt. But this is rather to be done in a private houſe, then a publick Schoole; how ever this manner of exerciſe now and then amongſt little Scholars will make their leſſons more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The greateſt trouble at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of children is to teach them how to know their letters one from another, when they ſee them in the book altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; for the greatneſſe of their number and variety of ſhape do puzle young wits to difference them, and the ſence can but be intent upon one ſingle object at once, ſo as to take its impreſſion, and commit it to the imagination and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Some have therefore begun but with one ſingle letter, and after they have ſhewed it to the childe in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, have made him to finde the ſame any where elſe in the book, till he knew that perfectly; and then they have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another in like manner, and ſo gone through the reſt.</p>
            <p>Some have contrived a piece of ivory with twenty four flats or ſquares, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which was engraven a ſeveral letter, and by playing with a childe in throwing this upon a table, and ſhewing him the letter onely which lay uppermoſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32573:5"/>
have in few dayes taught him the whole Alphabet.</p>
            <p>Some have got twenty four pieces of ivory cut in the ſhape of dice, with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter engraven upon each of them, and with theſe they have played at vacant hours with a childe, till he hath known them all diſtinctly. They begin firſt with one, then with two, afterwards with more letters at once, as the childe got knowledge of them. To teach him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſpell, they would place conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants before or after a vowel, and then joyn more letters together ſo as to make a word, and ſometimes divide it into ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, to be parted or put together; now this kind of letter ſport may be profitably permitted among you beginers in a School &amp; in ſtead of ivory, they may have white bits of wood, or ſmall ſhreads of paper or paſt-board, or parchment with a letter writ upon each to play withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some have made pictures in a little book or upon a ſcroll of paper wrapt upon two ſticks within a box of iceing-glaſs, and by each picture have made three ſorts of that letter, with which its name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth; but thoſe being too many at once for a childe to take notice on, have proved not ſo uſeful as was intended.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32573:6"/>
Some likewiſe have had pictures and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters printed in this manner on the back ſide of a pack of cards, to entice children, that naturally love that ſport, to the love of learning their books.</p>
            <p>Some have writ a letter in a great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon a card, or chalked it out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a trencher, and by telling a child what it was, and letting him ſtrive to make the like, have imprinted it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his memory, and ſo the reſt one after another.</p>
            <p>One having a Son of two years and a half old, that could but even go about the houſe, and utter ſome few gibber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh words in a broken manner; obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him one day above the reſt to be buſied about ſhells, and ſticks, and ſuch like toys, which himſelf had laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a chair, and to miſſe any one that was taken from him, he ſaw not how, and to ſeek for it about the houſe; became very deſireous to make experiment what that childe might preſently attain to in point of learning; Thereupon he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little wheel, with all the Capital Romane letters made upon a paper to wrap round about it, and fitted it to turn in little a round box, which had a hole ſo made in the ſide of it, that onely one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be ſeen to peep out at once;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32573:6"/>
This he brought to the childe, &amp; ſhowed him onely the letter O, and told him what it was; The childe being overjoyed with his new gamball, catcheth the box out of his Fathers hand, and run's with it to his playfellow a year younger then himſelf, and in his broken language tell's him there was an O, an O; And when the other asked him where, he ſaid, in a hole, in a hole, and ſhewed it him; which the leſſer childe then took ſuch notice of, as to know it againe ever after from all the other letters. And thus by playing with the box, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring concerning any letter that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſtrange to him, what it was, the childe learnt all the letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet in eleven dayes, being in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter <hi>A B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> C,</hi> and would take pleaſure to ſhew them in any book to any of his acquaintance that came next. By this inſtance you may ſee what a propenſity there is in nature betimes to learning, could but the Teachers apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their young Scholars tenuity; and how by proceeding in a cleare &amp; facil method, that all may apprehend, every one may benefit more or leſs by degrees. According to theſe contrivances to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward children, I have publiſhed <hi>a New Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi>; in the firſt leafe, whereof I have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32573:7"/>
ſet the Roman Capitalls (becauſe that Character is now moſt in uſe, &amp; thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the moſt eaſie to be learn't) and have joyned therewith the pictures or images of ſome things whoſe names begins with that letter, by which a childs memory may be helped to remember how to call his letters; as A, for an Ape, B. for a Bear, &amp;c. This Hieroglyphicall deviſe doth ſo affect Children (who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally forward to communicate what they know) that I have obſerved them to teach others, that could not ſo readily learn, to know all the letters in a few houres ſpace, by asking them, what ſtands A. for? and ſo concerning other letters backwards and forwards, or as they beſt liked.</p>
            <p>Thus when a childe hath got the names of his letters, &amp; their ſeveral ſhapes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in a playing manner, he may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taught to diſtinguiſh them in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing leaf, which containeth firſt the greater, and then the ſmaller Roman Characters, to be learned by five at once or more, as the childe is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them; other Characters I would have forborn, till one be well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe, becauſe ſo much variety at the firſt doth but amaze young wits, and our Engliſh characters, (for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32573:7"/>
the moſt part) are very obſcure, &amp; more hard to be imprinted in the memory. And thus much for the learning to know letters; we ſhall next (and according to Order in Teaching) proceed to an eaſie way of diſtinct ſpelling.</p>

            <head>Chap III. How to teach a childe to ſpell diſtinctly.</head>
            <p>THe common way of teaching a childe to ſpell, is, after he know's the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his Alphabet, to initiate him in thoſe few ſyllables, which conſiſt of one vowell before a conſonant, as, <hi>ab, eb, ib, ob ub, &amp;c.</hi> or of one vowel after a conſonant, as, <hi>ba, be, bi, bo, bu, &amp;c.</hi> in the Horn-book, &amp; thence to proceed with him by little and little to the bottom of the book, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him twice or thrice over till he can ſay his leſſon, and then putting him to a new one.</p>
            <p>In which courſe I have known ſome more apt children to have profited prety well, but ſcarce one often, when they have gone thorow the book, to be able to ſpell a word that is not in it; And ſome have been certaine years daily exerciſed in ſaying leſſons therein, who after much endeavour ſpent, have been accounted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32573:8"/>
meer block-heads, and rejected alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as uncapable to learn any thing; whereas ſome Teachers that have aſſayed a more familiar way, have profeſſed, that they have not met with any ſuch thing as a Dunſe amid a great multitude of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Schollars.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is <hi>Tullies</hi> obſervation of old, and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his aſſertion of latter years, that it is as natural for a childe to learn, as it is for a beaſt to go, a bird to fly, or a fiſh to ſwim, and I verily beleeve it, for the nature of man is reſtleſſely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know things, and were diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements taken out of the way, and meet helps afforded young learners, they would doubtleſs go on with a great deal more cherefulneſs, and make more proficiency at their books then uſually they do; And <hi>could the Maſter have the diſcretion to make their leſſions familiar to them, children would as much delight in being buſied about them, as in any other ſport, if too long continuance at them might not make them tedious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe that have gone a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way to reading, I ſhall onely mention Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> the latter of whom I have known to have taught lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children not much above four years old to read diſtinctly in the Bible, in ſix
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32573:8"/>
weekes time, or under; their books are to be had in print, but every one hath not the art to uſe them. And Mr. <hi>Cootes</hi> Engliſh-School-Maſter ſeem's rather to be fitted for one that is a Maſter indeed, then for a Scholar.</p>
            <p>Beſides the way then which is uſuall, you may (if you think good) make uſe of that which I have ſet down in the new Primar to help little ones to ſpell readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let a childe be well acquainted with his vowells, and made to pronounce them fully by themſelves, becauſe they are able to make a perfect ſound alone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Teach him to give the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or force of the conſonants, and to take notice how imperfectly they ſound, except a vowel be joyned with them. Both theſe are ſet apart by themſelves. (p. 2.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. Proceed to ſyllables made of one conſonant ſet before a vowel (Sect, 5.) and let him joyne the true force of the conſonant with the perfect ſound of the vowel, as to ſay, <hi>ba, be, bi, bo, bu, &amp;c.</hi> Yet it were good to leave <hi>ca, ce, ci, co, cu,</hi> and <hi>ga, ge, gi, go, gu,</hi> to the laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the valor of the conſonant in the ſecond and third ſylables doth differ from that in the reſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:32573:9"/>4. Then exerciſe him in ſyllables made of one vowel ſet before one conſonant, (Sect. 6.) as to ſay, <hi>ab, eb, ib, ob, ub, &amp;c.</hi> till he can ſpell any ſyllable of two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, backwards or forwards, as, <hi>ba, be; bi, bo, bu; ab, eb, ib, ob, ub; ba, ab; be, eb; bi, ib; bo, ob; bu, ub</hi>; and ſo in all the reſt comparing one with another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And if to any one of theſe ſyllables you adde a letter, and teach him how to joyne it in ſound with the reſt, you will make him more ready in ſpelling; as, if before <hi>a b</hi> you put <hi>b,</hi> and teach him to ſay <hi>bab</hi>; if after <hi>ba,</hi> you put <hi>d,</hi> and let him pronounce it <hi>bad,</hi> he will quickly be able to joyne a letter with any of the reſt, as, <hi>nip, pin, but, tub, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To enure your young-Scholar to any, even the hardeſt ſyllable, in an eaſie way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Practiſe him in the joyning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants that begin ſyllables, (Sect. 7.) ſo as that he may give their joynt forces at once; thus,</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed him to ſound <hi>bl</hi> or <hi>br</hi> together, make him to pronounce them, and a vowel with them, <hi>bla, bra, ble, bre,</hi> and ſo in any of the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then practiſe him likewiſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants that end ſyllables, (Sect. 8.) make him firſt to give the force of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32573:9"/>
joyned conſonants, and then to put the vowels before them; as, <hi>ble</hi> with the vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els before them ſound <hi>able, eble, ible, oble, uble,</hi> to all which you may prefix other conſonants and change them into words of one ſyllable, as, <hi>fable, peble, bible, noble, bubble:</hi> (with a <hi>b</hi> inſerted or the <hi>like.</hi> Where obſerve that e in the end of many words, being ſilent, doth qualifie the ſound of the foregoing vowel, ſo as to make words different from thoſe that have not <hi>e</hi>; as, you may ſee <hi>made,</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth quite from <hi>mad, bete</hi> from <hi>bet, pipe</hi> from <hi>pip, ſope</hi> from <hi>ſop,</hi> and <hi>cube</hi> from <hi>cub.</hi> Whereby I think them in an error, that leave out <hi>e</hi> in the end of words, and them that in pronouncing it make two ſyllables of one, in <hi>ſtable, bible, people, &amp;c.</hi> which judicious Mr. <hi>Mulcaſter</hi> will not allow.</p>
            <p>In this exerciſe of ſpelling you may do well ſometimes to make all the young beginners ſtand together, and poſe them one by one in all ſorts of ſyllables, till they be perfect in any; and, to make them delight herein,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let them ſpell many ſyllables toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which differ onely in one letter; as, <hi>and, band, hand, land, ſand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Teach them to frame any word of one ſyllable, by joyning any of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32573:10"/>
which go before vowels, with thoſe that uſe to follow vowels, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in vowels betwixt them; as, <hi>black, block; clack, clock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this they may do afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, having ſeverall looſe letters made and given them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or divide in a ſporting manner, which I may rightly terme the Letter-ſport.</p>
            <p>When a childe is become expert in joyning Conſonants with the vowels, then take him to the Diphthongs (Sect. 9.) and there,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Teach him the naturall force of a Diphthong (which conſiſts of two vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els joyned together) and make him to ſound it diſtinctly by it ſelf; as, <hi>ai, ei, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let him ſee how it is joyned with other letters, and learne to give its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nountiation together with them, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him how the ſame Diphthong differs from its ſelf ſometimes in its ſound, and which of the two vowels in it hath the greateſt power in pronouncation, as, in <hi>people e</hi> ſeemeth to drown the <hi>o.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides thoſe words in the Book, you may adde others of your own, till by many examples the childe do well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend your meaning, and ſo, as that he can boldly adventure to imitate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32573:10"/>
you, and practiſe of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus after a childe is throughly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the true ſounding of the vowels and conſonants together, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſpelling of words, firſt of one ſyllable (Sect. 10.) then of two (Sect. 11.) then of three (Sect. 12.) then of four (Sect. 13.) in all which let him be taught how to utter every ſyllable by it ſelf truly and fully, and be ſure to ſpeak out the laſt. But in words of more ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, let him learn to joyne and part them according to theſe profitable rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Engliſh ſyllable may ſometimes conſiſt of eight letters, but never of more, as, <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 In words that have many ſyllables, the conſonant between two vowels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the latter of them; as, Hu-mi-li-tie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſonants which are joyned in the beginning of words, are not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the middle of them; as, <hi>My-ſte-ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſonants which are not joyned in the beginning of words, are to be parted in the middle of them; as, <hi>for-get-ful-neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If a conſonant be doubled in the middle of a word, the firſt belong's to the ſyllable foregoing, and the latter to the following; as, <hi>poſ-ſeſ-ſi-on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:32573:11"/>6. In compound words, every part which belongeth to the ſingle words, muſt be ſet by it ſelf; as, <hi>In-a-bi-li-ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe rules have I here ſet down rather to informe the leſs skilful teacher, how he is to guide his learner, then to puzle a childe about them, who is not yet ſo well able to comprehend them.</p>
            <p>I have alſo divided thoſe words in the Book, to let Children ſee how they ought to divide other polyſyllable words, in which they muſt alwayes be very carefull (as I ſaid) to ſound out the laſt ſyllable very fully.</p>
            <p>To enable a child the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any word he meets withall in reading, I have ſet down ſome more hard for pronuntiation; (Sect. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) in often reading over which he may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to help his utterance; and the Maſter may adde more at his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, till he ſee that his willing Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar doth not ſtick in ſpelling any, be it never ſo hard.</p>
            <p>And that the child may not be amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with any thing in his book, when he cometh to read, I would have him made acquainted with the pauſes, (Sect. 15.) with the figures, (Sect. 16.) nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall letters, (Sect. 17.) Quotations (Sect. 18.) and Abbreviations Sect. 19) which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32573:11"/>
being but a work of few houres ſpace, may eaſily be performed after <hi>he can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſpell,</hi> which when he can do, he may profitably be put to reading, but not before; for I obſerved it a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in ſome of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Scholars, (whoſe way was to teach to read preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpelling at all) that when they were at a loſſe about a word, they made an imperfect confuſed ſound, in giving the force of the conſonants, which if they once miſſed they knew not which way to help themſelves, to find what the word was, whereas if after a childe know his letters, he be taught to gather them into juſt ſyllables, and by the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſyllables together to frame a word, (which as it is the moſt antient, ſo certainely it is the moſt naturall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of teaching) he will ſoon be able, if he ſtick at any word in reading, by the naming of its letters, and pronouncing of its ſyllables to ſay what it is, and then he may boldly venture to read without ſpelling at all, touching the gaining of a habit whereof, I ſhall proceed to ſay ſomewhat in the next chapter.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:32573:12"/>
            <head>Chap. IIII. How a child may be taught to read any Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Book perfectly.</head>
            <p>THe ordinary way to teach children to read is, after they have got ſome knowledge of their letters, &amp; a ſmatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome ſyllables and words in the horn-book, to turn them into the <hi>ABC.</hi> or Primar, and therein to make them name the letters, and ſpell the words, till by often uſe they can pronounce (at leaſt) the ſhorteſt words at the firſt ſight.</p>
            <p>This method take's with thoſe of promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wits, but many of more ſlow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, not finding any thing to affect them, and ſo make them heed what they learne, go on remiſſely from leſſon to leſſon, and are not much more able to read, when they have ended their book, then when they begun it. Beſides, the <hi>ABC.</hi> being now (I may ſay) gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thrown aſide, and the ordinary Primar not printed, and the very fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls of chriſtian Religion (which were wont to be contained in thoſe books, and were commonly taught chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at home by heart before they went to Schoole) with ſundry people (almoſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32573:12"/>
in all places) ſlighted, the matter which is taught in moſt books now in uſe, is not ſo familiar to them, and therefore not ſo eaſie for Children to learn.</p>
            <p>But to hold ſtill to the ſure foundation, I have cauſed the Lords Prayer (Sect. 20.) the Creed (Sect. 21.) and the ten Commandements (Sect. 23.) to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Roman character, that a childe having learned already to know his letters and how to ſpell, may alſo be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated to read by them, which he will do the more cheerfully, if he be alſo inſtructed at home to ſay them by heart.</p>
            <p>As he read's theſe, I would have a childe name what words he can at the firſt ſight, and what he cannot, to ſpell them, and to take notice what pauſes and numbers are in his leſſon. And to go them often over, till he can tell any tittle in them, either in or without the book.</p>
            <p>When he is thus well entered in the Roman character, I would have him made acquainted with the reſt of the characters now in uſe (Sect. 23.) which will be eaſily done, by comparing one with another, and reading over thoſe <hi>ſentences, Pſalms, Thankeſgivings,</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> (which are printed in greater
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32573:13"/>
and leſſe characters of ſundry ſorts) till he have them pretty well by heart.</p>
            <p>Thus having all things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne reading Engliſh made familar to him, he may attaine to a perfect habit of it. 1. By reading <hi>the ſingle Pſalter.</hi> 2. <hi>The Pſalmes in meeter.</hi> 3. <hi>The Schoole of good manners,</hi> or ſuch like eaſie books, which may both profit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light him. All which I would wiſh he may read over at leſt thrice, to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as the words, leave an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his mind. If any where he ſtick at any word (as ſeeming too hard) let him marke it with a pin, or the dint of his nayle, and by looking upon it againe, he will remember it.</p>
            <p>When he can read any whit readily, let him begin the Bible, and read over the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> (and other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hiſtories in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are moſt likely to delight him) by a chapter at a time; But acquaint him a little with the matter beforehand, for that will intice him to read it, and make him more obſervant of what he read's. After he hath read, aske him ſuch generall Queſtions out of the Story, as are moſt eaſie for him to anſwer, and he will the better remember it. I have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32573:13"/>
known ſome, that by hiring a child to read two or three chapters a day, and to get ſo many verſes of it by heart, have made them admirable proficients, and that betimes, in the Scriptures; which was <hi>Timothies</hi> excellency, and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers great commendation. Let him now take liberty to exerciſe himſelf in any Engliſh book (ſo the matter of it be but honeſt) till he can perfectly read in any place of a book that is offered him; and when he can do this, I adjudge him fit to enter into a <hi>Grammar</hi> Schoole, but not before.</p>
            <p>For thus learning to read Engliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, I allow two or three years time, ſo that at ſeven or eight years of age, a child may begin Latine.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. V. Wherein children, for whom the Latine tongue is thought to be unneceſſary, are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed after they can read Engliſh well.</head>
            <p>IT is a fond conceit of many, that have either not attained, or by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32573:14"/>
own negligence have utterly loſt the uſe of the Latine Tongue, to think it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unneceſſary for ſuch children to learn it, as are intended for Trades, or to be kept as drudges at home, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about husbandry. For firſt there are few children, but (in their playing-years, and before they can be capable of any ſerious employment in the meaneſt calling that is) may be ſo far grounded in the Latine, as to finde that little ſmattering they have of it, to be of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe to them, both for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Engliſh Authors (which abound now a dayes with borrowed words) and the holding diſcourſe with a ſort of men that delight to flant it in Latine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beſides I have heard it ſpoken to the great commendation of ſome Countries, where care is had for the well education of children, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Peaſant (almoſt) is able to diſcourſe with a ſtranger in the Latine tongue; and why may not we here in <hi>England</hi> obtain the like praiſe, if we did but as they, continue our children at the Latine Schoole, till they be well acquainted with that language, and thereby better fitted for any calling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:32573:14"/>Thirdly, And I am ſorry to adde, that the non-improvement of childrens time after they can read Engliſh any whit well, throweth open a gap to all looſe kinde of behaviour; for being then (as it is too commonly to be ſeen, eſpecially with the poorer ſort) taken from the Schoole, and permitted to run wildeing up and down without any control, they adventure to commit all manner of lewdneſſe, and ſo become a ſhame and diſhonour to their Friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>If theſe or the like reaſons therefore might prevail to perſwade them that have a prejudice againſt Latine, I would adviſe that all children might be put to the Grammar-Schoole, ſo ſoon as they can read Engliſh well; and ſuffered to continue at it, till ſome honeſt calling invite them thence; but if not, I would wiſh them rather to forbear it, then to become there an hinderance to others, whoſe work it is to learn that profitable Language. And that they may not ſquander away their time in idleneſs, it were good if they were put to a Writing-Schoole, where they might be, Firſt helped to keep their Engliſh, by reading of a chapter (at leaſt) once a day; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32573:15"/>
ſecond. taught to write a fair hand; and thirdly afterwards exerciſed in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique, and ſuch preparative Arts, as may make them compleatly fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe any ordinary calling. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus trained up in a way of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they will afterwards prove more eaſily plyable to their Maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch as few Grammar-Schooles of note will admit children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, till they have learn't their Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; the teaching of that book, alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh for the moſt part a work for a Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Schoole, where many that undertake to teach it, being altogether ignorant of the Latine Tongue, do ſorrily performe that taske, and ſpend a great deal of time about it to little or no purpoſe. I would have that book, therefore by ſuch let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and left to the Grammar-School, as moſt fitting to be taught there onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is intended as an introduction of Grammar, to guide children in a way of reading, writing, and ſpeaking Latine, and the Teachers of the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-Art are moſt deeply concerned to make uſe of it for that end. And in ſtead of the Accidents, which they do neither underſtand nor profit by, they may be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32573:15"/>
benefitted in reading Orthodoxal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes and other Books, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Duties of a Chriſtian, ſuch as are <hi>The Practiſe of Piety, The Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Quietneſſe, The whole duty of Man</hi>; and afterwards in other delightful books of Engliſh Hiſtory; as, <hi>The Hiſtory of Queen Elizabeth</hi>; or Poetry, as <hi>Herberts Poems, Quarl's Emblems</hi>; and by this means they will gain ſuch a habit and delight in reading, as to make it their chief recreation, when liberty is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And their acquaintance with good books will (by Gods bleſſing) be a means ſo to ſweeten their (otherwiſe ſowr) natures, that they may live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably towards themſelves, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably converſe with other perſons.</p>
            <p>Yet if the Teacher of a Petty-Schoole have a pretty underſtanding of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue, he may the better adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to teach the Accidents, and proceed in ſo doing with far more eaſe and profit to himſelf and learner, if he obſerve a ſure method of grounding his children in the Rudiments of Grammar, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to ſpeak and write familiar Latine, which I ſhall hereafter diſcover, having firſt ſet down ſomewhat how to remedy that defect in reading Engliſh,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32573:16"/>
with which the Grammar-Schooles are very much troubled, eſpecially, where there is not a good Petty-Schoole to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that work afore-hand. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed further, I will expreſſe my minde in the two next chapters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the erecting of a Petty-Schoole, and how it may probably flouriſh by good Order and Diſcipline.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of the founding of a Petty-Schoole.</head>
            <p>THe Petty-Schoole is the place where indeed the firſt Principles of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and learning ought to be taught, and therefore rather deſerveth that more encouragement ſhould be given to the Teachers of it, then that it ſhould be left as a work for poor women, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe neceſſities compel them to undertake it, as a meer ſhelter from beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</p>
            <p>Out of this conſideration it is (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) that ſome nobler ſpirits, whom
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32573:16"/>
God hath enriched with an over-plus of outward means, have in ſome places whereunto they have been by birth (or otherwiſe) related, erected Petty-Schoole-houſes, and endowed them with yearly ſalaries; but thoſe are ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate towards the maintenance of a Maſter and his familie, or ſo over-cloyed with a number of Free-Scholars, to be taught for nothing, that few men of parts will daigne to accept of them, or continue at them for any while; and for this cauſe I have obſerved ſuch weak foundations to fall to nothing.</p>
            <p>Yet if any one be deſireous to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards ſuch an eminent work of charity, my advice is, that he erect a Schoole and dwelling houſe together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of a Market-Town, or ſome populous Country-Village, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate it with a ſafe yard adjoyning to it, if not with an Orchard or Garden, and that he endow it with a ſalery of (at leaſt) twenty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof all ſuch poor boyes as can conveniently frequent it, may be taught <hi>gratis,</hi> but the more able ſort of neighbours may pay for childrens teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if the Schoole was not free; for they will find it no ſmall advantage to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32573:17"/>
have ſuch a Schoole amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Such a yearly ſtipend and convenient dwelling, with a liberty to take young children to board, and to make what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he can beſt by other Scholars, will invite a man of good parts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the charge, and excite him to the diligent and conſtant performance of his duty; eſpecially, if he be choſen into the place by three or four honeſt and diſcreet Truſtees, that may have power alſo to remove him thence, if by his uncivil behaviour, or groſe neglect he render himſelf uncapable to perform ſo neceſſary a ſervice to the Church and Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>As for the Qualifications of one that is to be the Teacher of a Petty-Schoole, I would have him to be a Perſon of a pious, ſober, comely and diſcreet behaviour, and tenderly affectionate towards chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, haveing ſome knowledge of the Latine Tongue, and abilitie to write a fair hand, and good skil in Arithmetick, and then let him move within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his own orb, ſo as to teach all his Scholars (as they become capable) to read Engliſh very well, and afterwards to write and caſt accounts. And let him not meddle at all with teaching the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32573:17"/>
except onely to ſome more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wits, which are intended to be ſet forwards to learn Latine, and for ſuch be ſure that he ground them well, or elſe diſmiſſe them as ſoon as they can read diſtinctly, and write legibly, to the Grammar School.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here have cloſed my diſcourſe; and ſhut up this Petty-Schoole, were it not that I received <hi>a model for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Students</hi> from a worthy friends hands (&amp; one that is moſt zealouſly and charitably addicted to advance Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to help it in its very beginnings to come forwards to its full Riſe) by which I am encouraged to addreſſe my remaining words to the Godly-minded Truſtees and Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for ſo good a work, (eſpecially to thoſe amongſt them that know me, and my School-endeavours) and this I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſt of them, that as they have happily contrived a Model for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Students, and brought it on a ſuddain to a great degree of perfection, ſo they would alſo put to their hands for the improvement of Schoole-learning, without which ſuch choiſe abilities as they aim at in order to the Miniſtry can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be obtained. And for the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32573:18"/>
firſt foundation of ſuch a work, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to offer my adviſe, that in ſome convenient places, within and about the City, there may be Petty-Schooles erected, according to the number of wards, unto which certain poor children out of every Pariſh may be ſent, and taught <hi>gratis,</hi> and all others that pleaſe to ſend their children thither may have them taught at a reaſonable rate, and be ſure to have them improved to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of what they are capable. And I am the rather induced to propound ſuch a thing, becauſe that late eminent, Dr. <hi>Bathurſt</hi> lately deceaſed, Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> and ſome others yet living did out of their own good affection to learning, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at their own charge to promote the like.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of the diſcipline of a Petty-Schoole.</head>
            <p>THe ſweet and orderly behaviour of Children addeth more credit to a Schoole then due and conſtant Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe this ſpeaketh to every one that the Childe is well taught, though (perhaps) he learn but little; and good manners indeed are a main part of good education. I ſhall here therefore take occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat concerning the Diſcipline of a Petty-Schoole, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the further Diſcourſe of Childrens Manners to Books that treat purpoſely of that ſubject: as, <hi>Eraſmus de moribus, Youths Behaviour, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let every Scholar repair to Schoole before eight a clock in a morning, or in caſe of weakneſſe before nine; and let him come fairly waſhed, neatly combed, and hanſomly clad, and by commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cleanneſſe, and ſhewing it to his fellowes, make him to take pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32573:19"/>
of himſelf to go neat and comely in his clothes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let ſuch as come before Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time take liberty to recreate themſelves about the Schoole, yet ſo as not to be ſuffered to do any thing, whereby to harm themſelves, or Schoole-fellowes, or to give offence, or make diſturbance to any neighbour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Schoole-time calleth, let them all go orderly to their own places, and there apply themſelves diligently to their books, without noyſe, or running about.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Maſter cometh into the Schoole, let them all ſtand up, and make obeyſance ſo likewiſe when any ſtranger cometh in) and after notice taken who are abſent; let one that is moſt able read a chapter, and the reſt attend, and give ſome littlt account of what they heard read; Then let him that read, ſay a ſhort prayer fitted for the Schoole, and afterwards let every one ſettle to his preſent taske.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The whole Schoole may not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be divided into four formes; whereof the firſt and loweſt ſhould be of thoſe that learn to know their letters, whoſe leſſons may be in the <hi>Primar.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32573:19"/>
of thoſe that learn to ſpell, whoſe leſſons may be in the Single-Pſalter. The third of theſe that learn to read, whoſe leſſons may be in the Bible. The fourth of thoſe that are exerciſed in reading, writeing, and caſting accounts, whoſe leſſons may be in ſuch profitable Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-Books as the Parents can beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, and the Maſter think fitteſt to be taught.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let their leſſons be the ſame to each boy in every form, and let the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter proportion them to the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, thus thoſe that are abler may profit themſelves by helping their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fellowes, and thoſe that are weaker be encouraged to ſee that they can keep company with the ſtronger. And let the two higheſt in every forme give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Maſter when they come to ſay, of thoſe that were moſt negligent in geting the leſſon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When they come to ſay, let them all ſtand orderly in one or 2 rowes, &amp; whilſt one ſayeth his leſſon, be ſure that all the reſt look upon their books, and give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to him thats next to correct him that is ſaying if he miſtake, and in caſe he can ſay better, let him take his place, and keep it till the ſame boy or another
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32573:20"/>
win it from him. The ſtriveing for places (eſpecially) amongſt little ones, will whet them all on to more diligence, then any encouragement that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; and the Maſter ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſparing to whip any one for his book, except he be ſullenly negligent, and then alſo I would chuſe rather to ſhame him out of his untowardneſſe by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending ſome of his fellowes, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him why he cannot do as well as they, then by falling upon him with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words, or injurious blowes. A great care alſo muſt be had that thoſe children that are ſlow witted and of a tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, be not any way diſcouraged, though they cannot make ſo good performance of their task as the reſt of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
            <p n="8">8 On Mundayes, Wedneſdayes and Fridayes they may ſay two leſſons in a forenoon and two in an afternoon; and on Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes in the forenoons they may alſo ſay two leſſons; but on Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes in the afternoons, and on Saturday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I would have the time ſpent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amineing, and directing how to ſpell and read a right, and hearing them ſay the Graces, Prayers, and Pſalms, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32573:20"/>
the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandements (which are for that purpoſe ſet down in the <hi>New-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>) very perfectly by heart. And thoſe that can theſe well may proceed to get other Catechiſms, but be ſure they be ſuch as agree with the Principles of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Their leſſons being all ſaid, they ſhould be diſmiſſed about eleven a clock, and then care muſt be taken that they go e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one orderly out of the Schoole, and paſſe quietly home without any ſtay by the way. And to prevent that too too common clamour, and crouding out of the Schoole door, let them riſe out of their places one by one with their hat, and book in their hand, and make their honours to their Maſter as they paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, one following another at a diſtance out of the Schoole. It were fitteſt and ſafeſt that the leaſt went out the foremoſt, that the bigger boyes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing may give notice of any miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour upon the way.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Their return to Schoole in the after-noon ſhould be by one of the clock, and thoſe that come before that hour, ſhould be permitted to play with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their bounds till the clock ſtrike one,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32573:21"/>
and then let them all take their places in due order, and ſay their leſſons as they did in the fore-noon. After leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ended, let one read a chapter, and ſay a Prayer, and ſo let them again go orderly and quietly home, about five a clock in the ſummer, and four in the winter ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If neceſſity require any one to go out in the School time, let him not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the Maſter by asking him leave, but let him leave his book with his next fellow above him, for fear he ſhould elſe ſpoile it, or looſe it, and in caſe he tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too long forth, let notice be given to the Monitor.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Thoſe children in the upper form may be monitors, every one a day in his turn, and let them every evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all leſſons ſaid, give a bill to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their names that are abſent and theirs that have committed any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and let him be very moderate in correcting, and be ſure to make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt thoſe faults that are viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enormous, and thoſe that are but childiſh tranſgreſſons; Where admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons readily take place, it is a needleſſe trouble to uſe a rod, and as for a <hi>ferula</hi> I wiſh it were utterly baniſhed out of all Schooles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:32573:21"/>If one, before I conclude, ſhould ask me, how many children I think may be well and profitably taught (according to the method already propoſed) in a Petty-School; I return him anſwer, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fourty boyes will be enough throughly to employ one man, to hear every one ſo often as is required, and ſo many he may hear and benefit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without making uſe of any of his Scholars to teach the reſt, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be permitted, and is practiſed in ſome Schooles, yet it occaſioneth too much noyſe and diſorder, and is no whit ſo acceptable to Parents, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the children, be the work never ſo well done. And therefore I adviſe, that in a place where a great concours of children may be had, there be more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters then one employed according to the ſpatiouſneſſe of the room, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of boyes to be taught; ſo that every fourty Scholars may have one to teach them; and in caſe there be boyes enough to be taught, I would appoint one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Maſter, to attend one ſingle forme, and have as many Maſters as there are forms, and then the work of teaching little ones to the height of their beſt improvement may be throwly done,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32573:22"/>
eſecially if there were a writeing-maſter employed at certain houres in the Schoole, and an experienced Teacher encouraged as a ſuperviſor, or inſpector, to ſee that the whole Schoole be well and orderly taught, and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>What I have here writ concerning the Teaching and ordering of a Petty-Schoole, was in many particulars expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by my ſelf with a few little boyes, that I taught amongſt my Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-Scholars in London, and I know thoſe of eminent worth, and great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that upon tryal made upon their own children at home, and others at Schoole are ready to atteſt the eaſe and benefit of this method. Inſomuch as I was reſolved to have adjoyned a Petty-Schoole to my Grammar-Schoole at the Token-houſe in <hi>Lothbury London,</hi> and there to have proceeded in this familiar and pleaſing way of Teaching, had I not been unhanſomly dealt with by thoſe whom it concerned, for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſake to have given me leſſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. Nevertheleſſe, I think it my duty to promote Learning what I can, and to lay a ſure foundation for ſuch a goodly ſtructure as learning is; And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32573:22"/>
though (perhaps) I may never be able to effect what I deſire for its advancement, yet it will be my comfort, to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſomwhat to others that may help thereunto. I have here begun at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground work, intending (by Gods bleſſing) forthwith to publiſh <hi>The New Diſcovery of the Old Art of Teaching,</hi> which doth properly belong to a Grammar-Schoole.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I intreat thoſe into whoſe hands this little work may come, to look upon it with a ſingle eye, and whether they like or diſlike it, to think that it is not unneceſſary for men of greateſt parts to beſtow a ſheet or two at leaſure time upon ſo mean a ſubject as this ſeem's to bee. And that God which cauſeth immenſe rivers to flow from ſmall ſpring-heads, vouchſafe to bleſſe theſe weak beginings in tender age, that good learning may proceed hence to its full perfection in riper years.</p>
