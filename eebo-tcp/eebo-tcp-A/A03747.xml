            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <list>
               <item>1 The fyrst, that his Mistresse is for Beautie of her face, and the Grace of her person, the moste per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature, that euer either the eye of man hath beheld, the Arte of Nature hath framed, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the earth hath enioyed.</item>
               <item>2 The second, that it is as impossible for any other whosoeuer, to abide the beames of his Mistresse looke, as for the Clowdes to endure the shining and appearing of the Sunne, and that the one dooth not sooner vanish at the shewing of the Sunne, then the other will sodenly fade at the presence of his Mistresse,</item>
               <item>3 The thirde, that the perfections of his Mistresse, are in number so infynite, in quality so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and in operation so effectuall, as she by the helpe of them, and they by the direction of her, doo make more men without liberty, and more bodyes without harts, then any, or all the women in the world besides.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And because <hi>Callophisus</hi> douteth that the taking vppon him a quarell which is so iust on his syde, will make that he shall haue none to defend the contrary against him, and that the woorthynesse of his mistresse will steale away the Seruaunts of other Ladyes, he will with one onely assistaunt, challenge all that either haue opinion in the constancy of theyr looue, or assuraunce in the greatnes of their affection, by these other three Articles.</p>
            <list>
               <item>4 The fyrst, that <hi>Callophisus</hi> for his faith will yeelde to none, and for his loyalty dooth thinke himselfe abooue all, and in these two respects pronounceth himselfe moste woorthy to be accepted into fauor with his Mistresse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to receiue grace at the hands of the fayrest.</item>
               <item>5 The second, that the good will and affection of <hi>Callophisus</hi> to his Mistresse, is for impression so deepe, for continuaunce so lasting, and for passion so extreame, as it is impossible for any other to carry so perfect looue, or to conceaue the like affection.</item>
               <item>6 The thyrde, that those aduentures and hazards, which cannot but be moste sower, to any other for the pleasing of any Lady (whom they Honour) are moste sweete vnto him, for the contentment of the Mistresse whom he serueth.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And if they neither will contend with him for the superioritie of his Mistresse in woorthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor for the prerogatiue of himselfe in affection, hauing not theyr iudgement vayled with so perciall an humor as may leade them to resist of manifest and open trueth, and doubting a bad successe in a wrong opinion, because <hi>Veritas vincet omnia,</hi> then will he, &amp; his sayd assistant, with all such, runne sixe courses, to ioyne with them in honouring of his Mistresse, which hath no equall, and expressing of his affection which cannot be matched.</p>
            <p>WHereas this challenge of Justes, was signifyed by way of deuise before her Maiestie, on Twelfe night last past, to haue been performed the fifteenth daye of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> her Maiesties pleasure is for diuers considerations, that it be deferred vntill the two and twenty of the same moneth, and then to be held at Westminster, the accustomed place.</p>
