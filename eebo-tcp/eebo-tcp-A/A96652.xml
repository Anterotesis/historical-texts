         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I intend to build my enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Obſer.</hi> The firſt is this: It is the duty
of Chriſtians to bee circumſpect and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in all their enterprizes: or (if you will
have it more plainly) in the words of my
text, To take heede to themſelves in all
their attempts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. Obſer.</hi> The ſecond this, Every one
ought to have a care of his Soule, to keepe
that diligently. Of theſe in their order
briefly and plainly, and firſt of the firſt.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of Chriſtians to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and cautious in all their enterprizes.
This is that which the Apoſtle exhorts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Eph. 5. 15. See then that ye walke cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116578:7"/>
not as fooles but as wiſe,
and according to this is that advice of the
Poet. <hi>Quicquid agis prudenter agas &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice
finem,</hi> what ever thou doeſt take heed
that thou doe it wiſely and praecogitate,
or anticipate to thy ſelfe what the end, the
iſſue or the event thereof may be, which
duty of circumſpection will appeare to be
moſt neceſſary, if we conſider the reaſons
following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Reaſon.</hi> Firſt wee ſhould be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and wary in all our undertakings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
raſh and precipitated actions, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never produce good effects, this
you may ſee verified in all manner of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether naturall, morall, civill or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
               <p>Firſt in naturall actions, as in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of nature, which the Philoſophers hold
are flowe in the beginning, ſwifter in the
middle, and ſwifteſt of all in the latter end,
ſo that no violent action (being contrary
to nature) can continue long, <hi>nullum vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentum
perpetuum,</hi> no violent is permanent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, morall actions, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
the exerciſe of virtues, ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to good perfection, unleſſe advice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116578:8"/>
and deliberation goe before, hence grew
that Maxime, <hi>Deliberandum eſt diu, quod
ſtatuendum eſt ſemel,</hi> we muſt deliberate or
forethinke of that often, which we are to
doe but once.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Civill actions, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Church or Common-wealth, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſucceede well unleſſe advice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
praecede them, and indeed there
is no Orator in the Senate-houſe, nor Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
in the Common-pleas, nor Preacher in
the Pulpit (if he have any modeſty) which
dare ſhew himſelfe in publique, except he
be well furniſhed and provided before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Spirituall actions,
which concerne the worſhippe of God,
never pleaſe God, unleſſe they bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with deliberation, due advice and
circumſpection, unleſſe wee conſider the
matter which we doe, the manner how we
doe it, the meanes whereby we doe it, and
the end wherefore we doe it, which is (or
at leaſt ought to be) for the glory of God:
according to that of St. Paul, whether yee
eate or drinke, or whatſoever elſe you doe,
let all be done to the praiſe and glory of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116578:8"/>
God. 1. Cor. 10. 31.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that no manner of action
can come to good perfection, except ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and deliberation goe before, which
(if there were no other reaſon) is enough
to perſwade every prudent man to take
heede to himſelfe; as Moſes in my text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea.</hi> 2. But Secondly, we had neede
take heede to our ſelves, and bee
circumſpect in our waies, in regard of the
many ſubtile and puiſſant enemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are daily ſurrounded. The greater
our danger is, the greater ſhould our care
be, and the more ſubtile our enemies are,
the more circumſpect ought we to bee,
leſt wee bee circumvented by their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you conſider what great
danger we are in,<note place="margin">

conſideration.</p>
               <p>The firſt enemy whoſe cunning I would
have you take notice of, is the Devill, the
grand Generall of all miſchiefe, who with
his Hoſt of malevolent Spirits, encamps
himſelfe againſt us, and endevors by all
meanes to plunge us both ſoule and body
into everlaſting torments in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
pit, where is weeping and wayling,

               <p>Much might be ſaid concerning the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſſe
of this enemy, but becauſe I
would haſten to other things, I ſhall refer
you to St. Peter for information in his firſt
Epiſtle, fift Chapter and eighth verſe; your
adverſary the Devill (ſaith he) goes about
daily like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he
may devoure, 1. Pet. 5. 8. In which deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you may finde foure properties in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
which makes him a moſt terrible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Firſt his power, Secondly his malice,
Thirdly his ſubtilty, and Fourthly his ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or diligence to harme us; Goliahs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
made him ſeeme ſo terrible, that Saul
and all Iſrael were diſmayed when they
heard of him 1. Sa. 17. 12. Doegs malice
made him ſeeme terrible, 1. Sam. 22. 22. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophels
pollicy made him ſeeme terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
2. Sam 15. 31. and the enemies of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
were accounted terrible in reſpect of
their ſwiftneſſe to deſtroy. Eſa. 5. 26.</p>
               <p>Now if one of theſe make an enemy ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
how terrible will that enemy bee, in
whom all theſe foure meete? if an enemy
be malicious (as a Writer obſerves) yet if
he want power, hee may peradventure
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116578:10"/>
conſume himſelfe with malice and hurt no
other; or if he have both power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
yet if he want cunning and ſubtilty
he may miſſe an oportunity to doe hurt; or
ſuppoſe he have power, malice and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet if he be ſlowe and careleſſe, there is
the leſſe danger of him, but where malice
is accompanied with power, and that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with craft, and all exerciſed with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie
and much diligence; who, having
ſuch an enemy will be careleſſe and take no

wee muſt all anſwere for all our

               <p>There be two things that deale imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with all men,<note place="margin">Pallida <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ors aequo pulſat pede pauperum tabernas regumque turres.</note> Death, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the laſt day. That death deales im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
you ſee proved in that it ſtrikes
with the ſame foote as well at the pallaces
of Princes, as at the cottages of poore
men: 'tis true that there is a great deale of
difference betweene man and man, in
three reſpects. Firſt in reſpect of naturall
endowments, ſome are wiſe, others fooles,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116578:11"/>
ſome beautifull, others deformed, ſome of
an affable and courteous diſpoſition, others
are ſordid and immorigerous; ſecondly, in
reſpect of ſpirituall graces, ſome are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
ſanctified with grace, others carnall, ſold
under ſin, ſome are patient in the greateſt
tribulation, and others querulous and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers
in the leaſt, ſome there are whom
nothing can make proud, or elevate them
above their brethren, and others there
are, whom things worth nothing,
tranſport in a ſphere of pride above
their betters; thirdly, there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in reſpect of future eternity, ſome
there are who are veſſels of wrath, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
of Hell, to whom it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Ite
maledicti,</hi> goe yee curſed into everlaſting
fire prepared for the Devill and his Angels:
and others there are who are Children of
God and Heires of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to whom it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Venite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicti,</hi>
come yee bleſſed Children of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receive the Kingdome prepared for
you.</p>
               <p>Yet though it be true that there be ſuch
difference between man and man in theſe
reſpects, if we looke upon death and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116578:12"/>
judgement that they have of the righteous
Judge at the laſt day, we ſhall finde that
they have no reſpect of perſons; as for
death it doth equaliſe the Peere of the
Realme,<note place="margin">Mors ſceptra ligonibus aequat.</note> and the Peaſant of the Country
the life of man is like a play or interlude.
You know before the play be begun, the
Actors are fellowes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in the play there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
a great deale of difference, ſome are
Kings, and others Subjects, ſome Judges,
others Priſoners, ſome rich, others beggers;
and after the play is ended, there is little or
no difference between them: even ſo is it
with men, while we act our parts on the
vaſt ſtage of the world, there appeares a
great deale of difference between us, ſome
live in the mountaines of riches, honors,
and preferments, others in the vallies of
meane and low eſtates, yet when we have
ſeverally acted our partes, death will make
us all equall: Him that ſitteth on the
Throne, with him that lieth in the field, him
that holds the Scepter, with him that holds
the Plow, the rich with the begger, wiſe
with fooliſh, by turning us all into the
prime element, duſt, whereof we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
And as death deales impartially
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116578:12"/>
with all, ſo will the judgement of the laſt
day. There <hi>Qualem unuſquiſque habet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiam
talem &amp; habebit Judicem,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
conſcience a man hath, ſuch a Judge
ſhall he have either excuſing or accuſing
him, there no bribes ſhall corrupt juſtice,
no intreaties protract it, no oppoſition hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the paſſage of it, but there every one
ſhall receive without partiallity according
to what he hath done in the fleſh. O that
men would ſeriouſly revolve this in their
minds, that ſo they might be cauſed to
walke circumſpectly with God and man,
and (as Moſes in my Text exhorts) to take
heed to themſelves, and keepe their ſoules
diligently.</p>

            <div type="application">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>It ſerves for exhortation; Firſt to Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates,
ſecondly, to Miniſters, thirdly, to the

in all their enterprizes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let Magiſtrates and men in eminent

more cauſe to be circumſpect in their

               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:116578:13"/>
Firſt they are bound to it by the former
reaſons, <hi>ſcil.</hi> their actions, as wel as the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of other men, (if undertaken unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly)
produce miſerable, and prodigious
effects. Again, they have the ſame enemies,
the Devill, the world, and the fleſh endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
their overthrow, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of others, and finally they muſt
die as well as others, Pſal. 82. v. 6. 7. and
give an account for their thoughts, words,
and deeds, as well as others.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, they have more cauſe to
take heede to themſelves, and to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in their waies then others, for theſe
reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt God hath advanced them above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in dignity, and he therefore expects
that they ſhould walke more warily then
others: if God ſhould finde them guilty of
ſuch enormities as others, he might juſtly
cry out againſt them as Caeſar did againſt
Brutus, <hi>&amp; tu fili?</hi> What and thou my ſon?
Have I honored thee ſo much? And wilt
thou be ſo careleſſe of my honour, and of thy
owne ſalvation?</p>
               <p>It ſhould be with men as it is with the
elements,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the higher they are, the purer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116578:13"/>
they are, aire is purer then water, and fire
then aire, ſo the higher men are in office
and wealth, the more circumſpect ought
they to be in their waies: to whom much is
given, of him much ſhall be required, Luke
12. 48. good to this purpoſe is that of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
<hi>Creſcentibus donis creſcunt &amp; rationes
donorum,</hi> the greater our guifts are, the
greater ſhould our care be.</p>
               <p>Againe, men in eminent places ought to
be more circumſpect then others, becauſe
the people commonly follow their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
their good or evill life doth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſe much good, or evill amongſt the
people.</p>
               <p>I remember a ſaying, which experience
in all ages hath proved to be true: <hi>Qualis
Rex, talis Grex,</hi> ſuch as the King or chiefe
Rulers are, ſuch for the moſt part will the
people be; for their preſident is more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
then their precept.</p>
               <p>If the King be an Idolater, it lodgeth
not in his breaſt alone, but like a gangrene
or ſpreading leproſie it paſſeth over the
whole body of the Common wealth: If
on the contrary, the King be a religious
and ſanctified perſon, the people will at
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116578:14"/>
leaſt in ſhew appeare ſo too: If Jeroboam
the ſon of Nebat become an Idolater, and
an errector of ſtrange Altars, he ſhall not
goe alone, but all Iſraell will ſin with him
for company, 2 Ki. 10. 31. if Joſhus devote
himſelfe to ſerve the Lord, all the people
will be ready to comply with him, 1 Joſh.
16. Ahaz was an Idolater, ſo were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Hezekiah his ſon worſhipped God tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo did the people, thus <hi>Regis ad exemplum
totus componitur orbis:</hi> the examples of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
perſons are as looking glaſſes, after
which the Country dreſſe themſelves; and
therefore you may find that Jehoſaphat
ſpeaking to ſuch, charges them even in the
very words of my Text to take heede to
themſelves, 2 Cron. 19 c. 6. 7. v. and he
ſaid to the Judges take heed what you doe,
for you judge not for man but for God,
who is with you in your judgement, v. 6.
againe v. 7. wherfore now let the fear of the
Lord be upon you take heede and doe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let Miniſters take heede to
themſelves and be circumſpect and wary
in all their courſes: Firſt let them take
heede that they thruſt not themſelves into
the calling of the miniſtry, without due cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116578:14"/>
thereunto, let them not intrude into

that every man in this caſe is a Miniſter, or

up the ſtrange fire of their owne prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Zeale, leſt fire come downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Abihu, Levit, 10. 1. 2. be pleaſed to looke
into the Chapter, and you ſhall in the firſt

in offering up ſtrange fire unto God; and
in the very next verſe, Gods juſt judgement
on them for their moſt unjuſt preſumption,
in ſending downe a miraculous fire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them.</p>
               <p>O then, as we love our owne ſoules let
us know our owne charges, let every man
take heede and keepe him to his owne
Trade or Vocation, <hi>Ne Sutor Vltra crepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
Let not the Cobler miſtake the Pulpit
for his ſtall, and inſtead of patching ſoles,
take upon him the charge of ſoules. Let not
the Taylor miſtake the Lords Table for his
cutting board, let him not inſtead of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

I aſſure you beloved I ſpeake not this out of

ponre downe his holy ſpirit upon them;
But (as a late writer ſaies) we muſt give
God leave to be the orderer of his owne

not guided by the ſpirit, but ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſpirites, like the ſeven ſonnes of
Sceva, Act 19. 13. 14. 15. a vagabond Jew
that without Commiſſion, would needes
caſt out Devills in the name of Jeſus, but
marke what befell them, Acts 19. the evill
ſpirit anſwered, Jeſus I know, and Paul I
know, <hi>ſed qui vos?</hi> But who are you? And
the man in whom the evill ſpirit was, leapt
upon them and overcame them. O that all
thoſe who pretend the ſpirit of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Ordinance of God, would
henceforward take heede to keepe them to
their owne vocations, and not meddle with
the preaching of the word, more then as

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116578:16"/>
or with the adminiſtration of the
Sacrament more then as pious and well
prepared Receivers, leſt the evill ſpirit
which they would ſeeme to caſt out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
enter into themſelves, prevaile againſt
them, and overcome them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when Miniſters are lawfully
called, let them take heed that they minde
not the fleece more then the flock, their
owne benefit more then the good of their
people, let them take heede that they deſire
not more to make a prey of their flock, then
to prey for it.</p>
               <p>Let them take heede that they be not
ſuch as in their preaching aime more at po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
applauſe for themſelves, then to win
ſoules unto God; I meane ſuch whoſe
preaching is more affectedly obſcure then
Delphian Oracles, or Egyptian Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,
that have mouthes, nay words, yet
ſpeake not, at leaſt not to their Auditors
underſtanding, that deale with their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as the Foxe did with the Storke, who
inviting him to dinner, poured his liquor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo ſhallow a platter that the Storke by
reaſon of his long bill was unable to lap a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of it, ſo that he was only ſpectator
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116578:16"/>
while the Foxlapt up the liquor.</p>
               <p>Such Miniſters as theſe ſet their words
in knots and borders, only to delight the
eares of the curious, not to raviſh the heart
of the ſanctified; they labour and ſtudy
much to ſpeake ſo as they may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
who fill up their Sermons with
ſtrange languages, ſome of whoſe Engliſh
words (being exceeding lofty) are as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be underſtood by the greateſt part
of their auditors, as Hebrew is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe
would make good that curſe upon their
auditors, to be of the number of thoſe, that
hearing, heare and underſtand not, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſee and perceive not, Iſa. 6. 9. Acts
28. 26.</p>
               <p>But ſtay, I would not have you thinke
that I am Advocate for thoſe that on the
contrary, as the other make their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as prophecying, ſo theſe in a bad ſence
would make good that of the Apoſtle, of
ſome that call preaching fooliſhneſſe,
1. Cor. 1. 21. 23. as if, becauſe preaching
muſt not bee gariſh, it muſt therefore bee
ſordid.</p>
               <p>I meane ſuch, who ruſh unpreparedly
into the Pulpit, perhaps three or foure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116578:17"/>
times a weeke, with any undigeſted ſtuffe,
and there rend the ſacred Scriptures in
peeces with their unſanctified lips, even as
a clowne doth a capon, who knowes not
how to carve it neately, neither know
theſe how to divide and diſpence the word
rightly; theſe take no heede to prepare
themſelves for ſo weighty a worke, but
ſpend the whole weeke in rioting, cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
and wantonneſſe, and little or no
part of their time in ſtudying, and then
mount the Pulpit truſting to Enthuſiaſmes
and Revelations, as if God were bound to
appeare alwaies in ſuch glorious rayes of
wonders, whereby it comes to paſſe that
they vent ſuch poore ſtuffe in the Pulpit,
that no wiſe or religious man hath ſo much
patience as to heare it, much leſſe ſo much
folly, as to follow it.</p>
               <p>I would ſuch would hereafter take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the exhortation of St. Paul, to the
Paſtors of the Church of Epheſus, take
heede to your ſelves and to the flock over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which

Thirdly, let all men in generall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to take heede to themſelves, and be
circumſpect in all their actions, but more
eſpecially in thoſe which concerne the
worſhip of God. Let us inſtance in ſome
particulars.</p>
               <p>Art thou to come unto the Lord by
Prayer? take heede that thou doe it not
raſhly without due preparation of thy
heart, and praeconſideration of the majeſty
of him to whome thou art to ſpeake, the
want whereof cauſes us to carry our
ſelves ſo irreverently as wee doe towards
God: for ſo immorigerous are wee
grown, that wee will ſcarce vouchſafe
to fall downe and worſhip the Lord our
maker. We thinke our ſelves too great or
too good to fall downe and kneele before
him in Prayer: Ezra: 9: 5. 6. It was
not ſo with Ezra, for hee rent his garment,
and his mantle, and fell upon his knees
and ſpread out his hands unto the Lord,
Ezra: 9: and David adviſes us to worſhip
and fall downe and kneele before the
Lord, our maker, Pſal: 95. 6. yea and the
Lord himſelfe expects it. Iſ: 45. 23. I have
ſworne by my ſelfe that every knee ſhall
bow to me: &amp; this is moſt certain that that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116578:18"/>
Prayer which is made unto God without
reverence and due reſpect done to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
majeſty is not acceptable with God.
I will not ſay, that all prayers that are
made without bending the knee are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
yet I could wiſh that men being
but duſt, ſhould kneel as low as duſt when
they are to ſpeake to the high God.</p>
               <p>It is reported of Auguſtus that one invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to dinner to homely entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
farre unfit for ſo royall a perſonage;
hee thus ſpake to him that invited him;
<hi>neſciebam me tibi fuiſſe tam familiarem,</hi> I
knew not that you and I had beene ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar:
may not the Lord ſay ſo to us, that
without any taking heede to prepare or
ſanctifie our ſelves, petition for favours:
take heede therefore to your ſelves, and
remember the advice of the wiſe man Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.
5. 2. be not raſh with thy mouth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let thy heart bee haſty to utter any
thing before God, for God is in Heaven,
and thou art on Earth, therefore let thy
words be few; and indeede it very much
concernes us thus to take heede that we be
not inconſiderate, raſh or multiloquacious
in our Prayer, for though it be true that we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116578:18"/>
may approach unto the throne of Grace,
with confidence and boldneſſe, yet wee
muſt take heede that we come not with
ſaucineſſe, for as God is a God of mercy, ſo
alſo is he a conſuming fire.</p>
               <p>Againe, art thou to come unto the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord? take heede that thou ruſh
not in thither raſhly or unadviſedly, as if
thou wert going unto a ſtage play, but
forethinke with thy ſelfe that thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as it were, into the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Almighty God, who is a great and
terrible God, that will not be mocked by
thee: as therefore when you are to meete
an earthly king, and to ſpeake with him,
you prepare your ſelves, and ſtudy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
and expreſſion that may beſt
pleaſe him, ſo doe when you are to meete
God: praecogitate with your ſelves what
comportment you ought to uſe in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
what zeale, Ro. 12. 11. cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Pſal. 100. 1. ſinceritie, Joſh. 24. 14.
and reverence, Heb. 12. 28. you ſhould
uſe in the ſervice which you performe to
God.</p>
               <p>Art thou to receive the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper? take heed that thou doe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116578:19"/>
it not raſhly or unadviſedly; it is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Apoſtle. Let a man examine
himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that bread
and drinke of that cup, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 28. 19. and
he gives a good reaſon for it in the next
verſe, for (ſaith he) hee that eateth and
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himſelfe, not diſcerning the
Lords body.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more? In a word, art
thou a beleever, and haſt embraced the
Faith of Chriſt? take heede thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
not any thing without due advice and
deliberation, leſt that old proverbe be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by thee, <hi>qui ante non cavet poſt dolebit,</hi>
he that doth not beware before, will be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
after.</p>
               <p>Now, leſt what I have ſaid be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make us take heede to our ſelves
in all our undertakings, I beſeech you look
back into the former ages, and conſider
what and how many miſerable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and ſad diſaſters have happened to
ſeverall people, only for want of good
take heede; it was the want of good take
heede that caſt the Angels out of Heaven:
it was the want of good take heede, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116578:19"/>
exiled Adam from Paradiſe, that brought
the flood on the old World: it was the
want of good take heede that brought ſire
and brimſtone on Sodome and Gomorrah,
that rent ten tribes from Rehoboams king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
1 King 12. it was the want of good
take heede that ſhut the five fooliſh virgins
out of Heaven, Mat. 25. and it is the want
of this good take heede, that ſhall bring a
generall deſtruction on the wicked and
ungodly, 1 Theſ. 5. 3.</p>
               <p>No more but this, conſider I pray you,
what is it that brings ſo many, ſome to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
ſome to diſgrace, ſome to ſodaine
deſperate and dangerous deaths? but only
the want of good take heede; that you
may therefore eſcape all theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and thouſands more which are moſt
incident to the careleſſe; I beſeech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the exhortation of Moſes in my
Text, Take heede to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But then as the Souldiers ſaid to
John the Baptiſt, Maſter what ſhall wee
doe? So may you ſay to me, you have (we
confeſſe) proved that we ſhould bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect
and take heede to our ſelves, but
we would know the manner how wee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116578:20"/>
ſhould doe it, or what it is that we ſhould
take heede to in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwere, You muſt firſt take
heede to your eyes, they are apt to range
after iniquity, and if they be not diligently
watch't, they prove arch-traytors to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde:
untill Adam and Eve luſted with
their eyes, ſin and Sathan entred not into
their hearts, Gen. 3. had not Herod look't
or Herodias dancing, hee had not ſo
raſhly granted her John Baptiſts head
Mar. 6. had not Potiphars wife given her
eyes liberty to behold Joſeph, ſhe had not
luſted to defile her marriage bed with him,
King. 2. had not Sichem ſeene Dina Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
daughter, he had never raviſh't her,
Gen. 34. Theſe evils proceede from licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
gazing on ſuch objects, and therefore
(ſaith the Prophet) turne away mine eyes
leſt they behold vanitie; it was the want
of taking heede to the eyes, that made
Tarquinius Sextus to raviſh Collatinus wife
that made Queene Cleopatra to uſe her
brother Ptolomeus as her husband; that
made Macareus to lye with his ſiſter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,
and Menephron to defile his own
Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:116578:20"/>
And indeede it is God's great mercy
that he hath placed in the eyes, as well the
remedy as the malady, <hi>fletum &amp; viſum,</hi> the
faculty of ſeeing, and the ſluce of teares,
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t qui delinquant videndo, poeniteant plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando,</hi>
that they who have offended by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
may repent by weeping; if therefore
thou wilt eſcape the puniſhment of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
(I meane of eternall weeping in hell
fire) take heed to thine eyes: look not after
a woman to luſt after her, for then thou
haſt committed adultrie with her in thy
heart, Mat. 5. In a word, make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with thine eyes that they behold nor
vanitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Take heede to your eares
which moſt commonly are more open to
Syrens ſongs, then to heavenly ditties, to
obſcene communication then to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of God, and therefore Chriſt ſets a
double guard at this Port of hearing, and
both delivered in the termes of my Text;
The firſt is in Mark 4. 24. where we are
bid to take heede what we heare: and the
other in Luke 8. 18. where we are bid to
take heede how we heare, Pſal. 141. 3. hee
keepes both theſe ſayings well that heares
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116578:21"/>
the word of God diligently, and practiſes
it in his life and converſation conſtantly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take heede to your tongue,
for this is often times an unruly member,
ſo unruly that (as one well obſerves) the
port-c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>llis of the teeth, and the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarfe
of the lips are not ſufficient to keepe
it in, unleſſe with David, wee daily pray
Pſal. 14. 3. Set a watch O Lord before
my mouth, keepe thou the doore of my
lips.</p>
               <p>Take heede to your underſtanding that
it be not corrupted; this is the firſt doore
the Devill knocks at, the firſt forge where
ſin is framed, the firſt commander the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
ſeekes to corrupt, for though he intend
to ſack the whole citty of our Soules, yet
hee makes his firſt aſſaults againſt this
Port.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the beſieged fortifie
moſt where they feare moſt batteries or
aſſaults, ſo take we heede to looke care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to our underſtandings, that they bee
not blinded with ignorance, nor inſnared
with the ſubtiltie of Atheiſme, Hereſie,
Popery, Schiſme, or any thing elſe repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to God and his truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:116578:21"/>
Take wee heede to our underſtandings
that they dive not too farre into the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
myſteries of the word: There is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
revealed both for our faith and our
ſalvation, <hi>Mitte arcana Dei,</hi> meddle not
with the ſecrets of God: <hi>Quod Deus texit,
quis revelabit,</hi> what God hath hidden, let
not the underſtanding pry into.</p>
               <p>Conſider wee, that our underſtanding or
intellectuall part, is that which the Devill,
Hereticks, Atheiſts, Papiſts, Schiſmaticks,
and many other pernicious enemies, much
labour to corrupt, and therefore let us take
great heede to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>Take heede to your will, which will be
either the ſeate of ſin, or ſanctuary of grace;
if it be depraved it hath a very malignant
influence upon all our actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as beſiegers of a Garriſon labour moſt
to poſſeſſe themſelves of the chiefe Sconce
or capitoll, knowing, that thence they may
command the whole City, ſo the Devill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
the City of our ſoule, labours
chiefely to captivate our will, becauſe he
knows that if that become ſubject to his
Lawes, and embrace his Scepter, all the
faculties of the whole man will be tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116578:22"/>
to the ſame ſervice.</p>
               <p>Take heed therfore that your wills be
not enſlaved by Sathans policy, but renued
by grace, and regulated by the rule of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Laſtly take heede to your conſciences,
there may be ſo much ſaid for this, that I
ſhall ſay but little.</p>
               <p>Salomon ſaies that a good conſcience is
a continuall feaſt, Prov. 15. 15. and indeed
ſo it is, if we be weake it is a ſtaffe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
us, if in want, a comforter to relieve
us, if in ſuites of Law, it is the beſt agent to
pleade for us if falſely accuſed, it is the beſt
witneſſe to cleere us, if wrongfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
it is a moſt upright Judge to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
us: There can no eſtate or condition
befall man, either ſo proſperous or averſe,
but that the comfort of a good conſcience
will appeare in it.</p>
               <p>It comforts in proſperity and adverſity,
in ſickneſſe and in health, in life and in
death, and (which is beſt of all) it yeeldes
tranſcendent comfort at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For when among the wicked at
the dreadfull day of Jeſus Chriſt, there ſhall
appeare nothing but horrors, frights, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116578:22"/>
amazements, be heard nothing but feareful

for feare of the ſentence of malediction,
that ſhall there be pronounced againſt
them; even then there ſhall be nothing
but joy, exultation, and heavenly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to them that have taken heede to
preſerve their conſciences ſpotleſſe, being
aſſured of the ſentence of benediction
which ſhall then be pronounced to them,
at which time their bodies being reunited
to their ſoules, they ſhall be both received
into everlaſting ſalvation which every one
ought diligently to ſeeke after, which is
ſet forth in the next part of my Text, the
duty in theſe words, keepe thy ſoule dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently;
whence we conclude this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2 Obſer.</hi> That every Chriſtian ſhould
have a ſpeciall care of his foule; and keepe
that diligently. To this purpoſe we have
both the Precept and Preſident of Gods
Children in ſacred writ. Firſt for Precept,
ſee St. Paul exhorting us to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to make our calling and election
ſure, 2 Pet. 1. 10. and Phil. 2 12. he bid us
worke out our ſalvation with feare and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116578:23"/>
trembling, ſo Moſes in our Text, bid us take
heede to our ſelves, and keepe our ſoules
diligently.</p>
               <p>As for preſident, looke on St. Paul, and
you ſhall finde that he was ſo carefull of
his ſoules ſalvation, that as the Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would not gratifie Arrius in the leaſt
compliance with him, ſo neither would he
conforme in any thing to the Doctrine of
Seducers: And if you read the life and
death of the Martyrs, you ſhall finde that
they were ſo carefull of the ſalvation of
their ſoules, that they would not in the leaſt
ſemblance condiſcend to the Pagan Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
though they might thereby have
come off with corporall ſafety.</p>
               <p>But not to trouble you with multiplicity
of examples, looke but on one preſident
more, and that ſhall be David a man after
God sowne heart.</p>
               <p>The Lord had wonderfully magnified his
mercy towards him in many eminent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
firſt in reſpect of his eſtate, when he
tooke him from following his Fathers
Ewes great with young, to feede Iacob
his people, and Iſrael his inheritance, Pſal.
78. 70. 71. when he tranſlated him from a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116578:23"/>
ſhepheards crooke to a ſcepter of gold, Pſa.
70. 71. Againe, the Lord did well for him
otherwiſe too, in reſpect of his ſtrength;
for he had as magnanimous a heart, as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1. Sam. 17. 49. And when that proud
Philiſtine Goliah came rayling and defying
the God of Iſrael, notwithſtanding his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing
tearmes, he encountred with him,
and ſlew him, and ſo tooke the reproach
from Iſrael. Againe, the Lord did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
well for David, in reſpect of his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for he was a man of a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
pulchritude, as you may ſee prooved,
1. Sam. 16 12. the Text there ſayes, that he
was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and goodly to looke on. Againe,
the Lord did wonderfull well for him, in
reſpect of his iſſue, for he had a marvellous
great iſſue. And I doubt not but David
was truly thankfull to the Lord for all theſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nercies beſtowed on him, in reſpect of his
body and his eſtate. But yet I am reſolved
that hee minded more the ſalvation of his
ſoule, then he did all theſe things: and I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this from his owne words in the 14.
Pſalme: he declares that he longs for the
ſalvation of God; and if you looke on him
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116578:24"/>
in the Pſalme, 25. v. 20. you ſhall finde that
being ſurrounded with miſeries, he hath a
ſpeciall care of his Soule, and deſires the
Lord to keepe that ſafe, ſo Pſal. 86. 2. hee
prayes the Lord to preſerve his Soule, and
having received ſome ſpeciall favour for
his Soule you may finde him making a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
invitation unto the righteous, to
come and heare what the Lord had done
unto his Soule, Pſal. 66. 16. Come and
heare all yee that feare God, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto you what he hath done for my
Soule; thus you ſee God's children have
at all times been ſo carefull of their Soules,
that they would rather ſuffer death then
doe any thing that might hinder the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Soules; ſuch care ought we
alſo to have of our Soules, Wee ſhould

               <p>Now therefore, as when Monica (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens
mother) heard an excellent diſcourſe
of the joyes of heaven, ſayd, <hi>Quid facio hic?</hi>
What doe I heere on earth? ſo ſay I, what
doe we heere, planting our affections on
the things of this life? let us tranſplant our
affections, and ſet them on things that are
above. Some may object thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Is it not lawfull to ſeeke at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the things of this life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, it is: you may, nay you
are bound in conſcience to provide for
thoſe that are under your tuition, but you
muſt not ſpend all your time herein, and
neglect ſeeking after the ſalvation of your
ſoules, you may in a moderate way ſeeke
after the things of this life, but you muſt not
doe it immoderately, you may uſe the
world, but it muſt be as if you uſed it not,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116578:35"/>
you muſt ſo live heere as if your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were in Heaven, you may ſalute the
world, but you muſt take heede that you
doe not hugge and embrace it.</p>
               <p>To conclude, in a word, I beſeech you
doe as our Saviour exhorts you, Mat. 6. 33.
ſeeke yee firſt the Kingdome of God, and
his righteouſneſſe, and all other things
ſhall be added to you: make ſure of Jeſus
Chriſt to be the Saviour of your ſoules, and
you ſhall be ſure that God will give you
all things elſe that are neceſſary for you;
which that you may doe, I deſire every one
of you, to remember and practiſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of Moſes in my Text, with which
I began, and now end. Only take heed to
thy ſelfe and keepe thy ſoule diligently.</p>
               <p>I have done with my Text.</p>
               <p>I know it will be expected that I ſhould

and I am ſure I might without
flattery ſpeake much to his honour, for
thoſe who knew him beſt, knew him to be
of an affable and amiable carriage, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the meaneſt, exceeding charitable to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116578:36"/>

               <p>But I know that Funerall Sermons are
not made as Panegyricks, or commendato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Orations to proclaime the worth of the
dead, but for inſtruction to the living; and
therefore I ſhall forbeare to ſpeake more
now, but I ſhall (God willing) write of
him by way of Elegy; which ſhall be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
