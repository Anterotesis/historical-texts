         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>NOw, now let's Rejoyce, and let <hi>England</hi> be glad,</l>
               <l>Since that we do hope there's no cauſe to be ſad:</l>
               <l>The King to his People return'd is again,</l>
               <l>And may he live happy, and proſperouſly Reign:</l>
               <l>Kind Heaven contriv'd it, no doubt, for our Peace,</l>
               <l>That all our Contentions for ever may ceaſe;</l>
               <l>That Flatterers from his true Friends may be known,</l>
               <l>And thoſe he eſteem'd that ſupported the Crown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What joy did ſurprize us when firſt we had News,</l>
               <l>The King to come back to us did not refuſe;</l>
               <l>Ay, each Loyal heart beat a March to's return,</l>
               <l>Whoſe ſurprizing abſence they often did Mourn;</l>
               <l>Long, long may he Live, each good Proteſtant Sing,</l>
               <l>Tho' all Evil Counſellors mount in a String:</l>
               <l>The Roads as he paſſed all Crowded they were,</l>
               <l>And each one did ſtrive to Great James to get near.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To Welcome him home to his Pallace of State,</l>
               <l>And pity the Hardſhip he ſuſtain'd of late;</l>
               <l>Vpon his Retirement, and with loud Huzza's,</l>
               <l>Still Welcom'd our Monarch where e're he did paſs;</l>
               <l>With Royal Attendance he made his Advance,</l>
               <l>On purpoſe the Crowds met, and not as by chance;</l>
               <l>Each glad was to ſee him returning again,</l>
               <l>And cou'd not from loud Acclamations refrain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But moſt of all <hi>London,</hi> that Renowned City,</l>
               <l>At once ſhew'd her Gladneſs, and likewiſe her Pity;</l>
               <l>For no ſooner Fame brought the News to her Gates,</l>
               <l>But joyful Expectants had filled the Streets;</l>
               <l>And as the Coach-Royal paſs'd with loud Acclaim,</l>
               <l>Mingl'd with Sighs, they did Welcome the ſame:</l>
               <l>By one they their Joy for his ſafety expreſs,</l>
               <l>By to'ther their Sorrow for his late Diſtreſs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Bells too they cou'd not this good News conceal,</l>
               <l>But Welcom'd him in with a Merry Appeal:</l>
               <l>To Mournful <hi>White-Hall</hi> he did ſcarcely appear,</l>
               <l>But Sadneſs flew thence that had ſat brooding there:</l>
               <l>The Gates ſo late clos'd, to our Monarch gave place,</l>
               <l>While he reſtor'd joy to each ſorrowful face;</l>
               <l>And thither the Nobles reſorted amain,</l>
               <l>To fill up the Room of his ſcattered Train.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With true Loyal hearts for to Welcome him home,</l>
               <l>So may our Diviſions to Settlement come;</l>
               <l>Our Troubles all ceaſe, and the Nation be freed</l>
               <l>Of thoſe that wou'd Diſcord amongſt us ſtill breed;</l>
               <l>Whilſt the King and People in Love they do meet,</l>
               <l>And right underſtanding does make him more Great;</l>
               <l>That we as a Providence, ever may own,</l>
               <l>The Diſcov'ry that caus'd his return to the Throne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Proſpect of War that did dreadful appear,</l>
               <l>We now are in hopes there's no cauſe for to fear;</l>
               <l>But that without Blood-ſhed things may be ſecure,</l>
               <l>And we with Prieſts Councils be troubl'd no more:</l>
               <l>So Law and Religion may flouriſh amain,</l>
               <l>And Plenty and Peace grow up under his Reign;</l>
               <l>Our Swords into Plow-ſhears, to Pruning-hooks Spears;</l>
               <l>We wiſh may be turn'd, and ſtill baniſh our Fears.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But this, to a <hi>Parliament</hi> we muſt ſubmit,</l>
               <l>And wiſh the great Nations Wiſe Council may Sit,</l>
               <l>So to heal all our Grievances, that none Complain,</l>

               <l>Of what by Vnbyas'd Men ſhall be thought Iuſt,</l>
               <l>In Religion, Law, Property, ne'r to be Croſs'd:</l>
               <l>And now to conclude, let us heartily Sing,</l>
