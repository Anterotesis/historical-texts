            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIrſt, there are few men ſo ſimple,

no need: neither is there any <hi>man</hi>
ſo wiſe of himſelf, but may ſtand in need
of the councel of another, nor ſo obſtinat
but will accept the councel of another,
eſpecially in a time of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>2 It is the eaſieſt and commoneſt thing
in the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>3 Of all men he is the veryeſt fool, that
preſumes to give good councel to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and followeth not the ſame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>4 Councel is very good if the Giver

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof

            <p>5 In Councel it is good to be hard to

            <p>6 Beware that thou take not haſty

help the underſtanding of the Hearers.</p>
            <p>8 When thou art in proſperity remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
adverſity; and in adverſity hope for
proſperity: for it is good for a man to
hope for the beſt, to be content in the
worſt, and patiently to ſuffer whatſoever
ſhall happen: ſo ſhall thy life be more
comfortable, thy death leſs terrible, and
thy future eſtate more durable.</p>
            <p>9 If thou enter into friendſhip and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with any man, be ſure thou try
before thou truſt, leſt thy friend be found
like the Carbuncle, which at a diſtance
ſeems to have ſire, but being toucht hath
no heat: ſo thy friend when he comes to
be tryed be found to have no faith,</p>
            <p>10 And if thou wilt prove or try thy
friend, take <hi>Time</hi> by the fore-top, and
ſtay not till thy neceſſity conſtrain thee,
leſt thy friend not onely deceive thee, but
add to thy miſery, and thy tryal be not
onely profitable, but alſo prejudicial.</p>
            <p>11 A true friend indeed is a pleaſure in
proſperity, a comfort in adverſity, in grief
a ſolace, in joy a merry companion, and
at all times a ſecond ſelf, and no time hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſecrets, nor denying money: ſo that
true friendſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p reſembles a man and his
wife, whoſe two bodies are become one
in will and affection.</p>
            <p>12 But feigned friends reſemble a flock
of Crowes that make their repair to no
place but where there is Carion to be fed
upon, and he that ſeeks a ſwarm of ſuch
friends needs not be long in his ſearch,
but if he takes not the better heed before
he be a ware, perhaps may find himſelf
in a Waſps Neſt of enemies.</p>
            <p>13 Be ſlow to fall in friendſhip with
any: but when thou art in friendſhip,
continue ſirm and conſtant: but before
thou admit any man to thy friendſhip &amp;
familiarity, be ſure thou firſt conſider
how he hath dealt with his other friends
before time: for look how he hath ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his former friends, be ſure ſo he will
ſerve thee.</p>
            <p>14 Believe after tryal, and judge before
familiarity, and if thou findeſt faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
be thou no cauſe of breach: and as
thou wouldſt do with Gold, ſo do by
thy friend: be ſure thou tryeſt it before
thou haſt too much need, leſt when thou
haſt moſt need, thou haſt leaſt help.</p>
            <p>15 Beware of the promiſes of great and
rich men, for they both will deceive thy
expectation when their own turnes are
ſerv'd: for if thou art poor, the one by his
power, the other by his purſe, wil depreſs
thee: and there is no contending with a
mighty man be thy Cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever ſo juſt.</p>
            <p>16 And if a great or rich man do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
thee a great recompence to do any
thing that may be either hazardous to
thy ſelf, or prejudicial to others, or both,
before thou begin thy enterpriſe conſider
that he that never truſted, was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and that it is more ſafe to ſit ſtill,
and contented with what thou enjoyeſt
by thy own induſtry, then to riſe up in
expectation of great things, at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of others, and with the Dog in the
Fable loſe the ſubſtance by ſnatching at
the ſhadow, and ſo to fall into a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of beggery and penury, from which
thou wilt have much trouble before, if
ever thou recover; and as thou mayſt be
pitied of few, thou ſhalt be ſure to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
of many, but helpt by none, derided
by thine enemies, forſaken of thy frends,
and well ſpoken of hardly by any.</p>
            <p>17 Remember that great men and rich
men would do by poor men, as they do
by their dogs and horſes, that is, keep
them til they are paſt uſe either for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or profit, and then either knock 'em
on the head, or hang them, but that the
Law ſtands in the gap: at beſt they deal
by them as they do by their old ſhooing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns,
make uſe of them for their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and when their turns are ſerved, caſt
them by as uſeleſs, till the next time they
ſtand in need. Alas poor ſoules.</p>
            <p>18 Great men and rich men ſeldome
promiſe with purpoſe to perform to poor
men, but never perform but with purpoſe
more to deceive: and therefore 'tis ſaid,
that he that knowes not how to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſhall ſcarce ever be either great or a
rich man.</p>
            <p>19 As it is not good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be too niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or ſparing becauſe thereby a man robs
himſelf of the benefit of enjoying that
he hath in poſſeſſion: ſo by too profuſe
and prodigal ſpending, a man expoſes
himſelf to many hazards: for what nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
power nor policy can compaſs, gold
both conquers and commands.</p>
            <p>20 Be loving and kind to all, but be
good to thy ſelf, intruſting to thy ſelf
next unto God: for it is better to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
for thy wel-gotten wealth &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then pitied for thy wilfully procured
poverty: beſides, he that is in a low or
declining condition, ſhall be forſaken of
his neereſt acquaintance, whileſt he that
is thriving ſhall have more kindred then
ever he had foes by John of Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
            <p>22 He that knoweth how to uſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,

Lord or Maſter: and therefore it is ill
beſtowed upon a covetous man, for the
more he hath, the more he deſires.</p>
            <p>23 If thou art poor, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pply thy ſelf to
Learning and Science, which is more
commendable then Riches: for rich men
without wiſdome are accounted of but
as ſheep having golden fleeces.</p>
            <p>24 Be diligent, for Diligence is the

nothing can be done concerning this life
