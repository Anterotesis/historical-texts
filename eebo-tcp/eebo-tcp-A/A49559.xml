            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Colonel General and some of the Gentry were taken, the rest made their escape by the swiftnesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56270:3"/>
of their horses to the Town; whereupon they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid Siege to it, publishing a Declaration which so fooled the people, that they were resolved to venture their Ruine in the prosecution thereof. Resenting the dangerous consequence this Faction might grow too, if not crop'd in the bud, the welfare or ruine of all South-wales depending thereon. I presently drew off my Guns from <hi>Aberistwith,</hi> leaving Colonel <hi>Powel</hi> to block it up, who since my departure surpriz'd their boat, a Captain, and fifteen Souldiers; marching directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for the Relief of <hi>Cardiffe,</hi> where before I could possibly come, the forces of Ragland were joyned with <hi>Carn</hi> and the rest, the Town taken, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour betaken himself to the Castle; whereupon I made my approach towards the Castle, least want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual or some other necessary might enforce Surrender; &amp; coming within a mile thereof, I found the enemy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a heath prepared for fight: drawing up my men I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently charged them; so God blessing our endeavors, Routed and dispersed them all, pursuing the Rout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ragland six miles beyond <hi>Cardiffe,</hi> their Foot were all killed and taken, and about forty of then Horse. My men eager of the Victory, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt into the Castle, made a sally too soon, before my Horse could be brought about (by reason of the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) to second them; so that being over-power'd with a body of Horse that was in the Town, there was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Brother which was my Lieutenant Colonel, and some few of the Souldiers, the rest making their Retreat good to the Castle; drawing off my wearied Forces for that night to their Quarters within a mile of the Town, thereby to cut off all accesse of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I was next day plyed with continual Alarms of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56270:3"/>
the gathering a Malignant party to a head in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that they had made good a passage within two miles of the Town, resolving to relieve their distressed Friends. While I was busied with this Alarm, the next day and night strengthning my Guards, and having a special eye to the issue, the Governor of the Castle, and the Committee in the interim fell to a Parley with those in the Town, and Articles of Agreement were drawn between them, which when brought to me to desire my Subscribal, I condescended to as much as concerned my self and my Souldiers, as not privy to the draught till the conclusion. But <hi>Carn</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants making breach of the Agreement, gave us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to do that which we much desired, considering the ill consequence if they had come to joyn with the other party. Being demanded their reason of the breach of Articles, answered, They would justifie it with their lives; and thereupon fell to fire on our men, which was quickly answered; for as soon as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders to fall upon them, they did it with that cheerfulnesse that they totally Routed them, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chase for seven miles. There were killed of the Enemy in both Actions, about Two hundred and fifty, and Eight hundred taken Prisoners, whereof two Lieut.

Colonel to Col. <hi>Trevilian,</hi> is raising a Regiment in these parts of Devonshire to assist in the more close blocking up of that place. Exeter this while is drawing its last breath, and I hope when we return neither place shall have that to stick with them, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to has done (point of honour) upon this ground, that there was a probable signe of relief, otherwise their inclinations are much to save themselves.</p>
            <p>This day (as indeed every day) there came some from the enemy, who inform they are about to draw off from Stratton,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56270:4"/>
and all the passes upon the River, having burnt down and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Bridges: That they were drawing off from Salt-ash; That most of their horse were neer twenty miles in Cornwal; That <hi>Hopton</hi> cannot get his foot together, neither will the Trainedbands rise, that their fear is great the Army will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them. The other day being the Market day, Master <hi>Peters</hi> preacht unto the Country people and souldiers in Torrington, (the Church being blown up) he was forced to preach out of a Belcony, where the audience was great; he made a great impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the hearts of the people: He is sent to Plymouth to offer things to consideration there in order to our marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cornwal, and to get all the Cornish Gentlemen to meet the General in Cornwal, to give their assistance in the better setling of that County: And I beseech you hasten such of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and interest in those parts that are above at <hi>London:</hi> And likewise for Devonshire, for I doubt the want of active Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to appear to settle the Militia of this County, will make the work to be done, when the Army is drawn back, which will not be for your and their service. It is certain the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> received a wound in the side of his head with a pike, some say he is wounded elsewhere; we took one of their spies coming into our quarters for intelligence, and that he might be the better credited by the person to whom he was sent; he was to produce a silver Meddal with the Kings Picture, which we took from him, and having committed him to custody, sent one of our spies to the partee (with that Meddal) who gave credit to the bearer, and informed the good condition of our Army, the desperate condition of theirs, by the defeat given them at Torrington; and that they had no way left but to flye to the furthest part of Cornwal: all the Country hereabouts are spread with their horse and foot, that ran away in the dark that night, and are lurking hereabouts; there are very many both horse and foot come in unto us, and take up Arms, and divers others desire passes to go into their own Countries, which they have granted accordingly: All the Cornish that were common souldiers are set at liberty, and had two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a peece given them to carry them home, which we hope will work the same effect, that an action of the like nature did

at the taking of Dartmouth, for, as Major <hi>Hooper</hi> who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner at Dartmonth, and sent upon his parole to Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal, reported at his return, that the overthrow given to <hi>Hopton</hi> at Torrington, did not so much move the Cornish with the fear of this Army, as their carriage in the sending home of those Cornish in that civil manner did prevail with them; who when they came into the Country, being required to take up Arms, refused the same, and were committed to Goal, and now lie in prison for the same; the Country being much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at their hard usage, and our gentle carriage; for indeed the Cornish were made to believe, and some by reason of their cruel carriage to our forces, when they were in Cornwal out of guilt did believe, that nothing but destruction was intended to them: There was directions given by the General to all the field. Officers at the Councel of war, that they should give a command to the several Regiments of horse and foot, that they do in no kinde offer any violence to the Cornish nor do any prejudice unto them in their persons or goods: I make no doubt the Officers will be very careful to do their duties, though (truly) I doubt the souldier (especially those that were there formerly stript) will hardly overcome a passionate remembrace of the same: The Commissioners of Parliament are sent into the several Counties to pay the recruits, and to hasten them to the Army; but the four thousand pound sent down hither for that purpose, we are inforced to take into Cornwal with us, and have assigned them to take up monies in ready cash at Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol and Taunton; We march with a very fine Army both of horse and foot into Cornwal, and great care is taken for an orderly and souldierlike march, and carriage of our affairs in this expedition.
