            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>HONOURABLE SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Read the Books you sent me with
some heed, pretending, some for the
<hi>Interest of England,</hi> others for the
<hi>Safety of the King and Kingdome,</hi>
all for the <hi>publick Good,</hi> which every
good man would readily imbrace.
But in perusing the several Pleas,
I found the Question to be, Whether
the present <hi>Uniformity</hi> or former <hi>Toleration,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Order</hi> or former <hi>Confusions,</hi> or at least a Mixture of
these, were the happiest Constitution for <hi>England.</hi> So
that what I expected to be an Olive-branch of Peace;
proved but a pricking Thorn, fitted into a Crown,
to expose our Saviour and his Church a second time to
vexation and pain.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange that men should think a <hi>Parliament</hi> so
glorious for forming a golden Scepter for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> would
be diverted to hammer out an iron Trident for <hi>Neptune.</hi>
Their Counsel (like <hi>Praise-God Barebone</hi>'s Petition) had
suited another <hi>Rump,</hi> whose Interest lay in <hi>breaking;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95686:3"/>
but not this present Parliament, whose glory is to be
<hi>Healers</hi> of their Nation.</p>
            <p>Who-ever will search into the bottome of most of
these mens Design, shall find them (while <hi>Cromwell</hi> and
<hi>Vane</hi> are silenced with a Rope) bold Advocates for the
<hi>Good old Cause.</hi> Some indeed speak the King fair, but
in as ambiguous language as the <hi>Covenant</hi> spake his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as may be instanced in the Relative <hi>[His,]</hi> and
<hi>[Le Roy le veult,]</hi> in the 87. page of the Proposition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(when a keen sword shall be brought to decide
the sense) as intelligible of Deliverance onely expected
from <hi>God,</hi> as from the <hi>King.</hi> And haply this and other
Slip-knots were left on purpose, to take the benefit of
a Comma when time shall serve.</p>
            <p>Others avouch plainly the Democratick Principles,
That <hi>Government rises from the People's Consent, and is
radically founded in them;</hi> as the Authour of Liberty of
Conscience asserteth, p. 42. Not considering, that in
<hi>Adam</hi>'s many hundred years Monarchy he never asked
his Subjects Consent: and had he not fallen, he had
prevented the <hi>French</hi> Design, and continued Universal
Monarch to the World's end. And though the King
hath prudently forbidden all publick Disputes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Prince and People's power; this Authour ventures
in many pages to circumscribe his Prince.</p>
            <p>And for the Parliament, though they are beholden to
them for an <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> whereby their forfeited
Lives are secured: yet so unkind are they, that one of
them <hi>professes himself not very carefull how he carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
towards them,</hi> Prop. pag. 4. he upbraids them <hi>for
passing Acts against Innocent men,</hi> p. 5. calling them
<hi>Murtherers,</hi> p. 74. and <hi>men of a hardy Conscience,</hi> ('twas
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95686:3"/>
too broad to say <hi>brawny</hi>) p. 76. <hi>that esteemed trouble
for sin a Romance,</hi> and accusing them for <hi>incompetent
Judges of a wounded Conscience,</hi> as <hi>never acquainted
with such things,</hi> p. 77. he tells them <hi>the damned will
cry out on their Acts as made to damn men,</hi> p. 75. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to <hi>convince the Parliament,</hi> p. 19. And all of
them strive to persuade them that <hi>their way will never
doe,</hi> with such like Rhetorick, of which these Books are
full.</p>
            <p>Now for the Church; besides their usual Crackers,
they constantly brand them with <hi>a formal spirit,</hi> as may
be seen in D. P. p. 16, 73, 106. not considering Saint
<hi>Paul</hi>'s description of formal men, to be such as are
<hi>traitorous, heady, high-minded, creeping into widows
houses,</hi> and conventicling there: of which (I suppose)
none have confidence enough to charge the Episcopal
Divines, but these tender Consciences. 'Twas those
he say 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 5. had a form of Godliness, without
the power.</hi> But one of them runs a stranger Risque,
and accuses the great States-men, or his Majestie's
Privy Council, <hi>for not wise in several particulars.</hi>
1. For not committing Sacrilege, P. p. 48. That is,
<hi>for not taking Church-Revenues from Church-men.</hi>
2. For not <hi>burying the Covenant</hi> (fetched out of the
Paw of the Northern Bear, who first whelped it) <hi>as
honourably as the Jewish Worship,</hi> that came from God,
P. p. 51. Thus is the Northern Thistle mated with
the Olive of God's Temple. 3. For <hi>not compounding
for Episcopacy:</hi> as if they had retrived the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
for Sequestrations at <hi>Haberdashers-Hall.</hi> And
for the Bishops, their sentence of Extirpation is past
by him, P. p. 51. who are farther threatned by them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95686:4"/>
all, but especially the Prop. p. 86. 'Tis matter of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to me, that so sober a man as that Authour is
should run out into such intemperate expressions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Authority; especially, the Presbyterians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared, in their Address to the King, <hi>that every
good man (in things he conceives to be sins) will be very
tender of the honour of Superiours.</hi> In a word, all that
advise the King, compared to them, are judged <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of mean counsell,</hi> as the Prop. phrases it, p. 46.
You see these <hi>Icarus's</hi> upon the wing; they hope
to kiss the Sun, if their wings be but fastned by an
Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Nor is their kindness to all these great Interests toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much larger then to them distinct. For they most
scandalously reckon Church and State, King, Lords
and Commons, (the true Representative of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
person in <hi>England</hi>) to be <hi>but a Party,</hi> and match
them with Presbyterians, Independents, Quakers, or
what other Party will pretend to Conscience. Nay,
D. P. p. 57. affirms <hi>the Non-conformers to out-balance</hi>
(that is his word) <hi>the Conformers:</hi> so trifling a thing to
them is a King in Parliament. And farther, D. R. p. 5.
calls it <hi>an unhappy Errour, when Parties</hi> (speaking of
the Episcopal) <hi>take themselves to be the whole, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
and act accordingly.</hi> Such ill Logick these men
conceive it, that the Legislative power of a Nation
should swell into a conceit of being equivalent to
some mushrome Sect. Surely thus to libell Governors
is not the way to convert them to our humour; unless
we conceive them to be Spaniels, made pliable by
Abuses.</p>
            <p>Can we guess these Writers of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95686:4"/>
that plead so hard for Syncretism, a thing so
hatefull to that Party, that <hi>Love</hi> at <hi>Vxbridge-</hi> Treaty
would have no Peace, for fear lest they should mix
Light and Darkness, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> together; that
is, King and Parliament? And the sagacious Sectaries
generally conclude them to be of an <hi>Imposing spirit;</hi>
in regard Father <hi>Beza,</hi> in his <hi>Haereticis morte mulctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
hath sentenced Hereticks to death; and that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
took care to see <hi>Servetus</hi> safe into another world,
at <hi>Geneva,</hi> by the light of his funerall Fire and Faggot:
which made poor <hi>Bellius, Eleutherius,</hi> and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
to style him <hi>virum sanguinarium,</hi> a bloudy <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite;</hi>
and <hi>Erastus</hi> to contrive another way for a <hi>Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Government. Marquess <hi>Huntley, Angus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholl,</hi>
will be <hi>Scottish</hi> evidence of their enmity to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration:
and no less speaks their glorious attempt
for outing Bishops, Root and Branch, out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Besides, <hi>they Covenant to bring the Churches of
the three Kingdoms to the nighest Uniformity they can.</hi>
And in 1645. their Assembly gave the Parliament
their Testimony against Toleration. Not to omit, that
<hi>Rigid</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> are almost convertible terms in
the vulgar Dictionary. Nor indeed do some of them
speak clear for a full Toleration: for D. P. tells us,
p. 58. <hi>A Toleration not stated will break us more to
pieces, and doe nothing else:</hi> and D. R. p. 87. pleads
onely for <hi>a well-managed and limited Toleration:</hi> yea
he tells you, p. 43. that <hi>the Non-conformers will never
endure a Toleration that brings in Popery;</hi> and M. I. p. 14.
utterly <hi>excludes Papists</hi> from this fair Haven, to sink
in the Seas of Oppression. Onely L. C. A. deals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously,
and speaks out for all, upbraiding the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95686:5"/>
rest, <hi>for consulting private Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis farther observed by many learned men, That
the <hi>Calvinisticall</hi> Party have ever strongly affected a
Papal Dominion over mens Lives and Consciences.
And the Remonstrants observe, in their Preface <hi>ad
Antidotum,</hi> That no man ever opposed that Party <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punè,
nisi cum ei potestas opprimendi defuit;</hi> like a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never guiltless but when his Nails are pared.
Which note haply caused Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> in his <hi>Fascicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Controversiarum,</hi> to propose that weighty Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>An Suprematus Papalis vel Presbyterialis sit tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilior.</hi>
Which one of these Proctors for Liberty of
Conscience justifies in <hi>English</hi> thus, P. p. 63. <hi>I know
no more danger in prevailing Popery, then prevailing
Presbyterianism, as to mens Lives and Souls.</hi> It seems,
he fansies both to be but <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Foxes tied by the
tails with Fire-brands, to burn down the Harvest of
<hi>Christ.</hi> And surely, while thy cry out against
<hi>Prelaticall Oppression,</hi> the Lordly Bishops onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
and confuted <hi>Servetus</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Church, and so dismissed him to Divine Justice; but
the <hi>Geneva</hi> Discipline found Fire and faggot for him
as soon as he came thither. Which made <hi>Montfort</hi>
draw <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Picture, not in a Gown and Cassock,
(robes of Peace,) but in a Helmet, Back and Breast,
belted and armed like a man of War. So little doth
Patience rule those sacred breasts, when they have
the Over-rule. Which farther shews these zealous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of Truth are but Time-servers, while their
Principles warp with their Condition.</p>
            <p>But, alas! the Devil would turn Monk when he was
sick and low. A <hi>Scottish</hi> stomack is not so great, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95686:5"/>
it scorns to ask for mercy. Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s Submission and
Mr. <hi>Jenkins's</hi> Petition both shew, the <hi>Elephantiasis</hi> (like
the Gout) never troubles them but when they are rich
and great. The Rump-Act of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1650. for Liberty
of tender Consciences was against the Presbyterians
Conscience and Preaching too, and pronounced a great
Sin in those daies: yet now these Consciences can tack
about, and plead for that they once condemned: why
may they not tack a little farther, to a compliance with
the Laws under which they live? If their Bread be
wholesome, being mixed in the Episcopal Batch, why
may they not (without danger of poisoning) eat all of
the ancient and national Baking? unless they will have
something granted, to make the world believe there
was some colour for the late Rebellion; which yet one
of them confesses <hi>to be nothing,</hi> and that <hi>Cause stark naught,</hi>
Prop. p. 45. though soon after, to wit p. 65. (as if he
had offended his weak brethren) he licks that Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up again with a flat Contradiction, averring the great
Causes of it.</p>
            <p>But to return: what would these men have? First,
and in general, <hi>the establishment of the Protestant Religion
in its full latitude,</hi> as D. R. p. 3, &amp;c. onely L. C. A.
seems to be more equal to all Religions, and thinks p. 52.
<hi>a limited Toleration pleaded for, infers no more then that
none are to be indulged but such as are punctually of their
own belief and persuasion.</hi> Yea so general is M. I. p. 10.
that he would have <hi>no distinction used, but that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
and Papist, in this Kingdom.</hi> But what need this
trouble? 1. Is any other Religion established in this
Kingdom, then Reformed Christianity in D. R. p. 3.
his sense? or any thing settled beside the Protestant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95686:6"/>
Religion? True it is, Accommodation or Toleration
may settle something else, but the present Establishment
doth not. For the settled Doctrine (I think) none will
question it: and for the Rites and Ceremonies; none
other are required but such as were settled by Law in
the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, as is positively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Rubrick before the Common Prayer:
and we think 'twas not Popery he settled. Indeed 'tis
true, <hi>Imposition</hi> it self is look'd upon, by some of these
Pleaders for Liberty, as Popish: for M. I. tells us, p. 12.
<hi>That he that is for Imposition is a Protestant by mistake,
and will find himself at home in his Principles no-where but
at Rome.</hi> Now if this be justified, then was <hi>Calvin</hi> a
Papist, who in his known Epistle to the Protector of
<hi>England</hi> advises, for the confining of desultory wits and
brain-sick people in this Kingdom, that one Form of
Doctrine and Order should be drawn up, to which every
Parish-Priest should declare his full consent, yea be
bound by an Oath to follow inviolably. Then was
<hi>Luther</hi> a Papist, who every-where pleads for a Form of
Doctrine and Discipline to be established and imposed
against the wild Sectaries of that Age. <hi>Melanchthon,</hi>
in his Church-Policy, is so earnest for these Impositions,
that he thinks, if these Church-Ordinances be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the Church it self is in danger. And little less is
confessed by D. R. p. 23. <hi>A Settlement must have all
things needfull to Faith, a good Life, and godly Order;</hi>
who therefore pleads for <hi>a limited Toleration,</hi> p. 8.
Yet he would not take it well, if you say he is at home
onely at <hi>Rome.</hi> And D. P. p. 16. grants the Church
<hi>power to impose Ceremonies,</hi> and thinks himself <hi>bound to
submit to the Churche's judgement what Ceremonies are most
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95686:6"/>
convenient,</hi> p. 17. yet esteems himself a Protestant. 'Tis
well if that Synod <hi>Act.</hi> 15. can clear themselves from
this Gentleman's imputation of Popery, for offering to
impose burthens upon the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> in things
indifferent, verse the 28. A Principle equally imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Protestants and Papists is very unreasonably
called <hi>a Popish Principle.</hi> But this is the old trick of the
Puritan, and too successfull, (as the late King and
Church most sadly experimented) to brand with the
mark of Popery what-ever they had a mind to render
odious to the People. 2. Are they so kind to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Interest as they pretend to be? See what a wipe
another of them hath given it, D. P. p. 109. affirming
<hi>that the Protestant Principles lead directly to Separation:</hi>
a blacker stroak then which was never given it by the
Pen of the most rancorous Papist. Yet let him be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
for it, since he doth but <hi>servire thesi:</hi> For how
can a Separatist prove himself a Protestant, unless Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism
lead to Separation? Thus the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> paint
the Apostles black, that they may not seem unlike the
Saints. 3. What Settlement is that to Protestantism,
when Toleration shall muster up all its Sects to beard
it in every Parish? As well might <hi>Job</hi>'s eldest Son's
House stand steddy, when the violent Gusts wreak'd
their spleen upon the four corners of it; or the Ship
be safe, when winds and waves are permitted to toss her
at their pleasure. 4. 'Tis strange Presumption, and
savours of but too large a stock of spiritual Pride, to
think they can settle Protestancy better then the most
accurate Diligence of the great Council of this Land.
5. Whom will they comprehend under the name of
Protestants? If all that protest against the Errours of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95686:7"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> such are the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, such
are the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> yea such is the <hi>Turk</hi> himself. If our
Sects onely; let them know that the most sober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have esteemed them but as the <hi>Ascarides</hi> bred
out of our Bodies, but as Vermine on the Body Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick:
they are reckoned amongst the ill humours with
which our crazy Body is distempered. Nor is it so
heavily to be charged upon our Constitution, since the
purest bodies are not secured from the like Corruption.
The very Angelical State produced the blackest Devils.
If they mean the bulk of Protestants, they are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
already. If all this pother is made for a few
<hi>silenced Ministers,</hi> do they think the Protestant Religion
lies choak'd while they are silenced? is it so interwoven
with their well-being, that it cannot survive them? Or
are they such ill Sons, that they will never let their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sleep, till she hugs them in her arms? Must not the
Father of their Countrey rest, till he hath given them
satisfaction? Must Parliaments withdraw their Acts, to
give these men their wills?</p>
            <p>For, as for the deluded People that follow them, what
can they scruple at? Are they obliged to Oaths or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions?
are they tied to use any other Ceremony
then what these Ministers acknowledge they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
use? and do they not many of them allow the
imposition of those things that are for Decency and
Order under Penalties, so they be but small? Hear
D. R. p. 27. granting <hi>Governours authority to use humane
Prudence, the light of Nature and general rules of Scripture,
in ordering of their Church;</hi> not requiring express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for every Posture about Religious Worship. And
D. P. p. 85. acknowledges the <hi>Magistrate may be bold
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95686:7"/>
in exacting Conformity by lighter punishment,</hi> which may
serve to deterre the Factious, and are not like to tempt a
man truly consciencious to act against his Conscience, if
it boggle at all. So that the Prop. did well observe, <hi>the
people's heads were onely filled with empty fears, with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
surprizes, and childish frights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains therefore that these Ejected Ministers are
in a great measure the Troublers of our <hi>Israel,</hi> as was
their Father's house ever since the Reformation. God
grant them a timely sight of it, and true Repentance for
it. But, alas! how can that be, while they hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the arms of their own Praises? See how affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately
they commend each other for godly, Prop.
p. 79, 80. and declare themselves <hi>the slain Witnesses,</hi>
and affirm themselves <hi>the most serious and painfull men of
the Nation,</hi> D. P. p. 87. and bestow their richest Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
of Rhetorick upon each other, <hi>ubi causa est, ubi
causa non est, as Blondel</hi> says <hi>Ignatius</hi> pleads for
Bishops.</p>
            <p>Surely, 'tis not without contrivance, that these men
now fill the Press with their Pleas. They well know
how ridiculous it would render the Parliament, (yea
and Government it self,) to withdraw an Act settled
with so much care and consultation, back'd with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Reasons, and deep Resolutions to stand by it; and
therefore can have but little hope to obtain its Repeal,
without which notwithstanding D. P. declares <hi>all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
impossible.</hi> If I may therefore have leave
to guesse the cause, it is to chear up the spirits of
gasping Factions with vain hopes of what the subtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to be hopeless. Much artifice hath been used
already to this purpose. At first, if great numbers would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95686:8"/>
leave their places, they promised that the Powers would
soon restore them. Then being willing to uphold their
Party, (for want of better things) they catch at the
Rush of a fond Prophecy,
<list>
                  <item>MDLLLVVII 1662.
BarthoLo MaeVs fLet qIa DesIt Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
AngLVs.</item>
                  <item>MDLCVVVI 1666.
ADVentV Laeta est sanCta MarIa
tVo.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>During the operation of this Prophecy they remained
pretty silent; till the time elapsed, and nothing effected,
they saw it necessary to spread a false report all the
Country over, of a <hi>Toleration</hi> prepared for them. But
words soon vanishing, they turn to Printing, to uphold
languishing expectation. So that they hold each other
from Conformity by these Stratagems, and call them
Conscience: but if the Parliament crouch not to them,
they must consult the Brazen head again, what to say
next.</p>
            <p>I conceive not all these Advocates for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but some act under a vizard, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading
themselves, that if they can get in the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Needle, the long thred of Sectaries must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow after. However they know, that if pretence
of Conscience can foil one Law, it will at length foil
every one it pleases to decry: and that if a man can't
save his Arm from cutting off, nor can he save his Head.
When the Out-works are taken, the rest can't long hold
out. If the royal Globe in the hand of Majesty be
once struck out, it will tumble to the bottome of the
Throne.</p>
            <p>And indeed they give occasion to suspect no less, some
of them pleading for the <hi>free admission of all persons to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95686:8"/>
Government.</hi> M. I. p. 17. desires <hi>that no man's opinion
may advance him, nor no man's opinion may prejudice him.</hi>
Another pleads for <hi>the restauration as well of Civil Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
as Ecclesiastical,</hi> P. p. 89. And whether he means the
<hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> or the proscribed or pardoned <hi>Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
or fanaticall and disaffected <hi>Aldermen,</hi> is a Question:
for you will find him to justifie that Cause, p. 65. and
highly to commend <hi>Cromwell, as a Mortal eternallized,</hi>
p. 45. he esteems <hi>the Covenant, as the</hi> Jewish <hi>Worship,
from God,</hi> p. 49. and judges <hi>the Rumpers more publick-spirited
men then this present Parliament.</hi> And D. R. p. 47.
desires <hi>a new Act for Sequestring scandalous, ignorant and
insufficient Ministers.</hi> So that at least they are <hi>Latitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians,</hi>
some of them, that is, of <hi>Henry Marten, Henry
Nevile, Thomas Challoner,</hi> or <hi>Aug. Garland</hi>'s Foot-mark,
with the rest of that sort of <hi>Rumpers,</hi> whose Atheism,
joyned with Religious Canting, made them look like
Ghosts with bright Tapers in their hands; true Non-conformists
to all that ever did believe a Deity.</p>
            <p>2. But now, for the Settlement of Protestantism, they
conceive it necessary that the Act for <hi>Uniformity</hi> be
withdrawn, and some larger way proposed. This D. P.
calls <hi>an Accommodation,</hi> D. R. <hi>an established Order,</hi>
L. C. A. <hi>Comprehension.</hi> Whether the Act for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
may be prudently withdrawn, shall be spoken
to anon: for the present we may observe, First, That these
Pleaders are divided in their desires so far, that to please
one would necessarily displease the other. D. P. and D. R.
both think <hi>the Settlement must be by turning the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
into an Act.</hi> But L. C. A. p. 52. would not
<hi>have the Civil Sanction at all; because such things are
onely cognisable in aliena Republica;</hi> and that Civil
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95686:9"/>
Powers have onely right to judge of things <hi>concerning
the natural good of mankind,</hi> not the spiritual good of
Christians, p. 49. that they must not use the Civil Sword
about ought but the <hi>light of Nature, (ferè per totum.)</hi> Thus
are the Powers accused by him for acting <hi>out of their
Sphere,</hi> and meddling with things they have nothing to
doe withall. Besides, he will acknowledge nothing to
be <hi>the Rule of Christian Communion</hi> (as far as I can judge)
but <hi>the Creed:</hi> which I gather from those words L. C. A.
p. 51. <hi>How unmercifull a thing is it, and how unlike the
Primitive Christians, to make such Ceremonies a Rule of
the Churche's Communion, which used to be nothing but
the Creed!</hi> I shall not digress so far as to examine the
truth of this saying, though I know the Authour hath
more Learning then to believe it. But secondly, why
is so great a Noise made about these Non-conformers?
Can they force the Government? I may say as <hi>Cicero</hi>
of <hi>Antony,</hi> he could never obtain that Power but by
evil Arts: so that 'tis their shame, not their glory, to
be popular. And lest they should swell in conceit,
S. <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Nepotian</hi> tells you, <hi>Admirationem sui facere
celeritate dicendi apud imperitum vulgus, indoctorum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum
est;</hi> and adds, (to confute mens bold ignorance)
<hi>attrita frons interpretatur saepe quod nescit:</hi> yea, to shew
the levity of winning the Vulgar, he adds, <hi>Nihil tam
facile quàm vilem plebeculam &amp; indoctam Concionem lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae
volubilitate decipere, quae quicquid non intelligit plùs
miratur.</hi> He could not more exactly have described
these Rabbies, had he lived to have seen them on the
Stage in Querpo. Yet will you hear them bear record
of themselves? One <hi>R. A.</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> p. 55. tells
you, <hi>Invenimus Ecclesiam</hi> Christi <hi>lateritiam, reliquimus
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95686:9"/>
marmoream.</hi> You hear him bellow like a Bull, 'tis pity
he should prove weaker then a Bulrush. Surely these
<hi>Megabyzi sermones</hi> will prove but <hi>swelling words of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
I appeal to the sober of this Land, what is the <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
there talked of, which these so much glory in, but
a turning men from the <hi>King</hi> to that which was then
nick-named the <hi>Parliament?</hi> I have heard two or three
of that Party say, (whose names I suppress in charity)
that they understood no <hi>Conversion</hi> for the first seven
years, but turning men from King to Parliament. That
they should boast of this success of their Ministry, is as
much Impudence as Imprudence. 'Tis <hi>Perversion</hi> rather
then <hi>Conversion,</hi> to turn men from <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
or from <hi>Debauchery</hi> to <hi>Disloyalty.</hi> Such Proselytes are
more the Children of darkness then before. Nor was
God long in Retaliating: for they soon found, to their
sorrow, <hi>Conversion</hi> signified turning men from <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
to <hi>Independent,</hi> from thence to <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> and so
on from one corrupted Opinion to another. And the
Apostates thus gloried in the name of <hi>Converts</hi> and
<hi>Inlightned,</hi> even when changed to the grossest Errours.
What <hi>Thraso</hi> would thus glory in his shame? <hi>Faction</hi>
hath well thriven under them, but so hath not <hi>Faith;
Rebellion</hi> prospered, but not <hi>Religion.</hi> Let the world
judge, whether Honesty and Devotion have been more
practised since the Wars then before.</p>
            <p>And since these men thus trouble their Countrey
with the loud noise of their Merits; let them answer
that sad, but serious, Charge laid on them by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the Modern Policy in the Pref. <q>That our
flouds of Miseries were swelled by Clergy holy-water;
That their Torches of saving Light were turned to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95686:10"/>
destroying Fire-brands;—Their Trumpets should
have sounded Retreats, but they sounded Alarms to
fury.</q> I am persuaded, would these Ministers lay their
hands upon their hearts, and impartially consider the
effects of their former Preaching, their just indignation
at their own sins would justifie any Act for their future
Silence, unless in a Recantation. The Consciences of
all grave and moderate men are ready to charge them
with preaching Unity out of the Church, Peace out of
the State, Obedience to Superiours out of mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
themselves out of countenance with all lawfull,
and out of maintenance with all usurped Powers. What
remains farther to compleat the measure of evils, may
be left to <hi>Cromwell, Phocas,</hi> or <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontius Pilate:</hi> for <hi>Judas</hi>
the Disciple of <hi>Christ</hi> hath done his part already. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will reade their Volumes of Fast-Sermons, preached
before the Long Parliament, shall find Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi>
outshot in his own Bow by <hi>English Presbyterians.</hi> Nor
needs there any other Picture then what they have there
drawn of themselves, to shew these <hi>men of God</hi> are in
truth but <hi>men of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should these men be again admitted, what security
will they give (that seruple at Obligations) that they
will not fall to their old work again of converting Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their Allegiance, and filling their hearts with
variety of Scruples? especially since 'tis doubted they
are not purged clean from that bitter Opinion, That
Subjects, seeing their Sovereign to erre, (of which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will be judges) may lawfully enter into a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
to stand by each other, (as the late Army several
times, by their example, did against their Rump) and
contend, till they have brought Sovereignty into due
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95686:10"/>
Order. Which is not onely a School-point, but an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith that makes up a Presbyterian <hi>Creed,</hi> aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by most of their learned Writers. For which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<hi>Paraeus</hi>'s Book died a Martyr in <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the
hand of the common Hangman. Yet sure,
<q>Mergi, non uri, debuit iste Liber,</q>
that flamed so hot in Fanatick zeal against Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</p>
            <p>'Twas <hi>Roman</hi> prudence, not to permit any man to
preach to the people, <hi>nisi authoritate Magistratuum priùs
habitâ, Cic.</hi> Ep. l. 4. ad Att. ep. 1, 2. where also <hi>potestas
Ciceroni &amp; Clodio concessa est</hi> to have a publick Sermon
before the Vulgar. I know not whether our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
see cause for so strict a course or no: but some
Demagogues make an ill use of their Liberty, praying
for Authority in such scandalous language as they would
be loath to be prayed for themselves; poisoning Auditors
hearts with holy Bread, and their Prince's Reputation
with religious Tears. They pray God to bring their
Prince to a right mind, that they may religiously from
the Pulpit proclaim him perverse; and onely ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of his sins, that the Vulgar may take notice how
sinfull he is. It would behove Princes to command
such Libellers to leave them out of those Devotions,
whose flames burn rather then warm.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What do these men presume they are, that the
<hi>English</hi> Nation must come to <hi>Accommodation</hi> with them?
Are they grown <hi>Hoghen, Moghens,</hi> that strive to make
Acts of Parliament to strike sail to their Toleration?
Shall the unparallel'd Confidence of 300 men rule the
Laws, rather then the Laws them? <hi>Satìs pro imperio:</hi>
God bless their Majesties. How strangely (think they)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95686:11"/>
are Parliaments cow'd, that fear the <hi>Black</hi> coat as well
as the <hi>Red?</hi> But why so? Are they <hi>Christians?</hi> then
there is no fear of them. <hi>Nunquam Christiani inventi
sunt Cassiani:</hi> There is no danger in a Sheep of <hi>Christ:</hi>
Christians may be Martyrs, but can't be Murtherers.
Are they <hi>Antichristians? Pereat proles Babylonica.</hi> Who
will make much of nought? who would yoak his Teem
to fetch a Wren home from the Woods?</p>
            <p>3. To make way for this Accommodation several
things are declaimed against. As 1. the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
Thus D. P. p. 14. <hi>No Reconciliation can be,
till the Act of Uniformity be down.</hi> But of this more
anon. 2. <hi>The requiring more as the Conditions of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
the Ministry, then things necessary to Salvation,
after Examination and Approbation.</hi> D. P. p. 95. P. p. 82.
<hi>'Tis unmercifull,</hi> says L. C. A. p. 51. <hi>to make Ceremonies
the Rule of the Churche's Communion:</hi> yea he decries all
Impositions but in moral things. So that the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried
by some of them (for they most irreconcilably
differ amongst themselves about this part) are 1. <hi>the
imposition of Oaths and Subscriptions.</hi> P. p. 18. declares
<hi>Oaths useless and provoking men to fall foul on the Imposers,</hi>
p. 22. <hi>when their Conscience smites them for them:</hi> and
D. P. p. 27. makes a loud outcry against the Oath in
the Act of Uniformity, as it was modelled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
contrived on purpose to comply with these mens Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Peevishness. The <hi>Covenant</hi> is not so much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it, that the Covenanters might find nothing to
boggle at; yet are their Complaints as great as before:
which may well discourage Authority from striving to
gratifie them for the future. How diligent that Authour
hath been in picking holes in the Oath, may appear
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95686:11"/>
to any that will reade the place cited. Yet we are told
by the Non-conformers, in their account to his Majesty
concerning the Review of the Liturgie, That <hi>they are
misrepresented, if they are represented causelesly or prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
inquisitive into the Reasons of Superiours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
That he is causelesly and pragmatically scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
appears by this, (D. P. p. 25.) that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the many faults he charges upon the Oath, to
affrighten others, <hi>he is ready to write a Book for taking
this very Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will you hear his Exceptions? 1. <hi>'Tis against the
freedom of the Subject, to be tied from endeavouring Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
D. P. p. 27. His Reason is, because <hi>Subjects have
power to chuse Parliament-men, who are to consult about
Grievances,</hi> &amp;c. For answer, First, It seems by this Plea,
that the Government is a Grievance, else the Argument
concludes nothing. Secondly, Their Writs will tell you
they are called to consult <hi>de arduis Regni,</hi> not to alter
the Government. And thirdly, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> thinks, to
consult is but to advise as Counsellors, not to enact as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators
distinctly. And fourthly, The man brings a
sword with him to stab this exception in p. 44. where
he asks, <hi>What have men in a private capacity to doe with
Government?</hi> Either the Electors are private, and then
what have they to doe with Government? or publick,
and then who are the private Subjects? Fifthly, The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is recognised, as a previous qualification to
all the People's Representatives; and what Alteration
can they then make in it without Perjury?</p>
            <p>2. His second Exception is against that Clause, that
declares it <hi>traitorous to hold we may take up Arms by the
King's Authority against his Person, or any commissionated
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95686:12"/>
by him;</hi> putting the Case of a Sheriff's using the <hi>Posse
Comitatûs</hi> by Writ against any commissionated by the
King to the contrary. For answer, First, He confesses
that <hi>he believes the Parliament never intended by this Clause
to advance the personal will of the King above the Law,</hi>
D. P. p. 28. nor do the words enforce any such sense:
therefore (it seems) he never intended by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to prove the Oath unlawfull; but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
weak, that could not see the Objection, or not
so word the Oath as to exclude that one Case. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Sheriff is made by Commission from the
King; therefore to take Arms against him is to take
Arms against one commissionated by the King. The
Law requires a Sheriff, but 'tis the King's personal
will that declares and individuates the Sheriff. So
that the whole Exception is groundless. Thirdly,
It bespeaks great suspicion, of and little charity to, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
to imagine they will issue forth two directly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary
Commissions, and suffer both to be prosecuted
to bloud. But it well accords with these mens former
carriage to Authority. But fourthly, Let Authority
look to it, they are fairly warned: they may see the
Roots of the hemlock are still in the ground, and who
knows how soon they will bud forth? The King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
is still distinguished from his Legal or Regal will:
And Armies may be raised against the King's Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
though not against the King. Which were the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Principles of the late <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Now for his Exception against the word [<hi>I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre,</hi>]
which he calls <hi>Mr. Calamie's Scruple,</hi> D. P. p. 28.
First, He confesses <hi>he may say'tis unlawfull, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say he abhorrs a thing.</hi> But, sure, every honest man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95686:12"/>
abhorrs all unlawfull things. 'Tis true, there is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Christian a regenerate and unregenerate part, an
outward and an inward man, flesh and spirit, the carnal
mind and the spiritual part: Now the flesh lingers after
what the spirit abhorrs; and this comes up full to his
instance, (that a man may say 'tis <hi>unlawfull to accompany
another woman as his Wife, when he can't say he abhorrs it.</hi>)
'Tis true, the carnal minde, judging it unlawfull, may
yet hanker after her: but the mind as far as 'tis spiritual
utterly detests the sin. If this were Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the judicious will be tempted by it, to think him
more versed in the Scruple-house then the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Secondly, His instance persuades me, that, as the
carnal mind hath some inclinations to his neighbour's
Wife, so have they to a fresh Rebellion.</p>
            <p>4. His next Exception against the Oath is, That it
affirms it <hi>unlawfull upon any pretence whatsoever to take
up Arms against the King;</hi> alledging several Authours to
determine it <hi>lawfull, in some cases, to take up Arms against
their King.</hi> D. P. p. 30. First, The Authour acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
he <hi>is not like to say any thing against the sense and
meaning of the Oath,</hi> id. p. 31. So that his quarrell is
against the Composers, (viz. the Parliament) for their
weakness in expressing their sense. Secondly, The
Authours cited speak with respect to the Laws under
which they live: but sufficient Authority hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it unlawfull in this Land, upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
to take up Arms against the Sovereign, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
hath imposed this Oath. Thirdly, Holy
Scriptures, that supersede all humane Laws, allow no
Opposition upon any pretence whatsoever: if they do,
the Authour may take his own time to shew where,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95686:13"/>
that we may see God's Anointed murthered by God's
command, and our holy Religion to countenance a holy
Rebellion. Fourthly, Admit it lawfull to rebell on any
pretence, and Traitors will not want a pretence for any
Rebellion. No Treason shall be unreasonable, because
some Reason may be given for Treason. This Truth
hath been most lamentably experimented in our past
Commotions, where the same reasons were given for
outing the Secluded Members that were used for reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the King, (viz. they were a corrupt Interest, that
strived to ruine the good People;) and the same Sword
that cut off the Bulk lopp'd off the Rump of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Army found no Sword like it, to overturn
what-ever carried any face of Authority. Being taught
by such fatal instances, 'tis time to break that Sword
that hath been the death of so many Powers. Fifthly,
To suppose a Case in which Opposition may be lawfull;
who shall be judge of the matter of Fact? nor Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
nor Governed, for both are parties; and <hi>unus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisque
sua in lite judex est corruptus.</hi> It remains then that
the senseless Sword must be the sole Arbiter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
and then the Sentence must needs be a keen
one, let it fall which way it wil. How much better is it for
this man to consent with those Non-conformers in their
Address to the King, cited D. R. p. 16. <hi>That the publick
judgment, Civil or Ecclesiasticall, belongs to publick persons
onely, and not to any private man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. His last Exception is, <hi>That men are forced to swear
to a doctrinall Proposition, which we can't be sure of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
man is not infallible.</hi> To which we say, first, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things are infallibly true, though delivered by a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
man: as that Twice five is ten; that there is a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95686:13"/>
Deity, &amp;c. Secondly, A man may lawfully swear what
he certainly believes to be true, and this the Authour
seems to do. Thirdly, His Exception would prevent
Oaths in matters of fact as well as doctrinall Conclusions;
for his Eyes are no more infallible then his Brains, as a
Juggler would soon convince him. So that this Oath
would never have choak'd him, had <hi>it been swallowed
without so much chewing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having done with the Exceptions of D. P. because
the rest seem to oppose all Impositions of this kind, I shall
farther say, Their Opinion may be that of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
and Quakers, that there is no <hi>jus jurandi,</hi> no Oaths
lawfull: To which I mean not a Plea for Swearing, but
onely tell them that God swears <hi>by himself,</hi> the Angel <hi>by
him that lives for ever,</hi> S. <hi>Paul by the rejoycing of Christians,</hi>
which is the Gospel, and most School-Divines make
Oaths a part of that Honour and Worship that is due to
God, when upon just occasions and reverently taken.
If <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Hus</hi> were of another opinion, (as the
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> affirms) yet the evidence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth hath led the Protestants (not to say the whole
Catholick Church) this way. The Christians were
not accused by <hi>Saturnius</hi> for refusing to swear at large,
but for refusing to swear <hi>per genium Caesaris,</hi> (as <hi>Tert.</hi>
Ap. c. 32. plainly proves.) Yet I would not be thought
a Patron to common Swearing, the Gentleman's sin,
who thinks his Coat can't be well emblazoned but by a
field of Oaths; as if his Oratory were not pungent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he stabb'd his God; as if 'twere impossible for him to
be damned, till he had pray'd <hi>God damn me.</hi> I could wish
that the Groans of Christians might drown the Oaths of
these Antichristians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:95686:14"/>
But now, allowing Oaths lawfull, what reason can
these men have to rob Authority of this Bond, by which
Inferiours are linked to Superiours? They say, indeed,
they are useless; but they have the concurrent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Ages past to the contrary, and that too
glossed with perpetual practice; so that anciently <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
militare</hi> was the form of <hi>listing</hi> a Souldier. And
can they believe all men deceived rather then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
If Oaths be no Tie, why do they refuse them?
if a good Bond, why do they refuse to give it to their
Prince? 'Tis a strange Paradox, That the way to settle
a Government in peace is to take away all Ties and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
of Fidelity to it.</p>
            <p>If they mean less then they say, and so confine their
thoughts to Oaths and Declarations about Religion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
I reply, That it would accuse the Licensers of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
negligence, should they admit a man to guide the
Flock of God, yet not require him to declare before-hand
which way he would lead them. Then may the
Fox be set to keep the Goose, and the Wolf appointed
to direct the Lamb. S. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 16. would give his
blessing to none but such as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>would
walk by</hi> his <hi>Canons.</hi> Woe be to the Souls of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerning
Vulgar, when men shall be bid to speak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we know what they will say; when vent shall be
given to their Commodity, though it be Poison. What
safety is a City in, when any one is permitted to enter
the Gates? The best Ties fail of holding all from evil;
and what will be done where is none at all?</p>
            <p>Yet were these mens Pleas ever lawfull, 'tis so now:
for they have learned (like masterless Swine) to run
through Quick-set-Hedges with Yoaks about their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95686:14"/>
Necks. How nimbly did they skip from <hi>Allegiance</hi> and
<hi>Protestation</hi> to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> from thence to the <hi>Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
without Scratch or Prick complained of in their
Consciences? As if the Fishes in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Net were all Eels,
you could have no hold of them: As if <hi>Christ</hi>'s Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
could not be bound with Word nor Wax. No
doubt they were good <hi>Graecians,</hi> that practised so much
<hi>Graecâ fide;</hi> the Fathers <hi>fideles Infideles,</hi> that had so well
studied the Art of fast and loose; Brothers to <hi>Severus,</hi>
of whom <hi>Herod. l.</hi> 2. says, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
rather then fail, he
made his Conscience serve under his Projects, the better
to effect them. They preserve Kings by their Oaths
as Ladies do Apricocks, plucking them from their tree
of life, and boiling them in scalding water. They swear
to advance him to a Throne, and interpret it a Scaffold;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as <hi>Pertinax</hi> tells his
Souldiers;) they new drew their Covenant in red
Letters, dipping their Pens in Royal Bloud. But whist!
one of them silences me with the Act of Oblivion; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which themselves had sat very mute.</p>
            <p>Now for their Clergie, as Mr. <hi>Calamy, Case,</hi> &amp;c. yea
all Ordained before 1640, they swore <hi>Canonical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to their Bishop for the time being; and about three
years after expounded it by a <hi>Covenant</hi> to root them
out. How can we call that a <hi>tender Conscience</hi> that can
digest two-edged Oaths, Oaths of an ell long, Oaths
that speak Daggers to each other, and that too without
the least wince or haesitation? I think a man may have
better hold of them by their Purse-strings then Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-ties.
And therefore I should think Authority far
more secure against that Party by a Bond for their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95686:15"/>
Good behaviour, then the exactest Oath.</p>
            <p>As for an Objection brought in against taking the
Oath by P. <hi>that it binds not to a Duty more then before,</hi>
'tis very pretty: for, First, Oaths are taken for a stricter
Tie; and how comes that to be an Objection against
imposing Oaths, that they do not bind us more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Secondly, Is it not a contradiction to say, <hi>Oaths
bind no more to the thing then we were bound before they
are taken,</hi> yet presently to say, <hi>they bind by more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees?</hi>
What is <hi>more,</hi> but <hi>a degree?</hi> Without the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis
there wants truth, and with it 'tis scarcely sense.</p>
            <p>But 'tis urged, <hi>The Cavaliers formerly complained of
the many Oaths imposed, and esteemed it a great Oppression.</hi>
'Tis very true, and methinks <hi>Clem. Rom.</hi> ep. ad Cor. 1. p. 72.
doth think so too, for he puts <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <hi>Oppression,</hi>
(if I understand him.) But then, First, The Cavaliers
found them contrary to each other. The Oaths of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
and <hi>Supremacy</hi> bound them to preserve the
King in his Civil and Ecclesiasticall capacity: the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
would bind them to preserve the King, but against
his Ecclesiasticall capacity: the <hi>Ingagement</hi> bound them to
preserve the Government without the King. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
They were imposed as Traps to ensnare them, and
put them out of their paternal Inheritance. Thirdly,
They were imposed by insufficient Authority; which
left them that knew it so, yet took them, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.
Now neither of these is our present Case.</p>
            <p>That this Party hath <hi>holes to creep out of Oaths</hi> is no
doubt. M. I. p. 6. acknowledges <hi>the juggling of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and you may take his word, for he well understands
them. And indeed without this skill in Picklocks, how
got they out of the Oaths of Allegeance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95686:15"/>
Protestation and Covenant, &amp;c? I am sure they
never had the Golden Key of Authority to unlock the
door. They are something like <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> who swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to <hi>Hercules,</hi> that he would never discover where his
Arrows or Reliques were, nor the place of his Buriall;
yet being urged by the <hi>Graecians</hi> to reveal, he thought to
save his Oath by his Silence, yet pointed out the place
with his feet. I will not say the Covenanters did so;
seeming to dislike the King's Death by their Silence,
yet made way for it by treading him under their feet:
let their Consciences make application. But having
taken the Oaths, let them creep out of what holes they
will, it must be a hole in their Consciences, and that will
make another in their Reputations, and that again a
great hole in all honest mens opinions concerning them.
But enough of this.</p>
            <p>They farther desire leave to <hi>take the Oath in their own
words,</hi> some of them, as D. P. p. 45. So may they for
me, for being Non-conformers, how could the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hope they would swear in a form? And they have
too great a conceit of themselves, to think a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could not find out fitter words then they. In
a word, such great Speakers ought not now to be taught
to speak.</p>
            <p>2. They decry <hi>Rites and Ceremonies, and a Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them, as tyrannicall,</hi> and would have nothing as
<hi>the condition of Communion for Ministers and people, but
what is necessary to Salvation;</hi> as is proved before. But,
first, Why should the Presbyterians plead thus, since
they judged other things necessary to be subscribed,
in their attempts for Association, then merely necessaries
to Salvation? They then thought it no Oppression, to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95686:16"/>
urge the Episcopal and Independent Brethren to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
their printed Books, the bulk of which did exceed
that of the Church-Canons, and contained in them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
things not necessary to Salvation. Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
thought it no Oppression, to oblige the Ministers of the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to a publick acknowledgment of
those Canons he gave them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. yet sure they
were not necessary to the being of a Christian, but the
well-being of a Church. Thirdly, I am of L. C. A's.
mind, that <hi>in the Primitive times the Creed might have
sufficed,</hi> and now may for the Communion of Churches;
but not so for Communion in Churches. Faith is a good
foundation of the Catholick Union; but Union of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Christians must be grounded on an obligation to
observe certain Rites and Canons, which ought to be
owned and submitted to, yea and subscribed, if the
Church shall think fit. How else can men know the time
and place and posture, the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that is required 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. which <hi>Calvin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
to be required in that place? Fourthly, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
praises the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for keeping certain Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
that he delivered unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. of
which one was, that men should sit <hi>bare-headed</hi> in the
Church; concerning which Ceremony he spends no
less then the 14 following verses to enforce it. Now all
the Arguments almost of the Non-conformers against
Ceremonies, do as strongly militate against this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Institution, as against any now impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And 'tis observable, that the last Reply the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
thinks good to make against these Non-conformers
contentions is this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. that the Apostles <hi>used
no such customes</hi> (as covering of heads in the Church,)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95686:16"/>
               <hi>no nor the Church of God.</hi> Now let the Authour of L. C. A.
consider, whether the Arguments for Ceremonies can
be traced no farther then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez;</hi> and
let the Authour of D. P. consider, whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> be not
as much to be blamed for defending this Ceremony, as
B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Whitgift</hi> for defending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his time. 'Tis surely
an easie way to conquest, to persuade men not to defend
those necessary Rites that these men please to assault.
Fifthly, It seems to me that some of these Pleaders are
not so heartily ingaged against Rites and Ceremonies,
how-ever they are pleased to affrighten their deluded
admirers with the danger of them: for D. R. p. 24. tells
us, <hi>Comprehension excludes not Decency, but would have in
no more Ceremonies then needs must.</hi> And pray who shall
be judge what are needfull? D. P. p. 17. thinks very
honestly <hi>that the Church must judge:</hi> if so, they have
judged already, and so we may end this Dispute in a
friendly agreement.</p>
            <p>Having thus discharged the General cry of this deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed
Pack, come we to consider the Particulars.
Let them but enumerate what they would have, and be
their own Carvers, and 'twill amount to no less then
the <hi>Good old Cause;</hi> or rather more, for they desire <hi>a
Positive Law for Toleration,</hi> as P. p. 69, 70. L. C. A. p. 11.
D. R. p. 8. &amp;c. while a general Praeterition served be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And certainly that great <hi>Roman</hi> Orator was right;
<hi>Non enim idem est, ferre, si quid ferendum est, &amp; probare,
si quid probandum non est. Cic.</hi> fam. Ep. l. 9. ep. 6. Nor
is this all, but one of them would have <hi>all things taken
away for which the people rebelled,</hi> P. p. 65. judging it
more reasonable that the Sovereign should conform to
the Subject, then the Subject to the Sovereign. Which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95686:17"/>
produces that <hi>Libyan</hi> Serpent <hi>Pareas, Luc.</hi> Phars. 1. 10.
that leads with the Tail. That Authour quarrells with
the Age, for <hi>striving to root out people's ill Principles, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then Princes ill practices.</hi> God knows what the
people may call ill Practices: but we know a <hi>Roman</hi>
sued at Law, for not tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> a Dagger deep enough into
his Bowels, with which his adversary strived to stab
him. It may in time be laid to the Prince and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
charge, that they buried not the Murther of the
late King in honour and silence; as well as now 'tis, that
the <hi>Covenant</hi> was not so buried. I will pursue this no
farther, lest it whet the Sword of justice too keen
against this kind of Pleaders.</p>
            <p>Now pray hear them branch their desires (with some
confusion) into these ensuing Heads.</p>
            <p>1. They would <hi>have Tithes taken away,</hi> or <hi>at least
altered. Israel</hi> was chidden for robbing God of Tithes
and Offerings: if these be <hi>Israelites,</hi> let them apply
it to themselves. 'Tis strange that hypocriticall <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi>
should boast of paying them, and these strive against
them. Surely these mens Consciences grow in their
Purse or Field, that scruple at payments: and so the Poet
was right,

How likes <hi>Cornelius Burges</hi> these Presbyterians, that
strive to baffle his whole Divine right with one Act of
Parliament? 'Twas hard for a man to commit Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
before, according to <hi>Burges</hi>'s notion; but (if these
mens motions take place) it will be impossible for the
future: so wise are these Pleaders to prevent sin. <hi>Euseb.
l.</hi> 4. praep. and <hi>Dion. Halic. l.</hi> 1. tell us that the <hi>Pelasgi,</hi>
(the Offspring of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> well proves)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95686:17"/>
being under great Judgments, sent to inquire of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whether they would be pacified with the Tenths
of Men: The Oracles answered, they would. But
these men think to remove our Judgments by taking
away the Tenths of Goods from God. Where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
scruples payments, 'tis a sign 'tis tender of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
rather then Piety; and that People aim at saving
their Purses rather then their Souls. But this is the old
complaint: and Tithes are like the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi>
alwaies proscribed, yet alwaies there. Thus Dogs of
<hi>Scyrum</hi> alwaies bark against the Moon, yet it still abides.
Tithes, like the Church they sustain, <hi>semper concussae,
nunquam excussae.</hi> Yet let it be confessed, that Tithes
and Landlords Rents are the two great Grievances of
this Nation.</p>
            <p>2. To prosecute the <hi>Good old Cause,</hi> in Rank with
Tithes are <hi>servile Tenures, called Copy-holds.</hi> O rare
<hi>Saturnalia!</hi> Lords must cease to be Lords, that Tenants
may be Free-holders. Their ancient Rights must be
parted withall, not for Coyn, but Clamour. In other
cases Causes make Complaints, but here Complaints
make Causes. They hope to get Free-holds as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
do Rattles, by crying for them. Unjust men like
not to continue their Lands on the Conditions they came
by them. Time (that makes all things worse) must
make their Tenures better. I may say of this Cause as
<hi>Cicero</hi> did of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, 'tis <hi>causa sine causa.</hi> The business
is, <hi>Jack</hi> will be a Gentleman: as if a man could make
a silk Purse of a Sow's ear. 'Tis pity these Saints throw
not up their Estates, as their Ministers their Livings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being <hi>Christ</hi>'s free-men, 'tis against their Conscience
to hold their Lands on humane Constitutions, and servile

3. The third branch of the <hi>Good old Cause</hi> that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
requires is, <hi>the Register of Estates.</hi> A thing
often attempted, but never effected: the onely single
thing that looks like just, of all they plead for: in which
I wish them success. Yet wants it not its Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that may make it unpassable. <hi>Tacitus</hi> prefaces his
Annals with a Story, that the world was first oppressed
with Tyrants, at length with Laws. A Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in every County newly erected would increase
Lawyers and Fees good store: but whether Honesty
would be increased, time must shew. This way leaves
little room for Charity, and cuts the sinews of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
which is Credit. In a word, humane Affairs
are the Game; Dealers are Gamesters; and the design
of Registring is to let the adversary over-see one's hand,
which spoils the Play. I look on the design as hopeless,
because four hundred men will scarcely ever be found
so intire, but some will halt on that sore, and can
no more consent, then proclaim themselves bankrupt.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth thing pleaded for by them is, the <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all Pluralities,</hi> that is, silencing those Laws that stint
Chaplains to Kings, Dukes, Earls, Bishops, &amp;c. <hi>in shovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up</hi> (as they phrase it) <hi>Church-Livings.</hi> I confess,
I believe the Clergie get more envy then profit by it;
besides that it doth much narrow their Interest. Yet
let it be considered, that these Laws must be silenced,
to make a Non-conformist speak, P. p. 54. Laws are
such trifling things with them, that they are as easie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
as scribbled against. These men think it no
oppression to out men of a legal possession, without
their personal consent. But why do these things now
trouble? Can't they remember their own practice but a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95686:18"/>
while since? Were not all the taking Preachers about
<hi>London</hi> Pluralists, that could procure entertainment?
Did not Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> spread his branches from <hi>Laurence
Jury</hi> to <hi>Watton</hi> in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> till he went off on a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Bridge? How much was Mr. <hi>Case</hi> noted for heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church-Living together? Mr. <hi>R. V.</hi> held seldome
fewer then <hi>S. Olave's Southwark</hi> and <hi>S. Edmond's Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardstreet.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Jenkins, Black-Friers</hi> and <hi>Christ-church.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Mayhew, Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>White-Chappel.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> a modest man, held the <hi>Charter-house</hi> and
<hi>S. Bartholomew's</hi> behind the <hi>old Exchange.</hi> But see
the subtilty of these men; to avoid the imputation
of <hi>Pluralists,</hi> they called themselves <hi>Lecturers:</hi> as if
that employment were neither a Cure of Souls, nor a
catering for the Purse. 'Tis well their Conscience and
Credit both can be salved with a new word. But
<q>Turpe est Doctori cum culpa, &amp;c.</q>
The <hi>English</hi> Church brought not in Pluralities: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reformation no Pluralities were admitted
<hi>nisi dispensatione Apostolicâ,</hi> v. <hi>Lyndwood;</hi> and since,
none were induced but by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And what forbids the Legislative Power (to wit, King,
Lords and Commons) to allow the King, Dukes, Earls
Chaplains, &amp;c. more then one Living, for the better
managing that part they are to act about their Master's
affairs, and for the state of the Kingdome; especially
where the Lay-Gentry are so plentifully instated in
Church-Livings, for the upholding their Greatness? Is
a man onely therefore uncapable of more Church-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
because a Clergy-man? But else the Non-conformers
cannot find Livings. Are they sure, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Occupiers being disseised, that the Patrons will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95686:19"/>
pin them on their backs? Are not the Universities full
of deserving men? and must they be put by till God
knows when? or must they turn Non-conformers to
get a Living? 'Tis pity such vast numbers of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants
(who may doe well) should be slighted for
those that have done ill.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth thing desired is, <hi>that all may be allowed to
preach and officiate that are in any Orders.</hi> Here is a
door opened to the Enthusiast, whom the Spirit orders;
to the Quaker, whom <hi>George Fox</hi> orders; to the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
whom the people order <hi>durante placito;</hi> to
the Presbyterian, whom <hi>Aerius</hi> orders, &amp;c. Here
<hi>Nadir</hi> and <hi>Zenith</hi> are made to shake hands: the two
terms of Contradiction are here reconciled, to wit, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas
à Christo descendendo, and à plebe ascendendo. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
must have a publick Ministry with private Orders,
or onely fansied ones. Then must the Church prove a
Poly-cephalist, more dreadfull then the <hi>Stygian Cerberus.</hi>
'Twas judged malice in <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, to re-ordain
those that <hi>Formosus</hi> had advanced to holy Orders; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was <hi>Episcopus Portuensis,</hi> and onely deprived of
his Bishoprick by <hi>John</hi> the ninth, not of his Episcopal
Function. But the Church in her great Synod judged
the Presbyters of <hi>Colythus</hi> making, in the Church of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> to be no Presbyters, and the Ordination
a nullitie, (as is instanced in the case of <hi>Ischiras</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was no Bishop, though he pretended himself to
be one, as also do these Non-conformers. So likewise
for the same cause were those Presbyters ordained by
<hi>Maximus</hi> pronounced no Presbyters, by all the Fathers
in the Council of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And 'twere high
temerity to establish that for good by a Law that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95686:19"/>
hath been so often condemned by Law.</p>
            <p>But here is <hi>nihil ad rhombum</hi> still, for what peace can
be expected from contrary Orders? Is it not listing the
Clergy in several battalia's one against another? And
what satisfaction will that give to the Scruple-house,
where five Parties are still forced to scruple at one? Do
not the whole Episcopal Church account Ordination by
Presbyters, or people, or vain pretensions to the
Spirit, or by a Se-ordainer, utterly uncanonicall? And
can their Conscience chuse but take offence at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of it? Or are they thought so tame, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended they will make no noise about it? 'Tis
pity they should fare the worse for their peaceableness.
Again, Is the Presbyterian satisfied in Conscience to
hear a Gifted Brother officiate that pretends to a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian
Ordination? Do not both send a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>
after a wandring Star, that says he was lighted by the
Holy ghost? Nor will this please the wild Sectarie, who
esteems Episcopal and Presbyterian Ordination (in <hi>John
Simpson</hi>'s language) the greasie Palm of Antichrist, and
fansies a Priest in Orders the <hi>English</hi> Edition of the
Pope. Yet <hi>Luther</hi> in Com. in Galat. tells us, men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Ordination, <hi>quanquam quaedam salutaria afferunt,
nihil tamen aedificant:</hi> for <hi>laborem eorum nunquam for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat
Deus.</hi> And S. <hi>Cyp.</hi> unit. Eccles. tells us, that by
the Sacraments of unordained men, <hi>non tam purgantur
quàm fordidantur,</hi> i. e. the water of Baptizing fouls, and
the Bloud of the Supper stains. I dread to think what
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Church our Mother will shed, when more
then a <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> shall be permitted to struggle in
her womb.</p>
            <p>D. P. p. 36. hath found an expedient here; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95686:20"/>
that the <hi>Bishops should impose hands on the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
already ordained, to commend them,</hi> non ad mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterium,
sed ad exercitium ministerii, <hi>in any Parish to
which they shall have a Title.</hi> I conceive the missive
words in Ordination may be so formed, as to admit to
Orders in the Episcopal sense, and yet onely to emit
in this Authour's sense: but then, first, This provides but
for a few Ministers, and so is scarce worth the trouble.
Secondly, 'Tis very probable, though the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
agree in this, they will quarrell in something else.
Let me therefore remember them, that <hi>Theodore</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being sent by <hi>Vitalian</hi> to <hi>King
Egbert,</hi> about the year 668, and finding <hi>Ceadda</hi> not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Ordained; the good man, understanding the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
said, <hi>Si me nôsti Episcopatum non ritè suscepisse, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benter
ab officio recedo:</hi> upon which Submission, <hi>bene
tandem consecratus, in sedem Dorovernensem provehitur.
Bed.</hi> Hist. Eccl. l. 4. c. 2. An excellent example of
true Christian meekness.</p>
            <p>6. Their sixth Plea is <hi>for Liberty of Conscience:</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
branch of the <hi>Good old Cause,</hi> and intended to open
the door of legal Restraint to those Legions of Devils
that inhabit the fanatick Soul. To effect which, all
these Authours strive <hi>eminus cominus,</hi> trying every key
in the bunch of their subtilties. Not all of them so
ingeniously as <hi>Bellius, Clebergius,</hi> or Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi> have done
before them; yet no less earnestly: for <hi>aequa tentant &amp;
iniqua,</hi> they try by hook or by crook to break the door
open. And why not? <hi>tentantes ad Trojam tandem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venere
Graeci.</hi> He that never speaks, never speeds.
They therefore bring a whole troup of Arguments to
make room for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95686:20"/>
If you would know what this Liberty of Conscience
is, L. C. A. (who most discreetly handles it) tells you, 'tis
<hi>A freedom to doe or omit as Conscience shall direct,</hi> p. 11.
so that his Question to be debated is, <hi>How far men may
be obliged to doe what they say is against their Conscience;</hi>
and, <hi>How far men may be suffered to doe what they say
their Conscience obligeth them to doe,</hi> id. ib. Now the
granting this freedom by the Magistrate is called <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
which D. R. p. 8. defines to be <hi>A permission of
different waies of Religion without the line of the approved
way.</hi> So that in this latitude Liberty of Conscience
looks like <hi>Hobbs</hi> his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> a masterless Monster.
This one Law would make the world lawless, and doe
what is right in their own sight, not in God's nor the
Magistrate's: therefore its Advocates shackle and
trammel this wild beast, some more, some less. First, To
save the King's life, L. C. A. p. 14. conceives <hi>the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
not bound to tolerate any thing destructive to his
being.</hi> But that if the Magistrate shall believe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
it self will destroy him? The Authour of the
Proposition plainly affirms, that <hi>Liberty of Conscience mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
the late King;</hi> and the Abettors of it were the
greatest Enemies to this Prince's Return and settlement.
And 'tis to be feared, it hath not yet evaporated its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
qualities. Secondly, Nor <hi>must the Magistrate
tolerate moral Evils,</hi> L. C. A. p. 50. Thirdly, Nor <hi>any thing
against common Light, common Interest, and natural good of
mankind,</hi> L. C. A. p. 49. We thank him for nothing:
without these Concessions the Magistrate, like <hi>Serapis</hi>
the <hi>AEgytian</hi> God, might stand and hold his finger in
his mouth, and all Government were dissolved. But
fourthly, D. R. p. 9. is more liberal, and acknowledges
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95686:21"/>
               <hi>the Magistrate not bound to tolerate dissensions,</hi> nor any
thing <hi>against the general Rules of Scripture in ordering the
Church,</hi> p. 27. But fifthly, D. P. p. 85. exceeds all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and acknowledges <hi>the Magistrate may punish with
lighter penalties any practice he esteems erroneous in Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus set down these mens Concessions, which
are onely to leave some work for the Magistrate, that
he may not, like <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s God, sleep <hi>in intermundiis;</hi> let
me observe to you, that these men jeast with us when
they plead for Liberty of Conscience; a thing so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from the rational creature, that no Padlock
can confine it. Conscience is so far out of gun-shot, that
the most murthering Cannon cannot reach it. Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is subject to no Exile nor Imprisonment, nor can
a Rape be committed upon it. The birds in the air or
fishes in the sea are not more free. So that the matter of
our inquiry is Liberty of <hi>Action,</hi> rather then Liberty of
<hi>Conscience.</hi> And so the Question will be, whether the
Magistrate be bound to let men <hi>doe</hi> in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what they say their Consciences oblige them to; or
to let them forbear what they say their Consciences
bind them to forbear. In answer to which we say,
The Magistrate may not permit men to walk by the
light of their private Consciences in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>First, Because the Magistrate ought to be <hi>a terrour</hi>
(not a tolerator) <hi>of evil-doers,</hi> Rom. 13. but a man may
pretend himself bound in Conscience to doe evil; as
the <hi>Jew</hi> most conscienciously blasphemes the name of
<hi>Christ.</hi> To this L. C. A. p. 15. answers, <hi>the Magistrate
is onely authorized to punish moral evils.</hi> The vanity
of which will appear, First, by that Logical Rule, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio
indefinita in materia necessaria aequipollet univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sali.</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95686:21"/>
Now all evils deserve a punishment, as well spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
as moral: and many times spiritual evils are the
greater; therefore he is to be a terrour to them as well
as to moral evils. Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> justifies this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. telling us the Law was made to punish
not onely what is contrary to sound Reason, but to
sound Doctrine too. Thirdly, The <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrate,
though a Heathen, had right to judge all Causes, as
well spiritual as civil; as appears by S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s appeal
to him concerning the Resurrection of the dead, about
which he was called in question, and referred the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If a man may follow the dictates of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
without controul, he may kill Saints for God's
cause, <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. and believe himself bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
so to doe: which haply was the case of <hi>Vennor</hi>
and his Complices. And 'twas once S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, who says,
He verily thought (to wit, in his Conscience) that he
ought to doe many things contrary to the way of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and did persecute from City to City. But no Magistrate
can discharge his Conscience by permitting men to kill
their Neighbours for God's cause, and questions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
'Twas <hi>Gallio</hi>'s scandal, that he drave men from the
Judgment-seat, and would not meddle in such matters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Every man is indispensably oblig'd to promote
the glory of God, and the Salvation of men, with such
talents as he hath received: But the Magistrates talent
is the civil Sword: Therefore with it is he to propagate
God's Worship, and stop mens sins. Advice and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
belong to every Christian; Reproof and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to Church-officers; but Correction of sin by the
civil Sword is the Magistrate's propriety. L. C. A. p. 24.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95686:22"/>
acknowledges this Argument in the main, but thinks <hi>he
may serve God as a Magistrate by other powers then by the
Sword,</hi> yet confesses <hi>no instance can fully reach the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his notion,</hi> p. 27. And no wonder, since it must
deny the Proposition or Assumption of this Syllogism,
both yet which are most evident Truths.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Magistrate's power</hi> is confessed by
L. C. A. p. 12. to be <hi>paternall:</hi> But a Father is bound
to use the Rod to keep his child from damnation: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the Father of the Countrey bound to use the
Sword to keep his Subjects from damnation. Magistrates
govern not men as brute beasts, but as indued with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls; and therefore must use their power not
onely for the safety of mens bodies, but the Salvation of
their Souls.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Magistrate is God's Shepherd as well as
the Minister: But Shepherds must destroy the Wolves
that strive to break in to the Flock to devour it, in their
proper sphere; the Minister by Church-Censures, the
Magistrate by temporal punishment.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, To multiply no more Arguments, the last
shall be <hi>ad hominem:</hi> If these men believe 'tis the will
of God, that every man should enjoy the practice of his
Conscience, why do they resist the will of God by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
this to the Papist?</hi> Yet this they doe, M. I. p. 14.
D. R. p. 43, &amp;c. Hath God, upon this general Charter
for Liberty, expresly excepted against the Papists? or
rather do not these Pleaders privately confess they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not their own Arguments, which haply prove
stronger for the Papists then themselves, as may be seen
anon? Indeed M. I. p. 14. says three things for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
Papists from this Privilege. First, <hi>Their giving
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95686:22"/>
no assurance of Fidelity.</hi> But surely they have been more
faithfull then these Sects in the late Rebellion: and the
Quakers and Anabaptists refuse to swear Fidelity as well
as they, &amp;c. Secondly, <hi>By their Principles they can never be
good Subjects.</hi> 'Twere well if these mens Principles were
better. If we are urged to it, we shall make it appear,
that both halt on the same lame side. Thirdly, <hi>They
themselves allow no Toleration.</hi> D. P. p. 102. shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it: <hi>O thou Argument! thou art a vile naughty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Do not these men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
themselves guilty in the like kind, that allowed
no Toleration of Prelacie? I am weary of these fooleries.</p>
            <p>Can a man truly love God, and yet sit patiently to
hear his Name dishonoured, when he hath power to
suppress it? Shall a Magistrate punish the injuries done
to himself with all legal severities, yet be so cool
in God's Cause as not to unsheath his Sword? Surely
men never were permitted to doe what was right in
their own sight, but in times of Confusion, when <hi>there
was no King in Israel.</hi> But when <hi>Asa</hi> had obtained the
Crown, a Vote was made, That whosoever would not
seek the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> should be put to death,
whether small or great, whether man or woman; as you
reade 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13. And why should the <hi>Jew</hi> be
more zealous for the honour of his God then is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
<hi>Moses,</hi> that saw the Looseness contracted by <hi>Israel</hi>'s
bewildred estate, tells them plainly, You shall not doe as
you doe this day, every man what's right in his own eyes,
or seems good in his own Conscience. Is Conscience such
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uary to damnable Doctrines, that being got in
there, the Holiness of the place must defend them? Can
it be imagined that Head and Hand-sins must receive
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95686:23"/>
their punishment, and onely Conscience-sins pass under
Protection? S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Rom. 13. 4. If thou dost evil,
be afraid of the powers:</hi> but these men say, (If the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Blasphemies be committed against God) be not
afraid, for the Magistrate hath no power to punish thee.
Be not afraid to bring in <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> for the
Powers are bound to tolerate thee. Break what Laws
thou wilt, and pretend 'tis thy Conscience obliges thee
to it, and 'tis a safe Plea, that can't be over-ruled.</p>
            <p>But well fare <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, that engraved on his
Sword <hi>Custos utriusque Tabulae;</hi> judging himself obliged
to see the Laws of God executed as well as the Laws of
the Land; and to take care that <hi>Christ</hi> have his due, as
well as <hi>caesar</hi> his.</p>
            <p>If you object, That then the Magistrate (if his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
should hap to be erroneous) might persecute Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
I answer, first, So may he in civil Causes punish an
innocent man, if his judgment errs; but that doth not
annihilate his authority. Secondly, And we may as
reasonably suspect an Angel will erre as the Magistrate,
since the Apostle's charge is to believe Angels no more
then men, in teaching another Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. And
thirdly, If any be possessed with the spirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
'tis the Magistrate, since the Scripture speaks
more favourably of him then of the <hi>Jesuites</hi> Pope, or
the Quakers Spiritual man: for <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov. 16. 10.
A divine sentence is in the lips of a King; his mouth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth
not in judgment.</hi> He may be ignorant in some
truths in Divinity, but not in the weighty things of the
Law. And if his commands proceed about circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
and lesser things, be they according to or dissonant
from the truth, the believer is obliged to be silent, upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95686:23"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, who saith, <hi>Rom. 14. 22. Hast thou faith?
have it to thy self before God.</hi> He must not flash his light
in his brother's eyes, and much less may he set a Church
or Kingdom on fire with the scattering of it about. And
thus much D. P. p. 101. acknowledges, <hi>The tolerated
must not broach principles to the scandal of others:</hi> much
less then to the scandal of a Church. And farther, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
In some cases we are obliged to force our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
rather then resist Authority; that by once passing
that River of which it was so fearfull, it may at length
goe more boldly forward when commanded, without
many blows to make it enter. <hi>Christ</hi>'s sheep may be
forced into green pastures, where else they will stand
boggling at the gate. 'Tis the Doctrine of a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
in these mens account, I mean <hi>Ames. l.</hi> 1. de
Consc. in recollectionibus ad calcem libri additis, Sect. 27.
<hi>Licitum &amp; consultum est, aliquando, agere contra scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
aliquem Conscientiae.</hi> And then, methinks, where
Authority appears, 'tis a considerable circumstance to
enforce: especially considering that of <hi>Plin.</hi> to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,
<hi>A Te exigetur ratio; nos excusabit obsequium.</hi> And
<hi>Cassiodore</hi> speaks but the mind of the civil Law, when he
tells you, <hi>Nimis iniquum est ut ipse patiatur dispendium
qui imperium fecit alienum.</hi> But then, fifthly, If Liberty
must be granted, <hi>then inclusivè,</hi> as P. p. 62. grants, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
must have their Liberty of Conscience as well as
Subjects. And then if their Consciences tie them to
punish Errours, what room is left for others Liberty?
Princes (if consciencious) are or may be as really ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to the making and executing, as others to the
transgression of the Laws: and then whose Conscience
shall take place? The Scripture enjoyns the Prince to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95686:24"/>
punish Disobedience, as well as it forbids the Subject to
obey: so that either the Consciences of Governours, or
governed, must be oppressed. Sixthly, What should Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
doe with Liberty of Conscience, that preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a poor, afflicted, despised Flock, and make Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the note of a Child of God, if not a note of the
Church? To grant them liberty were to divert their
Afflictions, and so unchurch them, yea to stop up their
way to Heaven, which (by false application of Scripture
to all persons and times) they hold must be <hi>through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tribulations.</hi> Now to justifie their Doctrine they
will find something else to quarrell with Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
if you grant them Liberty; and so <hi>pro thesauro
carbones,</hi> by long fishing you get a frog. Seventhly,
The common Principles of the Sectaries can endure no
Accommodation: for they hold God's Flock <hi>a little
Flock,</hi> whom the Powers of this world must oppress,
and they must have a World to rail at; and should you
conform to them in every thing, there needs no other
argument for their deserting their own way: as one of
these Authours well observes, in the instance of wearing
<hi>short hair,</hi> which the Non-conformers Consciences much
urged them to, till they saw Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> to commend it
to all the Clergy; then they changed, their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
tackt about, and wore all <hi>long hair.</hi> The Sectaries
are men of narrow spirits, and love a little way. They
think multitudes can't go together, but to doe evil;
and fansy huggling together, like a Covy of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges
in a field, to be the onely Christian way. Like
<hi>John</hi> the Baptist, they love to be in a desert; or, like a
Hare, to sit trembling alone in a bush: and can't be
brought, like Doves or Sheep, to feed in great Flocks.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95686:24"/>
Besides, they have an irascible appetite in them, which
is naturally trained up, like a true Bull-dog, to bait Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
so that <hi>Oliver,</hi> their great God-a-mighty, could
not save his <hi>Nose</hi> from their reproaches. In a word,
<hi>Tacitus</hi> observes that, <hi>evulgato Imperii Secreto, alibi Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraetorem
fieri posse quàm Romae;</hi> it taught every Legion
to proclaim an Emperour for the future. 'Tis well if
Obstinacy and Scrupling, prevailing to overthrow one
Law, do not at length strive to overturn all, and
translate the whole Government to themselves. I am of
<hi>Nich. Scomberg</hi>'s mind, (though in a far better cause)
That he that sees he can force any thing, will at length
believe he can force all; and so is, by Concession of one,
but invited to contend for another. Now they try
your patience, the next time they will try their own
courage.</p>
            <p>But stay, let us hear their Reasons for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
The First is that in the Proposition, p. 3, 5, 6.
<hi>That God hath witnessed his displeasure against the sharp
dealings of Authority by manifold Judgments:</hi> he instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>burning Ships, burning London,</hi> &amp;c. But, first, Is he
sure that this Government is worse then all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
because <hi>England</hi> suffered such great things?
<hi>Christ</hi> says, <hi>I tell you nay:</hi> but they say, Yea, or nothing,
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. 1, 2. Secondly, <hi>Solomon</hi> thinks a man cannot
<hi>know good or evil by what happens under the Sun:</hi> but
these know the Government evil by these Accidents.
Thirdly, Did that Authour's <hi>familiar</hi> that he speaks of
p. 86. give him <hi>a dark notice</hi> of the Interpretation of these
Providences? Fourthly, Do not these men turn Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus's,
and <hi>servire scenae?</hi> having formerly told us Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were a note of God's people, are they now a note
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95686:25"/>
of the Devil's? Well, let them hear the Poet's curse,
<hi>Careat successibus opto,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis a brave thought of <hi>Lucan,</hi>
               <q>Victrix causa diis placuit, sed victa Catoni.</q>
Sure a man may justifie God, without condemning poor
<hi>Abel</hi> for his misery. <hi>Job</hi>'s Piety should not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
because of his Misery. Let him reade <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 10.
and he must acknowledge it a foolish Argument.</p>
            <p>2. The second Reason common to them all is, that
<hi>Toleration must be granted to unite us, and make us strong
in War.</hi> For answer, first, A combined Interest recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles
all men of Estates so far as to prosecute a just War,
in defence of life and estate, and to secure themselves
from forein Oppression. Secondly, Crouching to
Male-contents at home disspirits Authority, and hinders
forein Conquests. Thirdly, Advancing dissenting
Sectaries is a civil War, where Ring-leaders are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
Preachers Captains, Congregations Camps, and
words at length proceed to blows. Fourthly, Toleration
would increase both Papists and Fanaticks; and being
let loose, and both increasing, who can assure us they
will not fall on both King and Parliament, sooner then
on any forein adversary, especially while they smell
so strong of <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Principles, to destroy Authority,
to make way for the <hi>Fifth Monarchy?</hi> Fifthly, All sober
Protestants are reconciled already in the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
if other mens Consciences keep them from Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
what will keep them from Disobedience but
Laws duly executed? Sixthly, 'Tis insolent for Subjects
to stand on terms of Accommodations with Sovereigns,
especially the meanest of Subjects with the best of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
No language so well becomes their mouths as
Submission.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95686:25"/>
3. The third Reason is, <hi>There is no hurt in Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers,</hi>
P. p. 10. <hi>Non-conformers are serious and painfull
men,</hi> D. P. p. 87. <hi>They are like</hi> Christ, P. p. 69, 70. <hi>Yea</hi>
Christ<hi>'s brethren,</hi> P. p. 71. Therefore grant them Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For answer, first, I hold my self excused from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
with this Argument, because these mens too late
crimes have proclaimed a confutation to the world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Nor am I willing to rake into so stinking a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
being much more delighted in Charientisms then
Sarcasms. Onely I take leave to vindicate my Saviour
from these foul aspersions. Let these Authours shew
me where or when <hi>Christ</hi> murthered his (even tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call)
Superiours. Against what Authority did he take
arms? where did he teach Christians to turn from Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and tears to Sword and buckler? when did he
preach Subjects into the field against Sovereigns,
upon pain of Damnation, <hi>cursing Meroz</hi> for being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to set out, &amp;c. as most of these Ministers here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
to <hi>Christ</hi> did? What incouragement did <hi>Christ</hi>
ever give to Factions amongst those that professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity?
My just zeal demands a blush from that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
for belying our Saviour, and saying he was like
these Sectaries. Besides, Conventicling against Law is
a sin of it self, if they sinned not in their Conventicles.
For 'tis a transgression of the Law of God mediately,
of man immediately. The Civil Conscience is obliged
by the Civil Law, as well as the Spiritual by the Divine
Law. Nor is this a fansying two Consciences, but one
distinguished by its several Objects about which 'tis
exercised; for the Conscience is <hi>mixta persona</hi> as well
as the King, and must be judge in all causes.</p>
            <p>If you object, that if Conscience be so bound to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95686:26"/>
Laws, they must be just: I answer, first, Untill they
are clearly proved otherwise, <hi>praesumptio est pro autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
imponentis.</hi> Secondly, They that see them unjust,
presume themselves to have more wit then the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Nation that made them, which cannot be said
without pride. D. P. p. 85. says well, <hi>An Act passed
on a thing doubted unlawfull, makes it not presently law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi>
yet sure, the judgment of so many grave men may
be a glorious Taper to illuminate, and a strong Cable
to bind the scrupling Conscience. Thirdly, The Laws
are most probably just when the generality of good men
practise them; who have Inspection to discern, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to scruple, Courage to oppose, if they see cause,
and Curiosity enough to examine them. The Scruplers
therefore must esteem their Notions either Inspirations
from God, or Demonstrations <hi>quibus non potest subesse
falsum;</hi> or else must judge themselves infallible: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
'tis notorious Insolence, to prefer their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Law before the Law it self, and the common
judgment of man; especially since <hi>Res judicata pro ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
accipitur</hi> is a necessary Rule in all Laws; and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to erre with Authority is to erre on the safer side.
Fourthly, Admit the Law were unjust, yet it binds:
for it binds not as just, but as a Law; it binds to suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
if not to doing. Oaths may be Perjuries, yet
the Judge passes sentence upon them without scruple:
so that the Magistrate's Conscience is secured in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the Laws upon Offenders, resigning his
judgment of the justice of those Laws to the Legislative
power. Fifthly, Nor are Laws in a politick considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such trifling things as these men fansie. <hi>Petilius</hi>
found a Book in <hi>Numa</hi>'s grave expounding the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95686:26"/>
Superstitions; but because by the Praetor's Oath they
were found contrary to the present Establishment, the
Senate adjudged the Book to the flames: so carefull
were they to uphold the reverence of their Laws.
<hi>Demosth.</hi> orat. in Aristog. tells us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp;c. and therefore
not lightly to be contemned. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> tells the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<hi>Balsac,</hi> though something in Laws be unjust, 'tis
just to obey them; for some States have thriven in
obeying unjust Laws, others in not obeying just have
perished. I wish these men of <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Emperour's
modesty, who reasonably resolves, <hi>AEquius est me tot &amp;
talium amicorum consilium, quàm tot, tales, meam unius
voluntatem sequi.</hi> But how then shall these men answer
S. <hi>Jude</hi>'s description of Separatists, v. 8. that they are
<hi>despisers of Dominion, and speak evil of Dignities?</hi> 'Twas
once said, <hi>Turpis est pars quae cum toto non convenit:</hi> but
now 'tis the highest pitch of Piety to oppose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>But secondly, Is there no hurt in Conventicling?
Are they not the <hi>Trojan</hi> horses whence armed men issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth to sack great <hi>Priam</hi>'s Territories? Are they
not like the <hi>Jesuites</hi> Order, the very nurseries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?
Are they not the seed-plot of damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?
Do they not slay the Souls of men with the
Sword of the Spirit? Is not <hi>verbum Domini</hi> amongst
them (as Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> observed) but <hi>verbum diaboli?</hi> Do
they not poison the streams of the Sanctuary? Yea
doth not their very Advocate confess, P. p. 57. that <hi>in
them they speak against the Government, and revile the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the people?</hi> But this with him may deserve a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95686:27"/>
And thirdly, Doth not their best Champion L. C. A.
p. 48. judge that <hi>they ought to be compelled to Church to
hear Sermons?</hi> So that, by their own confession, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may be bold to execute his Laws to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Yea and doth not D. P. p. 20. declare, <hi>they may
lawfully be punished for disturbing the Ecclesiasticall order,
to the disquieting of the State?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Their fourth Reason is, <hi>They must have a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
because many thousaends,</hi> P. p. 75. <hi>great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
M. I. p. 9. <hi>the Non-conformers out-balance Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
D. R. p. 28. and D. P. p. 57. I doubt these men
are drunk with their opinion, and see double or treble.
They swagger as if the Town were their own. May
they not be troubled with the <hi>Athenian Thrasylaus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that all they see is their own? But, first, Themselves,
in their harangues amongst their feminine troups, call
themselves a despised little Flock. Secondly, The late
Army alwaies held the spirit of this Nation (to use their
Cant) an <hi>imposing</hi> spirit: and therefore one Major <hi>Creed</hi>
resolved, in one of their Junto's, to draw his Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a free Parliament, as the common enemy to that
Army-darling, Liberty of Conscience. Thirdly, The
most part of them are the Riffe-raffe of the Nation:
yet I say upon my conscience, that I believe not above
a seventh part of the people are inclined to Liberty of
Conscience. Fourthly, If their Patron may be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Case, L. C. A. p. 21. says, <hi>The greatest part
of men desire a visible Judge, to save them the pains of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Enquiries.</hi> Fifthly, They have often tried, and never
could chuse a Parliament for that purpose; which is a
convincing evidence that they are not the major Vote.
Sixthly, They carry great animosities against each other.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95686:27"/>
Seventhly, The argument is a poling argument, where
<hi>Sententiae numerantur, non ponderantur,</hi> says <hi>Plin.</hi> l. 2. ep. 12.
Eighthly, Is it prudent to forbear the Cure, because the
Leprosie is spread all over the body? A great Politician
indeed advises, <hi>Vir sapiens nunquam direxit brachia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Torrentem:</hi> but sure that advice is more Christian,
<hi>Tu nè cede malis,</hi> &amp;c. Faction is a fire kindled in City
and Country, and P. p. 37. tells us <hi>the way to quench it
is to let it alone:</hi> thus also counsells M. I. p. 5. and
D. P. p. 6. Well; the Rump did so: did that quench,
or rather increase it much more? that is a convincing
Experiment. Errour is a Gangraene, and will spread, if
permitted. When these flouds break out, they must be
banked up. Ninthly, Neutrality loses both parts: as
<hi>Hen.</hi> 4. of <hi>France</hi> found to his sorrow. He that hath
no Enemy, hath no Friend. How should any think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
obliged for that favour that is given to all? Bats are
most despised, because a middle between birds and
beasts. Tenthly, Be the Sectaries never so many, yet if
Christians, they must not disturb the Government. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.</hi>
found Christians to fill the Armies, Markets, Senate,
Courts and all; yet they never opposed the then-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
Emperours. To conclude, I ever took King
in Parliament to be the Strength as well as most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Interest of the Nation. So that to affrighten them
with numbers is a Bug-bear, a threat to the Government,
and deserves correction.</p>
            <p>5. You must tolerate men, for force will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon Christians. P. p. 13. <hi>Restraint makes Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams:</hi>
p. 30. <hi>A mere Command makes Disobedience:</hi> p. 25.
<hi>Violence unites them:</hi> p. 38. <hi>Indulgence onely makes them
throw off Errours:</hi> p. 53. <hi>Conscience can't be touched:</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:95686:28"/>
L. C. A. p. 10. <hi>Force doth no good:</hi> p. 29. <hi>Sword can't
hinder Opinions:</hi> M. I. p. 18, 20. <hi>Force is an odious Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency
over Consciences.</hi> For answer, first, God
appointed the Sword to be <hi>a terrour to evil-doers,
Rom.</hi> 13. 3. and I do not think these Authours can prove
his Institutions frivolous or useless. If the Sword can
doe nothing, S. <hi>Paul</hi> is mistaken, who thought it would
terrifie wicked men. I hope, notwithstanding their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
they will avoid sin for fear of Hell. Secondly,
That setting a Law forces Disobedience, is an Objection
that flies in the face of God, as well as of the Parliament;
for God hath set a royal Law to mankind, which he
would never have done, if the mere setting a Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Disobedience. Thirdly, Say that it did, yet <hi>the Law</hi>
may be <hi>holy, just and good,</hi> Rom. 7. 12. the Chain may
be Gold though the Dog break his teeth on it. Fourthly,
If they believe Indulgence will destroy the Sectaries,
why do they deny Liberty to the Papists? Do they desire
to make the Papists more obstinate by Persecution? or
will they use those weapons against them that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
can't work upon Conscience? will they unite them
closer by acts of violence? or are they so unmercifull,
as to deny the Papists the gentle means of recovery from
their Errours? or will Restraint onely cure Papists,
and Liberty Sectaries? If Liberty would diminish num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
why must not the Papists be this way diminished? At
this Peep-hole one may see these men plead what they
do not believe. Fifthly, If force will doe nothing, how
comes one of them to say, <hi>the King of</hi> Japan <hi>rooted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
out of his Country by violence.</hi> Sixthly, But 'tis too
certain that force upon Conscience will doe much. The
ingenious Authour of the Inconveniences of Toleration
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95686:28"/>
gives two sad instances of it in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Jenkins.</hi> But to
avoid envy, we will instance in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who abjured
his Lord through fear of a Crucifixion. And if force
was so prevalent on so great a Saint, what may it be on
this giddy Rout, whose tongue is their hardiest part?
Seventhly, To feed the humour with Liberty can never
be the way to cure it. Eighthly, The Heathen obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> being fined five Talents, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
for asserting the Sun to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a globe
of fire, none ever affirmed it after. <hi>Tully</hi> observes, in
his Nat. deor. l. 1. that when the Philosophers saw <hi>Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
punished for saying, <hi>De Diis neque ut sint, neque ut
non sint, habeo dicere,</hi> they were all for the future <hi>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diores
ad sententiam suam profitendam, quippe cum poenam
nec dubitatio effugere potuisset.</hi> And who knows not but
the death of <hi>Socrates</hi> laid the foundation of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks</hi>
and <hi>Scepticks?</hi> So that none dar'd positively
to assert the unity of the Godhead for a long time
after. <hi>Christ</hi> says, in tribulation many will fall from the
Truth; and (think we) will none fall from their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours?
Should the Powers take that wicked example of
the <hi>Rump,</hi> and set up Committees and Sequestrations,
we should soon find our richest Zelots shrink. Ninthly,
<hi>Beza</hi> openly protests <hi>coram Deo &amp; ipsius Angelis, quas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
corruptelas passim in Ecclesia Dei maximo cum luctu
ferre cogimur, eas omnes ab hac tanquam scaturigine exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
quòd Principes,</hi> &amp;c. in his Haeret. mort. puniendis,
pag. (mihi) 160. He found all the Schisms and Heresies
of the Church to spring from the negligence of Princes, in
not taking care to punish them. And doth not <hi>England</hi>
see them to be the product of licencious times, when there
was no Rod of Discipline in the Magistrate's hand?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95686:29"/>
Tenthly, 'Tis true, the Sword cannot force the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
proximately, but it may remotely. It cuts the
body, and thereby frights the Soul. It works on the
outward man by Passion, but on the inward by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
It cannot keep men from believing, but it
may from publishing Errours. It can confine the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
from communication, though it cannot drive out
the Contagion. L. C. A. p. 29. says, <hi>we must not punish
men for want of the Holy Ghost, and supernatural Gifts:</hi>
True, but we may for striving to poison their own Souls,
by coveting the Rats-bane of Heresies; or for distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their poison into other mens breasts. But of this
more anon.</p>
            <p>6. Their next Argument is, The <hi>English</hi> Religion
hath been under an ill name. <hi>Serious men have ranked
it with Popery,</hi> P. p. 31. <hi>Non-conformers believe it, because
you persecute,</hi> &amp;c. p. 34. To this I say, I esteem it not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
an answer, being rather Railing then Reasoning;
and may be used against any way of Worship whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Was Christianity the worse, because <hi>Julian</hi> the
Apostate called it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? or <hi>Christ</hi> the worse, because
ranked with Publicans and sinners? or did not the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
that reproached him look as grave as these serious
men? What if <hi>Pilate</hi>'s malice will rank <hi>Christ</hi> with two
Thieves on the Cross? was he not therefore a child
of God? What if <hi>Cyprian</hi> be called <hi>Koprianus?</hi> They
that reckoned Popery and Prelacy all one, reckoned
also their Prince a Papist: God grant they doe so no
more. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Cratylo</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
He that
gives a name ought first fully to understand the thing:
but most of them that ranked Popery and Prelacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95686:29"/>
neither knew one nor the other. May not the
Papists as well judge them and us both, that we hate
the power of godliness in them, because we persecute
them, as these do us? Yea and may not the Quaker ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from the same Topick? Yet 'tis Idolatry we dislike
in the Papist, Atheism in the Quaker, and Obstinacy in
both. Were these men true Gold, yet may they be
cast into the fire, to purge out remaining Dross. I know
not what Protection God hath given to Errour, Schism,
Pride, Self-conceit, Rebellion, &amp;c. in the breast of
an Hypocrite, yea or real Saint, more then in any other.
If the Magistrate must be a terrour to evil-doers, then
sure to spiritual evils, because the greatest of all evils.
Nor are any the less to be punished, because they call
themselves the <hi>Godly Party;</hi> since Authority proceeds
on matters of fact and palpable evidence. I leave this
Objection as trifling, and proceed to their</p>
            <p>7. Which is, That Liberty of Conscience raises
Courage in Souldiers, P. p. 45. <hi>It breeds generous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
M. I. p. 8. <hi>The Sectaries Obstinacy is</hi> England<hi>'s best
Courage: It wrought all our Changes,</hi> Prop. p. 46. <hi>It
makes men for ever irreconcilable to all Impositions,</hi>
M. I. p. 13. To which I reply, First, It appears by the
Omnipotency ascribed to Liberty of Conscience, that it
is the Sectaries God, whom they adore not for his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
but for his Power. It is the best overturning Tool
in nature; and therefore its Advocates ought to be
carefully looked to, and timely suppressed. Thirdly,
An Argument drawn from Strength against a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is no better then a Threat. I hope <hi>tonant sine ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
their Threats are but Crackers. Fourthly, To
grant all that is true in this Argument, it amounts to no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95686:30"/>
more, then that the Devil is strongest when he fights
from that Fort called <hi>Conscience.</hi> Men thus possest
with a spiritual frenzie are alwaies stronger and more
mischievous then at other times. But must we make a
League with the Devil, to be of the stronger side?
Fifthly, I confess this Liberty is a terrible thing; for no
man knows what to call his own, while this Freedom is
in use. So true is that Maxime, <hi>Cui plus licet quàm
par est, vult plus quàm licet.</hi> Give the Slave a Sword,
and he will slash his Master. Sixthly, The Pleaders are
deceived with that usual fallacy of <hi>non causa pro causa:</hi>
For 'tis a strong presumption of being God's people, and
favoured by him, that raises valour to so great a pitch:
and this is a stale trick in the world. All Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
their Gods; by Birds, Intrails, &amp;c. gave their
Souldiers some Omen or other of divine favour, which
made them presume of Victory, and so to run any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
whatsoever. What made <hi>Severus</hi>'s Souldiers so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted,
but the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that he told them he
had? The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> made <hi>Constantine</hi> to be the Great,
and his Souldiers invincible. 'Twas <hi>Cato</hi>'s errour,
that he would not deceive himself and Souldiers with a
fine story brought from the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where
he was, and much urged by his Army to inquire; for
want of which they were conquered before they fought:
whereas some pious cheat would have made them more
terrible then <hi>Bellona</hi> her self. <hi>Curtius</hi> observes, that it
much furthered <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests, that he was voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to be the Son of <hi>Jupiter Hammon.</hi> 'Twas the strong
conceit of Saintship in <hi>Oliver</hi> and his deluded Army,
grounded on these Ministers encouragements, their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
frequent and fiery Prayers, and their high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95686:30"/>
to Responses from Heaven, that (joyned with good
Suits of Armour and the City Purse) made that Army
so mettlesome. Toleration was scarcely pretended in
their most bloudy conflicts; but was the Itch of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Army, too highly pamper'd with Loyal bloud.
Again, seventhly, The <hi>Turks</hi> are a valiant people in War,
and <hi>Cromwell</hi> was but a Pygmy to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the great:
yet none will say <hi>Turks</hi> are for Liberty of Conscience.
And surely the <hi>Roman</hi> valour hath left monuments of
its Greatness in a very large tract of the world; yet none
opposed Liberty of Conscience more then they in their
most flourishing times, if you will believe <hi>Liv.</hi> Dec. 4. l. 9.
who says, <hi>A Romanae reip. initiis negotium fuisse Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistratibus
datum, ut sacra externa fieri vetarent—Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulos
vatésque foro, circo, urbe prohiberent; vaticinos li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros
conquirerent combureréntque; omnem disciplinam sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificandi,
praeterquam more Romano, abolerent.</hi> If these
mean it restrictively of <hi>England,</hi> let them tell us
whether we deserved the name [<hi>gentis bellicosissimae</hi>]
better when the Rebellious Army was on foot, or 400
years before, when <hi>Ireland, Wales, France, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.
were subdued by us. But, eighthly, These men rightly
account for Liberty of Conscience, shewing that it is a
more successfull device for the blowing up any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then the Powder-Plot was. But 'tis a strange ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to commend it to the King, because it murthered
his Father; and to the Parliament, because it overturns
Government. 'Tis certain, 'tis the most fatal Wild-fire
of a Nation, and a sworn enemy to all Government;
and its genuine issue are Factions and Dissensions, whilst
each party struggles to promote his way. It distracts
the vulgar, who tend strongly to a Settlement; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95686:31"/>
the Gentry into Faction, to become the Head of
that Party are most like to receive them. It cuts off the
Magistrate at the half, leaving him no more of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
but the outward man. And could we but see the
face of it without a vizard, we should discern it to be
<hi>Vngovernableness.</hi> One of these Advocates calls it <hi>the
mad Earl of Warwick:</hi> then <hi>Bedlam</hi> is fittest for it; and
thither the Honourable House of Commons having vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, for me let it goe.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot but observe the pretty Artifice of the
Prop. p. 60. persuading us to believe, that <hi>if Liberty of
Conscience be granted, Episcopacie would drain all the Sects.</hi>
If Episcopacie could drain the Sects without an Act of
Uniformity to assist it, why not with it? But, alas! a
disease is infectious, but so is not health: we may get
Heresies by contagion, but seldome Truth. S. <hi>August.</hi>
tells <hi>Boniface, experientiâ edoctus, nullâ re magìs quàm
Severitate Donatistas &amp; Circumcelliones in officio conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri.</hi>
Sure these Seas of Errours never so much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
their Banks, till the Rumpers pull'd up the Sluces:
and whether Liberty made our Factions dwindle, let the
world judge. 'Tis too true a Proverb, <hi>Opportunity makes
the Thief.</hi> To set open the door, is not the way to keep
Errours out.</p>
            <p>8. Their eighth Reason is, 'Tis a sin to make men act
against Conscience: for Force either debauches Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or brings Persecution on mens bodies or estates;
either of which do make the Forcer guilty, L.C.A. p. 45.
<hi>'Tis a greater sin then lying, stealing, whoring,</hi> &amp;c. P. p. 74.
<hi>You were better stab him, p. 73. He is damned that is
made to doe what he thinks not lawfull, and he may never
recover his Conscience again,</hi> p. 75. To this we answer,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95686:31"/>
first, All this Argument is as strong for Toleration of
Papists as for any else; yet these men do unitedly deny
liberty to them. So that certainly they conceive it not
a sin; or else are content to damn themselves, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Papists. Secondly, They know that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
Quakers and Anabaptists do declare it against
their Consciences to come to our Churches, and
hear our Sermons: yet L. C. A. pag. 48. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
asserts <hi>that the Magistrate may without sin
compell men to hear Sermons.</hi> Did he therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
himself, and this Argument to be true, it did ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him to give the Magistrate that direction. If you
force the Quaker to come to Church, according to this
Argument you debauch his Conscience, &amp;c. Thirdly, This
Argument we are not concerned in; for we plead not
against liberty of believing or loving, but of professing
and practising Errours. We say with <hi>Cic.</hi> to <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
l. 4. ep. 9. <hi>Dicere fortasse quae sentias non licet, tacere
planè licet.</hi> Were their Case that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate,
<hi>Senatus ad otium summum, vel ad summum nefas vocare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
Plin.</hi> l. 8. ep. 14. they might save their Consciences by
doing nothing. If the Libertines fansy it a false Doctrine
they are required to believe, let them hold their peace,
and all is well. Laws can make men hide, though not
hate, their Errours. 'Tis true, Conscience ought not,
no nor cannot, be touched; but yet mens practices must
not be allowed. Thus <hi>Beza</hi> determines this Case, <hi>Vt non
sit punienda animi opinio, neutiquam tamen ferenda est
pestilens &amp; impia professio.</hi> Conscience is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
that can't be bound; but mens lips may be sealed, their
tongues may be tied, and their bodies moved from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
to Church, &amp;c. and that is all intended. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95686:32"/>
If the Powers could, or some men would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
act against the false suggestions of their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they would find it a saving rather then a stabbing
Act. For 'tis a false suggestion that of M. I. p. 7. That
<hi>he that is true to an erroneous Conscience is true to God:</hi>
for then are all the worshippers of Sun, Moon and Stars
true to God: then was <hi>Adam</hi> true to God, when he
was beguiled to eat the forbidden fruit. The truth is,
Conscience is indeed God's Officer; but the Devil hath
bribed it to his devotion: and 'tis no felony to thrust the
Devil out of what he hath no right to. But I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to this part elsewhere. Fifthly, Say that Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were great Cruelty to them that are in Errour; yet
'tis better one then all to perish. Surgeons never scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cutting off one member to save all the rest. 'Tis
certain, Kindness to Errour is Cruelty to Truth; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Wolf is Murther to the Sheep; Permission to
Conventicles is Persecution of the Church. Indeed
D. P. p. 114. tells you, <hi>he pleads the Cause of our Lord:</hi>
i. e. that his Name may be blasphemed without fear
of punishment; that any Worship, be it never so anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripturall,
may be offered him without controul. He
farther adds, that <hi>he and his Partner plead for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
&amp;c. to wit, that the Wolf may be gently dealt
with who worries the Lambs in <hi>Christ</hi>'s fold; that the
Serpent may be protected to seduce <hi>Adam</hi> to his Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Yet certainly, 'tis a sinfull patience, to
suffer God's Vineyard to be rooted out. What glory
is it to shew tenderness to the Weed that suppresseth the
Corn? He is no cruel Shepherd that kills the incurable
Sheep, to save the Flock from infection. <hi>Haereseos</hi> (says
<hi>Erasmus</hi> in praef. ad Hieron. ep.) <hi>ea est insimulatio, in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95686:32"/>
qua tolerantem esse impietas sit, non virtus.</hi> Sixthly, For
<hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s advice <hi>to let men alone, Beza</hi> says, <hi>ex veris
principiis falsam elicit consequentiam:</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> on the
place upbraids him for a doting and deceitfull Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.
Whose answers I leave with these Pleaders, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
they will be more gratefull then any I can
give. Seventhly, to conclude, This very Argument
in the Magistrate's mouth rises up in judgment against
all our opposers: for supposing the Magistrate's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
commands him (as it ought to doe) to take care
of the Honour of God, to punish Blasphemy, to nurse the
Church, to be a terrour to evil-doers, to lay out his
talent of Power for God, to endeavour God's glory, and
the suppressing of sin; If he should observe his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he must punish these men; if not, he sins against
his Conscience, and so wasts it, that he may never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it more. So that these men were better stab him
to the heart, then thus to force him upon Damnation for
neglect of his Duty. Thus are trifling disputes returned
upon the head of undiscerning, and therefore forward,
men. See this Case in <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. who being urged vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Gardiner,</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour,
to permit the Mass to his Sister <hi>Mary,</hi> he would
not for his life: they press the Suit; he wept, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
them to forbear: they also wept, saying, He had
more Religion in his little finger then they in their
whole bodies; as Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> reports <hi>in Vita Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard.</hi>
6. The occasion of this trouble to the young
King was, a Resolution given by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> before he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
the Mass to his Sister, That to wink at sin in hope
of return with patience, was no sin; but wholly to wink
after long patience, or to give permission to sin, was sin.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95686:33"/>
And indeed 'twas very true, for <hi>demisè ac facilè pati, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantis
speciem habeat,</hi> says <hi>Cic.</hi> ep. 3. ad Brutum. If
now our adversaries Argument stand good, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
stronger for the Magistrate then for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>9. Their next reason is, <hi>Force is no weapon of Christ's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
L.C.A. p. 30. and therefore not to be used. <hi>'Tis
unproportionate to the malady, to beat the body for the
Soul's fault: a Lion or a Dog may thus convert as well as
men,</hi> L. C. A. p. 36. <hi>The Apostles never took this way,</hi>
id. p. 40. <hi>nor is any service acceptable to God but willing
service,</hi> id. p. 39. <hi>nor can force ever settle the Gospell,</hi>
id. p. 47. To this I answer, first, Force may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used, (though not commanded) if it be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
else nothing were indifferent. D. R. p. 15.
denies <hi>Non-conformers to hold indifferent things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
Secondly, That the rod of Correction is not of
Divine institution, I think no sober man will assert. <hi>David</hi>
ventures to call it God's <hi>Rod, Ps.</hi> 23. 4. and <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9. tells
us 'tis a preacher of God's mission, <hi>Hear ye the Rod, and
who hath appointed it.</hi> S. <hi>Ber.</hi> will tell them the will of God
is, that the Priest should smite <hi>gladio oris,</hi> and the Prince
<hi>ore gladii.</hi> Thirdly, That the Rod should doe no
good is yet more strange, since the Scripture every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
asserts, that in mens affliction they will seek God
early: and certainly one way (and the best) to chastise
men is by the Sword of the Magistrate. Fourthly, That
Lions and Dogs may thus reduce men to better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
is no question, when God shall sanctifie a danger that
shall befall men by those Beasts: an instance of which you
have 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 25. the Lions that ravaged in <hi>Samaria</hi>
made the people inquire out the true God. Fifthly, This
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95686:33"/>
thour acknowledges, the Magistrate's Sword may drive
men from moral evils; and then what colour can there
be to deny it in spiritual evils? Sixthly, We must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them, that this Argument is as true in the Papist's
mouth against them, as in their mouth against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
Seventhly, They allow the body may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for the moral evils that the Soul commits; yet think
it unsuitable for spiritual evils. Eighthly, It was not (in
an ordinary way) the Apostles duty to use the civil Sword
in settling the Gospell, for that was to invade the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's
right: yet we find S. <hi>Peter</hi> sentencing <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> to death. To which our Pleaders reply,
'twas <hi>extraordinary,</hi> L.C.A. p. 3, 4. I answer, 'tis true
it was so, in the manner of the punishment, 1. because
inflicted by a Priest, 2. without visible means: but in
the matter it was not so, for Lying is a moral evil. And
therefore 'tis to be admired why the Authour should op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, and so swerve from his own principles: but
I take it to be the product of a spirit of contradiction, or
the effect of sleepie oscitancy. But had the offence been
an errour in Conscience, the punishment had been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defensible. Ninthly, The Civil Sword is most proper
to settle the Gospel, as to the publick profession of it,
(which is all contended for:) but 'tis the Holy Ghost
must assist, to erect a throne for it in the heart. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That forced service is unacceptable to God, is very
false: for God sends afflictions upon men to force them
into obedience; he scourges his children to bring them
home to him, and then accepts their Devotions. Thus
<hi>Manasseh</hi>'s chains bound him to his duty; and yet God
rewarded it with eternall life. And though the service
of compulsion be not so candid as that of a springing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95686:34"/>
spontaneity; yet 'tis not so drossie as to be rejected. But
say it were, yet is there ground enough for Force; as
S. <hi>August.</hi> to Gaudent. Ep. 2. l. 2. c. 17. <hi>Quòd autem
vobis videtur, invitos ad veritatem non esse cogendos, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis,
nescientes Scripturas, nec virtutem Dei, qui eos vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes
facit, dum coguntur inviti.</hi> If the Magistrate's
power bring their bodies, God's power will bring their
Souls. If the Magistrate's Pole drive the Fish together,
God will encompass them in his Gospel-Net.</p>
            <p>I see nothing more (that is considerable) left unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in either of these Authours; unless it be, That
<hi>men are bound to follow an erroneous Conscience, where
the Director or Imposer is not infallible in his Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
and therefore they ought to have their Liberty.
This is urged by L.C.A. p. 41, 42. and proved by these
parts. 1. <hi>That we must try all things our selves. 2. We must
doe all things in Faith. 3. That God will judge us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our own talent of knowledge, not the Magistrate's.
4. A man's judgment is useless, if he may not follow his
own light. 5. If we must follow the Magistrate's light,
all Idoll-worshippers will be excused,</hi> id. p. 43, 44, 46.
To which I reply, first, These men do not believe this
Argument to be true; for if they did, the Papist must
follow an erroneous Conscience: why then is he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from Toleration? Yea it argues as strongly for the
profession of Turcism, Judaism, Heathenism, or any thing
else, as for Presbyterianism. Secondly, It argues as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for permission of Fifth-monarchists to murther the
King, if they believe in Conscience the destruction of
earthly Powers is the way to advance the Kingdom of
<hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Thus is <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> justified for <hi>binding</hi> his
<hi>King in chains, and the Nobles in fetters of iron;</hi> for in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95686:34"/>
the execution of that Scripture-command he must have
liberty to follow his Conscience. Nay, thirdly, This
Argument would justifie poor men in seising on the
Estates of the rich; if once their Consciences persuade
them, that <hi>the meek</hi> ought to <hi>inherit the earth.</hi> Fourthly,
Who doubts but the Scripture is an infallible Director,
especially in the mouth of a Priest, from whom God
hath commanded us to inquire the Law, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a messenger of the Lord of Hosts? and who
can tell the mind of the Prince better then his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour?
And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> charges the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
c. 13. v. 7. to <hi>follow their faith that have the charge
over them.</hi> Fifthly, The <hi>Jew</hi> was under the obligation
of Conscience as well as the Christian; yet no Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was granted to him to publish or practice what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he pleased: for <hi>Heb. 10. 28. he that despised
Moses Law died without mercy, under two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:</hi>
and is the Gospell of less moment then <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Law? But L. C. A. p. 33. replies, <hi>a greater punishment,
even Damnation, is inflicted for contempt of the Gospell.</hi>
Very true, but so was it for contempt of the Law of
<hi>Moses</hi> too. The temporal Judge kills for Murther, and
the eternall Judge damns; and so did they then, for
damnable Doctrines that murthered Souls. Sixthly,
Men may use their judgment, and follow their own light,
and try what they will; onely let them keep it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
as <hi>Hester</hi> did her Religion in the Court of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasuerus.</hi>
Seventhly, This Argument is no less strong for
the Magistrate to prosecute Dissenters; if he believe in
his Conscience that he is bound to promote the Glory of
God, to propagate Truth, and to destroy those Boars and
Foxes that strive to root up the Vine, or to pick off the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95686:35"/>
Grapes. In a word, to follow an erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is sin; and for the Magistrate to indulge a man
in sin, is no less cruelty then that of King <hi>Philip,</hi> to bring
up his Wife's brother <hi>Alexander</hi> in all kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries,
that he might effeminate him, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of his Kingdome. In this case S. <hi>Hieron.</hi>
Com. in Ezek. 18. would cry out, and every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
with him, <hi>Nolo talem misericordiam, Domine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, <hi>manum de tabula,</hi> 'tis time to conclude.
Onely I pray leave to propose to this present and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<hi>Parliament</hi> the ensuing particulars: which if
they conduce not to quiet, yet certainly not to quarrell;
if they have little of <hi>Mercury,</hi> they shall have nothing
of <hi>Mars</hi> in them: and therefore (I presume) will be
patiently heard by a Parliament whose Discretion vies
with their Justice, and both seem to be Conquerours.
A true <hi>Parliamentum pacificum,</hi> Antipodes to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentum
insannum.</hi> Never any met with a more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Disease; never any made a more perfect Cure. A
Parliament that have been infinitely provoked, yet
know no Passions but by their Names. A Parliament
that is like to verifie <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Character of <hi>England,</hi> Ver.
hist. l. 2. that 'tis <hi>Insula fortunata &amp; Campi Elysti.</hi>
When <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> entered it, <hi>captus amoenitate loci
redire noluit:</hi> He resolved to live and die here. With
such a Parliament what <hi>Caesar</hi> would not take up the
same Resolution? Yet <hi>Carneades</hi> tells us, wise men
contrive Laws, and fools judge of them; and therefore
no wonder if some repine, that doat onely on Liberty
of Conscience. Let such hear that discreet Heathen
telling them, 'Tis <hi>optimus Reip. status, ubi nihil deest nisi
licentia pereundi.</hi> 'Tis a happy want, to be without tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95686:35"/>
to sin. <hi>Caesar,</hi> in l. 3. Com. de bello Gallico,
observes every man to be a Rebell by nature, <hi>Omnes
homines naturâ libertati studere, &amp; conditionem ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitutis
odisse.</hi> In <hi>English,</hi> No man would be ruled, if
he could rule: Obedience is not of nature, but of grace:
therefore 'tis, <hi>In bonos facile est imperium.</hi> It must be
Gold, if superlatively ductile. Which proves our see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
spiritual men to be too natural, their temper is so
ungovernable. Authority had need wear Hedging-gloves,
when they meddle with these scratching Thorns.
These discontented spirits breath so hot in the face of
Authority, that they make the cheeks of their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
blister. But all sober men will consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and wide Differences this Parliament hath composed,
how many Swords they have sheathed, how many Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
they have removed, how gently they have
touched the strings of our Concord, what pains they
have taken to modell Oaths, so as men might disown
nothing but opposition to the Government; and must
needs declare, That this Parliament (under his MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTIE's
influence) have been the <hi>Healers of our
Breaches, and Restorers of paths to dwell in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To continue the Parliament's candour and fidelity,
'tis humbly conceived necessary, 1. To discountenance
for the future (as they have now done) all attempts for
the Lawlesness the Authours here answered plead for. I
need adde no Reasons; their own in 1662. given to
the KING are the Quintessence of the Nation's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and therefore must be eternal. Yet I may say, 1. If
Scrupling and Faction repeal Laws, then are they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
stronger or honester then the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Secondly, If Subjects see that Coyn pass for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95686:36"/>
they will bid it for what-ever Law they take distast
at. 3. If the Parliament be unconstant to themselves,
men will judge their Acts not to be the product of
great Judgment, grave Counsels, and good Conscience,
but rather of Levity and Humour; especially when an
Act shall be repealed that was settled with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
printed Reasons, and deep Resolutions to stand
by it. I conceive, though a Parliament be acknowledged
fallible, yet an Act so carefully formed comes near an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis absolutely necessary for the Parliament to stand
by the Liturgie. 1. Because they have solemnly declared
in their Act of Uniformity, that it is comfortable to all
Christians, profitable to this Realm, fruitfull in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
God's blessings, an honour to the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the neglect of it scandalous and dangerous.
If this were true in 1662, 'tis no lesse in 1668. 2. In
respect of the People's happiness, who have the same
means and way to Heaven with their Prince, their
Nobles, the reverend Judges, the most reverend Bishops,
Doctors and Learned men of the Land. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man sails to Heaven in the same Bottome with the
greatest and wisest. So that if men conscienciously
use it, all must swim, or all sink together. 3. In
respect of the Ministry, whose tender Consciences
must needs otherwise be filled with great anxieties, for
fear lest their private parts, skill, reasoning, wisedom
and direction, should not be sufficient to convey so many
Souls (as they have charge of) safely to Heaven: from
which they are in a great measure delivered by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;
the studied assistence of the whole Church of
<hi>England,</hi> by which their Flock is fed and guided in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95686:36"/>
same manner, in their Devotions, with the best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
man of the Kingdome: men of the greatest parts
having no higher way for the daily Sacrifice then they.
4. In respect of the Papists, who may justly complain of
our Persecutions in this last Century of years, for their
not coming to our Worship, since we our selves at last
think it unfit for use. Yea in so doing this Parliament
would declare their Predecessors Persecutors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all former Parliaments, (except the Rump) as well
as themselves, for unconscionable Acts; yea and with
them condemn the very Reformed Religion in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
5. In respect of the Consequences of such a change;
the sharpest Eye-fight being not able to reach the end of
such an attempt. It will well become a sober Parliament,
constituted of the most substantial and honest Gentry, to
leave the Church in such a Constitution as she had in the
most flourishing times of our former Princes: leaving it to
Rumpers, and others of the like audacious Consciences,
to bring in Sacrilege, Confusion, Errours, Schisms, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
Civil wars, &amp;c. and so to entail Tortures to
their Consciences, Stains on their Reputations, Curses
on their Families, and Consumptions on their Estates.
Which God avert.</p>
            <p>3. The Parliament will find all Salvo's, to make way
for an Accommodation, utterly pernicious. 1. Because
they accuse the Laws as too rigid. 2. Salvo's oblige
none to obey but <hi>Quicunque vult.</hi> 3. The disobedient
seem equally innocent with the obedient, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious.
4. They permit a Party against the Laws,
and proclaim variety of judgments. 5. Changing men
from compliance with the Law to the benefit of a Salvo,
will be called <hi>Conversion</hi> in a little time by scrupling
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95686:37"/>
Preachers. 6. All Salvo's are virtual Repeals of a
Law.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis certainly necessary thatx the Parliament stand
fast to the Government of the Nation, according to their
own Explications. 1. Because without them men had
some pretences to justifie a Civil War, which was a
strong temptation to the raising of it. 2. Because if a
Prince cannot wrong, nor can he right his Subjects:
if he could doe no hurt, he could doe no good.
3. Because Rebells find alwaies hands too strong for the
best Laws, and just Princes generally find the Laws too
weak to protect them; especially in this Island, where
old <hi>Gildas</hi> long since observed, the people were <hi>fortes
ad Bella civilia.</hi> Yea he adds, <hi>Si quis Principum mitior
&amp; veritati aliquatenus propior videretur, in hunc, quasi</hi>
Britanniae <hi>subversorem, omnium odia teláque sine respectu
torquebantur.</hi> I groan when I reade it; yet our late
Times have most emphatically Englished it. 4. 'Tis
certain, what Odium they can receive from Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
they have received already; being judged (by
so freely declaring the Law) Propugnators of Laws,
Religion, Settlement, the Prince's Rights, and People's
Interests, and thereby of the Loyall Party: for which
the Factious are their implacable enemies. 5. Because
the Parties that would be gratified are true enemies to
all Government. The dispute being not what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but what Governours, with them. They could
no more endure the Long Parliament with their <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie,</hi>
nor the Rump with their <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> nor the
Protector with his <hi>Olivarchie,</hi> then their lawfull Prince
with his regular <hi>Monarchie.</hi> In a word, what they are in
Church they are in State; alwaies Reforming, but never
Reformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:95686:37"/>
5. The late vote of the Honourable House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
for putting penall Laws in execution, is most just
1. Because every Magistrate ought to punish injuries
done to God, as well as those done to men. 2. To distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the good Subject from the Rebell. 3. To take away
temptations from others to grow Factious. 4. To draw
the Factious to Repentance by momentany affliction,
for the saving of their Souls. 5. To bank up the floud
of Errours from overflowing an Island <hi>aliquid semper
audire volente, &amp; nihil certi stebiliter retinente,</hi> as <hi>Gildas</hi>
observes of us, and <hi>Bede</hi> confirms Hist. Eccl. l. 1. c. 8.
in the self-same words. An Itch after new Factions being
as natural to us, as after the new Fashions of the <hi>French:
a bad new way</hi> being in all Ages more welcome to us
then the <hi>good old way.</hi> 6. If the Law given be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
the Law-giver can't be respected. 7. A dormant
Law serves onely to increase transgression, both in them
that swear to execute the Laws, and in them that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.
8. By this means a Constable or Church-warden
in a Parish may void the best-contrived Sanctions of
Parliament. 9. If it be not possible to execute a Law,
the Contrivers wanted wisedome; if not lawfull, they
wanted Justice. 10. If former Laws be voided by
neglect of Execution, future Laws will not be fear'd;
which tends to dissolve all Government.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis humbly proposed to consideration, whether
the Church-wardens Tax for repair of Churches ought
not to be levied as the Over-seers of the Poor is, by
Justices Warrant; yea and Vicarage-Tiths be declared
positive in favour of Vicars, (who have commonly the
greatest work and least wages) and made to be sued for
at Common Law. 1. Because Sectaries stand willingly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95686:38"/>
excommunicate, and are tempted so to doe, by saving
their money. 2. The heavy sentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is unproportionable to the detaining a Groat.
3. An Act may be so drawn as not to be Derogative, but
Accumulative to Church-Franchises, leaving the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi
to take what way he pleases. 4. It would prevent
a thousand clamours against Spiritual Courts, for too
frequent Presentments, buying of Time, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
for Trifles, &amp;c. 5. If all Irregularities were
punished with Penalties, and onely Crimes with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
it would remove a great deal of offence;
especially if Excommunication be executed with that
Conscience and Gravity a Censure of <hi>Christ</hi> ought to
be, and by those hands in which <hi>Christ</hi> left it. I know
that Contumacie (as the learned D. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Power
of Keys, hath proved) is the onely sin that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
punishes: but 'tis pity to buoy men up into that
stubborn Posture for every Trifle; since men may guesse
from the equality of punishment, that the Church em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
that Stoicall conceit, that <hi>Omnia peccata sunt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, That Liberty may be yet more confined, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beg that common Swearing and common Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the Lord's Day may be stopp'd by Parliamentary
Authority; lest their general practice should make them
(in mens opinions) degenerate from Crimes to Vertues.
I would that our Scruplers had set their stomachs against
these Vices, and we should soon have been Brethren.</p>
            <p>Now (to turn the Tables a little) I become a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> to wit, That it may be
lawfull for Priest and People (without fear of Bailiffs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95686:38"/>
or common Arrests) to repair to and retire from their
Parish-Churches upon Sundays: lest while your Acts
command attendance on Divine Service, and Arrests for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them, they be forced upon transgressions.</p>
            <p>NOw, Sir, by this you may see my sense of these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
and their Designs, and what I imagine
to be more wholesome Counsell. If you wonder at
my style, as too biting for my temper; I alledge, that
the spirit of Meekness can be but of little use against
a Party that want Modesty. Besides, the nature of
this Case is such, that the discovery of these mens
Crimes is a confutation of their Cause. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
(though <hi>meek and lowly</hi>) found a whip for the
Temple-beasts, never using bitterer expressions then to
the Saint-like Hypocrites. Wolves in Sheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
are double-skinn'd, and must not be whipp'd with
a Nosegay. They cry, with the <hi>Donatists, Nos soli
homines, caeteri canes &amp; sues;</hi> proclaim each other
<hi>godly</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> men: so that to have smothered
the truth, had been to conspire with the Devil to
their Damnation. Upon these Reasons I stand at
the Bar of your candid Censure for my Severity,
rejoycing that your Honour will be concerned in
the Interest of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Church, and not, like the
<hi>Gallio's</hi> of our Age, <hi>care for none of these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What now remains for me, but to lay down
my Pen, and take up my Prayers, That God would
grant <hi>England</hi> to speak the same things, and think
the same things, and doe the same things; and that
(at length) all Animosities laid aside, we may all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95686:39"/>
with one heart and one mouth glorifie the God of our
Fathers; so that, maugre all opposition, <hi>England</hi> may
again appear a Nation at unity within it self? Which
shall be the daily prayer and endeavour of</p>
