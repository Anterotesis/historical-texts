            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>f his Cap, and deliuered it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, saying; I am very sorry <hi>M. Porter,</hi> that it is no better for you.

            <p>So then was he by M. Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conueyed to his Lodging, where he called vnto him one <hi>Iohn Wood</hi> his owne seruant, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted there to attend him, who could neither write nor reade, and swore him before
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16654:69"/>
the Lieutenant, that if he should heare or see at any time, his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster write, or speake any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thing agaynst the King, Councell, or State of the land, he should reueale it to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t might make the same knowne to the Counsell.</p>
            <p>After he had remayned in the Tower about a moneth, his daughter <hi>Roper</hi> (hauing greatly desired to see her Father) made earnest suite, &amp; got leaue to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit him: at whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming after the saying of the seauen Psalmes &amp; Letanyes, which he was euer accustomed to say with her) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell into discourse of any other matter, among other speaches he said vnto her: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue <hi>Megge,</hi> that they who haue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16654:69"/>
put me heere, thinke they haue done me a great displeasure: But I assure thee on my fayth (myne owne good daughter) if it had not ben for my wife &amp; you my Children, whome I acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt the chiefe part of my charge, I would not haue failed long ere now, to haue inclosed my selfe in a straiter roome then this. But since I am come hither, without myne owne desert, I trust that God of his goodnes will disburden me of my care, and with his gracious help sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my want amongst you. And I find no cause (I thanke God <hi>Megge</hi>) to reckon my selfe in worse case heere, then in myne owne house. For me thinkes in this case, God maketh me euen a wanton, setting me vpon his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16654:70"/>
knee, and dandling me.</p>
            <p>Thus by his patient suffering, and cheerfull demeanour in all his tribulations and disasters, it plainly appeared, that nothing seemed painfull vnto him, but rather a profitable Exercise, for the good of his soule. Then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had questioned a while with his daughter about his wife Children, and houshold state in his absence, he asked her how Queene <hi>Anne</hi> did? Neuer better Father (quoth she.) Neuer better <hi>Megge</hi> (quoth he:) Alas, alas, it pittieth me to remember into what misery (poore Soule) she will shortly come.</p>

Wherefore he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ther to not guilty, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued vnto himselfe aduantage
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16654:78"/>
to be taken of the body of the matter, after verdict, to auoyd that Inditement.

            <p>Then for proofe alleaged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iury, that <hi>Syr Thomas More</hi> was guilty of this Treason, <hi>M.

To whome, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus sworne, <hi>Syr Thomas More</hi> spake in this wise: If this Oath of yours be true <hi>M.

the whole world. Then recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he to the Court, the whole discourse, of all their Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and putting of Cases in the Tower, according to the Truth. And turning to <hi>M. Rich</hi> he said: In good fayth <hi>M. Rich,</hi> I am more sory for your Periury then for myne owne perill. And besides, you shall vnderstand, that neither I, nor any man else to my knowledge, euer tooke you to be a man of such credit, as to communicate vnto you any matter of importance; and (you well know) I haue ben ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you no small while, and haue knowne you, &amp; your Conuersation from your very youth; for we dwelled lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g together in one Parish, where, as your selfe can tell best, (I am sory you compell me so to say)

you were esteemed very light of your tongue, a great Dicer, and of no commendable Fame, or Name: Can it therefore seeme likely to your Lordships, that I would in so weighty a matter, so vnaduisedly ouershoote my selfe, as to trust <hi>M.
