            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEhold here, as in a Glasse, the mournefull face of a sister Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now drunke with misery; according to what God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi> Should I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by all the memorable particulars, which might be accumulated, to amplifie this sad theme, the third part would bee sufficient to weary thee or blinde thy eyes with reares, if thy heart were not adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.

Our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey did sometimes suffer in like manner, if not measure, as in the civill wars and other times.

            <p>HEre followes (according to the table) <hi>A true representation of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable estate of Germany.</hi> A most grave, serious, and weighty subject, and above all other most necessary for us to peruse, and ponder. Wee for the present have <hi>Halcion dayes.</hi> Sitting as the people under <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Every man under his owne Vine, and Fig-tree; No complayning in our streets, no carrying into Captivity.</hi> For which all honour and praise be to him, whose mercy it is that wee are not consumed. And yet there may be <hi>a lengthening of our tranquility,</hi> if wee would walke worthy of those mercies which we doe inioy, and <hi>learne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse by the judgements of God, which are made manifest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21850:4"/>
One especiall meanes effectually tending hereunto, is to be acquainted with the passages of Gods providence abroad, and to make such use of his dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he himselfe in Scripture directs us to. For our information in the state of things abroad, these ensuing schedules may helpe such as have no better intelligence. Wherein such passages are related, <hi>as may make both our eares <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to heare them.</hi> The heads insisted on are <hi>the Arrowes of the Almighty;</hi> Sword, Famine, and Pestilence, together with their pale and grisly attendants. Extortion, Rapine, salvage cruelty, desolations, deaths of all kinde. A sad and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall troope.</p>
            <p>The subject on which all these evils light, is <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> a neighbouring countrey well knowne. The Throne of Europes Empire. This is now the Stage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most direfull Tragedies are acted. And therein as well the <hi>Protestants</hi> (the more the pity) as the <hi>Papists:</hi> no difference for religious sake; nor any respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, ages, sexes, or conditions. <hi>The fowles of the ayre may therein eate the flesh of Kings, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and mighty men. The flesh of horses, and them that sit on them. Yea, the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great,</hi> Rev. 19. 18.</p>
            <p>The instances and particulars which are here recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are such as may seeme incredible, and cause wondring unto astonishment, yet is there nothing but what may well be counted probable, a few things considered. As first, what God threatens in this kinde for breach of his Law.
<pb facs="tcp:21850:4"/>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 53, &amp;c. Thou shalt eate the fruite of thine owne body, the flesh of thy sonnes and daughters —. The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eyes shall be evill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosome, and towards the remnant of children which hee shall leave: so that he will not give to any of them the flesh of his children, whom he shall eate, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then what particular instances we have of like things upon like occasions in Scripture, as in the siege of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, 2 King. 6. 28, 29.</hi> The certainety of the generals is beyond all exception, among those that will believe any thing more than they see with their eyes, and feele with their hands. The time, and space that the wars have endured addes much to the probability of all ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects avoucht. The current yeere making up full twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty since the beginning. During all which <hi>Germany</hi> hath beene <hi>Acheldama, a field of blood.</hi> Vnder this word <hi>(warre)</hi> more evill and mischiefe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended than can be uttered. Weigh all things duly, the severall kinds of warre, forraigne and domesticke; by invasions, by insurrections, the same persons, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being to day Conquerours, and to morrow conquered, over and over againe, and all things every day worse and worse; we may well conclude, <hi>the one halfe hath not beene told us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope none among us are so prophane as to say what is this to us, be it all be true? and few so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as not to know what God requireth of us
<pb facs="tcp:21850:5"/>
in this regard. Yet it's too manifest, that most are so carelesse, that they neede a Monitor to twit them by the care. I have therefore partly upon intreatie, and chiefly for affection unto the thing it selfe, endevoured briefly to speake something unto that end. <hi>The Lyon hath roared, who will not feare? The Lord hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, who can but prophecie,</hi> Amos <hi>3. 8. Salvian</hi> in his time, tooke great paines to prove there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilence, when the then supposed barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> broke in upon the Empire, as the Sea doth sometimes over flow the banke. But mee thinkes that alone were enough to manifest the finger of <hi>God,</hi> which bred the doubt in men Atheisticall. How exceeding full is the Scripture for the proofe of this? <hi>That God is Authour of all Judgements, and therefore in all wee ought to looke up unto him.</hi> All Captaines and their armies are but Sergeants under <hi>the Lord of hosts; that man of warre, and God of battell. The Assyrian is the rod of Gods anger, the staffe in their hand is Gods indignation,</hi> Isay <hi>10. 5. There is no evill in a City but he doth it. Behold</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>what desolations the Lord hath made in the earth.</hi> Psal. 46. 8. If a Sparrow fall not to the ground, but <hi>according to the will of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father,</hi> much lesse are millions of men mowed downe with the sword, but according to his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Iudgement.</p>
            <p>It is also cleare out of Scripture, that wee ought to lay to heart those Iudgements of God, which wee are acquainted with, and especially his greater Iudgements
<pb facs="tcp:21850:5"/>
God sends one place to consider of another: <hi>Goe yee now unto my place, which was in</hi> Shilo, <hi>where I set my name at the beginning, and see what I did to it for the wickednesse of my people Israel,</hi> 7. 12. saith God to the men of Ierusalem.</p>
            <p>And who makes question, but that those <hi>Churches, Nations, Persons,</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> which have speciall relation one unto another, sacred or civill, in the bonds of Religion, neighbourhood or commerce are more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bound mutually to consider and bemoane one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conditions.</p>
            <p>This likewise is evident, that our Church and State, and every member of the same, ought upon speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to be cordially affected with the miseries of <hi>Germany.</hi> They are of the same Religion with us. Christians as wee are; our peace is the weaker for want of theirs; many of our owne have suffered with them. but above all is the affliction of that <hi>Royall Lady</hi> our Gracious Soveraignes onely sister, who hath suffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in her Royall Person, and may suffer yet more in her posterity, but God forbid. But what is it that wee must doe, or learne from the state of things in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> The particulars are severall in severall regards. In relation to God, to them and to our selves.</p>
            <p>In regard of God. Wee must acknowledge the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Wisdome and unsearchablenesse of his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take heede of rash assigning the cause. Some lay all the blame upon the <hi>Protestants,</hi> as if their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion among themselves, and unnecessary separation (in their phrase) from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> were the
<pb facs="tcp:21850:6"/>
roote of all. But is it not more likely, that <hi>Germany drinkes now of the cup of wrath, because shee hath long drunke of the cup of sundry great abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations?</hi> The generall cause, which is sinne, wee all acknowledge: It were a happinesse to know the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, according unto that, <hi>Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.</hi> But such a spirit of discerning God gives not unto all. They themselves best know their owne waies, case and state, and therefore wee may leave it unto them to consider of the speciall causes, whom it most concernes. <hi>But who will not feare the Lord, and glorifie his Name, who onely is holy, and whose judgements are made manifest,</hi> Rev. 15. 4.</p>
            <p>In respect of them, first let us sympathize: grieve with them that grieve. Rom. <hi>12. 15. and weepe with them that weepe.</hi> We are all members of one and the same mysticall body, whereof Christ is head. Our peace and security is in a great measure bound up in theirs: their troubles may increase ours; as they have already occasioned many feares, cares and expences: Witnesse the great levie of souldiers at some times, and not a little chargeable Embassages from our King and State. Next of all, we are to pray for them, that God would restore peace, and make up all breaches. <hi>Giving the Lord no rest, untill hee make</hi> Ierusalem <hi>the praise of the earth. Abraham</hi> interceded long for <hi>Sodome,</hi> how much more ought we to do the like for them? And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we have ability and opportunity, we ought to help and succour them, ministring to their necessities, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their profugates, and intertaining them into our
<pb facs="tcp:21850:6"/>
bosomes, when they fly from their owne to us. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ours found among them a shelter from the storme in our <hi>Marian daies,</hi> and doe still, no doubt, blesse God for our peace, notwithstanding their owne warres.</p>
            <p>In respect of our selves, there be many instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we may learne from the <hi>Lecture</hi> of their calamities. No privileges can finally secure a sinfull people; for what have we to glory in that they had not? The seedes of all their evills are sowne in our fields. There be likewise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers duties that wee should abound in the more: In repentance, lest we bring upon our selves the like: In prayer, that God would blesse our state and government, that by the wisedome thereof we may be led along in such waies as may propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate our peace unto posterity: In patience under those chastisements which we suffer. Though the hand of God hath long beene upon many Cities and Townes, and <hi>his Arme be stretched out still</hi> upon some of them, yet is our misery, happinesse, in comparison of theirs: If a gentle plague alone have affrighted us all, What would Sword and Famine with it doe?</p>
            <p>But what doe wee? <hi>Wee put farre away the evill day, and cause the seat of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to come neere: Wee drinke wine in bowles, and anoint our selves with the chiefe ointments, but are not grieved for the afflictions of</hi> Ioseph, Amos <hi>6. 3. &amp; 6.</hi> This
<pb facs="tcp:21850:7"/>
is no small sinne, and if once the day of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation come, a small chastisement on Gods part will not be all. Oh that wee would consider, <hi>the Vials of Gods wrath are pouring forth, as well on his owne Churches for correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as on their adversaries unto destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> Who knowes how fast the cup may passe round? Gods arrowes are all fleete. <hi>The curse of God goeth forth over the face of the whole earth,</hi> Zach. <hi>5. 3.</hi> If the sinnes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> be found in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the sinnes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they shall all pledge each other: for God is no respecter of persons. Are there no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards but in <hi>Germany?</hi> Or, doth God hate sinne in them alone? What are wee, that God should alwaies spare us? Many cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> and I with the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> say <hi>Amen. The Lord doe so, the Lord performe the words of them which prophesie of nothing but good,</hi> Iere. <hi>28. 6.</hi> But its good to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that of the Apostle, when they cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gloss. ordin.</hi> in Ierem. <hi>7. 12. Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid illo populo fecit Deus, timeamus: cum nos similia faciamus.</hi> Yet no such clouds <hi>(blessed bee God)</hi> arise over our heads, as those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with her horizon is darkned. But stormes arise suddenly. <hi>God creates good and evill,</hi> brings both when there is no appearance or cause of suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Not to feare is cause enough to bee affraid, if we could so reflect upon our selves: <hi>As God brings
<pb facs="tcp:21850:7"/>
light out of darknesse, so darknesse out of light.</hi> How faire rose the Sunne upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> that day it rained fire and brimstone? How poore a thing was a cloud like a mans hand, to prognosticate abundance of raine by? But I must <hi>manum de tabula.</hi> Well then reade on, reade and spare not, reade and consider, reade and weepe, imagine the Booke to be <hi>Germany</hi> it selfe, their case ours, and <hi>our soules in their soules stead.</hi> Do as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did when he heard of the state of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and the Temple therein <hi>He sate downe and wept, mourned and fasted certaine daies, and prayed before the Lord God of Heaven,</hi> Neh. <hi>1. 4.</hi> Would we but doe the like for our selves and them, God would assuredly restore their peace, and continue ours, for which I shall ever heartily pray, and so rest</p>

SInce the Imperialists passing the Rhine, first entred into our Countrey, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two yeeres agoe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction hath come upon as like a whirlewind, and sudden desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath depopulated this our most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishing country; our Cities are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Townes, our Townes into Villages, our Villages into Cottages; where before were a thousand, there now scarce a hundred, and where a hundred, there the tenth is hardly left alive: Those which the sword hath spared, the Pestilence hath consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, those which the Pestilence hath left, Famine hath destroyed, and the small rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which pale-fac'd Famine hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, are so transce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dently miserable, as it

After that the Caesarian forces the last yeere had taken <hi>Swybruggen,</hi> &amp; passing with a numbersome army towards <hi>Lotharinge</hi> had destroyed all round about; there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed such a fearefull famin, that the most part of men, especially of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dwelt in the country, being urged by pressing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, was driven to feed on Acorns, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of herbs, roots, briars, nettles, grasse, leaves of trees, so that we may truly take up the complaint of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> (though there it's to be taken in another sense) that man is become like the beast that perisheth, but further, the intralls of beasts, the skins of beeves, sheepe, horses, the haire being first burned, was highly prised, yea Snailes, Frogs with their guts and egs, the flesh of dogs and cats, carrion that hath been dead six weeks or more, hath beene valued at a great rate,
<pb facs="tcp:21850:9"/>
nay, sometimes not the price, but a sword hath decided who should have a young colt, or some such thing, though not halfe a yard long. Two women did so long fight with their fists for horse-flesh, that one of of them dyed, yea, in some Famine made such a rage, that they did not abstaine from mans flesh. In a parish neere unto <hi>Sweybruggen,</hi> a brother and sister surviving their parents, and the sister also dying, he (wee tremble in the very writing) fed upon his sister, and devoured the thighes of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Diocesse of <hi>Blissoe Capellana</hi> the corpses of men starved, whose skin cleaved to their bones, so that whilest they were alive, we might truely have said, that their flesh did but infunerall their buried ghosts, yet they being dead, had their in wards, their heart and lungs taken our, and devoured, and that which is more, they have laine in waite to intercept passengers, and those whom they have taken, after they have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, they make their own bellies then graves. A boy of some three yeeres old, the

The widow of <hi>Albogastus Rumela</hi> perished her selfe, and foure children, and when they are extinguished by Famine (if they escape being eaten of others) they lie unburied, stinking and torne in pieces by dogs, wolves, and other beasts. Some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eaten mad dogges, were taken with phrensie themselves, and ragingly dyed. Hence comes such a wildernesse, that in 300 parishes, there's not any left alive, those few that remaine, hide themselves in the woods, and in the townes, the tenth man doth not survive, and many of them too,

            <p>ALas! What stormes and tempests doe now beat upon the ship of Jesus Christ in our Countrey? What punishments and plagues doe now oppresse us? God is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry with us for our manifold sinnes, and seemes in his indignation utterly to destroy us, and all that is round about us. The heavie curses of <hi>Moses,</hi> the bitter lamentations of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and all the horrible threatnings of the holy Prophets, wee see daily here accomplished. With this new Winter-quarter, beginnes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our miseries; oppression and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, we being utterly destitute of all helpe and meanes to support us. The chiefest of our Countrey are forced to leave their houses and lands, and to goe a wandring in strange Countries; yea, many of them end their lives most miserably. It is impossible to expresse either the greatnesse of our wants, or the fury of Famine amongst us. Mothers forgetting
<pb facs="tcp:21850:15"/>
their naturall affections towards their owne children become butchers of them, and eate them up in stead of food. Wee do heare dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children crying about the streets, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they dare not goe home, for feare of being killed. It is kept upon record by the Magistrates of this City, how that men have digged out of the graves dead bodies, and have eaten them. A woman was found dead, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mans head rosted by her, and the rib of a man in her mouth, holding it betweene her teeth, and of this horrible spectacle all sorts of men can give testimony. Such and many more signes of Gods heavie wrath wee could write unto you of, but this shall suffice to give you a touch of the extremities wee are in. O how seasonable are those almes, which are sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keepe some of us alive! That faithfull God, who hath made so many promises to the liberall heart, will undoubtedly consider those, that consider our poore Countrey-men in these extremities, and keep them from famishing.</p>

               <p>EVills of Punishment are Gods, the evil of Sinne is wholly ours. Whatsoever was the impulsive cause of his judgements, our whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest use is, to attribute them to our sins: to greater sins, greater Judgements, seeing God seemeth to observe a proportion to our deserts; for, <hi>Ezck.</hi> 14. 21. the Prophet speaks of foure sore Judgements, that is, greater and more grievous than the rest; famine, sword, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, and the noisome beast: with these hath he lately visited some nations; especially <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> before a large, populous, fertile and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countrey. What shal we say? were their sins greater than ours? No, but except we repent, what may we expect? the sins of <hi>Sodome</hi> were pride, idlenesse, and fulnesse of bread; and such they acknowledge theirs to have beene. I have seene their peasants served in plate, they slept

with downe-beds above and under them: their stoves kept them insensible of the winters cold; they ate no dish of meat without his sauce; their plenty of corne and wine, milk and honey, fish and flesh, did equall that of any other nation whatsoever. A little labour brought them in much; delicacie of living made them incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate of others sufferings; and security blinded them, that they could not see the storm a comming. Thus, while they swim in fulnesse and pleasure, the Judgement that slept, was suddenly awaked, &amp; the fire of war was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all their coasts; which blowne with the bellows of exasperated spirits, hath depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Land, and consumed their dwellings to the ground: all lieth desolate; the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards are not dressed, nor the fields tilled, the sword is every where drunke with bloud.

TO beginne with warre, which began the rest, who knoweth not that this mercilesse fury hath there plaied the tyrant, ever since that burning Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, the blazing Starre, gave them the alarme, 1617. which the best Astrologers expounded the sword of <hi>Germany.</hi> A Prophecie I have seen, long since, written in a Booke, which belonged to a Canonick of <hi>Nimegen,</hi> and now in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary at <hi>Zutphen;</hi> that a time should come, when one <hi>Frederike</hi> should be King, and then should the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Nobility of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the people of both be oppressed, and warre rage, beyond all precedent of former ages this, if ever, is now fulfilled in our daies. And if in such disorder it may be possible, I will observe this order in speaking thereof: first, extortions and exactions: secondly tortures and torments: thirdly, rape and ravishing: fourthly, robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and pillaging: fifthly, bloud-shed and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; sixthly, burning and destroying.

               <p>And that they might have their wills in this kinde, they have called the Magistrates, and Burgers into the State-houses, threatened, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, or otherwise abused them, till they condescended.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Griphenberg,</hi> they kept the Senators shut up in a chamber of the Common-hall, mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and tormenting them so long with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and smoake, that some of them dyed.</p>
               <p>We left in <hi>Heydelberg</hi>-Castle many Burgers to this their mercy; and divers reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who were imprisoned, and fed with bread and water, till the charity of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches could relieve them.</p>

Presently after, they at <hi>Frankendale</hi> surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the towne, upon necessity, could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the articles granted them by the enemy; But were together with the grave Counsellours, and other Electorall Ministers, forced to endure such conditions, as were sitter for slaves and dogs, than men. Some were cast into prison, and there so handled, that many of them dyed through griefe and sorrow. Others, though altogether exhausted, redeemed themselves with unreasonable ransomes. The goods of those that were fled, were confiscated: all the inhabitants, though they were willing to leave their houses, with all their furniture, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the City, and their destruction most cruelly plotted: after like manner have others beene dealt with, contrary to all oathes and promise, yea, contrary to the Lawes of Nations and common faith.</p>

               <p>NOt to insist on these, looke we up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cruelties which the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Souldier hath exercised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the persons of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, without respect of age, sex, dignity, calling, &amp;c.

Whom they thought to have hidden gold or other wealth, they have assayed, by exquisite torments to make them confesse. Yea Princely personages have suffered like cruelty in this kind with meaner folke.</p>
               <p>They have wound and tied about the heads of such, strong matches or cords, and twisted the same till the blood came out of their eyes, eares, and noses, yea, till their eyes started out of their heads.</p>
               <p>They have put and tied burning matches betwixt their fingers, to their noses, tongues, jawes, cheeks, brests, legs, and secret parts.</p>
               <p>Yea those parts which nature hideth, they have either filled with powder, or hung sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chels of powder on them, and so giving fire to the same, they have in horrible manner burst their bellies, and killed them.</p>
               <p>They have with bodkins pierced, yea with knives raced, and cut the skin and flesh of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as some Artificers deale with leather, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stuffe of like nature.</p>
               <p>They have drawn strings and cords thorow the fleshy parts of some, the muscles of their thighs, legs, armes, &amp;c. thorow their noses, eares, lips, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They have hung up some in the smoak, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with small fires, refreshing them sometime with small drinke, or cold water. For these being such as were before overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21850:21"/>
with griefe, they tooke care lest in their torment they should die too soone.</p>
               <p>Some they have put into hot Ovens, and so smothered or burned them. Some they rosted with straw-fires.</p>
               <p>Some have they stifled, strangled or hanged. This was great favour to be ridde out of their paine.</p>
               <p>To many they have bound so hard both hands and feete, that the blood hath sprouted out at the ends of their fingers and toes.</p>
               <p>Of some they have tied both hands and feet back ward together, and stopped their mouthes with clouts to hinder them from praying.</p>
               <p>Some have they hanged up, with ropes fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their privie parts, and hearing their roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cries, have striven to out-roare and drowne their cries as in sport.</p>
               <p>And yet more detestable, where they have found poore weake Creatures troubled with ruptures or burstennesse, they have enlarged the same by villanous meanes, filled them with gunpowder, and blowne them up as a Mine, by giving fire thereunto.</p>
               <p>Many have they trussed up on high, hanging on their feet stones and weights to stretch out their bodies.</p>
               <p>With Jizels or like Instruments they have gone about to plaine the faces of some, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they would make it equall &amp; smooth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:21850:21"/>
Some Housholders have they openly gelded, in the presence of their wives and children.</p>
               <p>The mouthes of some have they opened with gags, and then poured downe their throats, water, stinking puddle, filthy liquids, and pisse it selfe, saying, This is a <hi>Swedish</hi> draught. So growing sicke, and their bellies swelling like a Tun, they have dyed by leysure with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torment.</p>
               <p>Downe the throates of others, they have thrust a knotted clout, and then with a string pulled it up againe, to pull the bowells out of their place, or shew themselves exquisite in such divellish devices. And by these torments, they have made some deafe, or dumbe, others blind, others lame and miserable creples, if they killed them not.</p>
               <p>If an Husband did intreat for the Wife, or the Wife for the Husband, then tooke they the intercessour, and he was tortured by them, after the same manner before the others eyes.</p>
               <p>And (which is almost beyond all credit) when these poore prisoners or patients, were suffering or dying under their hands, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in their anguish, these hellish execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners would command or force them to pray unto the Divell, or call upon him.</p>
               <p>Infinite and unspeakeable are the cruelties, which have this last yeere beene exercised by the furious Souldiers on all sides.</p>

And some devills among them did proceed so farre, that they consulted and devised new and exquisite tortures, which they exercised upon innocent persons. They tooke a Divine, (some write a Canon in those parts, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend old man) stripped him, bound him along upon his backe on a Table, and a strong bigge Cat upon his naked belly. They beat and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Cat to make her fixe her teeth &amp; claws in the poore mans belly. So the Cat &amp; the man, partly through famin, partly through pain and anguish, both breathed their last.</p>
               <p>Some of their despicable and infamous ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery called Croats or Crabats, have laboured much to teach their horses not only to kil men, but to eate humane and Christians flesh, and have consulted how to find out torments more rare, cruell, and exquisite than ever. What shall we say to these devils? <hi>Phalaris, Nero, Dionysius,</hi> all other tyrants and tyrannies, are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to these new stratagematists and engineers. <hi>Cancasus</hi> bred them, tygers fed them, hel taught them, and thither I remit them.</p>

I Have said much of the former Particular, and yet but little. I will now speake little of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing abomination, and (I feare) too much. Rapes and Ravishing scarce to be spoken or heard of, have they committed, beyond all humane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty. Mayds and Matrons, Widdowes and Wives, without distinction have they violated and forced, and that in the presence of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Husbands, Neighbours, &amp;c. Women with child in child-bed, &amp;c. no pen can write it, no faith believe it. No Chappell Church or place consecrated hath beene free from the filthiest of pollutions, or most sacrilegious barbarismes. The very Hospitalls and Bedlame-houses have not beene spared: their divellish madnesse hath there found subjects for their purpose.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hessen</hi>-land, a poore leane Bedlam wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that had beene kept in chaines abóve twenty yeeres, was by these hell-hounds let loose. About her they brought divers others, like her selfe, some madde, some dumbe, all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21850:24"/>
wretched. They tyed their coates about their eares, and so used them as I shame to expresse.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pomeren</hi> they tooke the fairest daughters of the Country-dwellers, and ravished them in the sight of their parents, making them and their friends to sing Psalmes before them all the while.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> I have heard some with teares re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the villanies perpetrated by the Germane troopes of <hi>Gallas</hi> and <hi>Altringer,</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Mantua.</hi> Among the rest, a beautiful maid was by her Parents hid in the dung-hill. But they found her out, had their pleasures of her, then cut her in pieces, hung her quarters up in the Church, and bid her friends pray to the Saints for her succour.</p>
               <p>The Sperenrentrish herse-men (as we came through <hi>Brunswick</hi>-land) tooke by force a young maide ten yeeres old, and carryed her into a wood to ravish her. The mother with upreard hands came running after our Coach, crying out to my Colonell, who was here a stranger without command, and could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her: then saw wee the two horse-men come out of the wood, where they had left the poore child dead or alive I know not.</p>
               <p>Vertuous and chaste women have they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to kill, or throwne their children into the fire, to make them yeeld.</p>
               <p>They have not spared the very Nunnes in

the Cloysters, but after they have entred by force, broken open their Trunkes and Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and taken their goods, they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ravished them, and killed some of them.</p>
               <p>I know the Generall, a troope of whose horse having done the like, hee commanded them all to be hanged, but because they were not all alike guilty, they cast lots for their lives, and every tenth man dyed.</p>
               <p>Some have leaped into rivers, into wells, or killed themselves because they would not be subject to the filthy lusts of these hell-borne furies.</p>
               <p>Not onely sicke and weake maids, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have beene violated till they dyed, but these wretches have committed like filthinesse with the dead bodies.</p>

               <p>NO man can now passe any where in <hi>Dutch</hi>-land; but hee is robbed, stripped, perhaps killed. The Merchants of <hi>Frankford, Nurenberg Lipzig, Hamburg,</hi> &amp;c. have had too wofull experience hereof: witnesse of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite this one instance. The Merchants of <hi>Basil,</hi> returning from the Mart at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and other Faires, to goe to <hi>Shoffehausen,</hi> were set upon by the Imperialists in their lodging, and though they offered to prove themselves Merchants, and craved their lives upon their knees, yet they killed ten of them, saying, they must dye, because they were heretickes. The rest leaving their goods and garments behind, escaped by flight starke naked in the night.</p>
               <p>The very Convoyes which waite on those that travell to guard them are often-times as bad, almost, as a strange enemy. They watch all occasions to take from them what they have, their money and goods, their horses as they goe to watering, or out of the stables in the night, spoyle their Wagons when they make a stand, rifle and strip the meanest persons, if they straggle from the company, and so they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>Two Countesles of great nobility, with their faire daughters and followers in distresse, were entertained by us in the castle of <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> the one immediately before, the other in the time of the siege.

               <p>AS for killing, this is the least of all the rest. Death puts an end to all miseries; onely they that survive are oft-times the worse for want of them that are dead. To report the blood-shed of this warre, would be incredible: <hi>Alsted</hi> saith, that before the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> comming, it had consumed no lesse than 100000. If this be true, what hath it done since? How many millions have miserably perished? They have sometimes killed one another; and among other precedents this is not least remarkable, that <hi>Gourdon</hi> and <hi>Lesley</hi> Scotch Colonells, with Colonell <hi>Butler</hi> the Irish man, who killed <hi>Walstein,</hi> the Count of <hi>Tirskie,</hi> and other Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall officers then ready to revolt to the Swedish party, are now, this yeere after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hurt, or killed themselves (as is written) by <hi>Gallas</hi> his followers, upon a dispute about that former businesse; a Document for all stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to take heede, how they collogue with those monsters, in such dangerous actions, who love the Treason, but hate the Traytor.</p>
               <p>The cruelty of the Souldier towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of those Countries, is inexpressible.

Persons secular and sacred, have had the same measure. Neere <hi>Fryburg, Holck</hi> his souldiers cut in pieces a reverend Minister, a man of rare learning and piety. The dogs would not lick his bloud, nor touch his flesh. So his friends bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his mangled members.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Landshood</hi> in <hi>Bavier,</hi> the souldiers entring by force, killed not only all they found in arms, but the innocent inhabitants, yea, the very Priests kneeling at the Altars; and divers other instances of like nature I could produce.</p>
               <p>Now what may the poore peasant and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-dwellers expect? to kill them if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist or refuse them any thing, is but ordinary in this warre: among the Imperiallists is a base sort of rascally horse-men which serve them, and are called Croats. The tenth part of them are not of that Countrey: for they are a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellany of all strange nations, without God, without religion, and have only the outsides of men, and scarse that too. They make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of murthering men or women, old or young, yea, the very innocent babes; and like the beasts among whom they are bred, doe sometimes eat them, when other food might be found: the poore people have by these beene every where knocked downe in the fields and wayes, slaughtered, stabbed, tortured barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously.</p>
               <p>Their fellow souldiers are not much behind
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21850:29"/>
them having some where left such foot-steps of their cruelty, that there scarce remaine living, to relate the sufferings of the dead. I have seen them beat out the braines of poore old decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid women, as in sport, and commit other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of like nature, which my brevity wil not permit me to relate.</p>
               <p>It is now growne so usuall with the poore people to see one slaine before anothers face, that (as though there were no relation, no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of neighbourhood, kindred or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship among them) none compassionateth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, none cryeth out, oh my father, or oh my brother!</p>
               <p>As for quarter (that is mercy, and the saving of the lives of the vanquished, when they beg it on their knees) the vanquishers have been oft times inhumane. The Croats, till of late, never gave any quarter, but killed whatsoever enemy they had at their mercy. The like did the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins (the regiment of hell) receive pay of them of <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> to bring the nose and ears of their enemies away to their Masters.</p>

FOr burning, pulling down and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Churches, Cities, Villages, the like hath not been heard.

There is now no other aboad, but some campe, no other plow to follow, no other imployment but the warre, for he that is not an actor with the rest, must needes bee a sufferer among the miserable patients. No tilling of the land, no breeding of cattell; for if they should, the next yeare the souldiers devoure it.

FAmine commeth next in place, a thing so grievous, that <hi>David</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the pestilence in his choicy. To see men slaine by the sword, or die of contagious diseases, is not yet so grievous, as to see them dye of famine, or kill to eate one another. In <hi>Samaria</hi> besieged by Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad King of <hi>Syria,</hi> the famine was so great, that an Asses head was sold for 80. pieces of silver, &amp; the fourth part of a cab of Doves dung for 50. pieces of silver. Two women covenanted to eate their children successively: and when they had boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eaten the one, the other woman hid hers. In the siege of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Mice, Rats, and Hides were good meat, and women did dresse and eate their owne children, the smell whereof drew others that were hunger-starv'd to come to share with them. But that Cities not besiged, and a Country naturally fertile, should be so ruined, as not to be able, for so long a time to afford bread to a poore remnant of people, but that they must be faine to eate carrion, yea, dead men, yea, one another living: this is pittifull, this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of.</p>

               <p>Travelling from <hi>Neiustadt</hi> towards <hi>Frankendale</hi> in a snowie day, I met, unexpected, the army of <hi>Duke Bernard,</hi> whose stra ling fore-runners, came riding up to me by couples, and when I looked for a worse errand, asked onely for bread, which my guide gave them, so long as we had any.</p>
               <p>From thence to <hi>Manheime</hi> and <hi>Heydleberg,</hi> many dead men lay strewed on the way, especially on the fire places, which perished through cold and want.</p>
               <p>Before wee were besieged last time in <hi>Heydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> Castle, some of my patients, almost recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of thei diseases, sent mee word, they were dying of famine, as indeed they did, except our canon helped to shorten their miseries. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately shut up, we shot into the towne night and day, almost uncessantly.</p>
               <p>Our souldiers at the first, killed more horses on a day, than they could eate, lest they should famish for want of hay and those they threw out of the Castle, downe the rocke, which the enemy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21850:33"/>
in the night drew into the towne, (though some in so doing were slaine by our shot) and so they eat our horse-flesh, also our Serjeant Major salli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 50. men upon the enemy being 300. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched on the hil on the East side of the castle, and beate them out of their workes. Many were slaine, some broke their necks downe the rocks: but which equalized the victory, the valiant Major was shot dead. Our souldiers being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the trench, fell to ransacke the enemies knapsackes, which they had left behinde them. But there was nothing in them, save our horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flesh, which every day grew scarser with us: so that now we killed the horses which stood fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sleeping on the dung-hill, not out of compassion, but necessity. Another Serjeant Major had two very faire horses shut up our souldiers tooke the one and ate him, he thinking to make sure the other, stapled him to the wall with a strong chaine and a padlocke, but they espying their opportunity, cut off the horses necke, left the head in the chaine, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the body and ate it.</p>
               <p>At length, dogs and carrion came into request, we could smell our meate afarre off, and on the Table it was yet more loathsome, the taste did answer the smell, yet, we ate it savourly, but our bread at last failing, we yeelded to necessity.</p>

               <p>In some Cities, the inhabitans by this famine, have beene constrained to kill all unedible cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, without any difference, and to sell them publikely: as Dogs, Cats, Rats, Mice &amp;c.</p>

AS the sicknesse spreadeth by the contagion of infected bodies, so hath this famine encreased by the neglect of Providence in the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and famished. When no more food was to be got, they were inraged like beasts one against another, and gathering together by troopes, have watched for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the high waies, and so murthered, dressed, and eaten one another. Thenceforth no man could passe safe on the way, or in the streets, except wellarmed, or travelling with a convoy. And some of them have beene taken and severely punished by Justice, neverthelesse they haue secretly lurked here and there, and set upon the passengers, as by many instances, I could shew.</p>
               <p>It is not good to be alone; for where there is company, the one will helpe the other in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse. The hardnesse of these times being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, or rather felt, three maidens at <hi>Odenheim</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:21850:38"/>
in <hi>Dirmbstein</hi> by <hi>Wormes</hi> agreed to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to partake of sweet and sower all alike. But the proverbe is true, that necessity hath no law, and hunger is a sharpe Thorne. So pressed they were with extreame famine, that they sought one anothers lives to save their owne. Two of them conspired together to take away the life of the third, by strangling her in bed or otherwise treacherously to kill her, and after to dresse and eate her up. All which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Then the second resolved to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her companion, and cut off her head, which when shee had done, her heart being hardened, she went to a village called <hi>Ridisheim</hi> to a woman of her acquaintance, called <hi>Margaret,</hi> whose husband was a Farmer, and kept himselfe a way for a time in the towne of <hi>Leyningen.</hi> The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entertained her kindly, rejoycing that shee came yet once to see her. But in the night, lying by the said woman, she cut off her head, bound the dead body upon a board and brought it to <hi>Piedessen,</hi> where she dwelt and drew it into her house. The sharpenesse of hunger pricking her, she had not the patience to cut the body in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but did cut off the head and both the hands onely, and washed and dressed them. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band comming home missed his wife, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for her at the neighbours, who told him that such a maide was seene with his wife. He went to her house, knocked at the doore and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21850:38"/>
her, if she had not seene his Wife. She answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him no. But such deeds of cruelty are hard to be concealed. Murther will out, they say, or the very Bruits will discover it. Hee goes into her house, casteth his eyes round about, pryeth into every corner: at length hee espieth an hand to sticke out of the pot, which hung upon the fire. Hereupon, as overcome with griefe, hee rageth and raileth against the murtheresse, threateneth her with sharpe words, so that she presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and revealed it.</p>
               <p>Then went he to the Justice, and complained. So shee was brought to <hi>Slitzey</hi> with three Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketires. They made her hold the sodden hand in her hand, while she was examined: and so she had her sentence from the Imperiall officers, <hi>Burgrave Philip</hi> of <hi>Waldecke,</hi> and all the Lords of Justice, before the judgement-seat. They deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated long about her punishment, whether she shoule die or no, because some were of opinion, that she did it not as a rationall Creature, but as a brute, because the appetite of food is common to us with beasts. But wickednesse, though neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated, may not ever goe free. Some must be made an example for the terrour of others. She was led to the common place of justice, her head cut off, and her body bound upon a wheele, there to remaine as a spectacle.</p>
               <p>I cannot but write with teares what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.

What Myrmidon, what Dolop, who that beares Armes under harsh <hi>Vlysses,</hi> but his teares Must flow at this relation?</p>
               <p>No man ever hated his owne flesh. But such are the children of our bodies. It is even against nature to destroy such fruite. Yet the sharpnesse of hunger brought this to passe. Oh! what is that necessity which makes us breake stone walls, forget the neerest and dearest relations, vanquish our naturall and most powerfull passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and destroy that which we so dearely loved, so carefully cherished! At <hi>Oterburg</hi> in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate, a widow women dwelling by the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard (her name well knowne) had a daughter of nine or ten yeares old. This child with hunger was growne so faint, that upon a time, with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull eyes, she stedfastly looked upon her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and said, sweete mother, I would willingly die, so I were rid of my paine. Oh! would you make an end of mee, then should I goe from whence I came, or if I did kill you, you would be rid of your paine. The mother looking upon her againe, sighing said, and what wouldest thou do with me? The child answered, very sadly, I then would eat you, for they say that mans flesh is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sweet. The mother fell a weeping, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with her owne thoughts, as a ship tossed and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21850:39"/>
beaten between two rocks, desperate necessity &amp; her motherly affection, catcheth at her head, untyeth her haire-lace, twisteth it about the necke of this innocent lambe, and so strangleth her; when it was dead, shee having nor knife nor hatchet to cut it in pieces, took a spade, and therewith hewed it into boggets, &amp; so dressing the head, and part of the body devoured it. Some part thereof shee sold to her neighbours for foure stivers the pound.</p>
               <p>Her childe being long missed, her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance asked her where it was, and how she came by that flesh. She answered it was hogs-flesh, which she had got of the souldiers, who passed that way. But perceiving the truth would come out, she at last confessed it. Whereupon she was complained of to the justice at <hi>Keysars Lauteren,</hi> and put in prison by <hi>Jonker van Effren,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to an halfe pound of bread, and a kanne of water a day, so to expect her sentence. But being sent for out of prison, and examined by the Lords, she told them she was happy that she was in prison, and would be glad to lie there all her life, to slake her hunger and refresh her selfe with such food, her pricking paine being thereby abated. This so moved the Lords to pitty, that they freed her from prison, and let her goe as innocent.</p>
               <p>I cannot but record another story of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the woman of <hi>Horne-bach,</hi> where was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21850:40"/>
sometime the Princely schoole of <hi>Zwybruck,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lately lyen in childbed and wanting milke to nourish her babe, she kissed and embraced it with moyst teares, and after a long discourse killed it with a knife. Afterwards she dressed and ate it. When it began to be knowne, she was examined before the Justices. The Lords asked her, wherefore she killed her childe. She made answere that mighty and intollerable hunger had made her so to doe, and that it was her owne fruite, of which shee might better make use, than of any other. Neverthelesse she was condemned to die, and accordingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>

His eyes were sunke, his bones stucke out, and hee was so extreme leane, that his sides almost mot together. They carried him alive with them in the coach, and after a few daies he died.</p>

Beyond the Dona, after the <hi>Swedens</hi> departure from thence with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, diseases unheard of, and the Pest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all swept away a world of people. The like happened shortly after, about <hi>Nurenberg</hi> in the high Palatinate, and on the frontiers of <hi>Boheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before Mastreicht, after the Towne was taken, our quarters had contracted infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sicknesses: whereof I my selfe had my share, being left sicke in the Towne of a purple Feaver. But the yeere following both the Towne and Countrey were grievously affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, with Feavers, Fluxes, and the Plague above all.</p>
               <p>The same yeere <hi>Elsas</hi> or <hi>Alsatia</hi> and the lower Palatinate, where the Armies of the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> and the Rhinegrave had lodged, did suffer miserably in this kinde.</p>
               <p>The Army of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having taken <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> and marching towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striche</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> left such infection in great <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> about <hi>Firkens</hi>-ward, that the inhabitants the yeere after were afraid of their owne dwellings.</p>
               <p>About the same time, Generall <hi>Holck</hi> being sent by <hi>Wolstein,</hi> with 6000. to invade <hi>Saxony,</hi> sacked the City of <hi>Leipzick,</hi> and committed as great outrages as <hi>Tillies</hi> Army had done before.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21850:43"/>
But such a pestilence overtooke both him and his, that most of his souldiers dyed like sheepe of the rot. And being infected himselfe, hee offered 600 Rixdollers for a Minister of the Gospell to instruct and comfort him. But both himselfe and his Souldiers had so behaved themselves, that no Minister was to be found. In the meane all his friends &amp; servants forsook him, except his Concubine, who stayed with him to the last. He had beene both of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Protestants party, but revolted from both. So guilty of his owne perfidiousnes, and the execrable murders and rapines that he had caused, hee dyed despairing utterly of all future blisse. At length came a Minister, but <hi>Holcke</hi> was dead before.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Basile</hi> that winter lost above 20000. of the plague. They of the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> their neighbours rejoyced at their sufferings, as being their enemies in religion. But it sell out with them, as with <hi>Edom</hi> in <hi>Obadiah, v.</hi> 15. that mocked <hi>Jacob</hi> in his distresse. The winter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, 1634. the pestilence so raged among the Tridentines, that wee were forbidden to come that way, for the sicke and sound were mixed together, and that City (not great) bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried above 30000.</p>
               <p>Besieged in the Castle of <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> I visited every day divers sicke of the plague, and like diseases. But in neither of these two great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21850:44"/>
plagues in <hi>London,</hi> nor in any other, that I have beene in, did I ever finde the cause so virulent, the symptomes so incorrigible, the disease so incurable. Some dyed raging, others were killed with their carbuncles, when the venome seemed to be expelled from the inward parts, others were swollen and discoloured, as though they had taken poyson, and some that dyed were so spotted, as I never saw the like. If any souldier were but sleightly wounded, presently it became a maligne ulcer, though all good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward meanes, were used. If the infection got into a kindred, it killed parents, children, and almost all the blood, that were present. Whence I perswade my selfe, that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>Toward the end of the siege, wee had made an hospitall in the roofe of the house. But packing out of the Castle, wee left there our sicke, some dying, some crying out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, not to be left to their sicknesse, famine, and death, and which was worse than the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of whom how they were used wee may imagine.</p>
               <p>In the Towne they were much visited before
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21850:44"/>
we were shut up: which could not but be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the multitudes of the enemy.</p>
               <p>In the siege of <hi>Hanaw</hi> were buried, (most of the plague) above 22000 people, and had not God sent that sicknesse to diminish their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they had yeelded the towne through want of victuals.</p>
               <p>In the same siege, Souldiers that went to the guard seeing and well, came off strucken starke blinde thirty at a time. Afterwards the disease falling into their legges, the most of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

THe yeere 1635, almost whole <hi>Germany</hi> felt this punishment, in most grievous wise. In <hi>Swaben</hi> the Countrey of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll,</hi> all along the <hi>Reine,</hi> and the Maine, it was so furiously hot, that all places were alike safe.

               <p>In <hi>Swaben</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Memingen, Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and <hi>Isnen</hi> were utterly consumed, and none left. In the Countrey thereabout, in which were more than thirty thousand men heretofore, were not foure hundred soules to be found.</p>
               <p>In the confines of <hi>Bavier</hi> the living were nothing neere able to bury the dead. But Rats and Mice devoured their carcasses, most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to behold.</p>
               <p>The low Countries smarted sore also. The Universitie of <hi>Leyden</hi> buried thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. The Countrey Villages and the Hague,

(where I was shut up my selfe) were miserably afflicted. The Infant Cardinall was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from <hi>Bruxels</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> the sicknesse did so increase in those places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nimegen, Emericke, Rees, Guelders,</hi> with other places neere, were not onely visited therewith (wherof the Marquesse of <hi>Aytoma,</hi> the Spanish Generall, &amp; other Commanders died) but new contagious diseases, among which were strange Fluxes, and a kind of pox unheard of.</p>
               <p>The Emperours Army dispersing all over for want of resistance, did also scatter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion from their quarters at <hi>Haylbrun,</hi> through the Land of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> that many places here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became utterly depopulated.
