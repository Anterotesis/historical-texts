            <title>A Gospel plea (interwoven with a rational and legal) for the lawfulnes &amp; continuance of the ancient setled maintenance and tenthes of the ministers of the Gospel: proving, that there is a just, competent, comfortable maintenance due to all lawfull painfull preachers and ministers of the Gospel, by divine right, institution, and expresse texts and precepts of the Gospel: that glebes and tithes are such a maintenance, &amp; due to ministers by divine right, law and Gospel: that if subtracted or detained, they may lawfully be inforced by coercive laws and penalties: that tithes are no reall burden nor grievance to the people; the abolishing them, no ease or benefit to farmers, husband-men, or poor people, but a prejudice and losse. That the present opposition against tithes, proceeds not from any reall grounds of conscience, but base covetousnesse, carnall policy, &amp;c. and a Jesuiticall and Anabaptisticall designe, to subvert and ruin our ministers, Church, religion.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From which Texts and words of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt himſelf, it is moſt apparent,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtles, Preachers and Miniſters of the Goſpell are and ought to be diligent, <hi>painfull Labourers</hi> in Chriſts <hi>ſpirituall harveſt,</hi> not idle loiterers.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe at the very ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall inſtitution and firſt miſſion of his 12. <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and after of the 70. <hi>Diſciples to preach the Goſpell;</hi> thrice one after another, expreſly reſolves in poſitive termes; <hi>That they are worthy of their meat, hire, wages, for their Labour in the Goſpell;</hi> and ſo by conſequence, all other lawfull Labouring Miniſters, that diligently preach the Goſpell, are worthy of the like at this day; and neither of them obliged to preach the Goſpell freely without any recompence, as ſome Seducers now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>

for the greater evidence and conviction; who emphatically by way of reaſon applies theſe words only to his Apoſtles and Miniſters, <hi>For the Labourer is worthy of his meat, hire, wages;</hi> they being the moſt divine, excellent, uſefull, neceſſary Labourers of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that in matters of higheſt concernment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation both to God and Men: Therefore of all other labourers they are moſt worthy of a honourable, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, certain hire, ſalary, reward for their ſupport and encouragement.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it followes by neceſſary conſequence, (and let thoſe who are guilty conſider it ſeriouſly in the fear of God with trembling and aſtoniſhment) that the oppoſing, oppreſſing, defrauding the Miniſters of the Goſpell in their deſerved ſetled hire, wages; or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all, or any part of their ancient, juſt, eſtabliſhed Dues, Tithes, or Revenues from them (eſpecially out of covetouſneſſe, ſpite, obſtinacy or malice againſt their very callings) is as great, as crying, as damnable a ſinne, oppreſſion, unrighteouſneſſe; and will bring down as gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Tithes</hi> were paid and vowed to God by the religious <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Aaronicall Prieſt-hood inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, or Leviticall law given, is undeniable by two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſtances: the firſt of them is thus recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>returning victoriouſly from the ſlaughter of</hi> Chederlaomer <hi>and the: Kings that were with him;</hi> Melchiſedec <hi>King of Salem met him, and brought forth bread and wine, and he was</hi> THE PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD: <hi>and he bleſſed him and ſaid, Bleſſed be</hi> Abraham <hi>of the moſt high God, poſſeſſor of heaven and earth; and bleſſed be the moſt high God, which hath delivered thy Enemies into thy hand.</hi> AND HE GAVE HIM TENTHES OF ALL. This Hiſtory is thus recited and amplifyed in the new Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 20. &amp; 7. 1, &amp;c. <hi>Jeſus, made an higb Priest for ever after the order of</hi> Melchizedec <hi>King of Salem,</hi> PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD, <hi>who met</hi> Abraham <hi>returning from the ſlaughter of the Kings, and bleſſed him:</hi> TO WHOM <hi>ABRAHAM</hi> GAVE A TENTH PART OF ALL; <hi>firſt being by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. King of righteouſneſſe, and after that alſo King of Salem, which is King of peace: without Father, without Mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of dayes nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Prieſt continually. Now conſider how great this man was unto whom even the Patriarch</hi> Abraham GAVE THE TENTH OF THE SPOYLES. <hi>And</hi> VERILY <hi>they that are of the Sonnes of</hi> Levi, <hi>who receive the office of the Prieſt-hood,</hi> HAVE A COMMANDEMENT TO TAKE TITHES OF THE PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO THE LAW, <hi>that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loynes of</hi> Abraham: <hi>But he whoſe deſcent is not counted from them</hi> RECEIVED TITHES OF <hi>ABRAHAM, and bleſſed him that had the Promiſes. And without all contradition the leſſe is bleſſed</hi>

                  <hi>of the letter.

For he was yet in the loynes of his Father, when</hi> Melchiſedec <hi>met him. If therefore perfection were by the Leviticall Prieſt-hood, (for under it the people received the Law) what further need was there, that another Prieſt-hood ſhould riſe after the order of</hi> Melchiſedec, <hi>and not be called after the order of</hi> Aaron? <hi>For the Prieſt-hood being changed, there is of neceſſity a change alſo of Law</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhall draw my Obſervations and Arguments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tithes</hi> from both theſe Scriptures recited, and then anſwer the maine (if not ſole) Scripture objected againſt <hi>Tithes,</hi> drawne from the cloſe of the Apoſtles words.</p>

4. This preſident of his, was in all probability the ground of Gods appointing <hi>Tithes, by a ſpeciall Law, for all the Prieſts and Levites MAINTENANCE amongſt the Iſraelites, Abrahams Poſterity,</hi> and the Apoſtle intimates as much, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp;c. <hi>that they receive Tithes of their Brethren in the ſame manner by the Law, as Melchiſedeck did of their Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Now they received <hi>Tithes of Corn, Wine, Oyle,</hi> Cattle and all ſorts of herbs and fruits, for their ſtanding Maintenance and Inheritance too; <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 20. to the end, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. 28.

Therefore it was no reaſon they ſhould pay them over again to Chriſt or his Apoſtles (no more than Papiſts, who pay Tithes in kind againſt their wills unto our Miniſter, though not to their own Prieſts, but onely volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Contribution) whiles their Prieſthood ſtood in force, which they generally ſubmitted to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The totall abrogation of the Leviticall Prieſthood, and Ceremonies by the death of Chriſt, was not <hi>certainly known to, nor reſolved by the Apoſtles and believing Jews or Gentiles, till ſome years ſpace after our Saviours Aſcenſion, as is evident by</hi> Acts 15. in the great caſe of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> about which there was a <hi>Synod</hi> aſſembled by <hi>Pauls circumciſing</hi> Timothy <hi>after this, becauſe of the Jews.</hi> Acts 16. 3. and <hi>purifying himſelf, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his head after the Jewiſh manner, many years afterward</hi> Acts 21. 20. to 28. which he <hi>being a Jew was obliged even then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to avoid ſcandall, but not to the Gentiles.</hi> Therefore Tithes amongſt the Jews, were then ſtill paid to their Leviticall Prieſts, and not to the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="4">4.
