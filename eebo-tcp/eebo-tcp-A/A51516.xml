            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ALGERNOON <hi>Earl of</hi> ESSEX, Viscount <hi>Malden,</hi> Baron <hi>Capell</hi> of <hi>Hadham,</hi> and Lord Lieutenant of the County of Hartford.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE General good Character the World gives of your Honour and Virtues, has embolden'd me to beg your Favourable Protection of this <hi>Comedy</hi>: And though it be a hard matter for so young a Pretender to escape the industrious Ill Nature and Malice of the Town, yet I shall have this satisfaction, that if they'll not allow me a Judge of Poetry, they must of Persons; and they cannot impartially disapprove of my choice in a Patron.</p>
            <p>Indifferent Authors in most Ages have been incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd and preserv'd under the Clemency of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,


<pb facs="tcp:55085:3"/>
in hopes they might be better: But the severity of our Wits would have the first Plays which are now written, equal to the best of <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> or <hi>Shakespear:</hi> And yet they do not shew that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for their Works which they pretend to, or else are not so good Judges as they would be thought: When we can see the Town throng to a <hi>Farce,</hi> and <hi>Hamlet</hi> not bring Charges: But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will be Criticks, and will scarce give a man leave to mend; like the rigid Precepts and manner of the most Famous Master of <hi>Westminster</hi>: Who, though he has bred the greatest Men of Parts and Learning in this Age; yet I believe, if the Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Spirit of his Knowledge could have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the slower Capacities of his Scholars, he might have made many more.</p>
            <p>Poetry, I must confess, has ever been my Delight, as Honour and Goodness, your Lordships. And the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can never expect to be as perfect in the first, as you are in the last; I am sure of two good supports from such Excellencies; and which your Lordship ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver omitted expressing to those who have seek'd your Protection.</p>
            <p>Your early Gallantry for the Liberty and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your Country, in so needful a time (and where


<pb facs="tcp:55085:3"/>
the small number of Volunteers magnifies your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships being one) proves the Spirit of your Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors is left behind 'em: And though this Nation has heartily mourned the loss of one of 'em; Yet the death of a good Subject, like that of a good King, is best dispens'd with by the Publick, when his Virtues shine in his Offspring.</p>
            <p>I would avoid the Censure of Flattery, and of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Lordship with the Commendations which you justly deserve: but perhaps may not desire. I have only this to say, that it is not to be doubted, but the Spirit which has inspir'd this Noble Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of waiting on your Prince, will merit a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to preserve your Person. And as you will be a Credit to his Camp, may you return to be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namemt to his Court. And as you are the Pride of our present young Nobility, may you be a Pattern for the future. Then I shall wish for the fancy of Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> with the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> to express my Sence of your Worth: But in the mean time, I humbly entreat your Lordship would accept of the Hearty well Wishes, and perfect (though distant) Respect</p>

               <l>Hard we have toil'd this Winter for new Plays,</l>
               <l>That we might live in these Tumultuous Days.</l>
               <l>Sad Days for us, when War's lowd Trumpets sound,</l>
               <l>Nothing but Beaux and Parsons will be found:</l>

               <l>WEll, Sirs, is't Peace or War, that you declare?</l>
               <l>I am ready arm'd, so is my Second here.</l>
               <l>If you're displeas'd with what you've seen to Night;</l>
               <l>Behind <hi>Southampton House</hi> we'll do you right,</l>
               <l>Who is't dares draw 'gainst me and Mrs. <hi>Knight</hi>?</l>
               <l>Be kind, Gallants, if you can mercy show,</l>
               <l>Press not the Plant which of it self does how.</l>
               <l>Ladies, your Goodness is our best support,</l>
               <l>The Men must like the Play, if you are for't.</l>
               <l>And sure the Vizards will not cry it down,</l>
               <l>Since our Intrigues resemble still their own,</l>
               <l>Here all your Coquet tricks to th' life are shown.</l>
               <l>Will you take us to answer your desires?</l>
               <l>We look like two kind keeping Country Squires.</l>
               <l>You'll say we are Chits, too slight and little made,</l>
               <l>You'l scarce find larger in this Age, I Gad.</l>
               <l>For such a Pigmy-Race are now <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me up;</l>
               <l>They're but half sprouted, like a second Crop.</l>
               <l>The Fathers Sins are in their Offspring shown,</l>
               <l>And each now Puny Chit's an elder Son.</l>
               <l>Nature disowns the slender half-got Race,</l>
               <l>Every Lath-Carcass, with his small Pigs-face,</l>
               <l>By Art endeavours Nature to out-do,</l>
               <l>And since he can't pass for a Man,'s a <hi>Beaux.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If such as these your favour, Ladies, find,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Knight</hi> and me, as Pages, pray be kind.</l>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Because you won't allow me a Coach, Husband.</p>

                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>And because I won't allow you a Coach with two Horses, you'll have a Boat with four Men?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, a Barge with twelve, if I had my Will: Must I jolt about in a Hackney, or trapes a Foot like my Inferiour Neighbours? Since you'll make no distinction of me at Land, I'll make some my self by Water.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't know what you would have; you go where you please, and come when you please; live how you please, and do what you please; have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as you please, and yet I can never please you!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore I'll have those that can.</p>

                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I suppose you have.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis fit I should; did you not promise me when I marry'd you, I should keep my Coach, and live like what I was?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>A Beggar.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>The best of Quality; but that I credited your Protestations: Did you not swear, I should out-shine the best of all the City, and yet deny me a sneaking 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for a Coach, which almost every Tradesman keeps his Wife for a Twelve-month, tho he break at the Years end for't?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>They deserve it, when their Vanity exceeds their Ability: You took an Oath too, Wife, to Love, Honour, and Obey me; but you have taken your own Measures for all that; you have a Spirit that the Devil cannot Conquer, and a Desire that I cannot satisfie: You make me Ridiculous where ever you come, and seem as if you were asham'd of me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Since you will not use those Methods to gain my Love which you know will do't, I look upon you only as my Conveniency.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I have been a Conveniency to your whole Family: Five hundred pounds your Brother had to buy him a Company, which was broke in two Months; then he set my Prentice at Dice, cheated him of Two hundred pound, which he robb'd me of: And three hundred pound your Father had to purchase a Place at Court, to keep him from his Creditors, which he lost one night at the <hi>Groom-Porters,</hi> and durst never peep out of <hi>Whitehall</hi> since. Indeed you are a

Gentlewoman, and have behav'd your self like one: In less than a fortnight after I married you, you ran away with a Captain of the Guards, and I was forc'd to take you out of his Lodgings with a Messenger; and you have play'd me abundance of pretty tricks since, which my Love and Folly has forgiven: So I have been your Father's Bubble, and your Brother's Cully; the Mark of the City, the Shame of my own Family, and your Cuckold and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me but have a Coach, and I'll live as you'll have me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't think of a Coach, and you will live as I'll have you.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Ingredient, the <hi>Pothecary</hi> keeps his Wife a Coach, and is not worth half so much as you are; besides you have fin'd for Alderman.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, and if I had not fin'd for Fool, in giving your Relations a thousand pound, you might have had a Coach.</p>

                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet would never let me rest till I did it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, let me have a Coach, and I'll save it in other things; I'll catch Cold else every Winter, and it shall cost you as much in Slops; for my Cloaths are so good, and my Shoes are so fine, I cannot walk a Foot.</p>

                  <speaker>Rais.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh Citizens! Citizens! how are the times altered, since your Wives wore High-crown'd Hats, Farendin Gowns, Red-Cloth Petticoats, Spanish-Leather Shoes, and trudg'd about in Pattons: Now your Feet must be furnish'd with a Guiney a pair; your <hi>Milliners</hi> Ware from the <hi>New-Exchange,</hi> the Old can't please you; your Silks bought in <hi>Covent-Garden, Pater-noster Row</hi> has no Choice. We are a pretty Corporation! that are the Metropolis of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, furnish the whole Nation, yet cannot please our selves! like <hi>Vintners</hi> that love to be Drunk in others Mens Taverns! well may we decay, when our Wives, like French Mistresses, send our Money abroad.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Reas.</speaker>
                  <p>If the times are alter'd with the Wives, so they are with the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, since they wore slash Doublets, short Cloaks, and open-knee'd Breeches, with their own thin lank Hair, that look'd like the Fringe of a Blanket, or the strings of a Bunch of Leeks; you can now wear the best Fashion and richest Cloaths, Swords upon occasion; come Drunk to a Play-House; pick up Whores at the Chocolate-House: Be bubled by Sharpers at Ordinaries: Carry a good Face at Change, though within a day of Breaking; take up 3 or 4000 <hi>l.</hi> under pretence of unexpected Bills; whip over to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi>; Bilk your Creditors, and die with the Curse of Orphans and Widows on ye.</p>

                  <p>Well, <hi>George,</hi> if thou art as free from these sins, as thou wert when I left thee, I shall compleat my Travels in thy so wish'd for Conversation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that my curiosity abroad kept me so long from home.</p>

                  <p>Nay, my Lord, I was heartily griev'd my Fortune would not admit of my accompanying your Lordship abroad, but I have been faithful in my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence to your four years Travels, and my Letters never mist of any passages here that were worth your acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Dear <hi>George</hi> I thank thee for 'em; and but that I thought I should soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reach thee than a Letter, I had given thee notice of my arrival; for I came in the Pacquet Boat from <hi>Callis</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> where I took Post to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my self, and so came hither; and had I not met with you, was going to seek you.</p>

                  <p>I am glad this accident prevented that trouble, I was just going to <hi>Greenwich</hi>; but if you please, we'll go back to the Change, pick up an honest fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or two, and dine at the <hi>Rummer</hi> in <hi>Queenstrees</hi>; which, tho' the dearest, is indeed the best accommodated house we can boast of.</p>

                  <p>Faith, my Lord, they are mightily degenerated, since <hi>Strephon</hi> the wise, the witty, and the gay, and the Prince of all Company, as well as all hearts, forsook us: Those that are left of that glorious Society, are retired from the world, and mourn the remembrance of their lost Companions, that Wit and good fellows are as hard to be found, as Conscience in a Jury, or Honesty in a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</p>

                  <p>Well, since those Golden Days cannot be call'd again, we must make the best of our present Insufficiency, and be as happy as we can, tho' not to such perfection. For to tell thee truth, <hi>George,</hi> we have a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Character abroad; and the respect to an <hi>English</hi> man is lessen'd extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; our understanding is become a jest, by our not knowing what we wou'd have; and the next Age must play the Fool within its own bounds, for as the Gent. Usher says in the <hi>Rehearsal, for Politicians no body else will take us.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis a sad truth, my Lord, for our distractions, which we might heal, we strive to enlarge; and our misfortunes abroad are occasion'd by our sollys at home: Our Nobility love their Ease and Pleasure, the Gentry are Careless and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, the Commonalty grumbling and Positive, the Clergy Ambitious and frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and the Mobile mad for an Insurrection.</p>

                  <p>Ay, my Lord, as our Grandfathers were at 50: Youth now keeps Company with Age, and Men with Boys; Vice is so much Improv'd within these ten years, and madness so Pregnant, that within five more our Lads at 12 will begin to Whore and bear Drink, as <hi>Portuguese</hi> Women do Children, and be past it at five and twenty; they're Downright fots at 30, Drivel on till 40, when being fit for nothing but Hospitals, they expire in a Flux, and you read in the Bill of Mortality, they dyed of a Fever.</p>

Well, Virtuous Women, when once they're in love, should never let the man stir out of their sight, till they've made him sure; for we set the Devil a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in 'em; and because we won't comply without Matrimony, they meet while their eager some kind she that has less Grace, which reaps the fruit of our Labour.</p>

                  <speaker>Flor.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, as long as Virtue has any Regard to me. Prithee let us not affect that nicety when we're alone, which we assume in Publick: I confess I would not go beyond the Rules of Honour, and yet I cannot help envying those that do, when I think they enjoy my Lover.</p>

                     <hi>Florella,</hi> a lewd satisfaction is but of a short date; And however Gay or Splendid a Miss may appear for the time she Triumphs, she falls at last as unpityed, as unhappy; for the thoughts in each Man, that every fool who has money is as acceptable as himself, makes the Woman as cheap as the Pleasure.</p>

                  <speaker>Flor.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, do you believe that none of the Women about the Town were ever true to one man?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vio.</speaker>
                  <p>No more than I believe one man is enough for the Women about Town. The vanity that first betray'd 'em, always pursues 'em. Pride makes more Whores than Love. Love ne're made Whores; Conveniency and Lust: Love's pure and chast, the Beauty of the mind, if so allow'd; the Beauty of the mind can ne're abuse the Glory of the Soul: They that can fit contented with their being, will never use base methods to advance it: And I cannot help thinking that she who will be Debauch'd to mend her condition, will afterwards lye with any man that can better it.</p>

                  <p>Why, you must know, my old man has made Love to the Mother this six Months; she has 1200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for her life, which her Husband gave her, not as a Jointure, but generously, when he dy'd; which with my Father's two thousand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> will put 'em into a condition of living without being oblig'd to Relations. But indeed Mrs. <hi>Raison</hi> was the person who first presented me to the Family, for she Boards in the same House with 'em.</p>

                  <p>I think both Sexes are equally to blame in that point; and especially Husbands that carry their handsom Wives to all the publick places about Town, as if men married for the approbation of the World, and not their own likeing: Now, when I drink, I make use of my own Pallet; when I buy any thing, my own Opinion's my guide; and not the perswasions of the Seller.</p>

                  <p>Because they go to learn Wickedness at the one, and Hypocrisie, how to dissemble it, at the other.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you may be sober in a Tavern, if they'l bring you no Wine; but where there's Object, there's Temptation, and where there's Temptation, there's Desire, and where there's Desire, there's Uneasiness, and where there's Uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, there's Impatience to be cured, and when there's Impatience to be cured, Adultery or Fornication's the only Remedy; so the Devil in the end's your Physician.</p>

                  <p>MY dear <hi>Dorinda</hi> Darling of my sences, how sweet is Love after so long an absence; my hours have been as troublesome without thee as they have been delighted in being with thee; nor will I ever travail more for Knowledge; my utmost Study Center'd still in thee; I have wandered like a Child without my Guide, follow'd the Notion of improving Arts, when I had left my Natural Genius here.</p>

                  <p>They do so always when they are encourag'd, but where they are approv'd and know it not, they cannot justly sure be thought the worse of: Errors of Ignorance are most excusable, fools often fancy all that sees 'em Loves, but Prudent men their Imperfections know and give no way to such self-flattery.</p>
