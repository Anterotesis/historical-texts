            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it has in all Ages discouraged some from being Christians to see some of our Professors holy but on one side, and Religion onely hung out; so it has allwayes offended narrow and earthy mindes, to see Christianity happy but on one side: and to observe that whilst it promises its follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Thrones and Scepters, it leaves its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples oftentimes to Shackles and the Crosse. So that Religions Bills and Vndertakings<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63349:5"/>
have beene allwayes thought by some to exceed her Powers, bringing men to the condition of those ships which <hi>Plutarch</hi> saies the <hi>Stoiques</hi> were like, which after their valiant names and Inscriptions of <hi>Lyon, Elephant, Invincible</hi> were notwithstanding torne by common Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, and made the sport of an ordinary wave: But through the Dull Eye or the Evill Eye of the looker on, it hath beene the frequent Fate of things Excellent, to be Things mistook; God cannot thunder downe a Church, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer some Robber of that Church to live and survive the storme and Bolts, but the Epicure streight will say God sits with his Backe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the World, and sees nothing. And if He shines out upon a wicked man, and lookes on upon the ragged virtues of a poore Saint, his mercy shall be called his Sleepe, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence said to be away: Halfe of that being true of the most eminent things which the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iques</hi> said of the best men, <hi>That they can neither quickly bee, nor quickly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63349:5"/>
Hence is it, that Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse proposed as removed &amp; future things, make so shallow impressions upon carnall harts: as spirituall substaunces are of so fine and subtile an essence, that to them the Eye it selfe is but a lid: so spirituall promises, evident onely to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall minds, are wrapt &amp; undiscovered to a Naturall &amp; an eye <hi>born but once.</hi> Thus Afflictions which to the wicked are Miseries, to Gods Children appeare a kind of severe and not prayed for blessings, and the rougher sort of Love: and since they are meant onely as Cures, &amp; are at once both Wound &amp; Balsam, the faithfull are taught to number their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by their stripes, and call whips Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>David</hi> sometimes a man of so sad and throwne downe a condition, that he wept his owne Meales, (<hi>I have made my teares my meat</hi>: Psal. <hi>42</hi>) Yet is often found <hi>awaking his Lute;</hi> his different dayes were so divided betwixt the Coale and the Chalke, that in one <hi>David</hi> there seemes to be above one man: and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63349:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the Variety of his condition we may looke upon the Prophet, as we did on our Saviour that was of his Line, not as a Man but Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Yet through an even chearefullnesse he will never let his sufferings be sufferings, but seemes to looke downe upon the properity of the wicked, and reckon all delights that are showrd from the Spirit, among those things which are to be pittied, saying to God himselfe, <hi>Thou hast put Gladnesse in my heart, more then when their Corn and their Wine increased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are <hi>Davids</hi> acknowledgment of a double bounty: first, of his being favourd; <hi>Thou hast given mee Ioy</hi>: Secondly, of his being preferr'd, <hi>Thou hast given me more Ioy.</hi> Call them (if you please) <hi>Davids</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. <hi>(Thou hast given mee Ioy)</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Triumphs there is usually some Insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, some Captivity and sadnesse, here is <hi>Ioy, more then theirs; Corne</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> They
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63349:6"/>
have, not Perfect <hi>Gladnesse,</hi> which is the Oile within, and Wine to the Wine; That without which Corne and plenty is onely had, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd; and a full harvest is no more the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters then 'tis the Barns; The godly hath mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy lights of gladnesse cast from the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods private favours; The prosperous villaine has some dilute rayes of Blessings, but not his <hi>Countenance;</hi> So that as the Earths best and upper parts are Inlightened, but it's Riches, it's Mines lye below and shaded; So the Best men receive from heaven the most Comforts, though not the most of those Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which make men rich. The Text then (as those Schemes which are made to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the body of the Earth) has two sides, A light one, and a shaded. The light side con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the Godly mans condition here in this life, <hi>Ioy, [Thou hast given me Ioy.]</hi> Ioy Positively, and Ioy Eminently, <hi>More Ioy;</hi> The shaded side has the condition of the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing wicked man, (if it be flourishing to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63349:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grow up and thrive to the fire) Some Gladnesse or shadow of Gladnesse they have from their <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> Lastly, the Pencill that drawes both these sides, Gods favour; <hi>Thou hast put into my heart,</hi> great and <hi>more gladnes,</hi> Into theirs, Thin and Narrow and some Gladnesse, <hi>when their Corne and Wine Increase.</hi> I begin with the Godly mans Condition in this life, positively conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 'tis a Ioyfull Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He that said that all villany contained a kind of Iustice in it, and wickednesse carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much of the Magistrate, that it punishes every offender it makes such, and torments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very conscience, which it staines, might have said, that vertue is the other halfe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and rewards those that entertaine it. Not that it layes up and sowes Recompence, but makes every good Act crowne to it selfe, and sheds a present delight wheresoever she resides; So that Righteousnesse naked and it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63349:7"/>
selfe, is a rich satisfaction to it's owner, and he that nourishes Goodnesse, reapes it; Such a serenenesse and Calme of thoughts, (pardon me if I say) such a <hi>prospect within,</hi> there is in an innocent and swept Breast, that as <hi>Origen</hi> is said to have thought Hell no more then a gald and eaten conscience, So some wise Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have thought Happinesse nothing but a cleane one; and therefore they have sent the vertuous no further for their Happiness then to their vertues, &amp; bid them only look into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and be paid. So that Heathen who said, <hi>Drunkenes rewarded vertue,</hi> meant mirth and Content, and was but a Divine of a course Metaphor; for if he understood a serenity ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Contemplation of an humble and harmelesse soule, he might easily be corrected to this Christian Truth, that <hi>a good conscience is a Perpetuall Feast,</hi> and the Prophet might have found in the righteous what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them to (in the <hi>32 Psal. vers. ult.</hi>) <hi>Rejoyce ye Righteous &amp; shout for Ioy,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63349:8"/>
all ye that are Vpright of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is too unconfin'd, too common a Ioy to be the Godly's Portion. This is an Almes of mirth, and a Gladnesse given at doore; those of Gods Family have better Provision, holier and lesse humane Comforts; Vertues lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may cheare a heart, but Graces contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted anoint and crowne one; Christian Ioy the earnest of that to come being of the same met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall with the whole summe, and as Heavenly as what it represents: God sayes not to the Temperate man, Thou hast held out against the Nets and Traps which that Painted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lookt, therefore thou shalt stand faire and cleare in mens Memories and Reports; Thou hast refused so many Bowles, therefore thou shalt scape so many fits, and in flying Taverns hast onely abstained from the Dropsie; Nor sayes He to the Loyall man, Thou hast in an unperjur'd Obedience allwayes liv'd under the Crowne, Thou hast not made thy Humour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63349:8"/>
nor thy Fancy thy Scripture, nor tyed thy faith to the Ignorance and devout Bad faces of the Seditious Lectturer, therefore the discerning part of the nation and the Kingdomes Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall crowne thee with the brave name of Good Subject, and that's thy Comfort; Nor saies he to the Liberall man, Thou hast feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee in the Poore, therefore all the Bread thou hast given mee in the Porch, I will send thee backe in full Harvests, and all thy Water in Balmy and desir'd showres, and that's thy Gladuesse. God has reserv'd richer comforts for his servants. What a Treasure, what a Mine is that Text? <hi>The Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (Lamentat. <hi>3.</hi>) How much weightier then all those lower halfe Solaces, which stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Soules and Minds that obey their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, can call Delights; And that's the second ground of the Godly Mans Ioyfull Condition, a grounded confidence of Gods Favour. That a just man should expect Protection and Smiles from his God, is the whisper of naturall reason,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63349:9"/>
it being congruous to the Divine nature (whose Image we are in this too) to affect and cherish what is most like it selfe. So that every Good man is the care and charge of the Almighty, by whom he is look't upon, not with that publicke love which he allowes his whole masse of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but with a peculiar countenance, such as we cast upon Alliance and Kindred; Now what an extracted comfort is it, to looke upon ones selfe as the darling of heaven, one whom Devills onely aime at, cannot hit; and whilest <hi>All things worke together for his good,</hi> (Rom. <hi>8.</hi>) to be the man on whose side his very Enemies Rage and Afflictions serve under. To behold ones selfe as a thing arm'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity as a holy kind of Magicke, and see ones selfe as 'twere inchanted with Gods favour to a state secure from all that malice can dart. There is a malignant delicacy, by which, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and sufferings are made things of delight; and it has beene a perverse pleasure in men, to stand unconcern'd lookers on upon a Perishing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63349:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Army, or a sinking Fleet; I doe not say that the righteous man is glad so cruelly, that his delights are so much his Crimes, and Ruine his Recreation; Yet certainly (without losse of innocence) he does rejoyce with a Kind of Pitty at the Iudgements that fall only about him, not as they are his Enemies, but as they are not his owne: and devout persons are read to have sung their Enemies destruction, (<hi>Then sang Deborah Iudg. 5.</hi>) Not out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd and Womans Insultation, but a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Ioy for the favour of a delivery. If the <hi>Roman Conquerours</hi> could scarce stand under their owne Laurells, and Ioy'd so vehemently over a fir'd Towne or two, or a few chain'd <hi>Germans,</hi> that their Triumphs were not their least dangers; So that there has beene an Officer by, to tole them some cold &amp; sad sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to keepe them within themselves, and hinder transportation, Can you thinke a Good man can triumph lesse over his fetterd Flesh, and Corruptions. And when he shall see <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63349:10"/>
the <hi>Devill,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, and bound with distinct shackles, which his Graces and Integrity have fyled. Beleeve it, for Ioy there's no Throne to the neck of a Lust; No Triumph to a subdued affection. Thinke then what an unmeasur'd felicity 'tis to be absolute, and ones owne, not commanded by a Vice; of a soule smooth and without a wave; and then to be smil'd upon by that God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose leave nothing can hurt, who must consent before Poison can be more fatall then Cordials, who is so farre Master of all that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends power, that all punishing Evill is but his Commissioner; and Afflictions are Afflictions under Him, to have the Affection of Him to whose love the Best and Patterns of Mothers compar'd are cruell (<hi>Mothers may forget,</hi> saith he himself) and the most naturall Heart a Rock, that has bid his little flocke not feare; and since he has dy'd for his Children, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will not sleepe against them, (<hi>He that keepeth</hi> Israel <hi>does not</hi> so much <hi>as slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63349:10"/>

and therefore suppos'd in reverence to such glorious Bodies, to be too excellent for change; So the Christian most roundly evinces all good Things to flow from God, because they are Good; For as Gods will is the reason of his doing, so his doing is the reason of any things being Good; Goodnesse being a notion of a double face, which lookes not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to some Will which may affectt it, but backward too, to the Divine Minde to which 'tis already squar'd; <hi>Every good and perfect gift</hi> (that is indeed every Guift) saies Saint <hi>Iames, comes from above.</hi> All thy Parts are Rayes and Beames from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all thy Graces Influences; Thy Strength is dropt downe from the God of <hi>Hosts,</hi> and thy Wit from the God of <hi>Lights</hi>; Not thy Acres, but the Blessings uppon them fill thy Barnes, and the fruits of thy ground may rather be said to Rebound from the Earth, then to Come: Call not thy Exact and measured Shape the worke or Chance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

Thy Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls are not the Births of thy sweat and Candles, but God hath shed a bigger Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon thy Soule, to try whether thou wilt improve it in a diffusive Communication, or bury it in a sullen and unactive Contractednes; whether thou wilt Plant upon thy naturall Powers by Industry, or in a lazy presumption
