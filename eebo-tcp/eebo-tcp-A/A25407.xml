            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The occaſion taken for the malicious Proſecution, on pretence of Perjury, was from an Anſwer of Sir <hi>Humphrey Edwin</hi>'s in Chancery, to a Bill of Mr. <hi>Matthew Johnſon</hi>'s: And the true State of the Controverſy between them is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Hall</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> about <hi>March</hi> 1687/8, being indebted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thouſand Pounds to Sir <hi>Humphrey Edwin,</hi> offered him divers Securities for the ſame, and amongſt the reſt a Leaſe in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> which he had contracted for with the Truſtees of the Queen Dowager, in the Name of <hi>Matthew Johnſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> paying two hundred and ſixty Pounds Fine, Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> accepting thereof, and going with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> to Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Chambers in the <hi>Temple;</hi> The ſaid <hi>Johnſon</hi> acquainted them he had made ſome Proceedings therein already for Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and had uſed his own Name in truſt for him therein. And he ſaid that he had disburſed about twelve Pounds, which would be loſt if the Contract was to be new entred in Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Name, he therefore propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proceed to perfect the Leaſe in his own Name, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when he had finiſhed it, he would Aſſign it over to Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> then directed. Thereupon Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> empolyed him as a Truſtee, and gave him a Note for the 260 <hi>l.</hi> Fine that was to be paid to the Queen Dowager's Treaſurer. And alſo gave him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> Five Guineas for a Fee, deſiring him to haſten the Diſpatch of the Writings.</p>
            <p>The Leaſe being finiſhed, Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> aſſigned part of the Tenements contained in the Leaſe to one Mr. <hi>Knowleſly</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> that were Tenants thereof, and who were to pay for the ſame above 300 <hi>l.</hi> and he promiſed Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> that as ſoon as Mr. <hi>Knowleſly</hi> returned the Money out of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> it ſhould be paid to him. And Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> then drew an Aſſignment of all the Remainder of the Leaſe from himſelf and Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> to Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> Sealed and Executed at a Tavern with other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> giving Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> a Receipt for 300 <hi>l.</hi> on the back of the Deed, as the Conſideration thereof. And Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> being only a Truſtee, the Conſideration men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Deed to him was only five Shillings, and the Deeds of Aſſignment were drawn by Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> himſelf. But he failing to come and Seal at the Tavern where Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> Sealed, Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> called in a Day or two at his Chambers for the ſaid Aſſignment, and ſome other Writings: And then, and never before, Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a Debt due to him from Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> of 250 <hi>l.</hi> which he pretended was to be paid out of the ſaid Leaſe, ſo he refuſed then to Seal. But upon Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Application to Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> ſatisfied Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> promiſing to clear all Accounts with him. And then Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and ſoon after Sealed the ſaid Aſſignment. And Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> a Day or two after his Sealing gave him twelve Guineas, beſides the aforeſaid five Guineas, for his Fees, Care, Pains, and Diſpatch in the ſaid Buſineſs. At which time, they being both going into the Countrey and taking leave one of another, Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> called his Clerk <hi>Francis Sambrook</hi> to them, and bid him look out and deliver Sir <hi>Humphrey Edwin</hi> his Writings whenever he called or ſent for them.</p>
            <p>But when Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> called for the ſaid Deeds, though Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi> delivered them to him, and with him exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them, and ſaw Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> give them to his Servant and ſend him to Sir <hi>Francis Winington</hi>'s for one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Deeds that was found to be wanting: And Mr. <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> had alſo received two Guineas for his Pains, and 5 <hi>l.</hi> odd Monies for ingroſſing the Writings, yet when Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi>'s Servant was ready to go away with the ſaid Deeds, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi> then pretended that he had Directions from his Maſter to demand 250 <hi>l.</hi> of Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> for Mr. <hi>Hall</hi>'s Debt, and to detain the Writings unleſs Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> gave a Note for that Money. But he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> gave any ſuch private Orders, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Truſt, and Promiſe, and Orders openly given to <hi>Sambrook;</hi> ſo Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Servant would not deliver back the Writings which his Maſter had paid for, and given him, but carried them home,</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> returned out of the Countrey, Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> demanded of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And thereupon croſs Bills in Chancery were preferred by Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> And upon a Pretence that Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> had not truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Bill, the Malice of ſome Conſpirators picked out ſeveral Paſſages, which they hoped to falſify by ſome Witneſſes; and thereupon took the Confidence to deviſe this Indictment of Perjury, which Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> hath often proteſted to have been done without his Deſire or Privity.</p>
            <p>The pretended Falſhoods in Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Anſwer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Indictment, were as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>John Hall</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> gave in evidence, that he had ſo good an Opinion of Sir <hi>Humphrey Edwin,</hi> that he reſolved to put all he had into his Hands for his Security, and among other things, the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Leaſe in queſtion: That it was about the Year 1687, when he did firſt acquaint Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> that he had agreed with the Truſtees of the Queen Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Leaſe, paying two hundred and ſixty Pounds fine; and that if he pleaſed, he ſhould have it as a Security, paying the two hundred and ſixty Pounds fine. Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> accepted it, and went with him to Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Chamber, and he acquainted him of their Agreement: Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> anſwered, he had already made ſome Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings therein to take the ſaid Leaſe in his own Name, upon which he had expended about twelve Pounds; that if he ſhould now begin again, and take it out in Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Name, all that Money would be loſt: and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to ſave time, that he might take the ſaid Leaſe in his own Name, which would ſave Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> twelve Pounds; and that he would afterwards aſſign it to Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> All which Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> did conſent to, and gave Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> a Note to pay the two hundred and ſixty Pounds fine to Queen Dowager.</p>
            <p>My Lord Chief Juſtice asked Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> if Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> was to have the Benefit of the ſaid Leaſe, and if it was only taken in Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Name, to ſave 12 <hi>l.?</hi> Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> replied, Yes it was. And Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> being further asked, who was to pay Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> his 250 <hi>l.</hi> and whether Sir <hi>Hump<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Mr. <hi>Hall</hi>'s Debt; and bid him give him his Money back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which he had paid the Queen Dowager for the Fine. So Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> gave him a Note for the two hundred and ſixty Pounds. But he going with Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> the next day to Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s, and being concerned that he ſhould obſtruct the ſealing of the Leaſe to Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and he promiſing to pay Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> what he owed him in a ſhort time, Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſaid to Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> Give me my Note of two hundred and ſixty Pounds, and I will ſeal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> gave Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> his Note of 260 <hi>l.</hi> and they were all pleaſed, and parted ſatisfied.—Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> was again asked, if this Leaſe was not a Security to Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and how he did intend to ſatisfy him? Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> anſwered, Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> did ſhew him a Writing under his Hand, which he had forgot, wherein he was to have this Leaſe, and the Equity of Redemption of the Mannor of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for ſecurity of what he owed him.—But he deſired Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> that he would not hinder the executing of the ſaid Deeds to Sir <hi>Hamphrey <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> up to ſee if Mr. <hi>Francis Sambrook</hi> was in the Chamber; and he came and told Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> he was; ſo they went up together: Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Sambrook,</hi> if he had got his Writings ready; and after a little time, he went and fetched them, and delivered them to Sir <hi>Humphrey;</hi> and he looked them over, and examined them with Mr. <hi>Sambrook:</hi> and Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> miſſing the Grand Deed from the Queen Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the Lands in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi> told him, it was with Sir <hi>Francis Winington.</hi> He was then ſent for it; but Sir <hi>Francis</hi> not being in his Chamber, he came back and told them, he could not have it, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> not being within. And Mr. <hi>Tolſon</hi> alſo declared, That Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> wrote the Letter (which Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi> had before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) at Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi>'s Requeſt, he before having acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> that he was going down to <hi>Hereford;</hi> the ſaid Letter being writ, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Sambrook,</hi> to Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Brother in <hi>Hereford,</hi> to entertain him kindly, for which Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi> thanked Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Sambrook</hi> afterwards gave Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> a Bill for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing ſeveral Writings; and Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> paid him about five Pounds, or five Guineas, he knew not which. And going on, he was ſtopp'd; and,</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice ſaid, Here are Circumſtances alledged to ſhew the Truth of what is teſtified; The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings examined,—one of the Deeds wanting, and Money paid for ingroſſing the Deeds: Where is this Perſon that ſwore juſt now, and mentioned none of them? <hi>Francis Sambrook</hi> came again into Court, and confeſſed, as Mr. <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had depoſed, that the Deeds were examined, and the Grand Deed was at Sir <hi>Francis Winington</hi>'s Chamber, where he had left it by Miſtake; and Sir <hi>Francis</hi> not being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he afterwards got it. And he confeſſed that he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive five Guineas of Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> for ingroſſing the Deeds.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice appearing diſpleaſed that none of theſe Circumſtances were mentioned or owned before by <hi>Francis Sambrook,</hi> he put himſelf back out of the Court in a Heat.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice ſeeming to be diſpleaſed at the Indictment, did not deſire to hear more of the Matter, or any more Witneſſes for Sir <hi>Humphrey Edwin,</hi> he having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times expreſſed his diſlike of the Proceedings.—And the Earl of <hi>Berkly</hi> teſtifying much for the Reputation of Sir <hi>Humphrey;</hi> and then ſome of the Counſel againſt Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſaid, that they did not queſtion Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Reputation. But the Lord Chief Juſtice was pleaſed to anſwer, What! not queſtion his Reputation, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him of Perjury?</p>
            <p>My Lord therefore ſhortly ſummed up what was depoſed on both Sides. And the Jury being together a very little time, acquitted Sir <hi>Humphrey Edwin</hi> of the ſaid Indictment.</p>
            <p>If the Court had not been ſo ſatisfied, that it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there was no pretence for the Indictment, Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> had Witneſſes ready in Court to have proved the truth of the whole Caſe, as it is before ſtated, and of all the Matters before-mentioned, that were alledged by his Counſel in his Defence.</p>
            <p>There were Witneſſes to prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> deſired that the Leaſe from the Queen Dowager might be taken in his Name, in Truſt for Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> to ſave Charges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> paid the Fine to the Queen Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the Leaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> gave Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> five Guineas, and twelve Guineas for his Pains in the Buſineſs, and his Clerk two Guineas.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Conſideration of Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s aſſigning, was expreſſed to be no more than five Shillings, by his own Hand.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> after he had tried to have drawn Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> to have paid Mr. <hi>Hall</hi>'s Debt to him of 250 <hi>l.</hi> out of the ſaid Leaſe, did then promiſe to perfect the Deed, and was content with Mr. <hi>Hall</hi>'s Promiſe to pay him the Money due from him.</p>
            <p>And it was proved by the Witneſſes ſworn, that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſealed, and freely delivered the Deeds to the Uſe of Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi> This and much more would have been te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, which would have been great Aggravations of the Malice of thoſe that formed the Indictment againſt Sir <hi>Humphrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. His Witneſſes were alſo ready to have proved that ſome of the Conſpirators againſt his Reputation, did indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly publiſh, That an Indictment of Perjury was found againſt him, whilſt it was only deſigned, and not found: And that Money was offered to a News-writer, to have it inſerted in his News-Paper, to paſs into all the Kingdom. And,</p>
            <p n="7">7. That two Members of Parliament came to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman in the <hi>Pell-Mell,</hi> and deſired her to go to Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Edwin,</hi> and adviſe him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o withdraw his Petition in Parliament againſt Sir <hi>Bazil Firebraſs</hi> his ſitting there, for that if he did not, there would be an Indictment preferred againſt him for Perjury. And they doubted not of a Jury that would find it, ſaying, that he might avoid it, if he pleaſed to withdraw his Petition for his Election, or Words to that effect.</p>
            <p>But the Court ſeemed to think it a loſs of Time to hear more Witneſſes for Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> ſince there was no cauſe nor colour for the Indictment. Therefore he would not tire out the Court with needleſs Evidences, but reſerve ſome of the Witneſſes until he ſhall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
