            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

short a time it hath increased, that the very depth of its intricacy is found out; for within these Fifty or Sixty years last past, <hi>Changes</hi> were not known, or thought possible to be <hi>Rang:</hi> Then were invented the <hi>Sixes,</hi> being the very ground of a <hi>Six score:</hi> Then the <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>Twenty-four,</hi> with several other <hi>Changes.</hi> But <hi>Cambridge Forty-eight,</hi> for many years, was the greatest <hi>Peal</hi> that was <hi>Rang</hi> or invented; but now, neither <hi>Forty-eight,</hi> nor a <hi>Hundred,</hi> nor <hi>Seven-hundred and twenty,</hi> nor any Number can confine us; for we can <hi>Ring Changes, Ad infinitum.</hi> Although <hi>Philosophers</hi> say, <hi>No Number is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, because it can be numbred</hi>; for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> is a quantity that cannot be taken or assigned, but there is (<hi>infinitum quoad nos</hi>) as they term it, that is <hi>infinite</hi> in respect of our apprehension: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Ringers</hi> knowledge may seem <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> to dive so <hi>infinitely</hi> into such an <hi>infinite</hi> Subject; but least my Discourse should be <hi>infinite,</hi> I will conclude it, and proceed to the <hi>Peals</hi> following.</p>
               <p>Before I Treat of the method and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Peals,</hi> I think it not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to speak something of the <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>

wherewith a <hi>Young Ringer</hi> ought to be qualified, and then proceed to the <hi>Peals. First</hi> then, before he is entred into a <hi>Company,</hi> it is presupposed, that he is able to <hi>Set a Bell Fore-stroke and Back-stroke,</hi> as the terms are: Next, that he know how to <hi>Ring Round,</hi> or <hi>Under-sally:</hi> Then, that he may be complete, it is convenient, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Tuning of Bells</hi>; for what is a <hi>Musitian,</hi> unless he can <hi>Tune</hi> his <hi>Instrument,</hi> although he plays never so well? To do which, let him learn on some <hi>Instrument,</hi> or <hi>Wyer-Bells,</hi> to know a <hi>Third, Fifth,</hi> and <hi>Eighth,</hi> which are the principal <hi>Concords:</hi> Or otherwise, let him get a <hi>Pipe</hi> called a <hi>Pitch-pipe,</hi> which may be made by any <hi>Organ-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> to contain <hi>eight Notes,</hi> or more, (according to his pleasure) with their <hi>Flatts</hi> and <hi>Sharps,</hi> which will be very useful in the <hi>Tuning of Bells.</hi> And then this is a general Rule, begin at the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> or <hi>biggest Bell,</hi> and count 3 <hi>whole Notes,</hi> then a <hi>half Note,</hi> or <hi>Sharp,</hi> 3 <hi>whole Notes,</hi> then a <hi>half Note,</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi>; and so on, until you come to the <hi>least Bell</hi> or <hi>Treble.</hi> For example on <hi>four Bells,</hi> 1:234, here the 432 are <hi>whole
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100085:7"/>
Notes,</hi> and the <hi>half Note</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi> is between 1 and 2. On <hi>Five Bells,</hi> 12:345 the 543 are <hi>whole Notes</hi>; and the <hi>half Note</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi> is between 2 and 3. On <hi>Six,</hi> 123:456 the <hi>half Note</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi> is between 3 and 4. On <hi>Eight Bells,</hi> 1:2345:678, one <hi>half Note</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi> is between 5 and 6 and the other between 1 and 2. On <hi>Ten,</hi> 123:4567:8910; here one <hi>half Note</hi> is between 7 and 8, and the next between 3 and 4. On <hi>Twelve Bells,</hi> 12:345:6789:10 11 12. Here one <hi>half Note</hi> or <hi>Sharp</hi> is between 9 and 10, the next between 5 and 6, and the other between 2 and 3, which last is made contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rule, it being but <hi>two whole Notes</hi> from the next <hi>half Note</hi> to it; the reason is this, the <hi>Ninth</hi> is one <hi>whole Note</hi> below the <hi>Eighth,</hi> therefore the 2 must be a <hi>whole Note</hi> below the <hi>Treble,</hi> otherwise they would not be a true <hi>Eighth,</hi> therefore the <hi>half Note</hi> is put between 2 and 3.

                  <hi>First,</hi> I <hi>hunt</hi> up the <hi>third</hi> over the <hi>fourth</hi>; the <hi>Hunt</hi> being up, I make an <hi>extream</hi> between the <hi>treble</hi> and <hi>second,</hi> and then <hi>hunt</hi> down the <hi>third</hi> again, as in these <hi>changes,</hi> which course is to be observed to the end of the <hi>Peal.</hi>

               <p>I have insisted the longer upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the <hi>Twenty-four changes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the ground and method in <hi>Ringing</hi> all <hi>plain changes</hi>; and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding this aright, the Learner will more easily apprehend the course of all <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>single changes</hi> whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Twenty-four plain changes</hi> are to be <hi>Rang</hi> sixteen several wayes; in <hi>hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> one Bell, it is to be <hi>Rang</hi> four ways; that is, two wayes in <hi>hunting</hi> it up, and the other two wayes in <hi>hunting</hi> it down, (as appears in my directions before in <hi>hunting</hi> the <hi>treble:</hi>) so that in <hi>hunting</hi> the 4 Bells, 'tis to be <hi>Rang</hi> 4 times 4 wayes, which makes 16, some of which I have here set down.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Plain Changes</hi> on five Bells.</head>
               <p>There are <hi>Six-score Changes</hi> to be <hi>Rang</hi> on <hi>five Bells,</hi> which are to be <hi>Rang,</hi> by observing a <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> a <hi>half Hunt,</hi> and <hi>three Extream Bells</hi>; the course of the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> is the same with the <hi>Hunt</hi> in the <hi>Twenty-four Changes,</hi> and <hi>hunts</hi> up and down in the same manner. The <hi>half Hunt</hi> moves once, that is, over one Bell eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> comes before and behind the Bells; but when the <hi>half Hunt</hi> is removed either before or behind the <hi>Extream Bells,</hi> then there is an <hi>Extream Change</hi> to be made. For Example, I make the <hi>Treble</hi> the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> and <hi>hunt</hi> it up; and the <hi>Second</hi> the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> and <hi>half hunt</hi> it up, making every <hi>Extream Change</hi> between the two farthest <hi>Extream Bells</hi> from the <hi>half Hunt</hi>; the <hi>Extream Bells</hi> are the <hi>Third, Fourth, Fifth:</hi> Now observe, that whereas in the <hi>Twenty-four Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> an <hi>Extream Change</hi> was alwayes made, when the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> came before or behind the <hi>Bells,</hi> in these <hi>Six-score

               <p>The last is the <hi>Extream Change,</hi> which is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fifth</hi>; and this course is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the end of the <hi>Six-score

               <p>Another short Example I will insert, which is <hi>Second</hi> down, and <hi>Fourth</hi> up, (for that is the common Phrase amongst <hi>Ringers</hi>) whereby 'tis alwayes to be observed, that the first Bell which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> and the second that is named, is the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may perceive; where <hi>Second</hi> down, is meant, that the <hi>Second</hi> Bell is the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> and to <hi>hunt</hi> down the first <hi>Change</hi>; and the <hi>Fourth</hi> Bell is the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> and to <hi>half hunt</hi> up, that is, to move up towards the hindmost Bell the first time it moves at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Peal</hi>; which are only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in making the first <hi>Changes,</hi> for one <hi>whole Hunt</hi> and <hi>half Hunt</hi> may be hunted several wayes, either up or down at pleasure.

               <p>Now the <hi>Fourth,</hi> which is the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>Extream</hi> Bells, the next is to be an <hi>Extream Change,</hi> which may be made either between the two far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest Bells from the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> or the two nearest to it; and after the <hi>Extream Change</hi> is made, the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> and <hi>half Hunt</hi> must be <hi>hunted</hi> as before. These <hi>Six-score Changes</hi> of <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi> I have set down at large, at the end of my directions to these <hi>Changes</hi> on five Bells.</p>
               <p>In every <hi>Six-score,</hi> the <hi>Extream Changes</hi> may be made either between the two farthest <hi>Extream</hi> Bells from the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> or between the two nearest to it, observing to make all the <hi>Extreams</hi> in one <hi>Six-score</hi> alike; that is, if you make the first <hi>Extream Change</hi> between the two farthest <hi>Extream</hi> Bells from the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> you must make all the following <hi>Extreams</hi> in the same <hi>Six score</hi> between the two farthest <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100085:17"/>
Bells also; or if you make the first <hi>Extream</hi> in any <hi>Six-score</hi> between the two nearest to the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> you must make all the following <hi>Extreams</hi> in the same <hi>Six-score</hi> between the two nearest also.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Six-score</hi> plain and single <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> are to be <hi>Rang</hi> Eight-score several wayes; for although there are but <hi>Six-score</hi> several <hi>Changes</hi> on five <hi>Bells,</hi> yet by altering the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> the <hi>half Hunt,</hi> and <hi>Extreams,</hi> the course of the <hi>Changes</hi> are so altered, that the same <hi>Changes</hi> doe not come all along toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any two of those Eight-score wayes.</p>
               <p>With one <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> and <hi>half Hunt,</hi> the <hi>Six-score Changes</hi> are to be <hi>Rang,</hi> or set down eight several wayes; one way, is by <hi>hunting</hi> the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> and <hi>half Hunt</hi> both up; the second way, is by <hi>hunting</hi> the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> and <hi>half Hunt</hi> both down; the third way, is in <hi>hunting</hi> the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> up, and the <hi>half Hunt</hi> down; the fourth way, is by <hi>hunting</hi> the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> down, and the <hi>half Hunt</hi> up; each of these four wayes is to be <hi>Rang</hi> two wayes more; one is, in making the <hi>Extreams</hi> between
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100085:17"/>
the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt, and the other way is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them between the two nearest; for Example, in making the treble the whole Hunt, and second the half Hunt, the Six-score are to be Rang eight several wayes (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>

The two next Figures are 1.3 where the treble is the whole Hunt, and the third the half Hunt; and likewise the two last, or lowest Figures, are 5.4 the fifth is the whole Hunt, and the fourth the half Hunt; and so of all the rest, the first Figure representing the whole Hunt, and the next to it the half Hunt.</p>

               <head>The Changes on six Bells.</head>
               <p>On six Bells there are Seven-hundred and twenty Changes to be made; but there are Peals of Six-score and Twelve-score Changes to be Rang on them. The Six-score Changes are to be made, by observing a whole Hunt and half Hunt, which are to be hunted in the same course, as in the Six-score on five Bells, and the Exrream Changes to be made by the same Rule as they were on five Bells. The only difference between the Six-score on six Bells, and those on five, are this; whereas on five there are but three Extream Bells, on six there are four Extream Bells. And on five Bells, there are six Extream Changes in every Six-score; but on six, there are but four Extream Changes. And moreover, whereas in every Six-score on five Bells, the Changes were the same in each, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though altered in course; but the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on six Bells are not the same in each, for several Six-scores has several Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, one Six-score having many Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which another has not, as in this Peal, treble and second both up; which is,

Treble and second, or treble and fifth, with the tenor lying behind, makes very good Musick: Of which Peals I need not give you any Example, these Six-scores being the same with those on five Bells set down before.</p>
               <p>The Twelve-score Changes being only part of the Seven-hundred and twenty, and consequently the course of each being one and the same, I will therefore shew the course and method of the Seven-hundred and twenty, wherein the Twelve-score Changes are also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>In Ringing the Seven-hundred and Twenty, there is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, a quarter Hunt, and three Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Bells; the whole Hunt and half Hunt does hunt in the same course and method, as they did in the Six-score on five Bells, and in the last Six-score; and the quarter Hunt removes in the same course under the half Hunt, as the half Hunt does under the whole Hunt: for instance, when the whole Hunt is hunted either before or behind the Bells, then

the half Hunt removes over one Bell; and when the half Hunt is removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or behind the quarter Hunt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Bells (at which time in a Six-score the Extream is made) then the quarter Hunt removes over one Bell, in the same course as the half hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t moves, when the whole Hunt is before or behind. An Example I will set down, which is 1.2 and 3 all up, that is to say, treble the whole Hunt, and to hunt up, second the half Hunt, and to half hunt up, and third the quarter Hunt, and to quarter hunt up 4, 5 and 6 are Extream Bells; there is alwayes an Extream Change to be made, when the quarter Hunt comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or behind the Extream Bells, there are two wayes to make the Extreams, which are the same here, as in the Six-score on five, and made by the same Rule, I will here make it between the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter Hunt. Now the treble and second being the whole Hunt and half Hunt, must be hunted in the same course, as in the Six-score on five Bells, after this manner.</p>

                  <hi>The quarter Hunt being before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Bells, the Extream Change is to be made:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are just Twelve-score Changes already set down, and the Bells may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be brought round, and so make an end at the Twelve-score, or else proceed forward to the end of the Seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty. If the Bells are not brought round here, they cannot come round, until the Seven-hundred and twenty Changes are all made, and then they come round in course. To bring the Bells round at the end of these
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100085:28"/>
Twelve-score Changes, the Extream is to be made between the 5 and 4, which were the two Bells that made the last Extream Change, and brings them round in their right places again, as appears by these Figures 123456.</p>
               <p>There are but two Extream Changes in every Twelve-score, wherein 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly observed, that the last Extream Change is to be made between those two Bells which made the first Extream, otherwise the Bells would not come round at the end of the Twelve-score.</p>
               <p>Here I have somewhat deviated from my directions before, in making the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Changes; for in the last Change, which is 123456, I made the Extream between the two nearest Extream Bells to the quarter Hunt; but the Twelve-score Changes are an imperfect Peal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a third part of the Changes which are to be made on six Bells, and therefore not to be brought round, unless the last Extream Change is made out of course. To have proceeded forward in the 720, the last Extream should have been made between the 4 and 6, which are the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter Hunt, the Change next before
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100085:28"/>
the Extream, is 123456; now the 4 and 6 making an Extream Change, the Bells stand thus, 123564; the Extream being made, the whole <hi>hunt,</hi> half <hi>hunt,</hi> and quarter <hi>hunt</hi> are to be hunted as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the Extream Changes to be made between the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter <hi>hunt,</hi> which course will bring the Bells round in their right places at the end of the 720. In every 720, there are six Extream Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, there being Six-score Changes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each. The Twelve-score Changes are to be Rang with any whole <hi>hunt,</hi> half <hi>hunt,</hi> and quarter <hi>hunt,</hi> observing to make the last Extream Change between those two Bells which made the first.</p>
               <p>The 720 plain Changes are to be rang or set down One thousand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty several wayes, by altering the whole <hi>hunt,</hi> half <hi>hunt,</hi> quarter <hi>hunt,</hi> and Extream Bells (but the course of each is the same with that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set down) which I thus demonstrate. On 6 Bells, there are 120 several <hi>hunts, (viz.)</hi> a whole <hi>hunt,</hi> half <hi>hunt,</hi> and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>hunt</hi> Six-score several times, and not one and the same whole <hi>hunt,</hi> half <hi>hunt,</hi> and quarter <hi>hunt</hi> twice, as appears by these Figures.—

               <p>With one whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, the Seven-hundred and twenty Changes are to be Rang, or set down twelve several wayes; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, take the first three Hunts in these Figures, which are 123, where the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the third the quarter Hunt, which may be hunted six several wayes, as followeth.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100085:30"/>By treble, second and third all up, is meant, that the treble is the whole <hi>hunt,</hi> and to hunt up the first Change at the beginning of the Peal; the second is the half <hi>hunt,</hi> and to half hunt up; that is, to move up towards the hindmost Bells the first time it moves at the beginning of the Peal; and the third is the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>hunt,</hi> and to move likewise toward the hindmost Bells the first time it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves. And by treble and second up, and third down, is meant, that the treble and second are to move up towards the hindmost Bell, the first time each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves at the beginning of the Peal; and the third being the quarter <hi>hunt,</hi> is to move down the first time, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directions for moving the <hi>hunts</hi> at first, because they may be hunted either up or down.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happens, that the <hi>hunts</hi> cannot be hunted that way which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as in the 720, treble, second and third all down.—

               <p>The whole <hi>hunt</hi> which is the treble, should now be hunted down; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already before the Bells, insomuch that it can be removed no lower; I should therefore remove the half <hi>hunt</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100085:30"/>
down, but that being also down as low as it can go, I should move the quarter <hi>hunt</hi>; and that being also down before the Extream Bells, I can move it no lower, unless I should move it down under the second, which is the half <hi>hunt,</hi> which must not be done; for when the quarter <hi>hunt</hi> is down next before the <hi>Extream Bell,</hi> it must be removed no lower; and when it is up next behind the <hi>Extream Bell,</hi> it is to be removed up no higher; therefore it being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Extream Bell,</hi> the <hi>Extream Change</hi> is to be made the first of all; and when that is done, the treble, second and third must be hunted up in course. Or if you make treble and second down, and third up, then the first Change is to be made, by moving the quarter <hi>Hunt</hi> up over one <hi>Bell.</hi> And again, if you make Treble and Tenor both up, and Third down, first hunt up the Treble, and then the Tenor, which is the half <hi>Hunt,</hi> should be moved up; but it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready behind, the quarter <hi>Hunt,</hi> which is the Third, must move under one <hi>Bell,</hi> and then the whole <hi>Hunt</hi> and half are to hunt in course after each other: Many Examples of this Nature I could set

               <p>I might demonstrate how the 720 are to be Rang twelve wayes, with each of the Six-score Hunts, as I did that of tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, second and third; but I think that altogether needless, since that Example makes it most plain and easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: But I will give a general Rule for hunting any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, so as to produce six several wayes to Ring the 720 Changes, which is this:

                  </list>
Which is a general Rule to Ring the 720 six wayes on any one of the Six-score
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100085:31"/>
Hunts; each of which six wayes, may be Rang two wayes more, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the <hi>Extream Changes,</hi> one of which is to make the <hi>Extream Changes</hi> between the two next <hi>Extream Bells</hi> to the quarter Hunt, and the other way is to make the <hi>Extreams</hi> between the two farthest <hi>Extream</hi> Bells from it.</p>
               <p>The 720 Changes are to be Rang 12 wayes with one whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; so that with the Six-score Hunts, it is to be Rang Six-score times twelve wayes, which makes One thousand four hundred and forty several wayes to Ring this 720 plain Changes.</p>
               <p>In the 720, the half Hunt, the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hunt, and the three <hi>Extream</hi> Bells, makes the Six-score Changes on 5 Bells in a perfect course, the half Hunt and quarter hunt in the 720, being the whole Hunt and half Hunt in the Six-score; for Example, take the 23456, and set down the Six-score Changes on them, making the second the whole hunt, and the third the half hunt; which when you have set down, then take the Treble, and hunt it through every Change of that Six-score, and it will make 720 Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the same with those which I have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100085:32"/>
set down before. The Twenty-four Changes on four Bells, and the six chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on three Bells, have also a perfect course in the 720, in the same manner as I told you they had in the Six-scores on five Bells. There is alwayes one change in the Six-score made every time the whole hunt comes before or behind the bells, which is every sixth change; and there's one change of the Twenty-four made, every time the whole hunt and half hunt comes before or behind the bells, which is once in thirty chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and one change of the six made every extream, that is once in six-score changes. You may take the six-score changes on five bells, treble the whole, and second the half hunt, before set down; and hunt the sixth bell through every change of that six-score, which will make the 720 changes; Tenor the whole hunt, Treble the half hunt, and Second the quarter hunt.</p>

               <head>In this place, I will add a word or two to those that practise to Ring the Changes.</head>
               <p>THey that Ring the extream bells in the Twenty-four changes, must mind and observe the motion of the hunt, that they may the better know when to make the extream changes; and likewise in a six-score on five bells, he that Rings the half hunt, must observe the motion of the whole hunt; and they that Ring the extream bells, must observe the motions both of the whole hunt, and half hunt, that they may know when the half hunt is to move, and also when to make the extream changes; or else he that does Ring the half hunt, may give notice of the extream changes (by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Extream</hi>) the change next before the extream is to be made. The same is to be observed in the changes on six bells. The whole hunt is the easiest bell to Ring in any changes, and the half hunt is more plain and easie to Ring, than an extream bell. All changes are to be Rang either by <hi>walking</hi> them (as the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100085:33"/>
term is) or else Whole-pulls, or Half-pulls. By <hi>walking</hi> them, is meant, that the bells go round, four, six, eight times, or more, in one change, which is commonly used by young Practisers; it may be sometimes on five bells, Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Twenty-four changes on the treble, second, third, and fourth, the fifth bell striking behind every change; and many other changes of the like nature may be practised this way by young Ringers. Whole-pulls, is to Ring two Rounds in one change, that is, Fore-stroke and Back-stroke, and in a change; so that every time you pull down the bells at Sally, you make a new change differing from that at the Back-stroke next before; this Whole-pulls was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together practised in former time, but of late there is a more quick and ready way practised, called Half-pulls, which is—only once round in a change, that is, one change made at the Fore-stroke, and another at the Back-stroke, which way is now altogether in use (unless it be at some great bells, which are too weighty to be managed up so high a Compass at the Back-stroke, as Half-pulls requires) it being now a common thing in <hi>London</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100085:33"/>
to Ring the 720 <hi>Changes, Trebles and Doubles,</hi> and <hi>Grandsire Bob, Half-pulls,</hi> (which is commonly Rang with so round and quick a Compass, that in the space of half an hour, or little more, the 720 Changes are Rang out from the beginning to the end.) And also the Six-scores <hi>Doubles and Singles, Old Doubles, Grandsire,</hi> and many other cross Peals on five bells, are commonly Rang Half-pulls.</p>
               <p>In Ringing Half-pulls, some Peals do cut Compass, that is—the whole <hi>hunt</hi> comes to lead at the Back-stroke, to remedy which, make the first change of the Peal at the Back-stroke.</p>
               <p>By these following Rules, you shall know what Peals do cut Compass, and what not (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of plain and single changes. <hi>On six Bells,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In hunting either the treble, the third, or the fifth bells down, cuts Compass; hunting them up, does not cut Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.</p>
               <p>In hunting the second, fourth, or sixth bells up, cuts Compass; but hunting them down, does not cut Compass.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:100085:34"/>These Rules (leaving out the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) serves for five bells; and leaving out the fifth and Tenor, they serve for four bells.</p>

               <p>THe changes on bells do multiply infinitely. On two bells there are two changes. On three bells are three times as many changes as there are on two; that is—three times two chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which makes six. On four bells there are four times as many changes as on three; that is—four times six chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which makes Twenty-four. On five bells there are five times as many changes as there are on four bells; that is—five times Twenty-four changes, which makes Six-score. On six bells are six times as many changes as there are on five; that is—six times Six-score changes, which makes Seven-hundred and twenty: And in the same manner, by increasing the number of bells, they multiply innumerably, as in the Table of Figures next following; where each of

the Figures in the Column of the left hand, standing directly under one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (which are 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.) do represent the number of bells; and the Figures going along to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right-hand, directly from each of those twelve Figures, are the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of changes to be rung on that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bells which the Figure represents: For Example, the uppermost Figure on the left hand is 2, which stands for two bells; and the Figure next to it on the right hand is also 2, which stands for two changes; that is to say, on two bells there are two changes. The next Figure below in the left Column is 3, which stands for three Bells; and the Figure next to it on the right hand is 6, which stands for six changes; that is—on three bells are six changes, and so of the rest as follows.</p>

Every single change is made between the two bells in the middle (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in seconds and thirds places; excepting the extream changes, which are single, and made between the two farthest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream bells from the Hunt. An Example

I here set down, making the treble the Hunt, and I hunt it up at the beginning of the Peal (for it may be hunted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up or down at pleasure) and I make an extream change every time the whole Hunt comes before the bells. In ringing it, 'tis observed, that every bell hunts in course, and lies twice before, and twice behind, except only when the extream is to be made, and then the two farthest extream bells from the Hunt, does make a dodge, and then moves in their former course, as in these changes.—

Another way is to make an extream eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time the hunt comes behind. And the third way, is to make an extream every time the hunt comes before and behind the bells.

               <head>Doubles and Singles on five Bells.</head>
               <p>THere is a Peal to be rang on five bells, called Doubles and Singles, wherein are Six-score several changes, sixty of which are double changes, and sixty are single; the double and single changes are so intermixt, that two dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble changes does not at any time come together in the Six-score; neither are two single changes made next to each other in any part of this Peal, but one change is double, and the next single, in which course they are made to the end. Every double change is made between the four foremost bells (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in treble, second, third, and fourth place. When the whole hunt is hunting up, each single change is made between the whole hunt, and the next bell above it. In hunting down the single changes are made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the whole hunt, and the next bell below it, the whole hunt being alwayes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100085:38"/>
one of the two bells which makes every single change, except only when it leads, and then the single change is made in third and fourths places; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream is also a single change, and made (when the whole hunt leads) between the two farthest extream bells from the half hunt; the half hunt is to lie either before or behind the extream bells, when the extream changes are made, of which I shall shew you more anon.</p>
               <p>In this Peal there is a whole hunt, a half hunt, and three extream Bells; the whole hunt in a direct course does hunt up and down, and lies twice before, and twice behind all the way; every other bell leads twice together throughout the Peal.</p>
               <p>And when the whole hunt leaves the thirds place, hunting up, then every bell that comes into second and thirds pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, does lie in each of those places twice together, until the whole hunt comes down again into thirds place, at which time the bell in fourths place lies there twice, and then makes a dodge with the bell in thirds place (unless an extream change is to be made) and so removes directly down before the bells. And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100085:39"/>
that bell which comes into the tenors place (when the whole hunt leaves that place hunting down) lies still there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the whole hunt removes up into that place again, except only when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream is made behind, and then the bell in fourths place moves into tenors place, and lies there until the whole hunt moves up into that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With one whole hunt, and half hunt, this Peal may be rang six wayes, in three of which the whole hunt is to be hunted up at the beginning of each Peal, which three ways differs only in making the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream changes. One way, is to make an extream change every time the half hunt comes before the extream bells, as in the following Six-score. The second way, is to make an extream change every time the half hunt comes behind the extream bells. And the third way, is to make an extream every time, the half hunt comes before and behind the extream bells. In this last way there are six extreams in each Peal, but in the other two ways there are but three extreams in each Peal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The three wayes aforesaid, are to be rang, by hunting up the whole hunt; but it may be rang three wayes more, in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100085:39"/>
down the same whole hunt, in which three wayes the extreams are to be made, as I shewed you before. The whole hunt is alwayes to lead when every extream change is made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Peal I have set down at large, making the treble the whole hunt, the second the half hunt; and an extream change every time the half hunt comes before the extream bells, as in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing changes. I have drawn a Line between the figures at the extream chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that next below the Line is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It may be prick't, or rang Six-score several wayes more, by making the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream changes when the whole hunt lies behind the bells, but those wayes are never practised; neither do I think it material to say any thing more of them in this place, having only inserted this, to shew the great variety there is in this Peal. It being somewhat difficult to know the true way of beginning each Peal, I have therefore set down certain Rules, shewing how the first changes in each are to be made.</p>

               <p>IN this Peal are contained Six-score changes, which are Doubles and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, there being sixty double changes in it, and sixty single, which are so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, that two double changes does not come together in any part of the Peal; neither are there 2 single changes at any
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100085:41"/>
time made together, but one change is double, and the next to it is single; in which course the changes are all made to the end of the Peal. Every single change is made between the 2 hindmost bells. There is a whole hunt and half hunt in it. <hi>The observation in ringing it, is this: When the whole hunt lies before the bells, and is to hunt up, first it moves up into seconds place, where it lies twice; then into thirds place, where it lies also twice; then into the fourths place, where it lies once; and in the tenors place once: Then it makes a dodge with the bell in fourths place, after which it lies twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; then it moves down into fourths place, and makes a dodge with the bell in tenors place, and then moves down into thirds place, where it lies twice, and in the seconds place twice, ane then it leads four times; after which, it hunts again, as before. The course of the other four bells, are exactly the same with that of the whole hunt, in moving up and down, except only when the Bob-changes are made, and then they differ; but after the Bobs are made, their course is the same as before; every bell lies four times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the bells, and twice in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100085:41"/>
place without any alteration.</hi> In this Peal are two sorts of Bobs; one of which is called a double Bob, and the other a single Bob. The Rule for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the double Bob is this, when the whole hunt is hunting down, and lies in the seconds place, and the half hunt lies behind, then there's a double Bob; that is, two Bob-changes; one of which is made the next change, wherein the whole hunt moves down to lead; where having led four times, there is then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Bob-change to be made, in which the whole hunt moves up into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds place. The Rule for making the single Bob, is this, when the whole hunt has led four times, and the half hunt lies in thirds place; then the next change following is a single Bob, that is—one Bob-change, in which the whole hunt moves out of the trebles place up into the seconds place, every Bob is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change, and made between the two first, and two last bells, the bell in thirds place lying still when each Bob is made, where it lies four times together, and then moves down; every time the whole hunt comes before the bells, there is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a single Bob, or a double Bob made.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100085:42"/>
At every double Bob, those two bells that do dodge behind at the first Bob-change, continues dodging until the whole hunt moves up, and parts them: And likewise at the single Bob, those 2 bells which do dodge behind at the Bob-change, continue dodging until the whole hunt moves up, and parts them, as in the following changes, where the treble is the whole hunt; the tenor the half hunt, and the first is a Bob-change, being supposed to be the second Bob-change of a double Bob.</p>

               <p>THis Peal of <hi>Paradox</hi> is to be rang on five bells, wherein are Six-score changes, they are Doubles and Singles; that is—one change double, and another single; in which course they are made to the end of the Peal. Every single change is made in second and thirds pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then 'tis made in third and fourths places; but the extream Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are (also single) and made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two farthest extream bells from the half Hunt; the whole Hunt lies before the bells, when every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream change is made. Every bell lies four times together before, and four times behind, except only when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream changes are made behind. There is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three extream bells; the course of the whole Hunt is this, it being before the bells,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100085:43"/>
first it moves up into the second and thirds places, then it makes a dodge with the bell in seconds place, and moves out of the thirds place up into fourths, where it lies alwayes twice, then moves up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, where it lies four times, and then moves down into fourths place, where having lay twice, it hunts down into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds place, and makes a dodge with the bell in thirds place, and then moves down before the bells, where having lay twice, it hunts as before; each of the other bells has the same course (in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down) as the whole Hunt until the whole Hunt leads, at which time every bell that comes into seconds place lies there twice together, unless the extream change is to be made in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and thirds places.</p>
               <p>In this following Peal, the treble is the whole Hunt, and the second the half Hunt; the extream changes are made, when the half Hunt lies before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream bells.</p>

There are four changes made in the Twenty-four every time the whole Hunt leads, which coming before the bells six times in the Six-score, and each time lying there four times together, makes six times four changes, which is Twenty four.

in three of which the whole Hunt is to be hunted up; and in the other three wayes it is to be hunted down, in which six wayes the extream changes are to be made by the same Rules, and in the same manner, as I shewed before in the Six-score Doubles and Singles on five bells; so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be prick't or rang twenty times six wayes, which makes Six-score.</p>
               <p>This Peal may be prick't Six-score wayes more, by making the extreams when the whole Hunt lies behind the bells, but that being never practised, I will say no more of it. I have here set down some general Rules for beginning the several Peals of <hi>Paradox</hi> by the former course (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in making the extreams when the whole Hunt is before the bells.</p>

               <p>THis Peal has Six score changes in it, which are Doubles and Singles; the tenor is the whole Hunt, and the fourth the half Hunt. Every bell lies twice before, and four times behind; every single change is made in second and thirds places, and every bell that comes into fourths place, lies there twice together, until the tenor comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; at which time, the fourth lying in the seconds place, the next single change is made in third and fourths pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but the tenor lying behind, and the fourth in thirds place, then the two next following single changes are in third and fourths places.</p>

               <p>EVery bell leads four times, and lies behind twice, except when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream is made behind, and twice in the seconds place, except when the extream is before; and note, when the treble is before the fourth stroke, the single is in second and third, the next time the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle is behind; but at other times, the single is in third and fourths places. When any bell leaves leading, the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change is on the two first, and two last, and the extreams are made by turns, first behind, then before, and so on to the end, for there are six extreams.</p>

               <head>Old Doubles. On five Bells.</head>
               <p>THis Peal call'd <hi>Old Doubles,</hi> is to be rang on five bells, wherein are Six-score changes, which are all Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then there is alwayes a single change made. It has a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three extream bells; every bell leads twice together all the way, and lies twice behind, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then the bell behind lies there four times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unless the extream is made behind, and then but twice. Every bell hunts in a perfect course, until the whole Hunt leads, and then the single is to be made, at which time the bell in seconds place lies there twice (unless the extream is made in second and thirds place) and every single change is made in third and fourths places, except the extreams
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100085:49"/>
which are (in this Peal) made by the same rule, and after the same manner, as I shewed before in the Six-score call'd Doubles and Singles on five bells. In making the single changes in third and fourths places, it is observed, that the bell which lies in fourths place (the change next before the single) is hunting up; and in making the single change, it does dodge with the bell in thirds place, and so hunts up behind; and likewise the bell that lies in thirds place (in the change next before the single) is hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and in making the single it does dodge with the bell in fourths place, and then hunts directly down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this following Peal, the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and an extream change is alwayes made, when the half Hunt lies before the extream bells next to the whole Hunt; every extream is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two farthest extream bells from the half Hunt, as in these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing changes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>GRandsire</hi> is the best and most ingenious Peal that ever was composed, to be rang on five bells, it having no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the course of any other Peal. There are Sixscore changes in it, in pricking of which, there is the greatest variety of any other Peal whatsoever; for it may be prick't or rang some thousands of wayes. The common way of ringing it, is to make the Bobs and single chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges when the whole Hunt leads, which course
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100085:54"/>
and method I will first set down, and afterward say something of the other wayes in ringing it. It has a whole hunt and half hunt, the changes are all double except two, which are single. The whole hunt has a perfect course in hunting up and down, and lies twice together before, and twice behind all the way; every other bell has the same course as the whole hunt, in moving and hunting up and down; and each bell lead twice together all the way, and lie twice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behind, except only at the Bobs. Every Bob-change is made between the two first and two last bells, the bell in thirds place lies still when every Bob-change is made, and then moves down; and every other double change is made between the four bells that stand together (<hi>viz.</hi>) either the four first, or four last bells. There are two sorts of Bobs, one of which is call'd a single Bob, and the other a double. The Rule for making the single Bob is this — When the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in thirds place, the next is a Bob-change; in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of which, the whole hunt moves out of the trebles place up into the seconds place hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, and the bell which lies behind in the change next before the Bob, makes a dodge with the bell in fourths place, and then lies twice behind; and that bell which did dodge with the bell in tenors place, moves directly down; this is a single Bob, that is, one Bob-change. The Rule for making the double Bob is this—When the whole hunt lies in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds place hunting down, and the half hunt behind, then there is a double Bob, that is, two
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100085:54"/>
Bob-changes, one of which is made the next change wherein the whole Hunt moves out of the seconds place down before the bells, and the other Bob is made the next change but one to it, in which the whole Hunt moves from before the bells up into the seconds place; the bell which lies in the thirds place when every Bob-change is made, lies there twice, and then moves down. And at every double Bob, the two hindmost bells continue dodging until the whole Hunt moves up into the fourths place, and parts them. Every time the whole Hunt comes before the bells, there is either a single Bob, or double Bob made, which comes by turns, one single, and the next double through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Peal.</p>
               <p>The greatest variety of this Peal, consists in making the single changes. In this way of Ringing it (with any whole Hunt and half Hunt) the first single change may be made either at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth Bobs, at the single or double Bobs at pleasure; observing for a constant Rule, that the half Hunt is alwayes one of the two bells which makes every single change; for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle changes are so contrived, that (in making them) the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to continue their constant course as at other times. At the single Bob, the single change is made in second and thirds places; and at the double Bob, 'tis made in fourth and fifths pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the other three bells lying still in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whil'st each single change is made; the next change to each single, is a Bob-change; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry single change is made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the whole hunt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100085:55"/>
lies before the bells; there being alwayes sixty changes, from the first single change to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; if the first single change is made at a single bob, then the second single change must be made at the third single bob from it; or if the first single change is made at a double bob, the second single change must be made at the third double bob from that where the first was made.</p>
               <p>This Peal may be rang without making any single change therein, which is done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a double change to supply the place of it. There are two of these double changes in each Peal; the first of them may be made at any bob within sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal, and the second is to be made just sixty changes from the first. At a double bob, it may be made at either of the two bob-changes; at the first of them, 'tis made by moving the whole Hunt down, and the bell in thirds place up over two bells at once into the tenors place, thus:—41325:14253.</p>
               <p>In making it at the second bob change of the double bob, 'tis the same as at the first, only in that the whole Hunt moved down to lead; but in this it must move up from before the bells into the seconds place, as in this change— 12435:21354.</p>
               <p>The changes next following these, are the same as at other times. At the single bob, 'tis to be made when the whole Hunt lies in the seconds place hunting down; in which place it may be made two wayes, in one of which the bell in thirds place is to be moved up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, in the same manner as I shewed you at
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100085:55"/>
the double bob: The other way, is to move the bell in tenors place down into the thirds place, thus:—51423:15342.</p>
               <p>Now the reason wherefore at this place it may be made two wayes, and at each of the double bob changes but one way, is this; At the double bob, the half Hunt lies behind, which cannot be moved into thirds place, for that would put it out of its course; but in the single bob, the half Hunt lying before the bells, and the whole Hunt in seconds place, so that neither of those bells are concerned therein; therefore it may be made either by moving the bell in thirds place up behind, or else by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the hindmost bell down into thirds place, both which are to one effect, though different changes; for these changes are so continued, that (in making them) the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to continue their constant course, as at other times.</p>
               <p>I have here set down this Peal of Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, making the treble the whole Hunt, and the tenor the half Hunt, and the first single change is made the sixth bob; that is, the third double bob, which is sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal; you may know the single change, by the line drawn between the figures at the single change, that next after the line is the single: Grandsire is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rang, as it is here prickt; but it may be rang any other way, according to my directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before.</p>

               <p>Grandsire may be rang another way (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in making the bobs when the whole Hunt is before the bells (as in the former way) and to make the single changes when it lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind (<hi>viz.</hi>) the first single change may be made at any time when the whole Hunt comes behind, provided it be made within sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal; if it is made the next time the whole Hunt comes behind after a single bob, it is in treble and seconds places; after a double bob, it is made in third and fourths places, the whole Hunt

lying behind when each single change is made, and the second single change must be made just sixty changes from the first.</p>
               <p>In all the several Peals of Grandsire by the course aforesaid, the first changes in each Peal must be made by these following Rules.</p>

               <p>With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is made by hunting the whole Hunt down.</p>
               <p>These are the twenty Hunts on five bells, which are set down in Page 26. The two Figures which stand together, do represent the whole Hunt and half Hunt; for instance, the uppermost figures are 1, 3; the 1 is the whole Hunt, and the 3 is the half Hunt, and so of the rest. Where the letter B stands by the Hunt, the first change that Hunt makes is a Bob: But with all the other Hunts, the first change is either between the four first, or four last bells; yet the first change in many of them may be made single, as in 1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:2, 1:2, 3:3, 1:3, 5:4, 1:4, 3:4, 5:5, 1:5, 4:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:100085:57"/>In hunting the treble down, the first change is made between the four hindmost bells; and in hunting the fifth bell up, the first change is made between the four foremost bells.</p>
               <p>There is another way to Ring this Peal of Grandsire, which is, to make the bobs and single changes when the whole hunt lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the bells; but this is not convenient to be practised, therefore I will say no more of it in this place, having only mentioned this, to shew the great variety there is in this Peal.</p>
               <p>This Peal of Grandsire is to be Rang by another course, <hi>viz.</hi> to make the bobs when the whole hunt is behind the bells, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle changes, when it lies before them. This is the absolute foundation from whence the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Peal of Grandsire bob (on six bells) had its beginning and method, and by practising to prick down this Peal, and by observing the true course and method of the bobs and single changes herein, you may with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ease understand the true course of the bobs and single changes in Grandsire bob on six bells, for the half hunt, the quarter hunt, and the three extream bells (in Grandsire bob on six bells) do make these sixscore changes; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time the whole hunt leads in Grandsire bob, there are two changes made in this Peal of Grandsire on five bells: And so consequently, the single changes is Grandsire bob are made by the same rule and method as they are in this Peal. The Rule for making the bobs in this Peal, is this (<hi>viz.</hi>) when the whole hunt lies in the fourths place hunting up, and the half hunt leads, the next is a double bob: And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100085:57"/>
when the whole hunt lies in the tenors place, and the half hunt in thirds place, then the next change is a single bob, the bobs are made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two first and two last bells, that in thirds place lies still in the bob change, and then moves up. The single changes are made when the whole hunt leads; the first single change (in Ringing it with any whole hunt and half hunt) may be made at any time when the whole hunt leads, within sixty chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from the beginning of the Peal, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bells as they stand round at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for one of the sixty changes. The single change that is made the next time the whole hunt leads after a single bob, is made in fourth and fifths places; and that which is made next after a double bob, is made in second and thirds places, the half hunt is alwayes one of the two bells which makes every single change. If the first single change is made after a single bob, then the second single change must be made when the whole hunt leads next after the third single bob from that after which the first single was made; and the same is observed, in making them after a double bob: there being alwayes sixty changes from the first to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond single change in each Peal. This Peal I have here set down, in which I make the treble the whole hunt, the fifth the half hunt, and the first single change is made when the whole hunt comes to lead next after the first single bob: You may know the single change, by the line drawn between the figures; the change next below the line, is the single, as in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Peal.</p>

               <p>This Peal may be Rang without making any single change therein, there are two double changes which may be made to supply the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the two single changes; the first of these double changes in any Peal may be made any time when the whole hunt lies in fourths place hunting up, provided you make it within sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal. At a double bob, it may be made at either of the two bob-changes, by moving the bell which lies in thirds place down under two bells at once into the trebles place: Now suppose it

were to be made the first time the whole hunt lies in the fourths place hunting up in the Peal next before, which is at a double bob, the bells lie thus, 53412; now the treble being the whole hunt must move up behind, and the fourth bell being in thirds place, must move down under two bells at once into the trebles place, thus, 45321; or else it may be made at the next bob-change of the double bob, 53241; here the treble must be moved down into fourths place, and the second bell into tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles place, thus, 25314. It may also be made the change next before the single bob, in which change it may be made two wayes; <hi>viz.</hi> either by moving the bell in thirds place down into trebles place, as in the changes next before, or else by moving the bell in trebles place up into thirds place; for instance, two changes before the first single bob (as in the Peal before set down) the bells lie thus, 24315; now the change may be made, either by moving the third bell into the trebles place, thus, 32451; or else the bell that leads up into thirds place, thus, 43251; in both which wayes, the whole hunt is to be moved up behind.</p>
               <p>There are only two of these double changes to be made in each Peal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the first is made at a double bob, then the second must be made at the third double bob from it; or if the first of them is made at a single bob, then the second must be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the third single bob from that where the first was made, there being alwayes just si<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

any Peal (at places differing from any of the former Rules) <hi>viz.</hi> wheresoever the whhle hunt and half hunt meets together to make a change (which constantly happens every time the whole hunt hunts up, and every time it hunts down in every Peal) the other three bells may lie still in their places, whil'st the whole hunt and half hunt makes the change; which being made, the whole hunt, the half hunt, and the other bells are immediately to proceed in their course; which single change is as effectual, as those which are made by the Rules aforesaid. Observing to make the first single change in any Peal, within sixty changes from the beginning; and the second single change must be made (just sixty changes from the first) between the whole hunt, and half hunt, which two bells will in course lie in the same places where the first single change was made.</p>

               <head>Trebles and Doubles on six Bells.</head>
               <p>THere are many Peals of Trebles and Doubles to be Rang on six bells, as, Six-score changes, Seven-score and four, Twelve-score, and Seven-hundred and twenty. In each of which Peals, the changes that are made from the time that the whole hunt leaves the trebles place hunting up, until it comes down into that place again, are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all made in one and the same manner; so that the only difference in these Peals, consists in making the changes when the whole hunt leads. These Peals are called Trebles and Doubles, because one is a treble change (that is, 3 changes made together, in which all the six bells do change their places, thus, 123456:214365:) and the next is a double change between the 4 bells, in the midst, thus, 241635: And in this course the changes are alwayes made from the time that the whole hunt leaves the trebles place hunting up, until it comes down into the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles place again; and in Ringing this Peal, 'tis observed, that every bell does hunt in a perfect and direct course, and lie twice together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and twice behind, until the whole hunt leads.</p>
               <p>The manner of Ringing the Seven-score and four, is this; the treble and tenor are both whole hunts, and the second is the half hunt; the first change as a treble change, and the next a double change, as I shewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100085:61"/>
in which course they are made, until the treble leads again, and the tenor lie behind; at which time there's a single change to be made in third and fourths places: But when the half hunt lies next to the treble, then the next single change must be made in fourths and fifths places, as in this following Peal, where I have only set down part of it for an example.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100085:62"/>The course of the Twelve-score, and the Seven-hundred and twenty, are both one and the same; for the Twelve-score changes, are only part of the Seven-hundred and twenty. There's a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter hunt, and three extream bells in the Seven-hundred and twenty; the changes are all tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and double (in the same course, as in the Six-score next before set down) until the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, at which time there's a single change to be made in fourth and fifths places: But when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, and the quarter hunt lies next to the half hunt, then there's an extream to be made, which is a single change, and made between the two farthest extream bells from the quarter hunt; and by observing this course, you may prick down, or Ring the Seven-hundred and twenty: But if you would only Ring Twelve-score changes (and then end there, by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the bells round) you must make no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream change at all; for in making every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle change in fourth and fifths places, the bells will come round in course at the end of Twelve-score changes, if you make no extream change to carry the Peal forward. In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing changes, the treble is the whole hunt, the 2 is the half hunt, the 3 the quarter hunt, and the 4, 5, and 6, are the extream bells. It being not much material to set down this Peal at large, therefore after the treble (which is the whole hunt) has hunted twice up and down, I have put down only the two changes which are made every time the treble leads to the end of the Twelve-score, as follows.</p>

               <p>The last change is 123546: which is at the end of Twelve-score changes; and here you see, that the whole hunt, the half hunt, and quarter hunt, do lie next to each other before the extream bells; therefore the bells may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be brought round, by making the single change in the same place, as those next before, are made thus, 123456: or else, if you would proceed forward to the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty, then the next must be an extream change between the fourth and sixth, which are the 2 hindmost bells, thus, 123564: and by observing to make an extream change
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100085:63"/>
behind every time the 1, 2, 3, lie together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bells, the bells will come round in course at the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty; at the end of every Three score chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, there's a single change throughout the Peal, and an extream change at the end of every Twelve-score. This Peal (by the Rules aforesaid) may be Rang with any whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt.</p>
               <p>In this Peal is contained the Six-score chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Old Doubles on five bells, and also the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles on four bells; the half hunt, the quarter hunt, and three extream bells, makes the Six-score chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Old Doubles in a perfect course; and the quarter hunt, and three extream bells, do make the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles. Every time the whole hunt leads, there are made two changes of the Six-score; and every time the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, there are two changes made in the Twenty-four.</p>

                  <hi>Grandsire Bob.</hi> On six Bells.</head>
               <p>IN this Peal of Grandsire Bob, there are Seven-hundred and twenty changes, in Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of which, there is the same course, as in Trebles and Doubles (before set down) until the bob-changes come to be made; this Peal may more properly be called Trebles and Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles than the former, because all the changes throughout the Seven-hundred and twenty,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100085:63"/>
are treble and double, except only the two sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle changes: But in Ringing an Eighteen-score (which is half the Seven-hundred and twenty, and a complete Peal of it self) the changes are all treble and double without any single change therein; for you must know, that in any Peal of Grandsire bob, the bells will come round in course at the end of Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen-score changes, if you make no single change to carry it on farther to the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty.</p>
               <p>This Peal has a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter hunt, and three extream bells; every bell hunts in a direct course, and lies twice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before, and twice behind, until the whole hunt leads, and then the four hindmost bells do dodge, that is, they make a double change; in which 'tis alwayes observed, that the two bells which lie in third and fifths pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (in the change next before the dodge) are hunting down, and in making this double change, each of those bells do dodge with the bell next above it, that is, they move up over one bell, and then each of them moves direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down; and the two bells that lie in fourth and tenors places in the change next before every dodge, are hunting up, and in making the dodge change, each of those bells do move down under one bell, and then they move up again in their course, as before; the dodge changes in all Peals of Trebles and Doubles, are made in the same manner as these.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of bobs in this Peal, <hi>viz.</hi> a single, and a double bob; the Rule for making the single bob, is this, when the whole
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100085:64"/>
hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in tenors place, and the quarter hunt in fourths place, the next change is a bob; and when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter hunt in seconds place, then there is a double bob, that is, two bob-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; one of which is made the next change, and the other is made the next time the whole hunt leads after. The bobs are all double changes, and made in one and the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the leading bell, and that in fourths place, do both lie still, whil'st the two bells in second and thirds places, and those in fifth and tenors places make the bob-change; and as soon as 'tis made, the bell in fourths place moves directly down. The half hunt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one of the two hindmost bells which makes every bob-change.</p>
               <p>In Ringing this Peal, there is a Rule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, whereby the person that does Ring the quarter hunt, may give notice of the bobs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to be made, without which it were impossible to Ring it; the Rule is this: In the dodge which is made between the four hindmost bells every time the whole hunt leads, if the half hunt and quarter hunt do dodge in fifth and tenors place, then the next time the whole hunt leads, there's a single bob; if they dodge in fourth and thirds pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then there's a double bob, that is, two bob-changes, one of which is made the next time the whole hunt leads after the dodge, and the other is made the next time the whole hunt leads after the former is made: He that does Ring the quarter hunt, may give notice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100085:64"/>
bob-change, by saying (Bob) when the whole hunt is going to lead, which is a change next before the bob is to be made.</p>
               <p>There are certain Rules very convenient to be known by all that practise to Ring this Peal; (<hi>viz.</hi>) he that does Ring the whole hunt, must observe that the bell which he first fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows when he leaves the trebles place hunting up, he must follow the same bell the next time he lies behind; and the second bell which he follows in hunting up, he must also follow the same bell when he next leaves the tenors place hunting down; and likewise, the third bell which he follows in hunting up, he must also follow the same bell when he leaves the fifths place hunting down: For instance, in the first cha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge of the following Peal, the bells stand thus, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 43<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5: here the treble (being the whole hunt) does first follow the second, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the treble has hunted up, and lies behind it, follows the second again, as in this change, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>54<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>21: And again, the second change of the following Peal, is 241635: here the fourth is the second bell, which the treble follows in hunting up, therefore he follows that bell again the next time he leaves the tenors place hunting down, as in this change, 563412: which course is observed throughout the Peal. And in Ringing any other bell (beside the whole Hunt) 'tis observed, that the next time you lie before the bells after a bob, that bell which you first follow in hunting up, you must also follow the same bell when you lie behind; and the same bell you must first follow every time you hunt up, and every time you lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100085:65"/>
until the next bob comes to be made; but if the whole hunt is the second bell which you follow in hunting up, then you must follow the whole Hunt when you lie behind; and the next time you lead, and lie behind, you must follow the former bell as before, until the bobs come to be made; and after the bobs, the course is the same (though you do not follow the same bell) as before.</p>
               <p>These Rules and Directions before set down, are to be observed in Ringing any Peal of Grandsire bob with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt: An Example I have here set down, wherein the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt, as in these following changes.</p>

               <p>With these five Hunts, the first change must be made between the four bells in the midst, thus, 132546.</p>
               <p>In Ringing tenor, treble, and second, there's a single bob the first time the whole Hunt comes before the bells.</p>
               <p>In all Peals of Grandsire bob, where the first change is either a bob, or a dodge between the four hindmost bells, or else a double change between the four bells in the midst, it must be made at the back-stroke of the bells, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Peal would cut compass all the way, that is, every bell would come to lead at the back-stroke.</p>
               <p>In the Eighteen-score changes before set down, there's a line drawn between the figures
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100085:68"/>
at every bob, the changes next below each line is a bob-change.</p>
               <p>In the Seven-hundred and twenty changes of Grandsire bob, there are two single chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be made. The first single change in any Peal is most commonly made as near the end of Eighteen-score changes (from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) as may be, and 'tis the best way, and most convenient: For instance, sometimes it happens that one or more of those persons who do Ring this Peal, may be weary before they have Rang Eighteen-score changes, therefore upon notice given, the single change may be forborn, and then the bells will in course come round at the end of Eighteen-score changes, making a complete Peal; but after the first single change is made, the bells cannot be brought round in course, until the Seven-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty are all made.</p>
               <p>There is great variety in making the single changes in each Peal, which may be made at divers places (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
               <p>The first single change in any Peal may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first or second double bobs, at which places the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, do alwayes lie together before the bells, and the single change is to be made in third and fourths places.</p>
               <p>The first single change in any Peal may also be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the first or second single bobs, at which place the whole Hunt and half Hunt do alwayes lie together before the bells; and the quarter Hunt lies behind, therefore it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100085:68"/>
must be made between the two hindmost bells.</p>
               <p>Or if the first bob in any Peal is a double bob, then the first single change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third double bob in that Peal, at which place the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the single is made in third and fourths places.</p>
               <p>Or if the first bob in any Peal is a single bob, then the first single change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, where the whole Hunt and half Hunt do alwayes lie together before the bells, and the quarter Hunt behind, therefore the single change must be made behind.</p>
               <p>The first single change in any Peal may also be made either at the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places the whole Hunt leads, the half Hunt lies in tenors place, and the quarter Hunt in fourths place, therefore it must be made behind.</p>
               <p>The first single change in any Peal may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first or second double bobs, at which place the whole Hunt, and quarter Hunt do alwayes lie together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bells, and the half Hunt in fourths place, therefore the single change must be made in third and fourths places. And in most Peals, the first single change may be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob; and in some Peals, the first single change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100085:69"/>
after the third double bob (notwithstanding the first bob-change in that Peal is a single bob, as in the Eighteen-score treble, second and fourth before set down) which falls out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the first bob change happens to be made either nearer the beginning of the Peal, or farther from it; for in some Peals, the bells will come round in course the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob. And in many Peals, the bells will come round at the fore-stroke the second time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two single changes in every Seven-hundred and twenty, which are alwayes made when the whole Hunt leads, the last single change in every Peal being constantly made just Eighteen-score changes from the first; for making of which, observe these Rules.</p>
               <p>If the first single change (in any Peal) is made the second time the whole Hunt leads after a double bob, then the second single change must be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third double bob, accounting from the place where the first sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle change was made.</p>
               <p>If the first single change in any Peal is made the second time the whole Hunt leads after a single bob, then the second single change must be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, accounting from the place where the first single change was made. Or if the first single change is made at a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle bob, then the second single change must be made at the third single bob, accounting from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100085:69"/>
the place where the first single change was made.</p>
               <p>The second single change in every Peal must be made between those two bells, and in the same place where the first single change was made; and the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, will in course lie in the same places at the second single change, where they lay at the first: either the half Hunt, or quarter Hunt, are alwayes one of the two bells which makes every single change. But there are many other wayes to make the single chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>viz.</hi> to make them between the half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, at any dodge, where those two bells do dodge together next before a bob, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which I need not say any thing more in this place, having already set down all those wayes which are most easie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be practised.</p>
               <p>In Ringing this Peal of Grandsire bob, (with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hunt) if there's no single change made within Eighteen-score changes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Peal, the bells will in course come round in their right places, just at the end of Eighteen-score changes.</p>
               <p>In any Peal of Grandsire bob, where the first is a double change, and made at the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroke, the last change of the Peal (which brings the bells round in their right places) is a treble change, and made at the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroke.</p>
               <p>The Seven-hundred and twenty changes of Grandsire Bob may be Rang without making any single change therein, which way of Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100085:70"/>
it, is call'd <hi>Grandsire Bob True</hi>: that is, the changes are all true trebles and doubles without any single change therein. There are made two double changes (contrary to the course of all the double changes in the Peal) to supply the place of the two single changes, which two are called True changes; and to be made divers wayes, and at several places. The first true change in any Peal may be made at the first, second, or third double bobs either at the first or second bob-change of each. At the first bob-change of any double bob it may be made, by moving the Bell in fourths place down under two Bells at once into the seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells must make a change at the same time: for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the Eighteen-score of treble, second and fourth before set down, at the first bob-change of the first double Bob, the Bells stand thus, 143526. Now the true change is made, by moving the Bell which lies in fourths place down under two Bells at once into seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells are at the same time to make a change thus, 154362. At this place it may be made another way, by moving the hindmost Bell down under two Bells at once into the fourths place, and the two Bells in second and thirds places are at the same time to make a change thus, 134652. At the last Bob-change of each double Bob, it may also be made two wayes; one of which, is to move the Bell in fourths down into the seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells at the same time to make a change, as I shewed you before: But the best and easiest way is to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100085:70"/>
move the bell which lies in fourths place up over two bells at once into the tenors place, and the two bells in second and thirds places to make a change as at a bob: for instance, at the last bob-change of the first double bob in the Eighteen-score before set down, the figures stand thus, 143652. Now the bell in fourths place must be moved up behind, and the two bells in second and thirds places are to make a change, 134526. The second True change in every Peal must be made just Eighteen-score changes from the first, in making of which, these Rules are to be observed. If the first true change in any Peal is made at the first bob-change of a double bob, then the second true change must be made at the first bob-change of the third double bob, accounting from the place where the first true change is made, but not reckoning that for one of the three: or if the first true change is made at the last bob-change of a double bob, then the second true change must be made at the last bob-change of the third double bob, accounting from the place where the first true change was made, but not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that for one of the three. And the second true change in every Peal must be made in the same manner and place as the first; the true and single changes in Grandsire bob, are both to one and the same effect (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to alter the course of the extream bells; for in making these changes, the whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt are to continue their constant course without vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither of those 3 bells being any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise concerned therein, than at the change which should have been made, if the single or true change had been forborn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:100085:71"/>There is another way to Ring this Peal of Grandsire Bob, by a course differing from the former. When the whole Hunt leads, the half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter Hunt in fourths place, then the next change is a single bob; and when the whole Hunt leads, and the half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter Hunt in thirds place, then the next change is the first bob-change of a double bob; the bobs and dodge-changes herein are made in the same manner, as those in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way: But the bobs herein are called by a Rule differing from the former, <hi>viz.</hi> when the whole Hunt and half Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the quarter Hunt (ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in fourths place) dodges with the bell in thirds place, then the second time the whole Hunt comes before the bells (from that place) there is made the first bob-change of a double bob, the second bob-change being made the next time the whole Hunt leads af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When the whole Hunt and half Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hunt (lying in fifths place) dodges with the bell in tenors place, then the second time the whole Hunt leads (from that place) is made a single bob.</p>
               <p>There are two single changes in the Seven-hundred and twenty, the first single change in any Peal may be made at the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places it must be made between the 2 hindmost bells; or the first single change may be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places 'tis alwayes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100085:71"/>
made between the two hindmost bells. The first single change may also be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first, second, or third double bobs, where it must alwayes be made in third and fourths places. But in some few Peals it happens, that the bells will come round at the fore-stroke the next time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, and also after the last bob-change of the third double bob, which falls out according as the first bob-change in each Peal is made, either nearer the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or farther off.</p>
               <p>The second single change (in every Peal) must be made Eighteen-score changes from the first, in making of which, these Rules must be observed.</p>
               <p>If the first single change is made at a single bob, then the second single change must be made at the third single bob from the place where the first was made. Or if the first single change is made the next time the whole Hunt leads after a single bob, then the second single change must be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, accounting from the place where the first sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle change was made. And the same Rule is observed in making it after a double bob.</p>
               <p>The second single change in every Peal must be made in the same place, and between those two bells which made the first single change: But (in Ringing this Peal) if you make no single change, the bells will in course come round at the end of Eighteen-score changes.</p>
               <p>The way to begin several of these Peals, is as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:100085:72"/>In Ringing treble, third, and fifth; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, and fifth; and also third, fifth, and second; the first change is treble, and the next double, and so forward in the common course of trebles and doubles, until the first Bob in each comes to be made. In treble, second and third, the first changes are treble and double in the common course; and the second time the treble leads, there's a double Bob. In treble, tenor and second, the first changes are treble and double in the common course; and the second time the treble leads, there's a single Bob. In treble, second and fifth, the first change is a dodge between the four hindmost Bells; and the second time the treble leads, there's a single Bob. In second, fourth and tenor, the first change is made between the 4 Bells in the midst. In treble, second and fourth, the first change is a dodge behind; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time the treble leads, there's a double Bob.</p>

               <p>There are 40320 several changes on 8 bells, which to Ring it is altogether impossible; the greatest Peal that ever was Rang on 8 Bells, is 1680, being only a third part of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on seven Bells, which are to be Rang with a whole Hunt, half Hunt, quarter Hunt, half quarter Hunt (for so you may term it) and three extream Bells: But the most complete and musical Peal that ever was Rang on eight Bells, is Grandsire Bob, treble, second and fifth, Half-pulls, on 1.2.3.5.6.7. the fourth and the tenor lying behind every change, thus, 123567, 48. which has of late been practised

               <p>The most musical Peals that are commonly Rang on eight Bells, are these Six-scores on five, the other three Bells lying behind every change: For example, the uppermost fig. are 35678, 241. here the 35678, makes the Six-score changes, 3 the whole hunt, and 8 the half Hunt, or any others, and 241. strikes behind every change, in the same order as they now lie, and so of the rest. The three Bells which are to lie behind, must first be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up one after the other in order, before any of the Six-score changes are made. The Seven-score and four on the six middle Bells, the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leading, and the tenor lying behind every change, makes good Musick.</p>

the Bell into it, which is called <hi>Hanging of a Bell,</hi> I shall speak something: First, find out whether the Cannons be upright and true, then raise the Bell up by some Rope tyed to the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and so that the Bell hang level, which you may find, by applying a Plumet to the brim, then fasten a string to the Crown-staple within the Bell, then (a Plumet being tyed to the other end of the string) if the string hang in the midst between the two sides of the Bell whereon the Clapper should strike, the Crown-staple is cast into the Bell true: Now when you have hung the Bell, and let the Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in true by Keys (for therein consists the main point of the going of a Bell) then if the Clapper hang in the midst between the two striking sides, and the Stock stand upright, the Bell is well hung.</p>
               <p>If a Bell have a longer stroke on the one side, than the other, truss up that side which hath the short stroke more, or let the other side down, and put a piece or two of Leather in, according to the stroke; but sometimes the fault of the stroke is in the Sally, which you may remedy, by tying the Fillet (or little Cord about the rim of the Wheel, which causeth the dancing of the Rope) nearer, or farther off the main Spoke; nearer makes a short stroke, farther off the Spoke, a long one.</p>
               <p>And observe, that the trussing or taking up of a great Bell far into the Stock by a notch, makes the Bell go easier, and lie lighter at hand (that is) when it is set; for the farther the brim of the Bell is from the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

is a supposed line drawn through the Stock from one Gudgeon to the other; but note, if you truss a Bell up, that the Crown-staple be much above the Gudgeons, you must fasten a false Eye to the Crown-staple, and to this false Eye hang the Clapper, otherwise it will not strike so freely: Now small Bells must be trussed up short, for else the Bell hanging low, and fetching a great Compass in the swing, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but little Compass in the brim, the Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per keeps along by the side of the Bell, and gives no blow at all; but being hung short, the Bell fetches a quick and short Compass, equal to the bigness of the brim, and the Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per strikes well.</p>
               <p>Now for the tempering of the Gudgeons, I leave it to the judgment of the Workman; but a word or two of the polishing of it. After it is filed, or turned exactly round, take two pieces of Oak, and oyl one side of each, and strew fine Sand thereon, and clap them in a Smiths Vice, with the round of the Gudgeon between, then turn it about, until you think it is sufficiently polished, then oyl the sides of the pieces of Oak wherein there is no Sand, and so clap them in a Vice, with the Gudgeon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, as before, then turn it round, and it will polish the Gudgeon wonderful smooth; and if the Brasses are likewise well polished, the Bell will go as well at the first, as ever: Now by the neglect of this, the roughness of the Gudgeon will wear the Brasses so unequally, that the Bell will never go smooth and steddy.</p>
               <p>Now I would advise all Bell hangers to hang Bells with bolts of Iron to come from

the Cannons through the Stock, and to fasten them with Keys at the top of the Stock, and not with plates nailed on the sides; for they are mighty inconvenient to fasten a bell that is loose in the Stock, or to alter the stroke.</p>
               <p>As for the Rowle, let it not be without, nor within the hollow of the side of the Wheel; nor above, nor below the hollow at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Wheel. Now the bigger a Wheel is, if the Frame will permit, the bell will go the better; when the wheel is new, nail Stays from the Stock to each Spoke, to keep it from warping.</p>
               <p>'Tis very convenient (if the Frame will permit) to fasten a piece of Timber about half a foot long on the end of the main Spoke at the top of the Wheel (whereon the end of the bell-rope is fastned) with a notch on the end of it; so at the setting of the bell, the Rope will hit into that notch from the Rowle, and this will make the bell lie easier at hand when it is set, and flie better.</p>
