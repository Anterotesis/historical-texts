            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſufficient to ſatisfy any, Why I have
pitched upon you, rather then upon
another. I could tell the World,
What a grear Debtor you have me to
you, eſpecially in this day, wherein
the Hand of the Lord hath been, and
ſtill is, very heavy upon me: You
have been a Nurſe, and very much of
a Phyſitian to me; You have miniſtred
to my Neceſſities; You have often
cheared me with your Viſits; Yea,
you left not, till you had found out,
an Able and Eminent Phyſitian, and
brought him to me, under whoſe hands
I at preſent am, waiting upon God
for the Iſſue. Certainly, theſe are
Favours that are not to be forgotten;
and might very well be alleadged, as
<pb facs="tcp:107590:3"/>
the Reaſon of my Dedicating this
inconſiderable Peece to you. But,
<hi>Madam,</hi> under favour, I muſt tell you
and the world, that this Dedication,
neither reſpecteth, nor relates to, any
of theſe. The only Reaſon, is, truly
this, That there is none, can claim
ſuch an Intereſt in the Book, as your
ſelf; and if it be worth ſeeing the
Light, you muſt be thanked for it.
You were the Perſon, who, for ſome
years laſt paſt, did with much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
ſolicit me to the Printing and
Publiſhing of theſe Sermons; You
reſted not, till you had obtained a
promiſe from me, of doing it; When
my Copy was finiſhed, you were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
till it were ſent to the Preſs;
and when it was in the Preſs, in all
your inquiries after it, you were pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Stile it by the Name of <hi>Your
Book.</hi> So many wayes have you been
pleaſed to make it your own, that I
<pb facs="tcp:107590:4"/>
ſhould have wronged you very much,
if I ſhould have denied you, the right
you have to it. And now <hi>Madam,</hi>
having given you this accompt of the
Reaſon of my Dedicating this Book
to you, I ſhall next give you, a brief
accompt of the Book it ſelf. It Treats
of a Subject, which few or none (that
I know of) have written of, (I mean)
ſo as to make it the ſole Subject, of
a full and juſt Diſcourſe. It is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that Univerſally reſpecteth all,
of what Degree or Quality ſoever,
High and Low, Rich and Poor; yea,
the Higheſt, and the Loweſt; The
King that Sits upon the Throne, and
the Beggar that fits upon the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.
GOD, the Great Founder,
and Framer of Conditions, hath not

ſuch a crowd of Books: But God told not
me, what Changes He would make: And
<hi>who knoweth what is good for man,</hi> when
Providence concealeth much that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the Determination. Little thought I,
That <hi>God</hi> was ſo ſuddenly removing ſo many
faithful Guides, and bringing thouſands into
ſuch a caſe, in which, Books muſt be their
moſt learned, able, powerful Teachers!
O what a mercy is it, that even the Poor,
may keep ſuch <hi>Preachers</hi> in their houſes, at
ſo cheap <hi>a rate!</hi> That at Home, they may
thus have an <hi>excellent Sermon</hi> when they
pleaſe! That they may (yet) without Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
hear theſe <hi>ſilent Preachers,</hi> that
are Orthodox, Methodical, Impartial, not
bending to the Luſts, and Carnal Intereſts of
Men: That at home, you may hear a
Preacher that will not flatter you, nor raile
at thoſe, that are not for the Intereſt of a
Faction; nor by a beaſtly debauched Life,
unſay his Doctrine: That by reading <hi>more</hi>
or <hi>leſs,</hi> you may avoid the offence, of the
<hi>length</hi> or <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sermon:</hi> That
you may chooſe the Subject, moſt pertinent
to your caſe, and the Diſcourſe that for the
manner is moſt ſuited to your Edification!
That when you cannot come to a Powerful
<hi>Preacher,</hi> you may, at any time, read a <hi>heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warming
<pb facs="tcp:107590:5"/>
book:</hi> That when you want un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
and expreſſion, prudently to
inſtruct your Families, and exhort your near
Relations, or your Neighbours, you may
read to them, or lend them, a Book that is
beſt ſuited to their State. I think, Much
of the work of God in <hi>England,</hi> for mens
Converſion, Confirmation, and Conſolation,
is now to be carried on by <hi>Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I know ſome get them, but
as <hi>Hangings</hi> or <hi>Pictures,</hi> to Adorn their

ſupellectilis exornant thalamos, quae animis
ornandis inventa eſt, neque aliter his utuntur
quam Corinthii vaſis, &amp; tabulis pictis, ac
ſtatuis, &amp;c.</hi>) yet, when they are extant,
who knoweth whoſe hands they may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
And how many by ſuch Books, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
have fallen into their hands,
have bin brought to true Repentance and
Salvation.</p>
            <p>And it is a great-Mercy, that we have
ſuch a multitude of Books, that all <hi>agree</hi>
in the <hi>neceſſary unqueſtionable Truths</hi> of
our Religion; when it is a thing ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to read Books againſt Books, Errors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Truth; and [<hi>Libri quoſdam ad ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam,
quoſdam ad inſaniam perduxêre</hi>]
<pb facs="tcp:107590:5"/>
ſome are made <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and ſome made <hi>Mad,</hi>
by reading Books: And when diverſity,
and contrariety, ſo diſtract men, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Croſs-wayes do a Traveller. (<hi>ut
Petr.) Fallit ſaepe viarum multiplicitas viato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem;
et qui uno calle certus ibat, haeret in

quadrivii: ſic ſaepe qui librum unum effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer
elegiſſet, inutiliter multos aperuit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvitque.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The Papiſts remedy againſt the hurt of
ill Books, is to deny us the uſe of <hi>good ones:</hi>
Their remedy againſt the miſcheifs of <hi>errors,</hi>
is to keep men without knowledg of the
Truth; and to cure ſquinting to put out
our eyes: To eſcape the danger of <hi>miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>
the Scriptures, to keep them
from <hi>underſtanding</hi> them, and to lock them
up in an unknown Tongue, and to fly from
them, becauſe, they are abuſed by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
As if Chriſt ſhould not have ſaid

<hi>two</hi> Evils, the Vanity is more tolerable,

And it is of very great uſe, to the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> miſcarriages, and
<pb facs="tcp:107590:6"/>
the right ordering of our <hi>affections</hi> and
<hi>imployments</hi> in the world. How unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is it, That we ſhould be ſo eager and
peremptory in our deſires of that, which
we <hi>know not,</hi> Whether it will do us <hi>good</hi>
or <hi>hurt.</hi> That we ſhould be ſo paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
troubled, for thoſe paſſages of God's
Providence, which, for ought we know,
may be the means of our felicity. O how
oft do we <hi>fooliſhly trouble our ſelves,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>God is ſaving us</hi> from <hi>greater trouble,</hi>
and we do not underſtand His meaning!
Strange! that the knowledg of our <hi>nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and the experience of the <hi>fruits</hi> of
our miſcarriages, will not yet perſwade us,
to give God leave to Govern the World,
without our medling, or ſeeking to take
his Work into our hands, and cenſuring of
that, which we never underſtood! That
we have not yet enough, of the deſire of
<hi>being as gods;</hi> having ſmarted for it, as
we have done! O the folly of thoſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
of the Prophecies of Scripture, who
firſt <hi>overvalue a proſperous ſtate,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
beyond their knowledg, that it is <hi>beſt
for us;</hi> and then reduce the Promiſes to
their ſenſe; and grow ſo confident in their
expectations, of outward deliverances and
proſperous times, as to lay their hopes and
<pb facs="tcp:107590:7"/>
comforts on it, and the very credit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it ſelf! And ô the madneſs of thoſe
men, that laying this as their ground work,
that fleſhly Proſperity is beſt for them, are
unreconcilable to the wayes of Faith and
Holineſs, and Mortification, becauſe they
ſquare not with this Erroneous Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Generalls we are certain of; <hi>Firſt,</hi>
That ordinarily Adverſity, is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Soul, then worldly Proſperity.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>all things ſhall work together
for good, to them that love God.</hi> And
therefore we have reaſon to be <hi>moſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
of <hi>Proſperity;</hi> but, if we are true
Chriſtians, to interpret all well that is of
God.</p>
            <p>Did we but know what need we have
of <hi>mortifying Providences,</hi> as the ordinary
means of <hi>mortifying Grace,</hi> we ſhould right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
judg of them, then we do. <hi>Tanto quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
ferramentum medici patientius tolerat,
quanto magis putridum conſpicit eſſe quod
ſecat.</hi>] Saith <hi>Greg. He that beſt knowes
the rottenneſs of the fleſh, will beſt endure
the Surgions knife.</hi> And happy are we,
if that be <hi>cured</hi> by the <hi>pain</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi>
which was <hi>corrupted</hi> by the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the
<hi>fleſh:</hi> [<hi>Si quae carnis delectatione peccamus,

Marvel not, if, when thou turneſt unto

this way in all Generations. [<hi>Similes alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

Should we expect that Grace ſhould
have no Conflict, no Conqueſt before the
Triumph; but be Crown'd, before we have
ſhewed what it can do? Nay, we know
not the power of it in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> till it
be tried. [<hi>Nemo ſcit, quid potueris; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

Be not therefore too unmannerly, and
fooliſhly importunate with God for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thing, till thou not only thinkeſt that
at the preſent it would do thee good, but
alſo canſt ſee as far as to the <hi>end,</hi> and ſay,
That it will be <hi>in the iſſue good,</hi> and will

Recommendation, for the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
ſake: God threatneth by Sickneſs,
to call him hence; and therefore, that he
may Preach to <hi>many,</hi> when he is removed
from a <hi>few,</hi> and ſilenced in the duſt; is
that honour to his Name, and that benefit
to Men, which I gladly would Promote.

better in the Pulpit, then in the Preſs: I
have oft heard him, and ſcarce ever heard
a Sermon from him, which I thought not
worthy to be publiſhed: No, not when he
began to Preach, (about 26. years ago).

               </list>
               <p>The three firſt of theſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> diſcourſeth of
in the four ſirſt <hi>Chapters.</hi> And in the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi>
he comes to examine, and conſider of that of
Riches. And having, in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> by
many Arguments, proved the Vanity of Riches;
he comes in this <hi>Chapter</hi> to adde four Arguments
more.</p>
               <p>1. A man may have the Poſſeſſion of them, and
yet want the right Uſe, and comfortable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them. This you have, in the ſix firſt
<hi>Verſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They are not able to give ſatisfaction to the
Deſires of men. This he proves, <hi>Ver. 7. All the
labour of a man is for his Mouth,</hi> i. e. for the Body,
and the ſervices of It; But <hi>the Appetite is not filled.</hi>
And further confirmes it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. by comparing the
Wiſe and Fooliſh, Rich and Poor, together. If
there were ſuch contentment, and ſatisfaction to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107590:16"/>
be found in Riches, why then Wiſe men and Rich
men ſhould, of all others, enjoy the happineſſe of
it. But, ſaith <hi>Solomon, What hath the Wiſe more
than the Fooliſh? What hath the Poor, that knoweth
to walk before the Living?</hi> q. d. What hath a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and laborious Poor man leſſe of Contentment
than the Rich?</p>
               <p>3. Riches are unable to preſerve from, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
againſt, thoſe Evils to which Man is ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi>
Sickneſs, Pain, Grief, Sin, Wrath. <hi>Ver. 10. That which
hath been is named already, and it is known that it is
Man.</hi> i. e. Call him what you will; Wiſe, Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
Rich; why yet he is ſtill but Man, Weak,
Earthy, Frail, Mortal; and ſo, ſubject to thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
that attend Man.</p>
               <p>4. Abundance of Riches hath abundance of
Cares, Troubles, Diſtractions, Diſquietments,
<hi>Ver. 11. Seeing there are many things that increaſe
Vanity, what is Man the better?</hi> q. d. Many, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
Riches, think to encreaſe Happineſs; yet
they do but encreaſe Vanity: And if ſo, then Man
is ſo far from being the better, that he is the worſe
for them.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhewes how men are miſtaken in
thinking Happineſſe to lye in Riches; And the
ground of this miſtake is laid down in the words
of the Text, and that is; Mans ignorance of what
is good for him in this life; He thinks that good,
which is evil. <hi>For, who knoweth what is good for man
in this life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words are a Queſtionary Propoſal. <hi>Who
knoweth what is good for man in this Life?</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation
implies a Negation, and ſo reſolves it
ſelf into this univerſal negative Propoſition; No
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107590:17"/>
man knowes what is good for man in this life. One
great thing, about which the ignorance of man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
it ſelf, is this, What is good, and what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
for a man in this life.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion deducible from the words,
is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> No man infallibly knowes what is good, and
(<hi>ſo on the contrary</hi>) what is evill, for a man in
this Life.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Propoſition, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</p>
               <list>
                  <item>By way of
<list>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. For Explication. So we are to make two
Enquiries.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of what <hi>Good,</hi> this is to be underſtood.</item>
                  <item>2. Of what <hi>Men,</hi> this is to be underſtood: And
whether every man is concluded under the
Ignorance of what is good for a man in
this Life.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Conſider of what <hi>Good</hi> this Propoſition is to
be underſtood. So the Queſtion is, Whether no
man knoweth what is good for himſelf in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this, conſider,
What it is that we call <hi>good?</hi> That is <hi>Good</hi> that all
deſire. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is, <hi>Congruentia rei cum appetitu,</hi> It is
the ſuitableneſs and agreement of the thing to and
with the deſire; And hence it is, that <hi>bonum &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petibile;</hi>
what is good, and what is deſirable, are
the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now here is the Queſtion, when every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107590:17"/>
what is good, that, for all that, no man knows
What is good for a man; ſince every man knows
what it is that ſuites with his deſires.</p>
               <p>For the Anſwering of this Queſtion, we muſt
give-in ſome Diſtinctions.</p>
               <div n="1" type="distinction">
                  <head>1. Diſtinction is this;</head>

                  <p>There is <hi>Good real,</hi> and, <hi>Good in appearance.</hi> There
is that that is truly good, and that that ſeemeth
good but is truly evil; There is that that is good,
and that that only ſeems good.</p>
                  <p>Now when we tell you, No man knoweth what is
good for a man in this life; It is to be underſtood
of the former, not of the latter. No man knows
what is really good for him; He knows indeed
what is ſeemingly good for him, what pleaſeth
his carnal appetite and corrupt deſires; but what
is really good for him, Man knoweth not.</p>

                  <p>2. There is a <hi>Profitable good;</hi> And we muſt know
this, that things may be pleaſingly good, that are
not profitably good. Things may be toothſome,
that are not wholeſome. A man in the Fit of an
Ague, knows, Drinking much would be a pleaſing
good to him, when the Phyſitian knows, it would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107590:18"/>
not be a profitable good and ſo denyeth it.</p>
                  <p>Now the propoſition is to be underſtood of the
latter, not of the former. Every man knoweth
what is a pleaſing good. He knoweth, (as it is ſaid
of <hi>Iſſachar</hi>) Reſt is good, and Health is good; but
he knows not what is a profitable good for man.</p>

                  <p>So the Propoſition is to be underſtood of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not of the former. A man may know what is
good in it ſelf, when he may not know what is
good for him. A man may know, Riches are good,
when yet they may not be a convenient good for
him. <hi>Agur</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8. was <hi>Give me neither
Poverty nor Riches, feed me with food Convenient.</hi>
Though he ſaw, Riches were in themſelves good, yet
he queſtion'd whether they were a Convenient good
for him; and thereupon deſires a middle Eſtate,
between Poverty and Riches. So that, when we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107590:18"/>
tell you, No man knowes what is good for man in
this life, it is to be underſtood of a Convenient good.</p>

                  <p>1. There is good in reſpect of our apprehenſions.
So men, have their ſeveral apprehenſions of what is
good, and what is evil. One man apprehends Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
good for him, and Riches good for him; And
apprehends Diſgrace evil, and Poverty evil. A man
apprehends Health good, and Sickneſs evil, for him.</p>
                  <p>2. There is good in Gods Intention. And ſo the
Propoſition is to be underſtood of the latter, not
of the former. Though a man may know what is
good for himſelf in his own apprehenſion, yet he
knows not what is good for him in <hi>Gods Intention.</hi>
What a man apprehends to be good to him, may
be intended for evil; and what he apprehends as
evil, may be intended to him for good, Eccleſ. 9. 1.
<hi>No man knowes Love or Hatred by any thing that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</hi> The meaning is, That no man from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bleſſings, which are good in our apprehenſion,
can conclude that God loves him, and intends good
to him; And no man from outward Afflictions,
which are evil in a mans apprehenſion, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
hatred, or that He intends evil to him. So that
though a man knoweth what is good and evil for
him in his own Apprehenſion, yet he knoweth not
what is good or evil in God's Intention.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="distinction">
                  <head>5. Diſtinction:</head>
                  <q>There is <hi>Good,</hi> that is good in a General Notion

                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107590:19"/>
So the Propoſition is to be underſtood of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not of the former. This is granted, that a man
may know what is good and what is evil for him in
General; but a man knoweth not what is good
for him in ſuch a particular Caſe, and at ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Time. As <hi>Huſhai</hi> ſaid of <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
<hi>It is not good at this time;</hi> Why ſo what a man
looks upon as good for him, may not be good for
him at ſuch a time. Riches that ſeem to be Good
for a man, yet at ſome times may be Evil to a man.
As in Plundring times, it was a mans unhappineſſe
either to be, or to be thought, Rich.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus for the firſt thing,</hi> Of what Good this is to be
understood.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond thing to be Enquired after, is,
<hi>Of what Men, this is to be understood?</hi> So the Queſtion
is, Whether the Propoſition concludes all men,
without Exception, under this ignorance; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all from the knowledge of <hi>what is good for
them in this Life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Queſtion is concerning Godly men that
are ſanctified, and enlightned by the Spirit of God,
Whether are they as Ignorant in this particular,
as others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a great difference to be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Spiritual and the Natural man, in reſpect
of their knowledge of <hi>what is good or evil for a man
in this Life.</hi> A Godly man, not only knows what is
good for a man, in relation to the Life to come;
as Pardon of Sin, an Intereſt in Chriſt, &amp;c. but
alſo he knows more than others do <hi>what is good for a
man in this Life.</hi> He knows, that many things are
<hi>good</hi> for a man, that are apprehended to be <hi>evil;</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107590:19"/>
and he knows, there are many things <hi>evil</hi> for a man
that are look'd on as <hi>good.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was
good for him that he had been afflicted;</hi> when others
looked upon Afflictions as <hi>evil,</hi> he looked on them
as <hi>good</hi> for him. <hi>Agur</hi> prayed againſt <hi>Riches;</hi> why,
he knew they were <hi>evil</hi> for him, when others look
upon abundance as <hi>good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, conſider; a <hi>Godly</hi> man hath Four things to help
him in the knowledg of this, that others have not.</p>
                  <p>1. He hath the Spirit of God to inſtruct and
teach him <hi>what is good and evil for a man in this life.</hi>
When others are only led by Senſe, &amp; Opinion, the
Godly man is taught, and led by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>2. He hath the Sanctuary to go into, where he may
learn what is <hi>Good and Evil for a man in this Life.</hi>
There <hi>David</hi> tells you, that he attain'd to this
knowledg; and, till he went into the Sanctuary
he was ignorant of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 17.—<hi>till I went into
the Sanctuary.</hi> Till then, he thought it was <hi>ill</hi> for
good men, that they were <hi>afflicted;</hi> and that it was
<hi>good</hi> for wicked men, that they were in <hi>proſperity:</hi>
But when he came into the Sanctuary, he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>3. The Godly man hath <hi>convincing</hi> Experience,
by which he comes to know <hi>what is good and evil for
a man in this life.</hi> So that by experience, he knows
that to be <hi>good</hi> for him, that others think <hi>evil,</hi> Pſal.
119. 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been Afflicted.
David</hi> ſpeaks it from <hi>experience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Godly man hath the Promiſe to help
him too, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things work together for
good to them that Love God.</hi> So that, being ſuch as
Love God, they know all ſhall be for Good to
them, be it what it will. Though it ſeem Evil, yet
it ſhall work for Good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107590:20"/>
Theſe things Godly men have above others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are enabled above others to know what is
Good for them this in Life. And yet, for all this,
the Propoſition includes them too, as well as others.
It is true, <hi>Solomon</hi> (it is probable) means it chiefly
of the Natural and Unregenerate man; yet it
takes in the Godly man too, as one that knows
not what is Good for a man in this Life. And that
eſpecially in two Caſes:
<list>
                        <item>1. A Godly man knows not what is good for
a man, in all things.</item>
                        <item>2. He knows not what is good for a man, at
all times.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. A Godly man knows not what is good for a
man in <hi>all things. In this</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks)
<hi>they know but in part.</hi> And it appears thus; that
they have been denyed in their Requeſts, Praying
for that that God ſaw not Good for them. Thus
<hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> requeſted to have
gone into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And Gods deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them theſe Requeſts, muſt be interpreted Gods
not ſeeing that particular thing Good for them;
and that indeed it was not good for them: The
Will of God being the higheſt Rule of <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we find ſome of the Servants of God have
been blinded with <hi>paſſion</hi> in ſome of their <hi>requests;</hi>
as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Jonah;</hi> and God did not ſee it <hi>good</hi> to
grant them what they deſired. <hi>They Asked they
knew not what.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. A Godly man may not know what is good
for him, at <hi>all times.</hi> Of that they have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
till they have gone <hi>into the Sanctuary,</hi> and till
experience hath afterward taught it them. Time
was, when <hi>David,</hi> a Godly man, was miſtaken
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107590:20"/>
about the Afflictions of Godly men, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of Wicked men; till he went <hi>into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi>
Till then, he was as Ignorant as other men.
So that till then, a Godly man may be Ignorant of,
<hi>What is good for man in this life.</hi>

               <p>1. By Scripture. So we may gather, from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
two things, that may ſerve to aſſert the
truth of this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>1. Scripture acquaints us with what Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
men have met with in thoſe wayes, wherein
they have dreamt of nothing but <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi>
and <hi>advantage</hi> to themſelves. How, many have Ruin'd
themſelves, by that by which they thought to
have Rais'd themſelves. Scripture gives us many
Inſtances in this kind, of thoſe whoſe Table hath
been their Snare; and what they thought ſhould
have been for their Welfare, hath become their
Trap, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 22. And this ſhews how men have
been miſtaken in <hi>what is good for them.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
furniſheth us with many Inſtances; as thoſe
of <hi>Ahab,</hi> in compaſſing <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. <hi>Gehezi,</hi>
in getting the Talents of Silver from <hi>Naaman.
Achan,</hi> in ſtealing the Wedge of Gold, and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107590:21"/>
                  <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Garment. <hi>Haman,</hi> in ſcrewing himſelf
into the Favour and Affection of his Prince.
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> in asking a King; and in asking Quails.
Scripture ſhews us how theſe were miſtaken about
what was <hi>good</hi> for them. We may ſay of them, this,
That, had they known what had been <hi>good</hi> for them,
they would not have done what they did. <hi>Solomon,</hi>
in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 13. ſpeaks of an Evil that he had <hi>ſeen
under the Sun,</hi> viz. <hi>Riches kept for the owners thereof
to their hurt.</hi> Surely, if the <hi>owners</hi> had not thought
they had been for their <hi>good,</hi> they would not have
laid them up.</p>
               <p>2. Scripture acquaints us with this; That there
have been many, that, contrary to expectation,
have found thoſe things <hi>good</hi> for them that they
thought <hi>evil,</hi> and looked on them as <hi>Evils.</hi> As it
tells us of many, that found that to be <hi>evil</hi> to them,
that they thought to be <hi>good</hi> for them; ſo of many,
that have found that to be <hi>good</hi> for them, that they
thought to have been <hi>evil.</hi> Scripture furniſheth
us with Inſtances in this particular. And here time
would fail me to tell you
<list>
                     <item>1. Of <hi>Job,</hi> who looked upon himſelf, as the
moſt Miſerable man in the World; That
God had ſet him <hi>as a Mark to ſhoot at;</hi> as if
God would make <hi>ſport</hi> with him. He tells
you how God wrote <hi>bitter</hi> things againſt
him; Yet we ſee, all was for his <hi>good.</hi> And ſo
we ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 15. what end God made with
him: ſo that we ſee by that, that <hi>Job</hi> was
miſtaken about his Afflictions.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. confeſſeth, <hi>It is good
for me that I have been Afflicted.</hi> Conſider,
time was, when <hi>David</hi> did not think ſo.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107590:21"/>
Time was when <hi>David</hi> complained of them.
But ſee, he was afterwards of another mind,
and tells us, It was <hi>good</hi> for him that he was
<hi>afflicted.</hi> In Pſal. 73. (if he were the Penman of
it) you find there was a time when he was
envious at the proſperity of the Wicked,
and thought them the happieſt men; and
he was troubled at the adverſity of the
Godly, and thought them the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
men; but afterwards he confeſſeth
his ignorance and miſtake in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>To cloſe up this: If you look upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. you
ſhall find the Apoſtle ſpeaking to Chriſtians under
Affliction; and endeavours to convince them of
their miſtake about Afflictions, and that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon that as evil which was for their good. You
ſhall find, this is the ſcope of the Apoſtle in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that Chapter. And then, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. 8. 9.
He tells them they are Chaſtiſements, and that they
bring forth the quiet fruit of Righteouſneſs; q. d.
When you come to taſte the fruit of theſe <hi>Afflictions,</hi>
you will be of another <hi>minde:</hi> You will find, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your expectation, that <hi>good</hi> for you that
you thought <hi>evil.</hi> You muſt judge of the Tree by
the Fruit; and when you come to taſte the <hi>Fruit</hi> of
<hi>Afflictions,</hi> you will ſay, You were miſtaken in the
<hi>Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus for the Confirmation by Scripture.</p>
               <p>2. We come to ſhew the Grounds and Reaſons
of the Propoſition, Why no man infallibly knows
what is good for <hi>man</hi> in this life.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107590:22"/>
                  <item>So there is
<list>
                        <item>1. Some Reaſon of it, in Reſpect of
God.</item>
                        <item>2. Some reaſons of it, in reſpect of Man.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The Reaſon of it in Reſpect of God is this:
Becauſe God hath hid this knowledge from <hi>man,</hi>
and therefore, no <hi>man</hi> knoweth what is <hi>good</hi> for
<hi>man</hi> in this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any ask, For what reaſon God hath hid
this knowledg from man? I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. God hath done it to maintain his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.
It onely belongs to him who made the
creature to know what is <hi>good</hi> for the creature. It
belongs only to him who hath given life to man, to
know what is <hi>good</hi> for a man in this life. He knows
man beſt, and knows beſt what is good for man,
whether <hi>Riches</hi> or <hi>Poverty; Quietneſs</hi> or <hi>Trouble;
Health</hi> or <hi>Sickneſs; Life</hi> or <hi>Death.</hi> This knowledg
is too high and excellent for man. It is not for
man to know this, which God hath put in his own
Power.</p>
               <p>2. God doth it to keep man in a ſtate of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on him, and Submiſſion to him; That man
may know at whoſe finding he is, and at whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) of that God, who onely knows what
is <hi>good</hi> for man. God doth it, to take the creature
off from being his own Carver. He will have man
look to Him, and ſeek to Him, for what is good for
him. God hath hid this knowledge from man,
that man may <hi>pray</hi> both for the <hi>good</hi> things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>evills,</hi> of this life, with ſubmiſſion to the
will of God. <hi>Lord, I know not what is good, or what
is evill for me in this life; and therefore I leave my
ſelf to thee; and in thoſe things ſubmit my ſelf to thee:
Thou ſhalt Diſpoſe of me, Thou ſhalt Carve for me,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107590:22"/>
Thou ſhalt Guide me by thy Counſel, who onely knowest
what is good or evill for me in this life; Thou ſhalt
chuſe my condition for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God hides this knowledge from man, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
and make the Glory of his Wiſdom and Power
known, in working contrary to the apprehenſions,
hopes, and expectations of man.</p>
               <p>So the Wiſdom and Power of God ſhewes it
ſelf.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In a way of Juſtice, turning <hi>good</hi>
into <hi>evill.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In a way of Mercy, turning <hi>evill</hi>
into <hi>good.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. He ſhewes his Wiſdom and Power in a way of
Juſtice, cauſing what was apprehended by men as
good for them, to become <hi>evil</hi> to them, contrary to
their hopes and expectations. Thus the Lord cauſeth
ſome mens Tables to become their Snare; and
what they thought to have bin for their welfare, to
be their Trap. Thus the Lord lets ſome men lay up
Riches for their hurt, and ſuffers them to get Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to their ſhame. There is an expreſſion in
Mal. 2. 2. <hi>I will curſe your Bleſſings.</hi> God can make
ſeeming bleſſings to become Curſes. And in this his
Wiſdom and Power are Gloriouſly ſeen. God can
let a man think he hath a good thing in his hand,
and turn it into an evill. And hence it is, ſome
have curſed their Riches, and Honour, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Greatneſs, as <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>Spain</hi> did.</p>
               <p>2. He ſhewes his Wiſdom and Power in a way
of Mercy, in turning ſeeming <hi>evills</hi> into <hi>good.</hi> That
when a man thinks it to be an <hi>evill,</hi> God turns it
to <hi>good,</hi> contrary to a mans apprehenſion, hope,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107590:23"/>
and expectation. Thus, as he can turn the Rod
into a Serpent, ſo he can turn the Serpent into a
Rod: He can bring <hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evill,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> out
of <hi>darkneſſe.</hi> As he can turn a ſeeming <hi>bleſſing</hi> into
a <hi>curſe,</hi> ſo he can turn a ſeeming <hi>curſe</hi> into a <hi>bleſſing.</hi>
When <hi>Balack</hi> would have curſed <hi>Iſrael, Moſes</hi> tells
them, <hi>Deut. 23. 5. God turned it into a Bleſſing. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
brethren intended <hi>evil</hi> againſt him, but God
turned it into <hi>good,</hi> Gen. 50. 20. And upon this
account it is, that God hides the knowledg of what
is <hi>good</hi> for a man in this life from man, that he may
have a freedom and liberty of declaring his Wiſdom
and Power when he pleaſe, both in turning <hi>evill</hi>
into <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> into <hi>evill,</hi> contrary to mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
hopes, and expectations.</p>
               <p>4. God hath hid this knowledg from man, to keep
man humble in the midſt of his greateſt outward
enjoyments. That the great man may not glory in
his greatneſs, and that the rich man may not glory
in his riches; ſince he knows not whether they
are good for him. When a man conſiders this
with himſelf, I have Honour, but I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be for my <hi>good;</hi> I have Riches, but I know
not whether it be for my <hi>good:</hi> how humble ſhould
the conſideration of this make a man in the midſt
of theſe enjoyments? When he conſiders, Honour
hath been many a mans Snare; Riches, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
proſperity have been many a mans Trap, and
I know not but they may be ſo to me: how hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſhould this keep a man, when he knoweth not
whether they are for his <hi>good?</hi> God doth it to keep
man from boaſting of his enjoyments, <hi>Prov. 27. 1.
Boast not thy ſelf of to Morrow</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon:) for
thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</hi> So men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107590:23"/>
muſt not boaſt of their Wealth or Honour, ſince
they know not what they may bring forth. Thus
a man ſhould reaſon with himſelf; Why ſhould I be
proud of thoſe things which have proved evill to
ſome, and I know not but they may be ſo to me?</p>
               <p>5. God hath hid this knowledge from man, To
make man patient in <hi>affliction,</hi> and to make him
hope in the worſt condition: when a man conſiders
thus with himſelf, Alas I know not what is <hi>good</hi> for
me in this life: For ought I know, theſe afflictions
are good for me; and what reaſon have I then to
be impatient under them? why ſhould I fret and
murmur at theſe diſpenſations? Do I know what
theſe Croſſes and Afflictions may bring forth? Do
I know, but that <hi>good</hi> may lie in the womb of them?
The Tree may ſeem bitter, yet the Fruit may be
Sweet. The Roſe is Sweet, yet the Tree that bears
it, is Thorny. I know not, what Grapes may grow
upon theſe Thorns, and what Figs upon theſe
Thiſtles. When <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed <hi>David,</hi> what ſaid
<hi>David?</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 12. <hi>It may be the Lord will do me
good for this.</hi> God not onely knows how to do his
people <hi>good,</hi> but how to do them <hi>good</hi> by ſeeming
<hi>evills. It is good for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that I have been
Afflicted.</hi> Pſal. 119.</p>
               <p>6. God hath hid this knowledge from man, To
keep men from judging and cenſuring one another.
To keep the Rich from deſpiſing the poor, and to
keep the poor from envying the Rich. If a man
knew, that Riches were good for a man in this life,
and that Poverty were evill for a man; then
would Rich men look upon themſelves as the onely
bleſſed men, and judge of the poor as the only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
men. So that, as the Apoſtle ſaith of eating,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107590:24"/>
Rom. 14. 3. <hi>Let not him that eateth not, judge him
that eateth; and let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him
that eateth not;</hi> So will the Lord have it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, in this caſe: He will not have the Rich
and Great Ones of the world to deſpiſe the poor;
neither will he have the poor, and ſuch as are in a
low condition, to envy the Rich. And, to prevent
this, the Lord hath hid this knowledg from man,
of what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill</hi> for him in this life. Thou,
o Rich man, knoweſt not but that thy riches may be
for thy hurt, Why ſhouldſt thou then deſpiſe the
poor? And what knoweſt thou, O poor man, but
thy poverty may be for thy <hi>good;</hi> and why then
ſhouldſt thou envy the Rich? This is the diſeaſe
to which Rich and Poor are ſubject; The Rich are
apt to deſpiſe the poor, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 6. And the poor
are apt to envy the Rich, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 1. And the Lord,
for the curing of this diſeaſe in both, hath hid this
knowledge from man.</p>
               <p>7. God hath hid this knowledg from man, To
let man ſee that the things of this life are not the
things (<hi>viz.</hi>) the only things and the main things,
that a man ſhould look after. He doth it to let man
know, that outward evils are not evils to be feared,
for they may be for <hi>good:</hi> And that outward <hi>good
things,</hi> are not the onely <hi>good things</hi> to be ſought
after; for they may be for a mans hurt. And ſo
the reaſon why God hides this knowledg from man
of knowing what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill</hi> for man in this
life, is, That he may eſpecially ſeek after thoſe things
that are <hi>good,</hi> and fly from thoſe evils that have
relation to another life. Thoſe things that we call
<hi>good,</hi> viz. things of this life, are but things <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
good;</hi> they are things may become evil to a man,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107590:24"/>
and therefore not the only good things to be <hi>ſought
after;</hi> And thoſe things, that we call evil, are but
<hi>changeably evil,</hi> ſuch <hi>evils</hi> as may be for <hi>good;</hi> and
therefore not the only <hi>evils</hi> to be <hi>fled from.</hi> There
are <hi>good things</hi> that are <hi>unchangeably good,</hi> which are
<hi>good</hi> for a man in relation to another life, and theſe
are the things mainly to be ſought after. And there
are <hi>evils</hi> that are <hi>unchangeably evil,</hi> which are <hi>evil</hi>
for a man in relation to another life; and thoſe are
the <hi>evils</hi> that are moſt to be feared and fled from.</p>
               <p>8. God hath hid this knowledg from man, To keep
man in a preparation for all conditions: That ſince
he knows not what is <hi>good</hi> for man in this life, he
may be prepared for what God ſeeth <hi>good</hi> for him;
that he may be fitted for all the diſpenſations and
purpoſes of God concerning him. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayeth
<hi>Prov. 27. 1. Thou knowest not what a day may bring
forth.</hi> And why hath God hidden that knowledg
from man, but that a man may be prepared for
what ever a day ſhall bring forth, whether <hi>good</hi> or
<hi>evil, mercies</hi> or <hi>miſeries, life</hi> or <hi>death. Solomon</hi> in
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 14. ſpeaking of proſperity and adverſity,
ſaith, <hi>God hath ſet them, the one over against the other,
that Man may find out nothing after him.</hi> There
is Chequer-work in the Diſpenſations of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man in this life. There is Black and White;
There are Fair and Foul, Sunſhine and Rainy days
Intermingled; There is Proſperity and Adverſity,
changes of Conditions. And mark, God hath ſet
the one over againſt the other, there is Adverſity,
oppoſite to Proſperity; there is a Vally, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Hill. And ſee for what end? <hi>That Man
may find out nothing after him.</hi> What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that? why this, That man ſhould not know
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107590:25"/>
what ſhall come afterwards, or what ſhall come next,
whether Proſperity or Adverſity, that so he may
be prepared for both. When God hath ſet a man
upon a Mountain of Proſperity, he cannot aſſure
himſelf he ſhall alwayes ſtand there; for there is
the Valley of Adverſity ſet over againſt that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and he knoweth not how ſoon he may be in
it. And ſo, ſince he knows not what may be next,
God will have him keep himſelf in a preparation
for all conditions. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>I have learned to be full, and to be hungry; to abound,
and to want.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I am prepared for
what God ſees <hi>good</hi> for me; if he ſee it <hi>good</hi> for me
to be in a low condition, to be hungry and to want,
I am prepared for it, I am prepared for all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And this is one reaſon, why God hath hid this
Knowledg from man, that man may be prepared for
all <hi>Conditions.</hi> There is an expreſſion in <hi>Eccleſ. 8. 7.
Man knoweth not, what ſhall be.</hi> And what is the
reaſon that man knows not what ſhall be? why this,
That man may be prepared for what ever ſhall be.</p>
               <p>9. God hath hid this knowledg from man, To
ſhew man the vanity of his thoughts, and to let
man ſee how his thoughts differ from the thoughts
of God. As the Lord ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Esa. 55. 8.
My Thoughts are not as your thoughts.</hi> So the Lord
will have men know, that his thoughts and mans
thoughts, are not the ſame in reſpect of what is <hi>good</hi>
or <hi>evill</hi> for a man in this life. God doth it to ſhew
man his thoughts and the vanity of them. Man
thinks that <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> are good for him in
this life, and God lets him ſee how he is miſtaken
in his thoughts, by their becoming <hi>evil</hi> to him; And
man thinks <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>evil</hi> for him in this life,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107590:25"/>
and God lets man ſee how he is miſtaken in his
thoughts, by turning them to <hi>good.</hi> Thus God ſhews
man the miſtake and vanity of his thoughts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for man in this life.
And ſo the Lord diſcovers to man the vanity of his
thoughts in this particular, in three things.</p>
               <p>1. In thinking thoſe happy, that enjoy the <hi>good</hi>
things of this life; when alas, poor man knoweth
not but theſe things are evil for him. Thus the
Lord in turning mens Tables into Snares, ſhewes
His Thoughts are not as man's. We read of ſome,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15. that <hi>call'd the Proud, Happy:</hi> They
thought wicked men were the happieſt men; But
God tells them he would have a time to ſhew them
the vanity of their thoughts, <hi>v.</hi> laſt. <hi>Then ſhall ye
return, and diſcern between the Righteous and the
Wicked.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You ſhall ſee, My
Thoughts were not as your thoughts. Men are ready
to think, the Rich man the happy man, and the
Great man the happy man. And thus he diſcovers
to man the vanity of his thoughts, and to let them
know, that they know not the thoughts of the
Lord. As the expreſſion is, <hi>Micah 4. 12. But they
know not the Thoughts of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In his thinking them the only miſerable men
that are <hi>afflicted;</hi> it is uſual with men to do ſo: And
God by hiding from man what is <hi>good</hi> for man in
this life, diſcovers to man the vanity of thoſe
thoughts. Thus, by making <hi>afflictions good</hi> for
a man, they come to ſee they were miſtaken in
their thoughts, and find that Gods thoughts were
not as their thoughts. God in this, gives man to
ſee his folly in giving a judgment of thoſe things
he knows not. And to let man ſee, that while he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107590:26"/>
profeſſeth himſelf wiſe, he becomes a fool, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22
That he is miſtaken about the intentions of God,
ſince what he apprehended <hi>evil,</hi> was by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for <hi>good.</hi> God by this lets men ſee how
much their apprehenſions and His intentions differ.
How hath the Lord brought men to acknowledg
their folly in this particular. Thus he that was the
Penman of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. tells you at <hi>verſ. 22. So fooliſh
was I and Ignorant!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. In his judging of the intentions of Gods
heart, by the diſpenſations and operations of His
hand; And for this reaſon God hath hid this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from man, to ſhew man the vanity of his
thoughts, and his judgings, in that particular.
Though Gods heart and hand go together, yet
not alwayes ſo as men imagine. Men think, where
there is a loving heart, there ſhould be a bleſſing
hand; and where there is an afflicting hand,
there ſhould be an hating heart. God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth
things in a myſtery; But God will give
man to know, he underſtands not that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
Man is ready to think, God intendeth <hi>good</hi>
to that man to whom he diſpenſeth <hi>good</hi> things,
(I mean) things temporally <hi>good;</hi> and that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
evil to that man, to whom he diſpenſeth
things temporally <hi>Evil.</hi> Now the Lord by hiding
this knowledg from man, will let man ſee how
he is miſtaken in theſe thoughts, and will let him
know, that, with a loving heart, there may go an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
hand; and with an hating heart, an hand
that is ſeemingly a bleſſing hand; That there may
be <hi>good</hi> in his intention, when there may be ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>evil</hi> in his Diſpenſation. When God Afflicts,
and Chaſtiſeth, and Corrects, Who would think
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107590:26"/>
there were <hi>good</hi> in His Intention? and yet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
10. <hi>He chasteneth us for our profit. Rev. 3. 19. As
many as I love, I Rebuke and Chasten.</hi> Remember
that, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 1. No man knowes love or hatred by
what is before him;</hi> he knoweth not the Intentions
of God by his Diſpenſations; he knoweth not Gods
Heart by Gods Hand.</p>
               <p>And thus for the Ground in General, Why God hath
hid the Knowledg of what is Good or Evil for a
man in this life.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>I Now come to give you the Particular <hi>Reaſons,</hi>
why no man knoweth what is <hi>good</hi> for a man
in this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Ground of it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Mans inability to know what is <hi>good</hi> for
a man in this <hi>life.</hi> So conſider; Man is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to make a judgement of Conditions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
to ſay, what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for a man in
this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ignorance of man is great in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and I ſhall ſhew you it to be ſuch, that it is
not poſſible for a man, as man, to give a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what is <hi>good</hi> for a man in this <hi>life.</hi> And
that in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>I. A man knoweth not what the ſpirits and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of men are, and therefore he cannot
know what is a fit and <hi>convenient good</hi> for them in
this <hi>life.</hi> We know not, what will fit a mans ſpirit
and diſpoſition, unleſs we know his ſpirit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107590:27"/>
He knoweth not the foot, and therefore
knoweth not what ſhooe will fit him. <hi>No man</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>knows the things of a man,</hi> and
ſo he knowes not the ſpirits and diſpoſitions of
men. Nay let me tell you more, Man knoweth not
his own ſpirit and diſpoſition, and how a condition
will ſuit with it. Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>Luk. 9. 55.
They knew not of what ſpirit they were.</hi> And then,
man knoweth not, what is a fit and <hi>convenient good</hi>
for himſelf. It is with men in this caſe, as with
ſome that drink Wine, who find it pleaſant, but
know not the ſtrength of it, nor the ſtrength
of their own heads to bear it, and ſo come
to be diſtemper'd by it before they are aware.
Every man thinks proſperity <hi>good</hi> for him,
when as all men can no more bear a proſperous
condition, then all heads can bear Wine or ſtrong
Drink. Man knowes not how a condition will ſuit
with his diſpoſition, till they meet. We have a
Famous Inſtance in <hi>Hazael, 2 King.</hi> 8. 13. when
he heard what was propheſied of him, he thought
the doing of ſuch things did better ſuit with the
nature of a Dog then of a Man; and therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<hi>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do ſo?</hi>
But what is the Prophets reply? <hi>The Lord hath
ſhewed me, that thou ſhalt be King over</hi> Syria, q. d.
The change of thy condition will preſently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that diſpoſition to be in thee, that now thou
wilt not believe is in thee.</p>
               <p>All men know not what Lyons and Wolves lie
ſleeping in their boſoms, till they are awakened.
Like the Snake in the Snow, that doth not ſtir and
hiſſe, till it feel the warmth of the fire of proſperity.</p>
               <p>Every man is apt to think his head can bear the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107590:27"/>
Wine of Proſperity till he drink of it. As the Sons
of <hi>Zebedee</hi> anſwered Chriſt, when he asked them,
Can ye Drink of the Cup that I muſt Drink of, and
be Baptiſed with the Baptiſm I muſt be Baptiſed
with, and they anſwered, <hi>We are able.</hi> So ask a man,
whether he be fit and able to bear a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
whether he be fit for Honour and Riches?
why, he is ready to anſwer, that he is able; when
alas, he knoweth not his own ſpirit and diſpoſition.
And therefore, through a ſuſpition of this, <hi>Agur</hi>
prayed, <hi>Prov. 30. 8. That God would give him neither
Poverty nor Riches;</hi> And why he prayed againſt
riches, he gives the reaſon, <hi>lest I be full and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
Thee.</hi> Why, he did not know under what Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
Riches might bring him: They might be
ſuch ſtrong drink that his head would not bear.
And in this he ſhew'd he was Ignorant of his own
ſpirit it and diſpoſition; he was afraid that Riches
would not ſuit with it.</p>
               <p>II. Man is ignorant of this, how Men will manage
their conditions, and thereupon is unable to give,
and make a Judgement of them. Man knoweth not,
how a man will uſe, and improve his condition.
Things prove <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> to men according to their
management of them. There is an Art of managing
conditions, which moſt men are ignorant of; a
condition that might be for a mans <hi>good,</hi> through
the ill-managing of it, becomes <hi>evil.</hi> It is the ſaying
of one, that, Every thing hath two handles. And
ſo it is in reſpect of Conditions, they have two
handles. And here is the thing, to take Proſperity
and Adverſity, to take every condition by the right
handle. Now in this the Ignorance of man is ſeen.
In his taking of things by the wrong handle; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107590:28"/>
ſo taking of conditions by wrong handles, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
evil; whereas if they would take them by the
right handle, that condition might be for <hi>good</hi> to
them that otherwiſe is not. So man knoweth not
by what handle men will tak hold of Conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> hath an expreſſion, <hi>Eccleſ. 8. 6. To every
purpoſe there is time and judgment; therefore the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of man is great on him.</hi> The meaning is this,
That, God having put handles to things, and men
not laying hold on the right handle, his not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to do things, and when to do things, makes
the miſeries of man great upon him. So it is in
reſpect of conditions; ſeeming mercies become mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
becauſe men know not how to uſe them;
and ſeeming miſeries would become mercies, if men
did but know how to uſe them.</p>
               <p>It is in this caſe with us as with children, who, if
you give them a knife, know not to make any other
uſe of it then to cut and wound themſelves; and
ſo, moſt men know not how to make any other uſe of
their conditions, then to hurt themſelves.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that no man knowes what is <hi>good</hi>
for man in this life, what condition is <hi>good</hi> for him,
whether a proſperous or an adverſe condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knowes not how he will manage his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>The wrong Uſe man makes of Conditions, makes
it impoſſible to man to give a judgment of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And through this ignorance it comes to
paſſe, that things prove to be <hi>evil</hi> for a man, that
might have been for <hi>good.</hi> Upon this account
many a mans Table becomes his Snare, and what
might have been for his Welfare becomes his Trap.
Thus by his abuſing things, he makes <hi>Bleſſings</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:107590:28"/>
become <hi>Curſes;</hi> and ſo thoſe things become <hi>Evil</hi>
that might have been for <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>Thus it is in reſpect of
<list>
                        <item>Proſperity.</item>
                        <item>Adverſity.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. For Proſperity; How do many abuſe it to the
feeding of their luſts, whereby that becomes
<hi>evil</hi> to them that might have been for <hi>good?</hi> and ſo
by their ill managing of a condition, make that
condition to become <hi>evil</hi> to them that might have
bin for <hi>good.</hi> Why thus they draw <hi>evil</hi> out of
<hi>good;</hi> as when a Spider draws Poyſon out of a
Flower, it is not from the Flower but the Nature
of the Spider; that, turns it into Poyſon.</p>
               <p>2. For Adverſity; Why there are many that
do want the Art of making <hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evil;</hi> and
ſo that becomes <hi>evill</hi> to them, that through their
wiſe managing of it might have been for <hi>good.</hi> Men
have learned the Art of making Wind and Water
ſerviceable to them. We have a Saying of making
a vertue of Neceſſity, and ſo there is an Art to make
<hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evil:</hi> but man knowes it not.</p>
               <p>That man will never be a good Bowler that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how to ſet the Byaſſe of his Bowle. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
have their Byaſſes: and here is the Art and
Skill, to ſet the Byaſſe of a Condition right.</p>
               <p>III. Man knoweth not to what Dangers, Evils,
and Temptations, mens conditions may Expoſe
them; and therefore they are not able to give a
judgment of conditions, and to ſay what is <hi>good</hi>
for a man in this life. We may look upon thoſe
things as <hi>good</hi> for a man which may expoſe him to
ſuch temptations and dangers that may be for his
hurt and ruine. Remember, there are no outward
or worldly <hi>good</hi> things, but do expoſe men to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107590:29"/>
many Evils, Dangers, and Temptations, and
ſo become <hi>evil</hi> to a man in this <hi>life.</hi> Thus we find,
Honour, Riches, outward Proſperity, do expoſe
a man to Envy. As one ſaith of <hi>Naboth,</hi> It had
been better for him he had not had a Vineyard,
it coſt him his life. Theſe things have coſt a man
his ſweeteſt things, (<hi>viz.</hi>) his Liberty and Life. How
many men had lived longer, had they not had ſuch
and ſuch things, wherein they ſeemed to excel and
to be more happy then other men. And ſo the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian
ſaith of the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, That they
got nothing by their Honour, <hi>niſi ut citius inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficerentur,</hi>
but to be kill'd the ſooner. We read of
<hi>Eſius Proculus,</hi> that he was Slain by <hi>Caligula,</hi> for
being the handſomeſt Man in <hi>Rome.</hi> Beauty and
Handſomneſs was for his hurt. And <hi>Seneca</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for being too Eloquent, though, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of one of the Emperour's Lemans his
life was ſpared. And hence it is, a man is not able
to give a judgment of things, becauſe he knows
not what their iſſue may be, and what dangers they
may bring a man under; becauſe experience ſhews,
that it had been <hi>good</hi> for ſome men to have bin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thoſe things, that, in the eyes of ſome, ſeemed
to be <hi>good</hi> for them. That, as our Saviour ſaid of
<hi>Judas, It had bin good for that man, if he had not bin
born;</hi> So we may ſay of ſome, it had been <hi>good</hi> for
them, if they never had had Honour, Riches, Beauty,
and other things that moſt men look upon, as <hi>good</hi>
for a man in this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Man knoweth not what Snares Satan hath laid
in a <hi>Condition,</hi> to catch and entrap a man in; and
therefore is not able to give or make a judgment
of outward conditions. Through his devices, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107590:29"/>
condition may become <hi>evil</hi> that ſeemed to be for
<hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Satan is a ſubtil Adverſary, and he ſeeks to get
an advantage againſt us by the conditions we are
in. He endeavours to make every condition, a
Snare and a Trap to us. He ſtrives to make Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
out of our Conditions. He knows how to
make uſe of our Conditions to advantage himſelf,
and to hurt us. And man knows not what Snares
Satan may lay for a man in a condition, and what
advantage he may make of it to hurt a man, and
therefore no certain Judgment can be made of it.
Satan is a careful and diligent Obſerver, as of our
Conſtitutions, ſo of our Conditions, and will be
ſure to ſuit his Temptations to them. He hath his
Temptations for all Conditions, whether High or
Low, whether Proſperous or Adverſe.</p>
               <p>1. If a man be in a Proſperous Condition, why
there are Evils he Tempts a man to, in that Eſtate.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>And thoſe, both

               <p>I. <hi>Moral.</hi> So conſider theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. Pride and High-mindedneſs. Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
inclines a man to it, and here Satan
ſayles with Wind and Tide, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.
17. <hi>Charge them that be Rich in this world
that they be not High-minded.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Boaſting and Glorying in their Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
with a Contemning of thoſe
whoſe Condition is meaner, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.
23. <hi>Let not the Rich man Glory in his

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107590:30"/>
3. Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, <hi>Prov. 22. 7.
The Rich Man Ruleth over the Poor.</hi>
Or, as it may be read, <hi>Domineereth.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. Luxury, and Profuſeneſs, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs.
As the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> And <hi>Dives</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>Spiritual Evils</hi> there are, to which a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
Condition Inclines a man, and to which
Satan will be ready to Tempt a man: and theſe
are Three:
<list>
                     <item>1. Forgetting God and forgetting Duty.
And upon this Account it was, <hi>Agur</hi>
prayed againſt Riches, <hi>Prov. 30. 9. Lest
I be full, and forget Thee.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Creature-Confidence. We find the
Scripture frequent in giving Cautions
concerning that, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17. That
men ſhould not trust in uncertain
Riches.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Security, We read of the Rich man
in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke 12 19. who bid his
Soul take its eaſe, it had goods laid up for
many years.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Why thus you ſee a Proſperous Condition hath
its Temptations; and all theſe ways, Satan is
ready to get an advantage of a man that is in
that condition?</p>
               <p>Now who can give a Judgement of a mans
Condition when it is Proſperous, when he
knoweth not but it may caſt him into ſome of
theſe Evills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107590:30"/>
2. If a man be in an Adverſe Condition, why
that hath its Temptations too. When a mans
Condition is low, then Satan Tempts him to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
Diſcontent, Impatiency, Envy, uſe of
Unlawful means. And, upon this Account, <hi>Agur</hi>
prayed againſt Poverty, <hi>Prov. 30. Lest I be Poor
and Steal.</hi> He ſaw, that condition had its Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>Why thus you ſee, every Condition hath its
Temptations: and, How ſhall man be able to make
a Judgment of Conditions, when he knows not
what Temptations he may fall under, by reaſon of
his Condition; when we know not, but Satan,
through his Wiles and Devices, may make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<hi>evil</hi> for a man, that elſe might have been
for his <hi>good;</hi> how he may make that Condition his
Snare, that might have been for his Welfare?</p>
               <p>V. Man cannot make a Judgment of what is <hi>good</hi>
or <hi>evil</hi> for a man in this life, becauſe he knoweth
not, what the wheel is that is within the Wheel.
We read <hi>Ezek. 1. Of the wheel in the wheel.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
there is the outward wheel of Diſpenſation
that is viſible to us, and there is a ſecret wheel of
Providence within that wheel. So that when we
look upon the outward wheel of Proſperity, or
Adverſity, we know not what Wheel moves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thoſe wheels. We ſee how the outward wheel
moves, but we know not what the motions are of
the Wheel within; Its motions may be croſs to
the wheel without.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider how it is in reſpect of Proſperity.
There is an outward wheel that is viſible, and
ſeems to move to a mans Honour, Exaltation, and
Advancement in the world; and yet we know not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107590:31"/>
what croſs motions the ſecret wheel of Providence
may have to the External wheel of Diſpenſation:
While the outward wheel ſeems to move to a mans
Good, and Honour, and Advantage; the inward
wheel (for ought we know) may be moving to a
mans Hurt and Ruine. According to the ſaying
of the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>—Tolluntur in altum</l>
                     <l>Vt lapſu graviore ruant—</l>
                  </q>
Their lifting up, may tend to their caſting down.
While the outward wheel may ſeem to raiſe them,
and mount them; The wheel within, may move
to the undoing and Deſtruction of them. We have
a notable Inſtance of this in <hi>Haman:</hi> There was an
outward wheel moving to his Raiſing and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
to the ſetting of him High in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his Prince, and who (that had lookt upon
that) would not have thought, this had been for
<hi>Hamans</hi> good? But ſee, there was a Wheel within
the wheel, a Croſs-wheel that was then moving
to <hi>Hamans</hi> downfall, and <hi>Hamans</hi> ruine.</p>
               <p>II. For Adverſity, why you ſhall find ſometimes
the outward Wheel ſeemingly moving to a mans
Hurt, and Ruine, and Diſadvantage, when yet
we know not the motions of the Wheel, that are
within the wheel. There may be within that
wheel, a Wheel of Providence moving to a mans
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>advantage.</hi> Thus it was in the caſe of
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was caſt into a Pit, when he
was ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he was caſt into Priſon by
his Maſter; Who would have thought but that this
outward wheel of Diſpenſation had moved to
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ruine; and yet, at the ſame time, there
was a Wheel within this wheel moving to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107590:31"/>
Advancement of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and to the making him
Ruler over all the Land of <hi>Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> So in the caſe
of <hi>Job:</hi> When he was ſtript of all to a Shoo-latchet,
when he was bereaved of his Goods, Cattel, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Health, Who would have thought but this
wheel of Diſpenſation had moved to the Ruine
and utter undoing of <hi>Job?</hi> And yet, at the ſame
time, there was a wheel moving within this wheel
to his <hi>good</hi> and advantage, as you may read in his
Story. So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jam. 5. 11. You have
heard of the Patience of Job, and have ſeen the end
of the Lord.</hi> God's end in all was <hi>Jobs good,</hi> though
the outward Wheel of Diſpenſation ſpake it
not.</p>
               <p>So this is one reaſon, why a man knoweth not
what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for a man in this life; becauſe no
man knows the motions of the Wheel of ſecret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
within the wheel of outward Diſpenſation.
We know not what is the end of the Lord in a mans
Proſperity or Adverſity; our ſight is not clear
and peircing enough to diſcern the wheel within,
and what Its motions are: When we ſee a man
Great, and Rich, and Honourable, we cannot ſay,
He is an happy man, and that it is <hi>good</hi> for him to
be ſuch; becauſe we know not the end of the Lord.
And ſo, when we ſee a man poor, and low, and in
an afflicted condition, we cannot ſay, That man is
miſerable, or, that it is evil for him; becauſe in this
Diſpenſation we know not the end of the Lord;
we know not how the wheel within moves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ</hi> 6. Man knoweth not what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for
a man in this life, becauſe of that ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
changeableneſs that there is in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Man's ignorance of this, diſables him to make a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107590:32"/>
judgment of outward Conditions. If a man could
make the things of this life certain, why then he
might make a judgment of them; but, the comfort
in them and the enjoyment of them being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
Who can make a true and perfect judgment
of them? The things themſelves are uncertain,
and the <hi>good</hi> in them changeable; and, Who is the
man then that can ſay, That things, that are ſo full
of uncertainty and ſo changeable, are <hi>good</hi> for a man
in this life? <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 14. ſpeaking of
Conditions, ſaith, <hi>God hath ſet Proſperity and
Adverſity one over against the other,</hi> as a Vally
over againſt a Mountain: So that, when a man
lookes upon himſelf as ſet upon the Mountain of
Proſperity, he ſeeth a Valley of Adverſity over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: why, he ſeeth a change of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before him; and though he ſtand at preſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mountain of Proſperity, yet he ſees below
him a Valley of Adverſity, which he knoweth not
how ſoon he may deſcend into. And, who can ſay,
Proſperity is <hi>good</hi> for him, when he ſeeth Adverſity
over againſt him?</p>
               <p>So conſider: upon this account, it is impſſioble
that a man ſhould make a perfect judgment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Since
<list>
                        <item>1. Conditions are Changeable.</item>
                        <item>2. The Good and Comfort in a Condition
is Changeable.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The Condition is changeable. An Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
Rich, &amp; Proſperous Condition is changeable:
and then, what is man the better for being in ſuch
a condition? <hi>Pſal. 49. 20. Man being in Honour
continueth not.</hi> And yet ſee, Men had other thoughts
<hi>verſ. 11. Their inward thoughts was, that their houſes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107590:32"/>
ſhould continue for ever.</hi> They thought, It was <hi>good</hi>
for a man to have Houſes and Poſſeſſions, becauſe
they looked upon theſe things as conſtant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during,
and laſting; They thought their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
laſting, and that they ſhould leave them to
thoſe that would continue their memory for ever,
that is, to their Children; which are, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
multiplied and continued. Which, as one
ſaith, is but <hi>Nodoſa Aeternitas,</hi> a knotty Eternity;
as when one thread is ſpun and broken, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thread is knit to it: Thus men dream of a
continued Succeſſion. But what ſaith the <hi>Pſalmist?</hi>
This their way, is their folly; for man being in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
continueth not. Conſider, there is a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
in all outward conditions; there may be
a ſudden turn of Providence. <hi>Job</hi> the Richeſt man
in the Eaſt, loſt all (as it were) in an inſtant. All
the wit, and care, and induſtry, and providence
of man, cannot hinder the Providence of God from
making conditions changable. And conſidering this,
Who can ſay, This or that condition is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi>
for a man, when he knoweth not how that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may change? What if a proſperous condition
ſhould change? why then, it had been better a man
had not known it; It making a man but more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
to have been happy, and then to be miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>2. Though the Condition it ſelf ſhould continue,
yet the comfort in the condition is changeable:
why, the things of a condition, that ſeems good and
comfortable and deſirable, are changeable. The
things of ſuch a condition may become a Croſs,
and Burden, and Vexation; ſuch a changeableneſs
there is in the comforts of a condition that ſeemeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107590:33"/>
good for a man. <hi>Augustus</hi> had three Daughters,
and all of them very lew'd; and he was uſed to
call them his <hi>Tria Carcinωmata</hi> his three Ulcers
or Botches; And was uſed to ſay, <hi>Vtinam aut caelebs
vixiſſem, aut orbus periiſſem,</hi> I would I had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
or died without Children. Life and Light
are two of the ſweeteſt things, and yet a man may
out-live the comfort of them; they may prove a
burden to a man as to <hi>Job</hi> (Job 3. 20) <hi>Why is life given
to the Afflicted, and light to the bitter in Soul?</hi> Let
me tell you; Thoſe things, that are looked on as the
greateſt earthly comforts, may become a mans
Burthens and Afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. Man cannot make a perfect judgment of
what is <hi>good</hi> for him, and ſo on the contrary what is
<hi>evil</hi> for him in this life; becauſe there are but few
that have the right Art and way of judging of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
and ſo are apt to call <hi>good evil,</hi> and <hi>evil good;</hi>
and ſo are diſabled from knowing what is <hi>good</hi> for a
man in this life. I ſhall name ſome of thoſe ways,
by which moſt judge of the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Opinion.</item>
                  <item>2. Senſe.</item>
                  <item>3. Affection.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. Moſt judge of Conditions by Opinion; they
take things to be as they account them. It is Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that makes things to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> to ſome,
that, if rightly conſidered, are not ſo. Thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are looked upon as <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> according
as they are in our Opinion. It was the ſaying of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,
Levis est Dolor, ſi nil Opinio adjecerit,</hi> The miſery
would be little, if our Opinion did not adde to it.
<hi>Opinion</hi> is a leight judgment of things, by which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107590:33"/>
things are <hi>good</hi> in the imagination, but never arrive
at the underſtanding to be made <hi>Reaſon.</hi> It is an ill
<hi>Guide,</hi> and therefore ſome call it the <hi>Guide of Fools,</hi>
when <hi>Reaſon</hi> is the <hi>Guide of the Wiſe.</hi> Moſt men
judg of Conditions by Opinion, and ſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
they ſhould make a right Judgment of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for a man in this <hi>life.</hi>
And therefore, we find the Scripture ſetting it
ſelf to oppoſe and croſs the Opinions of Men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> for a man in this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jam. 5. 1. Howl ye Rich Men, &amp;c.</hi> Now it is
the Opinion of moſt, that Rich men have cauſe to
Rejoyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prov. 15. 16. Better is a little with the Fear of the
Lord, then great Treaſures with Trouble.</hi> This croſſeth
the general Opinion of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal. 37. 16. A little that a Righteous man hath,
is better then the Riches of many Wicked.</hi> Now the
Opinion of the World is, That much, is alwayes
better then little.</p>
               <p>One place more, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. It is better to go to the Houſe of Mourning,
then to go to the houſe of Feasting. <hi>But moſt men
think not ſo.</hi> Verſ. 3. Sorrow is better then laughter.
<hi>But this croſſeth the general Opinion of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Another way by which men Judg of the <hi>Good</hi>
or <hi>Evil</hi> of Conditions, is by <hi>Senſe.</hi> They judg of the
<hi>good</hi> &amp; <hi>evil</hi> of things, according as they are pleaſing
or diſpleaſing to their Senſes. They judg of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as many do of Meats, who judg of them
by the taſte, and ſo take them to be Wholſome that
are Toothſome: And ſo, on the contrary, thoſe
meats Unwholſome that are Unpleaſant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Apoſtle tells thoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. how they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107590:34"/>
were miſtaken about their Condition, which was
then a Suffering Condition; <hi>No Affliction</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>for the preſent ſeemeth Joyous but Grievous.</hi> Why,
Senſe at the preſent can feel no good in it, <hi>But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it bringeth forth the quiet Fruit of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
This way of judging deceived <hi>Eve:</hi> She ſaw the
Fruit was deſirable, it looked fair to the Eye. Thus
many are deceived about their Conditions. They
are like the Book St. <hi>John</hi> eatt, As Hony in the
Mouth, but in the Belly, as bitter as Gall. Thus
men look upon Conditions, whether they are Hony
in the Mouth; they look no further, whether they
may not prove Gall in the Belly. Why, thus moſt
judg of Conditions by Senſe; and while they judg
ſo, it is impoſſible for them to know, what is <hi>good</hi> or
<hi>evil</hi> for them in this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Some make a judgment of Conditions, by
their ſinfully-ſenſual Affections, and ſo account that
good for them in this life, that ſuits with their Luſts
and Inordinate Deſires. Thus men come to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
with the appearance of <hi>Good,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Real
Good.</hi> Moſt men take the word of their Luſts, and
corrupt and ſinful Deſires, concerning what is
<hi>good</hi> for them. As <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give her me, for
ſhe pleaſeth me well.</hi> Since the Fall, man rather
conſults with his own Corrupt deſires then any
thing elſe, and makes them his Oracle; at which,
he enquires about the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> of things: and
while they ſeek to that Oracle, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that <hi>Good</hi> muſt be rejected under the Notion
of <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> lookt upon as deſirable under the
Notion of <hi>good.</hi> Affections ſenſually-ſinful, are
wofully blinded in judging of Conditions.</p>

undertake things, and adventure on them hand over

without any Circumſpection, Conſideration, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Foreſight or Providential Care, as in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
&amp;c. Why, ſome may ſay; I know not what

how it will. So the Queſtion is, Whether this
Truth, do not deny and deſtroy all Care of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</p>

                  <p>I ſhall give an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Question.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. General.</item>
                     <item>2. Particular.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. <hi>General.</hi> So I Anſwer; That, notwithſtanding
it ſo falls out that <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>good</hi> for a man, yet
they may be lawfully prayed againſt. And this
Truth I ſhall clear up to you, by four things.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Afflictions</hi> are, in their own Nature, Fruits and
Effects of Sin, and ſuch as Nature abhors; ſuch
are Sickneſs, Poverty, all ſorts of Loſſes and Croſſes;
they were brought in by Sin. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Rom. 5. 12. Sin entred into the world, and Death by
Sin.</hi> Death is there put for, All Miſeries. As Life in
Scripture is put for all Good; ſo Death is the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
for all Miſeries, being called <hi>the King of Fears;</hi>
and ſo the King of Evils, being the King of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is fearful to man, and what Nature abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
As Death, ſo all Evils (as Death's attendants)
came into the world by Sin. Sin was the Mother,
and <hi>Afflictions</hi> of all ſorts are the Daughters. So then,
looking upon them under this Notion, as the Effects
of Sin, they may be prayed againſt. When Sin
came into the world, theſe Evils crowded in with
It; and when Sin ſhall be no more, theſe Miſeries
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107590:35"/>
and Evils ſhall be no more, <hi>Rev. 21. 4. There ſhall
be no more Death, &amp;c.</hi> The Thred followeth the
Needle. Sin was the Needle, that drew in with it
the Thred of Miſeries and Afflictions. Man had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known what Loſſes, and Croſſes, and Miſeries,
and Afflictions had bin, had it not been for
Sin.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Afflictions</hi> of themſelves, do us no <hi>good;</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they do not make a man better. The <hi>Good</hi>
by <hi>Afflictions</hi> comes from a Superiour Work, from
thoſe admirable Influences and Concurrences of
the Spirit of God, on, and with, the <hi>Afflictions.</hi> As
our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Man lives not by Bread only:</hi> So,
man is not amended by <hi>Afflictions</hi> only. Put a
Stone into the Fire, it cometh out a Stone ſtill.
No water, either hot or cold, will make a <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
White. Empty Vinegar from Veſſel to Veſſel,
it will be Vinegar ſtill. So, let a man be emplyed,
from Condition to Condition, he is ſtill the ſame.
We know, the Plough breaks up the Earth, but of
it ſelf doth not better it; it leaveth it as it was,
there is nothing put in by the Plough: If the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
Dung it, and caſt in good Seed, when he
hath broken it up with his Plough, then there is
like to be a Harveſt, elſe there is nothing but Weeds
and Nettles. The Plough of Afflictions may break
our Bodies, and Eſtates, and Spirits; but there will
be no Harveſt without ſomething more, without an
Heavenly Influence; Afflictions will bring forth only
Briars and Thorns. The Expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt,
is, <hi>Pſal. 94. 12. Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chastenest
and teachest out of thy Law.</hi> It is then happy, when
Correction and Inſtruction go together.</p>
                  <p>3. As Afflictions are fruits of Sin, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107590:36"/>
do no good; ſo oftentimes, through Mans
Corruption, they prove occaſions of Sin. They are ſo
far from making men Better, that they often make
men Worſe. I have ſhewed before, what Evils
are incident, both to a ſtate of Proſperity and
Adverſity. Satan knoweth, how to make Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to become Temptations: And therefore we
find this to be the Reaſon, why <hi>Agur</hi> prayed againſt
Poverty, <hi>Prov. 30. 9. lest I be Poor and Steal, and the
Name of God be taken in Vain;</hi> q. d. Poverty may
put me under a Temptation of uſing Unlawful
means, to the Diſhonour of God. Thus, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
prove ſomtimes occaſions of Sin; and we are
taught to Pray, <hi>That we may not be led into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Conſider again this, That the Saints and
Servants of God have prayed againſt Afflictions:
So, they have prayed for
<list>
                        <item>1. The Preventing of them, and Keeping
them off.</item>
                        <item>2. The Removing them, and Taking them
off.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. For the Preventing them, and keeping them
Off. Thus did <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. where you have
his Prayer; Firſt, Againſt the Evils of Sin, <hi>Ver. 7.
Take from me Vanity and Lying.</hi> Next, Againſt
the Evils of Affliction, <hi>Ver. 8. Give me not Poverty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. They have prayed for the Removing them,
and taking them off. And thoſe have done it,
who got as much <hi>good</hi> by their Afflictions, as any
under <hi>Heaven.</hi> Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39. 10. <hi>Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thy Stroak from me.</hi> Pſal. 119. 22. <hi>Turn away
Shame and Reproach from me.</hi> Thus did <hi>Job,</hi> Job
9. 34. <hi>Let him take away his Rod from me. Job 13.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107590:36"/>
20, 21. Withdraw thine Hand from me, &amp;c.</hi> Where,
he Prayeth for Gods taking away his Afflicting
Rod, and for his with-drawing his Afflicting
Hand. And theſe Two men, got as much <hi>good</hi> by
their being Afflicted, as ever any did.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in General, You ſee what we Anſwer
to the Queſtion, Whether Evils of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
may be Prayed againſt?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="question">
                  <p>II. We come to give a more particular Anſwer
to the Queſtion; And tell you, That though we
ſay, It is Lawful to pray againſt Afflictions; yet it
muſt be with the Obſervation of ſome Rules, and
Cautions, and Directions. That, as our Saviour
ſaid in another caſe concerning Hearing; <hi>Take
heed, how ye Hear;</hi> So in this caſe of praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Afflictions, we ſay, Take heed how ye Pray.
So conſider; There is a double praying againſt
Afflictions, as I told you before:
<list>
                        <item>1. For the Keeping them off.</item>
                        <item>2. For the Taking them off.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. For the Keeping them off. So, there is a Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
praying for the Keeping off Afflictions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Abſolute.</item>
                     <item>2. Conditional, and with Submiſſion.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. <hi>Abſolute.</hi> When men Pray, that, in no Caſe,
the Evil may happen to them; ſo making their
Will a Law to God's. This praying againſt <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
is Unwarrantable and Unlawful. We muſt
know; for Moral Evils of Sin, we may pray abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
againſt, but not ſo againſt the Evils of <hi>Affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There is a Praying againſt them, that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
&amp; with Submiſſion to the Will of God; This
is Lawful. Our Saviour himſelf prayed that the Cup
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107590:37"/>
might paſs from Him, but adds this, <hi>Not my Will,
but Thine be done.</hi> Our praying againſt <hi>Afflictions</hi> is
then right, when there is a ſweet Submiſſion of our
wills, to the Will of God: So, that though we know
that <hi>Afflictions</hi> are grievous to our Natures; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we know not, what the Decrees and Purpoſes
of God are concerning us; and not knowing, but
that He may ſee them <hi>good</hi> for us, and make them
<hi>good</hi> to us: we do ſweetly ſubmit our wills, to the
Will of God, and Proclaim Liberty to Him, to
deal with us as He pleaſe. And herein is the Work
of Grace ſeen, that, though Nature deſireth wholly
to be freed from them, (they being ſuch things as
are bitter to It;) yet a Chriſtian leavs himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Will of God, and ſaith, <hi>Not my Will, but
Thine be done.</hi> When Chriſtians ſee the Cup of
Affliction preparing for them, or coming towards
them, they muſt pray againſt it, only as our Saviour
did. It is then right, when in praying againſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
we pray abſolutely that God may be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
but for the things that concern our ſelves,
we pray with Submiſſion to His Will. Thus Chriſt
did, <hi>John 12. 27, 28. Save me from this Hour, but
for this cauſe came I to this Hour. Father, Glorify thy
Self.</hi> Our Saviour is abſolute in that requeſt of
his, That His Father would Glorify his Name, and
received an Anſwer; But for the other Requeſt, he
ſweetly ſubmitted to His Father's Will. Thus doth
a Gracious Heart pray abſolutely, that God may be
Glorified, (let it be in Relation to himſelf) which
way the Lord pleaſe. Thus in deſiring freedom
from Affliction, though a Gracious Heart looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as deſirable to Nature, to be freed from
Loſſes, and Croſſes, Sickneſs, and Poverty, &amp;c:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107590:37"/>
Yet he looks upon Gods Glory as, That, that is to
preferred before its own worldly Welfare, Eaſe,
Quiet, Contentment, and Comfort. Whereas
ſome may ſay, that <hi>Agur</hi> prayed abſolutely againſt
Poverty, <hi>Prov. 30. 8, 9. Give me not Poverty, &amp;c.</hi>
We Anſwer, that though it looketh like an abſolute
Requeſt, yet it is not: If we look upon the Reaſon
of the Requeſt, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. we ſhall find that he prayed
abſolutely, only in relation to Gods Glory. For,
the Reaſon why he prayes againſt poverty, is this,
<hi>lest I be Poor and Steal, and the Name of God be taken
in Vain.</hi> Where ſee, that he only prayeth againſt
Poverty upon this account, leſt it might occaſion
him to Sin, and Diſhonour God. <hi>Agur</hi> doth not ſay,
leſt I be poor and Steal, and be Whipt, and Stockt,
or Hanged; but, <hi>lest the Name of God be taken in
Vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Concerning the keeping off, of Afflictions.
There is a praying either againſt,
<list>
                        <item>1. The Things themſelves.</item>
                        <item>2. The Evil of the things.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Againſt the Things themſelves. For that, we
ſay, as formerly, We ought not to pray Abſolutely,
but with Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a praying againſt the Evil of the
things. So we may pray abſolutely againſt the
Evil of the Evils, though we may may not pray
abſolutely againſt the Afflictions, yet againſt the
Sting of the Affliction. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> calleth
Sin, the Sting of Death; and it is the Sting of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Affliction: and againſt the Sting, we may
pray abſolutely.</p>
                  <p>Thus for the firſt, concerning praying for the
keeping off of Afflictions.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="question">
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:107590:38"/>
2. Concerning praying for the taking off Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So, theſe Rules are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. We muſt not put our wills, as a Law to
God's. Then it is right, when, while we
deſire God to remove the Affliction, we
get our hearts willing to bear the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if God will have it ſo.</item>
                     <item>2. In praying for the removal of them, there
muſt be a Submiſſion to the Will of God,
in relation to all Circumſtances; to wit,
the time and manner of removing. We
muſt ſubmit to his Wiſdom for the means,
and be content to wait his Leaſure, for
the time of taking them off.</item>
                     <item>3. We muſt chooſe rather Affliction, than
Sin; and pray more for the taking away
of Sin, then the taking off Affliction. It
was a <hi>Pharoah</hi> that prayed only for the
taking off of Affliction, <hi>Exod. 10. 17. Pray
to the Lord your God, that He may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from me, this Death only.</hi> He was
only, for having his Judgment taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
not his Sin.</item>
                     <item>4. We muſt pray more, for God's Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Afflictions to us, then for his Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them from us. That the Rod may
do its work for which it is ſent, before it
be taken off; that we may be better'd by
the Affliction, before we are freed from
the Affliction.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Thus in Anſwer to the Firſt Queſtion.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">

               <div n="2" type="question">
                  <head>The Second Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>IF a Man know not, <hi>What is good for a man in this
Life;</hi> Is it then Lawfull for a man to pray for
the things of this Life, <hi>viz.</hi> Riches, &amp;c? Since he
knoweth not, but they may be Hurtful for him.
His proſperity may be his Ruine, his Table may
be his Snare; and that which he thought was for
his Welfare, may become his Trap. To this
Queſtion I ſhall give an Anſwer
<list>
                        <item>1. In General.</item>
                        <item>2. More Particular.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. In General, I Anſwer thus: That it is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to pray for the things of this Life; although
we know not, whether they are <hi>good for Man in this
Life.</hi> There are theſe Arguments to make it
good.</p>
                  <p>1. Riches, and Health, and the Comforts of this
Life, are in themſelves Bleſſings of God. They
flow from Him, who is the Fountain of Good;
and are, in themſelves, Streams that iſſue from
that Fountain, and ſpeak His Goodneſſe. They
are ſome of thoſe things, by which, He that is Good
(as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) <hi>doth good to his Creatures.</hi>
Acts 14. 17. <hi>God left not Himſelf without Witneſs,
in that he did Good, and gave them Rain, and Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Seaſons; filling their hearts with Joy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
So, upon that account, they may be pray'd
for.</p>
                  <p>2. The things of this Life may be prayed for,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107590:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In that our Saviour hath taught us to pray for
<hi>our Daily Bread.</hi> Where, by Bread, is meant all
thoſe Good things that are neceſſary for this Life.
Bread is there a Comprehenſive word, being <hi>the
Staff of Life;</hi> And ſo call'd <hi>the Staff of Bread.</hi> And
by a Synechodoche it is put for All, both Neceſſary
and Comfortable ſupports of mans Life. Now,
being to pray for <hi>our Daily Bread,</hi> we may pray
for what is Neceſſary and Comfortable for
Life.</p>
                  <p>3. Outward <hi>Good</hi> things are neceſſary for our
Uſes, and for our Well-being in this World. <hi>Mat.</hi>
6. 32. <hi>Your Heavenly Father knoweth, that you have
need of all theſe things.</hi> In Prayer, there is a making
known of our Needs and Wants to God; not only
Spiritual, but Temporal too; not only thoſe that
relate to our Souls, but alſo to our Bodies. The
Apoſtle bids us, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. In nothing be careful,
but let your Wants be made known to God.</hi> Then no
doubt, but we may Lawfully pray for all Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and Suitable ſupplies to our Wants.</p>
                  <p>4. Theſe Outward things do not of themſelves
Hurt. Of themſelves they make none Evil. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things are to Men, as they are to Them. It
is not from the things Themſelves, but from Luſts
within that they become Evil. The <hi>Poyſon</hi> is not
in the Flower, but in the nature of the Spider:
So the Evil of Outward things, is not in the things
Themſelves, but from our Luſts, that turn them into
Evil. It is not mens Poſſeſſions, but mens Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that make them to become Evil to them. When
a mans Table comes to be his Snare, the Creatures
are not to be blamed, but a mans own Luſts.
The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. ſpeaks of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107590:39"/>
that are in the world through Luſt. The World,
and the things of the world are the Object; but
the Cauſe why they become Evil to us, is Luſt.
The Fault, why men are Covetous, or Senſual,
or Effeminate, is not in Gold, or Wine, or Women;
but in Mens Senſual Affections, and naughty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
So it is Obſervable, when St. <hi>John,</hi>
1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 16. doth Sum up, what of the World is
oppoſite to the Love of God, He doth not name
the Objects, but the Luſts. He doth not ſay, What
ever is in the World is Pleaſure, or Honour, or
Profit; but he names, <hi>The Lusts of the Eye, The
Lusts of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life; And theſe
are not of the Father, but are of the World.</hi> (i. e.)
Theſe are not of God, as Riches, and Honour,
and outward things are; but of that world, that
man hath made within himſelf, by his own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
deſires, and Senſual Luſts and Affections. By
this you ſee, The Evil is not in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but in our ſelves; We find, they are ſuch
things as are Conſiſtent with Grace and Holineſſe.
We read of <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Jobs</hi> Wealth and Riches.
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> ſpeaking of theſe Worldly things ſaith,
<hi>Dantur bonis ne putentur mala, dantur malis ne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentur
ſumma bona.</hi> It is a certain Truth, That
God never giveth any thing in it ſelf Evil, to thoſe
that are Good; ſo, neither doth he give the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
good Things, to thoſe that are Evil. So that
when theſe things become Evil to men, it is from a
mans own Corruptions. When men make theſe
things, the Bellows of Pride, the Fewel of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
the Inſtruments of Revenge; This is
not from themſelves, but mans making uſe of them
for ſuch ends, for which they were not Ordained.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107590:40"/>
So when the Goſpel calls upon us, to Renounce
the World, The meaning is not, That we ſhould
caſt the things of the World out of our Poſſeſſion,
but out of our Affection. To be Rich, is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with Religion, it is mans abuſing of
Riches, &amp;c. that makes them Evil to us.</p>
                  <p>5. The things of this life, may be helps to
Chriſtians, to further them in doing <hi>good:</hi> though
they be ſeeming hindrances; yet, by a wiſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
they may become great Advantages,
for the performing of Works both of Piety and
Charity. If a man have but the Art, of placing
theſe things aright, They may help a man toward
Heaven. As we ſee it is with a Trunk of Mony;
Let a man put it upon his Head, it boweth him

him up. 'Tis the Apoſtle's Command, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18.
to thoſe that are Rich, <hi>that they be Rich in Good
Works;</hi> Letting them know, That they have an
opportunity put into their hands, of doing good
with their Wealth. See what our Saviour ſaith,
<hi>Luke 16. 9. Make you Friends of the Vnrighteous
Mammon.</hi> But, why doth our Saviour call it, The
unrighteous Mammon? Not becauſe Riches are ſo
in themſelves, but becauſe of mens either Evil
getting, or uſing of them. <hi>q. d.</hi> Things that many
men abuſe, and ſo make them the Riches of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
may be ſo imployed, as to be helps to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>good.</hi> And therefore, it was a hard ſaying, and
Cenſure of a Father (although I confeſs it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
true) <hi>Omnis Dives aut iniquus, aut iniqui Haeres,</hi>
Every Rich man is either an Oppreſſor, or the Son
of an Oppreſſor.</p>
                  <p>6. Wealth and Riches, and the Things of this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107590:40"/>
Life, are the things that come within a Promiſe.
It is ſaid of him that feareth the Lord, <hi>Pſal. 112.
That Wealth and Riches ſhall be in his Houſe</hi> (i. e.)
when God ſeeth it good for him. For all Temporal
Promiſes muſt be underſtood with an Exception.
The Rule is this, concerning ſuch Promiſes, That
they do not Intimate what ever ſhall be, but what
ever befalleth a Godly man ſhall be a Bleſſing. The
Fruit of a Promiſe, ſhall not be the Fruit of a
loſer Providence; but to a Godly man, they are
the Fruits of a Promiſe, and therefore may be
prayed for.</p>
                  <p>Thus for the Anſwer in General.</p>

               <div n="2" type="answer">
                  <p>II. The Particular Anſwer is this. Though we
ſaid, and have ſhewed, that it is lawful to pray for
outward things, yet it muſt have its Rules and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
and that upon this Ground, That we
know not what is good for a man in this life. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
praying for outward things, we muſt know
this, they muſt not be prayed for;
<list>
                        <item>1. Abſolutely.</item>
                        <item>2. Ultimately.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Abſolutely. In praying for outward things,
we muſt not pray for them, but with a Submiſſion
to the Will of God. In praying for them, we muſt
take need of making our wills a Law to God's. For,
as I ſhewed you before, That the Evils of this life,
are not Evils to be abſolutely prayed againſt; ſo
neither are the things of this life, abſolutely to be
prayed for. Then it is Right, if, when you are beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of them, you can find in your heart to be
without them, if God will have if ſo. As for thoſe
Good things that relate to another Life, they are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107590:41"/>
to be abſolutely prayed for; but, for the things of
this life, we are not to do ſo; we muſt not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
them, as not content to be denyed. This was
<hi>Rachels</hi> ſin, in her deſire of children, <hi>Give me Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or elſe I dye.</hi> She would have no Nay, but ſhe
muſt have children, and ſhe payed dear for it, for
ſhe died in Child-bearing; ſhe would die if ſhe had
not children, and ſhe died in bringing forth a
child, whom ſhe called <hi>Benoni.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> would
have no Nay, but they muſt have a King. And thus
the hearts of many, are ſo ſet upon the things of
this life, that they cannot brook a denial of them;
and think God doth not love them, if He do not
grant thoſe Requeſts they make for them.</p>
                  <p>2. In praying for outward things, as you may
not pray for them Abſolutely, ſo you are not to
pray and ſeek for them, Ultimately, but to make
them Subordinate to Gods Glory. It is lawful to
pray for Health, and Wealth, and the good things
of this Life; but it is to be done, with a reſpect
to the Glory of God, that we may be enabled the
better, to Serve and Honour Him with them; and
not that our ſenſual deſires, and ſinful luſts, may be
ſatisfied, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 3. The Apoſtle telleth us, of ſome
that did Ask; but he telleth us, that their End was
not right; for they did ask, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it upon their Luſts. This asking is Evil and
Unlawful. How many are there, that would have
God beſtow that upon them, that they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon their Luſts, as Health, and long Life;
that they may live the more Pleaſantly, Wealth,
that they may fare Deliciouſly every day; Great
Eſtates, that they may Raiſe Themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
that they may be ſome-body in the world,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107590:41"/>
and may lord it over others. It is not right, when
men deſire outward things, that they may live more
comfortably, and not Serve God more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But ſome may Ask, How may I know,
in praying for the things of <hi>this Life,</hi> that I have a
reſpect to Gods Glory; ſince the Heart of man is
ſo Deceitful?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe things, it may be known.</p>
                  <p>1. He that makes Gods Glory his End, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe things, is as much in begging Grace
to Uſe them for God, as he is to have them.
Where the deſires of a man, after theſe things,
are right, they are not ſingle deſires after the
things themſelves, but conjoyned and coupled
with deſires of Grace; whereby he may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to ſerve and honour God with them. This
is his moſt earneſt Requeſt, That, if God put any
ſuch price into his Hand, he would give him a
Heart to make uſe of it for his Glory. <hi>Prov. 3. 9.
Honour God with thy Substance.</hi> So, this is the great
Requeſt of thoſe that eye the Glory of God, in
their begging the things of <hi>this life;</hi> That, if God
ſee it good to beſtow thoſe things on them, that
he would give them to honour Him with their
Riches, with their Health, and with all their
Worldly Enjoyments. When it is otherwiſe, our
praying for them is not right. There are many
that only look after the things themſelves, but
never begg for Grace, by which they ſhould
make a right Improvement of them. Then it is
right, when a man deſireth rather to be denied the
Things themſelves, than Grace to uſe them; when
he can ſay, <hi>Lord give me not Riches, give me not Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107590:42"/>
give me not Worldly Poſſeſſions, if thou do not
withall give me a Heart to uſe them to thy Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This ſpeaketh it, When a man can take a
Denial, and be content to go Without them, when
God will have it ſo. This ſheweth man's reſpecting
the Glory of God, above the things themſelves.
Such an one ſits down contented, when God is
pleaſed to croſs his deſires, and to deny him his
requeſts: When he beggeth Health, and Wealth,
and the good things of this life, and is denied;
he layeth his hand upon his mouth, and concludeth,
that, God did not ſee thoſe things to make for his
Glory, nor for the good of him that begged them.
We read of <hi>Balaam,</hi> Num. 22. when he was ſent for
by <hi>Balak,</hi> that he gave out, he would not eye
the offers that <hi>Balak</hi> made him, but only the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God. Yet, when he was told, He ſhould
not go, he enquires again, and again, till at laſt
God bid him go; which ſhews, he eyed more the
Promotion and Advancement he expected from
<hi>Balak,</hi> then the Command of God. So ſome, in
ſeeking the things of this life, are ſo impatient,
that, though the Lord have denied them once, and
again, yet they will be asking them again; It is
good for men to do ſo, in ſeeking after the things
of another life, but not in ſeeking after the things
of this life.</p>
                  <p>3. This ſpeaketh it, When, in praying for the
things of this Life, he prayes only for ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and proportion of them, as may leaſt expoſe
him to ſin. By this, a man ſhews, in ſeeking of them,
he hath en eye to the Honour and Glory of God.
Such an one ſeeks not great things for himſelf, but
only what is convenient. It was <hi>Agur</hi>'s prayer,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107590:42"/>
                     <hi>Prov. 30. 8. That God would feed him with food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</hi>
If you ask, why he prayed for convenient
Food, and a convenient Eſtate, the Reaſon was
this, Becauſe he ſaw danger in extreams; in Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on the one hand, and Riches on the other. He
ſaw, To be very Rich, or very Poor, was very
dangerous, and would put under great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>q. d.</hi> Lord I would not be Rich, becauſe it
is hard to be Rich and Good; and I would not be
poor, becauſe it is hard to be poor, and not to ſin.
Therefore he prayeth for ſuch an Eſtate as did beſt
ſuite with holineſs, and would leaſt expoſe him, to
temptations unto ſin; this ſpeaks his eying the Glory
of God. He prayeth againſt Riches, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
but it is not upon this account, becauſe
they may make a man envyed, or cauſe cares and
troubles, for he that encreaſeth Riches, increaſeth
them: But it is purely upon another account,
(viz) the Glory of God, as appears by his Reaſon
given, <hi>verſ. 9. Lest I be full and forget Thee,</hi> and
ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> Which ſhews, that it was
Gods Honour and Glory, that he did Reſpect. So
when he prayeth againſt Poverty, he doth not
make this his Reaſon, leſt I be deſpiſed and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under foot, but, <hi>leſt the Name of my God be
taken in Vain.</hi> So that what he prayed for, was
in Relation to Gods Glory. So it is with him that
eyes the Glory of God, in ſeeking the things of
this life; he ſeeks not great things for himſelf,
but only what is proportionable and convenient.
He knows, A ſhoo too big for his foot, may hinder
him in going, as well as a ſhoo that is too little:
A Staff, you know, is a help to a man when he
walketh; but a bundle of Staves, both hinder and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107590:43"/>
burden. It is good for men, in ſeeking the things of
<hi>this life,</hi> to ſeek only what is fit and convenient,
that they may be the better fitted to be ſerviceable
to their God, and to <hi>run the Race that is ſet before
them.</hi> Suppoſe a man were to run a Race, and many
Suites were laid before him to take his choice, ſome
of cloth of Gold, &amp;c. he would not chooſe the
moſt Gorgious, but the moſt Convenient, leſt
otherways he loſe the Race.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Some may Ask, What is a convenient
Eſtate?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>That which Nature requireth. Nature is
content with a little. It was the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Wiſe man,</hi> He that liveth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Nature, will find a little, Enough;
and He that liveth according to Opinion,
will never have Enough. <hi>And it was the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Gracious man,</hi> Having Food and
Rayment, let us therewith be Content.</item>
                        <item>2. That is Convenient, that is ſuitable to the
Eſtate wherein God hath put us. Some need
not ſo much as others do; and it is their
Happineſs, if they knew it; as it is for
a man to ſee without Spectacles, and to
walk without Crutches. It was the ſaying
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> when he ſaw great Riches
carried through a Town, <hi>How happy am I,
that I can live without all this?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>That is Convenient, that is requiſite for
the comfortable Maintenance of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> He that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
not for his own Houſe, is worſe than
an Infidel. <hi>Yet</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> There was a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107590:43"/>
man, That had neither Son, nor Brother, and
yet there was no end of his Labours.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. This ſpeaketh our reſpecting Gods Glory,
in our ſeeking the things of <hi>this life,</hi> Our uſing
the Things for God, when he hath beſtowed them
on us, and hath granted us our deſire. Do you
not ſpend them upon your Luſts? Do you not
ſay to the Wedge of Gold, <hi>Thou art my Confidence?</hi>
Do you not make them the Fuel for Luſts, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of Revenge? You may know, what your
Hearts were in Deſiring them, by the Uſe you
afterwards make of them. Remember, Luſt is an
earneſt Craver; and will pretend, That what it
beggs, is for God, till it hath what it deſireth.
It is good for Chriſtians then, to put the Queſtion
to themſelves, <hi>What God hath the more from them,
for that they have received from Him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To cloſe up the Anſwer to this Queſtion; Let
me tell you, Although it be lawful to pray for the
things of <hi>this life;</hi> yet not <hi>Principally</hi> and <hi>Primarily,</hi>
but with reſpect to the Inferiority of their Nature
and Uſes. Remember ſtill, Theſe are not the
Cheif things to be ſought after. <hi>Mat. 6. 33. Seek
first the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</hi> We ought, in our
Prayers, to give the precedency, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
to Spiritual good things. Heavenly
things are to be preferred before Earthly; and
we are to place them in our Prayers, as God hath
placed them. Though we may Lawfully pray for
the things of <hi>this life,</hi> yet we pray Unlawfully,
when we are more earneſt for them, than for the
things that relate to <hi>another life.</hi> God took it
well from <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he was left to his choice,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107590:44"/>
and bid to ask what he would, he only asked <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
He did not ask Riches, nor Long Life, nor the Life
of his Enemies. Yet God gave him Thoſe. The way
to have the things of this World, is, chiefly to ſeek
after the things of another World. Theſe things
you may pray for Abſolutely, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace, and an
Intereſt in Chriſt, and Pardon of Sin, and
all Soul-Mercies; and all the Good things
that relate to <hi>another life.</hi> We read of ſome, in
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. that <hi>howled upon their Beds, for Corn
and Wine.</hi> Thoſe were the things they only ſought
after; and their Prayers was but a brutiſh Crie,
compared to the <hi>howling of a Dog.</hi> A gracious Soul
pants after the things of another Life, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
pant only after the things of this Life.
The Prophet ſpeaks of ſuch, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 7. who
pant after the <hi>Dust of the Earth:</hi> But <hi>David</hi>'s Soul
panted after God, <hi>Pſal. 42. 1. So panteth my Soul
after Thee, O God.</hi> Then it is Right, when we
pray for the things of this Life, with a ſerious
conſideration of their Lowneſs, and Baſeneſs, and
Inferiority, being compared with the things of
Eternity, and another Life.</p>

                  <p>1. IT is uſeful by way of Information. If this be
true, that no man infallibly knows what is
<hi>good</hi> for a man in this life; why, then it is not to
be wondred at, that we find men ſo wofully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in their Judgments, about Conditions, and
God's outward Diſpenſations. The Prophet ſpeaks
of ſome, that call <hi>evil good,</hi> and <hi>good evil:</hi> So man,
through his ignorance, of what is <hi>good</hi> for him in
this life; is apt to think that condition <hi>good</hi> for
him, that is <hi>evil;</hi> and that condition <hi>evil</hi> for him,
that is <hi>good.</hi> We read <hi>Job 11. 10. Vain man would
be wiſe.</hi> So, ignorant man would be thought wiſe,
in the knowing of things that are above him, and
beyond his line, and that come not within the
Sphear of his knowledg. Though he know not,
how to make a Judgment of Conditions, yet
he will be offering at it; nay as confidently
undertake it, as Aſtrologers and Gypſies do,
to tell people their Fortunes. But we may ſay of
men in this caſe, as the Apoſtle doth of thoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 22. <hi>Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>they became fools.</hi> So while men profeſs themſelves
to be ſo wiſe, as to know what is <hi>good</hi> for a man in
this life, they have but ſhewed themſelves fools;
as hath appeared by their groſs miſtakes about
Conditions. The Heathens of old, though they
thought themſelves wiſe, yet ſhewed themſelves
fools in their Opinions, concerning the <hi>Chiefest
Good,</hi> (which did amount to the number of 288.)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107590:46"/>
And ſuch fools do men ſhew themſelves in their
Opinions, concerning inferiour <hi>good things,</hi> and
what is <hi>good</hi> for a man in this life. But, as the Lord
ſaith of the cuſtoms of the people, <hi>Jer. 10. 3. That
they are Vain:</hi> So, may we ſay of the Opinions of
people, concerning conditions. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of
ſome, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 10. who would undertake to make
a Judgment of Times, and did ask, <hi>Why were the
former times better than theſe?</hi> But <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth
ſuch, <hi>They did not enquire wiſely concerning them.</hi>
(i. e.) They were but fools in thinking ſo. So there
are many that inquire not wiſely concerning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,

a man in this life.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpend a little time, in the examining theſe
Grounds, to ſee whether ſuch a Concluſion may be
built upon them.</p>
                  <p>1. The Firſt is this. That muſt needs be good
for a man in this life, that is in it ſelf good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not: That which is good in its
ſelf, may be a convenient good for me, or you, or
other. That, that makes a good thing, to be a
convenient good to us, is its ſuitableneſs to, and
agreeableneſs with, our Conſtitutions, Spirits, and
Diſpoſitions. Here is the miſtake of many, that
when they hear, that Honour, and Riches, &amp;c. are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107590:47"/>
things good in themſelves, they preſently conclude
they are good for them; without conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are a convenient good, never examining
how they ſuit with their Spirits and Diſpoſitions.
The Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Creatures, that God
hath made and ordained, for the nouriſhment and
preſervation of mankind, telleth us, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 4.
That every Creature of God is good:</hi> So, Fleſh is good,
and Fiſh is good, and Wine is good; yet we know,
it may not be good for ſome to eat Fiſh, &amp; for ſome
to drink Wine; Wine, that is in it ſelf good, yet it
is not good for him that is in the fit of a Feaver.
So that here lieth the miſtake, Men diſtinguiſh not,
between what is good in it ſelf, and good for them.
Thus it is with moſt; they look upon the things of
this life, without themſelves, but look not inward
upon their own Spirits and Diſpoſitions; which
<hi>Agur</hi> no doubt did, when he prayed againſt Riches,
and that God would feed him with food conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                  <p>2. Conſider this, That a thing may be good in
it ſelf, that may become evil to a man in this life,
through his Abuſe of it; and therefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, that, that is alwayes good for a man in
this life, that is good in it ſelf: Things good in
themſelves, may through mans corruption be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome, <hi>that turn
Grace, into Wantonneſs:</hi> And if the corruption of man
may riſe ſo high, to abuſe that, that is placed in
the higheſt Rank of good things; then much more,
to abuſe thoſe good things, that are of a lower and
inferiour nature. It is obſervable, that we are moſt
apt to offend in <hi>licitis,</hi> in thoſe things that are in
themſelves lawful; becauſe we are there leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107590:47"/>
of danger. We ſuſpect not the things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are in themſelves good, which, through
our abuſe of them, become evil to us. The Flowre
is in its own nature, ſweet and good, but through
the Venemous nature of the Spider, what is drawn
from it, is turned into Poyſon. So it is in this caſe,
mens corruptions make thoſe things Evil and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous,
that are in themſelves good. We muſt
know, Outward things are to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we are to them;
our outwards, are according to what our inwards
are; things good in themſelves, become evil to
us, when through our corruptions, they are made
to be but food and fewel for our Luſts. It may be
ſaid of many, It was ill for them, that they were ſo
Great, and ſo Rich; had they not been ſo, they
had not been ſo bad, and ſo wicked. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The proſperity of fools, destroyeth them.</hi> One of the
Fathers, wrote thus to one, <hi>Monacho fervido, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bati
tepido, Epiſcopo frigido, Archiepiſcopo diſſoluto.</hi>
To the Zealous Monk, the luke-warm Abbot, the
cold Biſhop, and the diſſolute Arch-Biſhop. Thus
we ſee, that ſome are the worſe for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Thus for the firſt Ground of mens miſtakes
about Conditions. Now for the ſecond.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="application">
                  <p>2. Ground of mens miſtakes about Conditions,
is this, That muſt needs be good for a man in this
life, that pleaſeth him, and ſuits with his deſires.
And hereupon many do infer this, That it muſt
needs be good for them in this life, ſince it is that
they deſire. Now I ſhall ſhew you, how wofully-miſtaken
ſuch perſons may be concerning their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that ſay, It is as I would have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:107590:48"/>
Conſider this, That a man's having what his
heart deſireth, doth not at all, ſpeak the perſon
good. For we ſhall find, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. That thoſe
were as bad, as bad could be, that yet had what
heart could wiſh. It doth not alwayes ſpeak, that
that is good for us, which falleth out according to
our deſires. Mens deſires may be corrupt, and
inordinate, and carried out after things that are
evil for them. We read of the Iſraelites, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 29.
They required meat for their luſts, (and ſee what
followeth) they had their heart's deſire. But by
the event, you will find, it was not good for them.
So by this you ſee, this is a falſe ground that men
go upon, in making a Judgment of Conditions.
And this the very Heathens ſaw by light of nature.
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> had on one and the ſame day
a Son born; the winning of a Prize, by his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
at the <hi>Olympian Games;</hi> and a Victory his
Army had the ſame day obtained. He was ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the News being ſo good, that he feared a
miſchief would enſue; and therefore deſired the
Gods, to mix ſome Adverſity with it. Remember,
the things of this life, though they ſuit with our
deſires, are ſo far from being good for us, that it
were good for us ſometimes, that our deſires were
not granted. How many are there, that have bleſſed
God for ſuch a Providence! Providence doth
ſometimes croſs a man, and turn him out of the
way of his deſires, for his good. As <hi>Poſſidonius,</hi> in
the life of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> hath a memorable Story,
He going to Viſit a place, with his guide, miſtook
his way, and ſo eſcaped the hands of ſome bloody
<hi>Donatists,</hi> that lay in wait to take away his life.
God ſometimes leads his people, out of the way of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107590:48"/>
their deſires, for the avoiding of ſome danger,
that may lie in the things deſired.</p>
                  <p>Thus for the Second Ground, upon which
men go, in making a Judgment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="application">
                  <p>3. Ground upon which men go, in making a
Judgment of Conditions, is this: That muſt needs
be good for a man in this life, that hath been good
for others. If they were good for <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.
Why may they not be good for me? And here I
ſhall ſhew you, how upon this ground many are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
miſtaken about Conditions.</p>
                  <p>It follows not: I told you before, that the things
of this life, are ſo to us, as we are to them. Thoſe
Godly Men that had thoſe things, had hearts and
ſpirits fitted for them. It doth not therefore follow,
That we have. It is, as if a man ſhould ſay, This
Shoo fits ſuch and ſuch a mans foot, and therefore
it will fit mine. We are not to look ſo much upon
the condition, as the Graces that belong to the
Condition. Had <hi>Abraham</hi> a proſperous condition?
Conſider withal, what Graces he, and others
had, and ſee whether you have the ſame. There are
Proſperity-Graces, and Adverſity-Graces; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, neither Proſperity or Adverſity is good
for a man. The condition was not ſimply good for
them, but as they were furniſhed with ſuch graces
as made them fit for their condition. In a word,
Conſider this, The things of this life, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they never did any man hurt; So, let me
tell you, Of themſelves they never did any man
good, I ſay of themſelves. Their doing a man good,
cometh from a higher Good; and that is, Grace
to Improve them for the Glory of God, and our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107590:49"/>
own and others good. There was never any man
made better, by his being Rich; but many that
have been Rich, have been the better for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gracious, with their being Rich.</p>
                  <p>4. Ground that men go upon, is this: That
muſt needs be good for a man in this life, that God
beſtows upon a man in this life. But Honour, and
Riches, &amp;c. are God's Gifts and Diſpenſations;
therefore muſt needs be good for a man in this life.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall a little examine this Ground, and ſhew
how men may be wofully miſtaken, that from thoſe
premiſes make ſuch a concluſion. Their miſtake
lieth in this, Their not conſidering, How God is
ſaid to beſtow theſe things.</p>
                  <p>1. They diſtinguiſh not, between what God
giveth <hi>ex Largitate</hi> out of his Bounty; and as He is
good to all: and what He giveth <hi>ex Promiſſo,</hi> by
Promiſe. And the not conſidering of this, is one
great cauſe of mens being miſtaken, in making a
judgment of a proſperous condition. So that, as
our Saviour told the Sadduces in another caſe, That
they did erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor
the Power of God. So we may ſay of theſe, That
they erre, not knowing the Scriptures, and the
Intentions of God in the beſtowing outward
things. While a man hath the things of this life,
beſtowed on him by God, only out of Bounty, he
cannot ſay, They are good for him, till he find,
they come in by Covenant and Promiſe, as I ſhall
ſhew you more largly afterwards. When <hi>Eſau</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Jacob, Whoſe Children are theſe?</hi> He anſwered,
<hi>Theſe are the Children that God hath Graciouſly</hi>
(or, in Mercy) <hi>given me.</hi> No man can ſay, Theſe are
the Riches, and this is the Proſperity that God hath
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107590:49"/>
in mercy given me, till he finds they flow from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fountain, than that of general Bounty. <hi>Luther</hi>
ſaid of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, That, how great ſoever
it was, yet it was but a Cruſt, that the great Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
had caſt to a Dog. Remember, it is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that forms a Mercy.</p>
                  <p>2. They diſtinguiſh not, between things in the
Diſpenſation, and in the Intention of God. Hence
ariſeth the Miſtake. Many judg of the Intention,
by the Diſpenſation; and if ſuch things be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed,
that be in themſelves good, they preſently
think they are intended for good to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<hi>Solomon</hi> telleth ſuch, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 1. No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
love by any outward thing, &amp;c.</hi> Not by Riches,
nor Honour, nor by outward Proſperity. Gods
Hand, and Gods, Heart doth not alwayes go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
His Hand may ſeem to make for men,
when His Heart is againſt them; as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
His Hand may ſeem to be againſt men, when
his Heart is not. We read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 41. When
God ſaid, He would do his People good, <hi>He would
do them good with his whole Heart, and with his whole
Soul.</hi> We find, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 29. God gave the Iſraelites
their heart's deſire, they had what they would;
But ſee what followeth, <hi>While the meat was yet in
their mouths, the Wrath of God came upon them.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this, The beſt good things of this life, may
be beſtowed in Anger, <hi>Hoſ. 13. 11. I gave them a
King in mine anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. They diſtinguiſh not, between Gods Giving
Hand, and Gods Sanctifying Hand. Between the
Things given, and Grace that fits for the Uſing
of them. God ſometimes gives the Things, when
He gives not the Grace to make a Right uſe of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107590:50"/>
them. There are ſome, who, if they find but a
Giving Hand, look no further, whether there be
a Sanctifying Hand, or no. Know this, While
you look upon a Giving Hand only, you can never
make a right Judgement of a Proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till you look upon the other Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Sanctifying Hand. Till you find, that with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
you have alſo Proſperity-Graces given
too.</p>
                  <p>4. They diſtinguiſh not, between what cometh
in by a Permiſſive providence, and by an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
providence. As there is Gods Permiſſive
and Approving Will, ſo it is in reſpect of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
as relating to the good things of this life.
Some men have them onely by a permiſſive provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Some there are that God maketh Rich, as
it is ſaid, God made <hi>Abraham</hi> Rich; ſome God
permits to be Rich, and hindreth them not. Thus,
ſome by ſinful, and unjuſt, and unlawful Means,
get the things of this life, when God approves not
of it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 4. God ſaith, <hi>They ſett up Kings, but
not by Him; and Princes, but He knew it not.</hi> The
meaning is, That He approved it not. There is a
diſpoſition in men, (what courſe ſoever they take
to compaſs the things of this life) to draw God
unto a liking, and approbation of what they do,
(let it be never ſo unlawfully done) As thoſe,
<hi>Zach. 11. 5. Bleſſed be the Lord, for I am Rich.</hi> How
much do men father upon God, as his Gifts and
Bleſſings, which they have got by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and oppreſſion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay, Is it not the Bleſſing
of the Lord that maketh Rich? And, if I am
Rich, muſt I not ſay, It is by the bleſſing of the
Lord?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:107590:50"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, and the place, is, <hi>Prov. 10. 22.
The Bleſſing of the Lord, it maketh Rich, and addeth
no ſorrow with it.</hi> This is a truth. And yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not from hence, that, Thoſe that have
Riches, and outward things, have them as a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
This will appear, if you conſider, what is
meant by <hi>Rich</hi> in the Text; It is not the having
the things, but comfort, and contentment, in the
things, that ſpeaks men Rich. So you find, the latter
words in the Text are Exegetical, and expound the
former, (<hi>viz.) He addeth no ſorrow with it.</hi> There are
three Vultures that commonly feed upon a Rich
mans heart, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Care in getting, Fear in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Grief in loſing. But now the Bleſſing of
the Lord, driveth away all theſe. So that it doth
not follow, That the bare having of the things, is
the Bleſſing, but the having the Riches of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
with them. So that the meaning is this,
That it is the bleſſing of the Lord, that gives
Comfort and Contentment with the things; and
this is that indeed, that ſpeaks a man truly Rich.
Many have Gold and Silver, and Poſſeſſions in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
and cannot be ſaid to be Rich, becauſe
they have not the comfortable uſe of them, and
contentment with them. So that it is the Comfort
and Contentment, that is that Bleſſing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Rich.</p>

1. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That thoſe things
are good for a man in this life, that bad men have
had, as well as good; and for the moſt part, the
greateſt portion of them? Upon this ground, the
very Heathens were drawn to a contempt of thoſe
things, becauſe they ſaw, that for the moſt part,
they were in the hands of thoſe, that were the worſt
of men. <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay, Who would eſteem of
Riches and Honours, when he ſeeth them caſt, <hi>in hoc
coenum in has ſordes,</hi> upon ſuch Dung-hills; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Honours conferred upon <hi>Sylla.</hi> Who would
eſteem of Beauty, (ſaith another) which a Whore
may have, as well as an honeſt Woman? <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1.
The Prophet obſerved, <hi>That the way of the Wicked
did Proſper.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. That the worſt of Men,
<hi>had waters of a full Cup wrung out to them, and had
what heart could wiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That is good for
a man in this life, that never made a man Good?
Where is the man that can come forth and ſay, That
his Riches and Honours, did ever change his heart
or reform his life?</p>
                  <p>3. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That thoſe things
are good for a man in this life, that have made
many men worſe, through their Abuſe of them?
To how many have they become a Trap, and Snare,
and occaſions of Sin? How many men hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
undone? <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 20. Did not <hi>Solomon,</hi>
King of Iſrael, ſin by thoſe things? yet among
many Nations there was none like him, Beloved of
his God. How Conſcientious was <hi>David,</hi> when
he was <hi>David</hi> the Perſecuted? but how careleſs,
when he was <hi>David</hi> the King? It is obſerved of
<hi>Rome,</hi> That it was never more Wicked, then when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107590:51"/>
it was moſt Flouriſhing. And it is obſerved of the
Church, That it had leaſt Purity, when it had moſt
outward Proſperity.</p>
                  <p>4. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That thoſe things
are good for a man in this life, that are things ſo
uncertain? They come and go, paſs and run, like
a River. The Apoſtle calls them uncertain Riches,
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17. Solomon</hi> telleth us, <hi>They make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Wings, and fly away. Prov.</hi> 23. 5. Yea, their
being is ſo ſhort, that they are ſaid not to be; for
ſo ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in the ſame <hi>Verſ. Why wilt thou ſet
thy heart upon that which is not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That is good for
a man in this life, that cannot in the leaſt cure a
mans vanity, or adde any thing of worth, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
to him? When he hath all the things of the
world, yet he is ſtill but vain and empty Man; he
is ſtill <hi>Adam,</hi> weak, frail, fleſhly, and ſtill vain.
Hence it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſheweth, that Riches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a mans happineſs, <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 10. That which
hath been, is named already, and it is known that it is
Man:</hi> (i. e.) Call him what you will, Great, or
Rich, or Honourable, yet he is Man ſtill, (i. e.)
crazy, frail, mortal man; outward things do not
amend his nature and conſtitution. This the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
telleth us, <hi>Pſal. 39. 5. Surely, every man at his
best estate, is altogether vanity.</hi> At his beſt eſtate,
let him be never ſo happy, in reſpect of worldly
eſtate, yet it doth not cure his vanity, he is ſtill
but vanity.</p>
                  <p>6. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That that is good
for a man in this life, that will do a man no good
in the time of his greateſt need, and ſtraits, and
exigencies? <hi>Prov. 11. 4. Riches profit not in the day
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107590:52"/>
of Wrath.</hi> And we have ſeen this made true in the
former dayes of common Calamity. In all Changes,
we have ſeen, The Greateſt, were the greateſt Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Great Winds, ſhake moſt the talleſt Cedars,
and throw down the ſtrongeſt Oakes. We read,
2 <hi>Kings 24. In that Captivity, the Richer Jews
were carried away, when the poorer ſort were left to
till the land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That that is good
for a man in this life, that fills the life with ſo
many cares, and expoſeth to ſo many dangers, and
troubles, and diſquietments? How many are there,
whoſe wealth hath coſt them their lives? It had bin
good for <hi>Naboth,</hi> he had had no Vineyard. And
it was ſaid of the Roman Emperours, That they
got nothing by their Advancement, but <hi>ut citius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terficerentur,</hi>
That they might be killed the ſooner.
How many men are there, that had been happy,
had not their proſperity deſtroyed them? And
this is another Argument, that <hi>Solomon</hi> uſeth to
prove, that a mans happineſs lyeth not in Riches.
As you may ſee <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 11. Seeing there be many
things that increaſe vanity, what is man the better?</hi>
So, How can thoſe things, that increaſe cares and
troubles, make Man the better? <hi>Pſal. 39. 6. Man
diſquiets himſelf in vain; he heapeth up Riches, and
cannot tell, who ſhall gather them.</hi> Nay, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells
us, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 3. That he had ſeen Riches laid up for
the owners, to their hurt. Antigonus</hi> ſaid of his
Crown, That if a man knew what cares were wrapt
up in it, he would not think it worth taking up.
Nay, one ſaith of life it ſelf, <hi>Nemo vitam acciperet
ſi daretur ſcientibus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Who can ſay, That is good for a man in this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107590:52"/>
life, that makes the entrance into Eternal Life ſo
difficult? This our Saviour ſheweth, <hi>Luk. 18. 24, 25.
That it is hard for a Rich man to enter into Heaven.</hi>
Nay, he makes it not only hard, but in a manner
Impoſſible; When he ſaith, <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel
to go through the eye of a Needle.</hi> Our Saviour
meaneth it, of thoſe that have Riches, and truſt in
them.</p>
                  <p>Thus for the firſt ſort of perſons, who think,
It is good for them in this life to have
Proſperity.</p>

               <p>2 THere are ſome think, Afflictions are ill for
them in this life; and conclude, it is ill with
them, becauſe they are their Portion in this life.</p>
               <p>I am now to ſhew you, that many are wofully
miſtaken in that. I ſhall name to you five things,
that men look upon as evil for them in this life.
About which they may be deceived; and they may
be for good to them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. God's hiding his Face from them.</item>
                  <item>2. God's ſuſpending, and deferring his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to their prayers.</item>
                  <item>3. God's denying their particular ſuits.</item>
                  <item>4. God's depriving them of many dear
comforts.</item>
                  <item>5. God's exerciſing them, with many ſad,
and great Afflictions.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107590:53"/>
We ſhall a little conſider of theſe things; and
whether men may not be miſtaken about them, and
take them to be evil for them, when they are not
ſo.</p>
               <p>1. Many think this evil for them, To have God
hide his Face from them. And indeed, we find
the Godly in Scripture, complain of it, as one of
the ſadeſt things. Yet let me tell you, ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions,
and the withdrawings of the light of
Gods Countenance, for a time, may be for Good.
That as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>It is good for you
that I go away.</hi> So it is ſometimes good for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, that He turns his Face away. Although
it is not a pleaſing good, yet it may be a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
good.</p>
               <p>1. By way of Correction. The Father's frowns
are ſometimes neceſſary, though the Children will
not ſay ſo. The ſleighting of Divine Favours, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God to withdraw His Favour, by way of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>2. By way of Inſtruction. So His hiding His
Face from his People, teacheth them theſe things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Where their ſtrength lyeth; That in
His Light, they ſee Light: That He is
the Fountain of Comfort, and that the
happineſs of lower Spirits, lieth in Him,
who is the Chief of Spirits. How know
you, that the Branch of the Tree hath
nouriſhment from the Root? Pluck it
away from the Tree, and it ſuddenly
withereth. Let but the Nurſe, leave the
child to it ſelf, and it quickly falleth.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:107590:53"/>
2. It teacheth men to prize God more, and
to long the more after Him. As in the
Nothern parts, where the Sun is long
abſent, people will get upon the tops of
the Mountains, to eſpie and diſcover its
ariſing; and happy is he, that can firſt ſee
it. For this end, God ſometimes hides
His Face, that his People may with more
longing, look after the breakings forth
of the Light of His Countenance.</item>
               </list>
               <p>3. By way of Prevention. So God hideth His
Face.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To prevent pride, and to keep His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
humble.</item>
                  <item>2. To keep them from truſting in habits of
Grace.</item>
               </list>
               <p>4. By way of Probation. So by this, God try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his concerning two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether they can love a hiding God?</item>
                  <item>2. Whether they can walk dutifully, when
God walketh ſtrangely? <hi>Iſa. 8. 17. I will
waite upon Him, that hideth his face from
the Houſe of Jacob.</hi> He reſolved to walk
dutifully, though God walked ſtrangely.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that Gods hiding his Face from
His people, may be for Good.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond thing, that many look upon as Evil
for them, is, God's ſuſpending, and deferring An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to their Prayers. Of this, the Godly have
complained in Scripture, That they did Cry, and
God did not Hear. And yet let me tell you, this
may be for Good.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:107590:54"/>
                  <item>1. To make His people to be more earneſt
Suitors at the Throne of Grace. As we
read of the Blind man in the Goſpel,
when he cryed to Chriſt to have mercy
on him; and being rebuked, he cryed
the more earneſtly.</item>
                  <item>2. To make the Mercy, the more welcome
when it cometh. Merchants look for the
greateſt return, by that Ship that is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
abroad. God keeps a mercy the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in his Hands, to enrich it the more;
and to ſend it forth, as a Bride adorned
for her Husband. One cluſter of grapes,
when ripe, is better then many when
they are green and ſowre. <hi>Abraham</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long for a Son; but it was, that
his Son might be the greater Bleſſing to
him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>3. This is that, ſome look upon as evil for them
in this life; Gods denying them their particular
ſuits. God is pleaſed ſometimes, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
His Anſwers to our Requeſts; but alſo to deny
them: and yet this may be for good. God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
heareth his people, and anſwers them for
their profit, though He doth not alwayes anſwer
them according to their wills. As the Phyſitian
hears the Patient's requeſt, <hi>Non ad voluntatem, ſed
ad ſanitatem;</hi> He reſpects not ſo much the Patient's
will, as his health. The Patient calleth for drink,
but the Phyſitian gives him a Sirup, or a Julip,
which is better. We many times, like the Sons of
<hi>Zebedee,</hi> ask we know not what: Inſtead of bread,
we ſometimes ask ſtones. God hears to our profit,
and Anſwers, though not alwayes according to our
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107590:54"/>
wills. Upon this account, <hi>Abrahams</hi> requeſt, on
the behalf of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> requeſt, to enter
into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were denyed. Yet they
were heard in another thing, and their requeſts
granted in another way.</p>
               <p>4. This is another thing, that men look upon
as evil for them; Gods depriving them of many
dear comforts: as when He takes away a Wife out of
our boſoms, or breaks an Olive branch off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
our tables, &amp;c. This is lookt upon by us, as
evil, and yet it may be for good.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It may be to make us to live more to Him,
and to lean more on Him; and to ſeek for
that in Him, which we ſought in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
God ſometimes pulleth away our
worldly ſtayes and props, to make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
more on Him, in whom our ſtrength
and comfort lieth.</item>
                  <item>2. He ſometimes takes away our comforts,
to return them better, as he did <hi>Jobs.</hi>
Gods pulling down, is ſometimes for this
end, to build up better. To make that
of Marble, that before was but of Brick.
He ſometimes takes a comfort out of our
hands, to deliver it again to us, with
Intereſt and Advantage.</item>
               </list>
               <p>5. Some look upon this as Evil; Gods exerciſing
them with many ſad and ſore Afflictions. And ſome
of the Grounds that they go upon, are theſe:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Afflictions are Arguments of Divine
Wrath.</item>
                  <item>2. That they are Uſeleſs.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:107590:55"/>
3. That they are Bitter, and Burthenſom to
Nature.</item>
                  <item>4. That they are the Fruits of Sin.</item>
               </list>
               <p>We ſhall Examine theſe Grounds, on which
many go, in making ſuch a Judgment of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Condition.</p>
               <p>1. Say ſome, Afflictions are Arguments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wrath, and Divine Hatred; and therefore
not good for man in this Life: ſince ſuch, as upon
whom Afflictions fall, are as it were marked out by
God, as the Objects of His hatred.</p>
               <p>Now let us a little examine this, and ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be ſo; and upon ſerious and ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
we ſhall find, It is an Error, being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Scripture-Truth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. They who ſay
ſo, condemn the generation of the Juſt; we find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that moſt precious Saints, whom God tendred
as the Apple of his Eye, have ſeen and felt, great
Afflictions. <hi>Noah,</hi> who found Grace in the Eyes
of the Lord, yet ſaw a World drowned. <hi>Job,</hi> of
whom God gives a moſt high Character, for his
Piety and Uprightneſs, <hi>was stript of all to a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchet.
David,</hi> a man after Gods own Heart, was
bred up in the School of Affliction. Yea, Jeſus
Chriſt himſelf, who was the Beloved Son, yet was,
<hi>Vir Dolorum,</hi> A man of Sorrows. You ſhall find,
that to ſome, the Scripture makes Afflictions to
be Arguments of Divine Love, <hi>Prov. 3. 12. Whom
the Lord loveth, he Correcteth, as a Father doth his
Son, in whom he delighteth.</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of them, as Arguments of Love, <hi>Rev. 3. 19. As
many as I love, I Rebuke and Chasten.</hi> It is true,
God delights not in Afflicting; but he loves His
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107590:55"/>
Children; and that Love moves Him as a Father,
to Correct and Afflict them for their Good. He
were a cruel Father, that would ſuffer his Child
to die for want of a little Phyſick. So that it is
a groſſe Miſtake, to think that Afflictions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Wounds of an Enemy. But of this, more
ſhall be ſpoken afterwards.</p>
               <p>2. Some have this Conceit; That an Afflicted
condition is an Uſeleſs condition; and therefore not
good for a man in this Life. They look upon Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as things that a man may be very well without.</p>
               <p>We ſhall a little examine, whether this be true,
or no. Many indeed ſay, concerning Afflictions,
as thoſe did concerning <hi>Nazareth, Can any Good
come out of Nazareth?</hi> So, Can any good come out
of Afflictions? We muſt know, That Afflictions
are as neceſſary for us, as our Daily Bread. It is
ſtrange, yet it is true, <hi>Theſe Thorns will bear
Grapes, and theſe Thistles will bear Figgs:</hi> And
there is a Day, when the Saints of God ſhall ſay,
They could not have been without ſuch and ſuch
Afflictions; and that <hi>It was good for them that they
were Afflicted.</hi> Some <hi>Trees</hi> there are, whoſe <hi>Root</hi>
is <hi>Bitter,</hi> yet their <hi>Fruit, Sweet.</hi> A natural Eye
ſeeth no <hi>Good</hi> in them, and taſtes no <hi>Sweetneſs:</hi>
And indeed, the Spiritual man, doth not always,
at preſent, diſcern what Advantage cometh by
them. We muſt know, thoſe <hi>Creatures</hi> that we look
upon as <hi>Venemous,</hi> and <hi>Noxious,</hi> are yet uſeful for
ſome Ends, and ſome Reſpects: Thus, even <hi>Toads, &amp;c.</hi>
The skilful <hi>Apothecary</hi> knoweth how to make
<hi>Vipers</hi> and <hi>Scorpions,</hi> Medicinal. Enquire of the
Saints of God, and they will tell you, from their
own Experience, What good Afflictions have done
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107590:56"/>
them; and that they were <hi>Chastned for their Profit,
Heb.</hi> 12. 10. Afflictions ſeem to be but dry Rods;
yet, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, they have found them bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth both <hi>Bloſſomes,</hi> and <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Some ſay, Afflictions are bitter, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom
to Nature; and therefore conclude, they
are not good for a man in this Life.</p>
               <p>We ſhall a little examine this, to ſee whether
there be <hi>Truth</hi> in it. The Premiſes are granted,
That they are <hi>Bitter</hi> and <hi>Grievous</hi> to Fleſh and
Blood; and the Apoſtle grants it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. But
the Conſequence is denied, That what is <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Grievous</hi> to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> is therefore
<hi>Evil</hi> for a man in this Life. And therefore we are
to diſtinguiſh, between what is <hi>Toothſom,</hi> and
what is <hi>Wholſom:</hi> Between things, that are <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly,</hi>
and <hi>Profitably</hi> good. Things may be <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi>
good for us, that are not <hi>Pleaſingly</hi> good.
Thoſe things are ſometimes moſt <hi>Wholſom,</hi> that are
leaſt <hi>Toothſom.</hi> There be ſweet and honied <hi>Poyſons</hi>
that Deſtroy. And there be bitter, and diſtaſtful
Medicines that do Cure. We know Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
is a Bitter hearb, and yet Wholeſom,
and Uſeful for Man. Some things may be
ſweet in the Mouth, that yet are bitter in the
Stomack. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. The Apoſtle ſaith of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
though they are <hi>Grievous,</hi> yet they bring
forth the <hi>quiet fruit of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Here is the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Evils of Sin, and of Affliction.</p>
               <p>The Evils of Sin, they are Sweet in the Mouth,
but bitter afterwards; but the Evils of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are bitter in the Mouth, but ſweet in the
Cloſe. Afflictions indeed are bitter, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
the bitterneſſe ariſeth from our own Spirits.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107590:56"/>
When our Taſte is Vitiated, ſome things ſeem to
be Bitter to us, that otherwiſe would not be ſo.
It's our Spirits, that many times Imbitter our
Condition, and make our Chain much Heavier,
than other waies it would be. There are many
Afflict themſelves, when they are under an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
As it is with a <hi>Bird,</hi> when it is gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Room, or Chamber, it might do well, if it
ſate ſtill, till the Doors and Caſements were
opened; but, till then, with flying againſt the
Walls, it doth but hurt and bruiſe it ſelf. To
cloſe up this: Phyſitians do obſerve, we are moſt
apt to Surfeit of thoſe things that are moſt Sweet
and Luſcious. And we find, <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wiſeſt of
Men, prefers bitter things, before Sweet. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
7. 3. <hi>Sorrow is better than Laughter.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>It is
better to go to the Houſe of Mourning, than to the Houſe
of Feasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Some ſay, That Afflictions are the Effects and
Fruits of Sin; And therefore not Good for a man
in this Life.</p>
               <p>We ſhall a little Examine this Ground. It is
true, That Afflictions, were, at firſt, Fruits of Sin.
But we muſt make a Difference, between what
they were at Firſt, and what Jeſus Chriſt hath
made them, to His People now. It is true, they
were at firſt, the products of Sin; but to the People
of God they are now Changed and Altered. We
muſt Diſtinguiſh between what is Sinfully Evil,
and Penally Evil. What is Sinfully Evil, is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
Evil; but Afflictions are but Penally
Evil, and may be made good. We muſt know, As
there is a Regeneration of Perſons, ſo of Things:
To him that is Born again, All is Born again; As
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107590:57"/>
his Outward Comforts are born again, ſo all his
Outward Afflictions. It is true, the Evils of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
were firſt Conceived in the womb of Sin,
and Sin brought them Forth: but there is the
womb of the Covenant, and of the Promiſe, where
they are New-formed; and out of which, thoſe
things that were Puniſhments, come forth Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
and what was Loſs, comes forth Gain.
We read, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. Sin entred into the World, and
Death by Sin.</hi> We ſee Death came in by Sin. Death,
which is <hi>the King of Fears;</hi> and ſo its Attendants
with it, <hi>viz.</hi> all Miſeries and Afflictions whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Thus, at firſt, they were conceived in, and
came forth of, the womb of Sin: but the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and Promiſe, have changed and altered
them; it turneth Miſeries into Mercies, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
into Priviledges, and Evil into Good.
1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22. All is yours,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;)
and among other things, he names
<hi>Death:</hi> where he makes Death one of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
Priviledges, put into the Believer's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. ſaith, <hi>To
him to Die, was Gain.</hi> Death, in reſpect of its
firſt Birth, was Loſſe; but being born again, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Gain. And as Death, which is <hi>the King
of Fears,</hi> (and ſo the chief of Evils;) ſo likewiſe,
all other Evils are Gain to a believer. <hi>Rom. 8. 28.
All things work together for Good, to them that love
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have examined the Grounds, that
thoſe go upon, in making this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of an Afflicted Condition; <hi>That
it is Evil for a Man in this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:107590:57"/>
I ſhall Conclude with theſe Queries:</p>
               <p>1. Who knows, or can ſay, that, That is Evil
for a man in this Life, that God inflicts upon the
beſt in this Life. We often find the cup of Gall
and Wormwood going round about the Saints
Tables. We uſually find it the Diet-drink, with
which God doth <hi>Phyſick</hi> his <hi>Dearest Children:</hi>
With the ſame Sword wherewith He deſtroyeth
his Enemies, He ſometimes wounds his Friends;
and all this for their Good. We find, the Godly
ones of <hi>Judah</hi> were carried Captives to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as
well as others: they loſt their Houſes, Eſtates;
were taken out of the Land of their Nativity, and
carried into a ſtrange Land: And yet the Lord
ſaith of them, <hi>Jer. 24. 5. That he had ſent them into
Captivity for their Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Who knows, or can ſay, that, that is Evil
for man in this Life, that may be conſiſtent with
Happineſſe. An Afflicted Man may yet in this
Life be a happy Man. As Man, at his beſt Eſtate,
is but Vanity; ſo there are, that in their worſt
Eſtate may be Happy. A Man may be Great,
and Rich, and yet Miſerable: And, a Man may
be Poor, and Afflicted, and yet Happy. <hi>Job 5. 17.
Behold, Happy is the Man whom God Correcteth.</hi>
It ſeems to be a ſtrange thing, and therefore a
<hi>BEHOLD</hi> is put to it. A ſtrange Sight, to ſee
an Afflicted Man, and yet a Bleſſed Man! Senſe
and Reaſon wonder at this Conjunction, That
Affliction and Happineſſe ſhould both Kiſſe the
ſame Perſon. <hi>Pſal. 94. 12. Bleſſed is the Man whom
thou Chastnest, &amp;c.</hi> So that a Man may be a Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
man, and yet a Bleſſed man.</p>
               <p>3. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That thoſe things
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107590:58"/>
are evil for a man in this life, that, by experience,
have been found, to have been the means of doing
many good. Though Afflictions of themſelves have
not done it, yet, being Sanctified, and Inſtruction
going together with them, they have wrought a
Gracious and wonderful Change. How many may
ſay with <hi>David, That it was good for them, that they
were Afflicted.</hi> We read, of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod, what
Miracles it wrought. The Rod of Affliction works
Miracles, when God worketh with it. How many
Proud ones, hath Affliction Humbled? When <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi>
was in Bryers, then he ſought God. How
many Ignorant ones, hath Affliction taught? They
have Learnt that, in the School of Affliction, that
they never knew before. Sir <hi>Thomas Palmer,</hi> upon
<hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> when he came to Dye, (pointing to
the <hi>Tower</hi>) ſaid, I have learnt more, in yonder
dark Corner of the <hi>Tower,</hi> then ever I learnt in
all may Life. How many wild, and unruly Spirits,
hath Affliction tamed? Thoſe, that in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
have been, as Wild Aſſes, uſed to the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
that none could turn them back: Yet in
their Moneth of Affliction, they have been found
and taken. <hi>Jer. 31. 18. Ephraim</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou hast
Chastiſed me, and I was Chastiſed.</hi> (i. e.) I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the Chaſtiſment. He was, as an unruly
Bullock, unaccuſtomed to the Yoak. But Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have made him to ſubmit, and tamed him.
How many Wandring ones, hath Affliction Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and brought into the Way? <hi>Pſal. 119. 67. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was Afflicted, I went astray: but now I keep thy
Statutes.</hi> Many have been out of the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and have been brought into it, by Gods
Guiding with this Rod. It was Affliction, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107590:58"/>
made the Prodigal find the way to his Father's
houſe. We read of thoſe that were with <hi>Paul</hi> in
the Ship, when they ſuffered Ship-Wrack, <hi>Acts</hi>
27. 44. that ſome upon Planks, and ſome upon
the broken pieces of the Ship, got ſafe to Land.
So, many have been brought to Heaven, upon the
broken pieces of an Eſtate; and muſt ſay, (as one,
once ſaid) <hi>They had been undone, if they had not
been undone.</hi> How many worldlings, hath Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
Weaned from the world? By being croſt
in the creature, they have come to diſcern the
Vanity that is in the creature, and to have their
hearts taken off the creature. Here we taſt Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(as a Father ſaith) <hi>Tanquam amaritudinem in
where materno.</hi> We are apt to hang on the breaſts
of the Creature, and Afflictions are the Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
by which God Weans us from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> How many Sinners, hath Affliction ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
who elſe, had run headlong into Hell; if God
had not made a Hedg of Affliction in their way?
We read, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 6. I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>hedg
up thy way with Thorns, and thou ſhalt not find thy
paths.</hi> God ſometimes, maketh a hedg of Thorns,
whereby ſinners are ſtopped; It is happy for a
man to meet with ſuch a ſtop, though the hedg
be made of Thorns.</p>
               <p>4. Who knoweth, or can ſay, That, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is Evil for a man in this life, in which the
People of God are beſt. This is to be conſidered,
that wicked men, are worſt, in their beſt world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condition; and a Godly Man, is beſt, when
his outward condition, is worſt. As one ſaith of
the Engliſh Nation.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:107590:59"/>
Angliea gens est optima flens &amp; peſſimaridens.</q>
               <p>The Engliſh Nation, is beſt when it Weeps, and
worſt when it Laughs.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Second ſort, of thoſe that are
miſtaken about Conditions.</p>
               <p>3. There are another ſort, that are groſly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on the other hand; And ſuch are thoſe, who
think it cannot but be well with them, becauſe they
are in this life Afflicted. Thus ſome think, they
are the better, and the happier, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
And here lyeth the miſtake, becauſe they
hear, Afflictions have done ſome good; and that
ſome, have been able to ſay, That it was good for
them, that they were Afflicted; and thence Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That they are happy, becauſe their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is ſuch a Condition: Never conſidering,
(what I ſaid before,) That Afflictions of themſelves,
never did any man good; and that conditions are
to us, as we are in thoſe conditions. Some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they Suffer in this world, think it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that they ſhall be freed from Suffering in
another world; as if God could not make two Hells
for them. We muſt know, when the Scripture
ſpeaketh of Rejoycing in Affliction, it is not to be
underſtood, that meerly Afflictions are matter of
Joy. thoſe that think, they are happy becauſe
they are Afflicted, and that their Condition is low
in this world, may be ſadly miſtaken. It is ſaid,
<hi>Mat. 5. 3. Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. It is
not ſaid, Bleſſed are all that are poor in Purſe.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107590:59"/>
Let me tell you, Some mens ſufferings here, are
but the forerunners of thoſe that are to come, and
ſo may be but the beginning of ſorowes. We muſt
know, that upon the very Tooth-ach of a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
(as one ſaith) Hell is Engraven. Every <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
is not taken into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. Thoſe
may want a bit of bread here, that may hereafter,
cry as <hi>Dives</hi> did, for a drop of water, to cool
their tongues. A man may be poor in this world,
and poor in the world to come. There are a ſort
of poor, that are the worſt of people under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
being Ignorant, Stubborn, Prophane, Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Deſpiſers of God, His Sabbaths, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Miniſters, People. And indeed, for the moſt
part, the pooreſt ſort, are the worſt of people, and
the moſt Licentious; there being nothing of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
or politique Reſtraints, or civil and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Education, to keep them in, and hold them
back. To conclude this, Happineſs is not the
portion of every Afflicted man in this life. It is
not Affliction, but Affliction Sanctified, that makes
a man Happy by it.</p>

                  <p>IF no man knoweth, What is good for a man
in this Life, then it Informeth us, That
we ſhould be as ready to receive evil, as well as
good, at the Hands of God. We are not to be
our own Carvers in reſpect of Conditions. When
<hi>Job</hi> was in his ſad Condition, the Devil ſtirred up
his Wife, to tempt him to Blaſphemy, and Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency.
But ſee what anſwer <hi>Job</hi> returns to her,
<hi>Job 2. 10. Thou ſpeakest as one of the fooliſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
&amp;c.</hi> Where Firſt, He Reprehends her. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
He Inſtructeth Her. <hi>Shall we,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>receive Good at the Hands of God, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Evil; (q. d.</hi>) Have I, for ſo many Years,
received ſo many good things, and bleſſings, from
the Hand of God; and ſhall I not now, receive
theſe Croſſes and Afflictions? Now, receiving Evil
from the Hand of God, ſtands in this, In a Sweet,
and Patient Submiſſion, to the Will and Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God; being content, with what God ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
whether it be good or evil, and that upon
theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>1. That God knoweth, what is better for us in
this life, then we do; ſince no Man knoweth, what
is good for man in this life.</p>
                  <p>2. That Good and Evil, come both, from one
and the ſame God. It is the Lord that gives, and
that takes away. As we have Bleſſings, by Divine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107590:60"/>
Donation, ſo Afflictions, by Divine Ordination.
It is God, that bringeth not only Men, and their
Comforts, but alſo Men, and their Croſſes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>3. As Good and Evil, come from the ſame God,
ſo they may come from the ſame Affection in God;
They may both come from Love. The Apoſtle
<hi>James,</hi> puts this Queſtion, <hi>Can a Fountain ſend
forth ſweet water and bitter?</hi> Jam. 3. 11. Yet from
the ſame Fountain of Divine Love, may iſſue the
ſweet Waters of Comfort, and the bitter Waters
of Afflictions. The ſame Love, that moves a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to beſtow an Inheritance on his Child, moves
him alſo, to Correct his Child.</p>
                  <p>4. All Evils, come from a God, that hath a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power over us, and may do with us, what
he pleaſeth. A God that may give, and take away;
and who can ſay to Him, <hi>What doest Thou?</hi> A God
that hath Right to all that we have, and ſo may take
away what he pleaſe. In taking away, he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but what is His own. It is obſervable in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
That the Lord claimeth an Intereſt, in all
that belongs to Man, (<hi>viz.) The Earth, and the
Fulneſs thereof;</hi> and ſo, whatſoever it affordeth
to man, Whether Fields, full of Corn; or Foulds,
full of Sheep; or Orchards, full of Fruit; or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
full of Meat. The very Cattel, and the Beaſts
of the Earth, are the Lords, <hi>Pſal. 50. 10. All the
Beasts of the Forrest are mine.</hi> The Beaſts of the
Forreſt, are of a wild nature, and commonly know
no Maſter; and yet of theſe, The Lord ſaith, they
are His: So alſo, He ſaith of Gold, and Silver,
<hi>Hag. 2. 8. Thy Gold and Silver, is mine.</hi> Yea, <hi>the
Wool, and the Flax we have. Hoſ.</hi> 2. 8. He ſaith,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107590:61"/>
                     <hi>It is His.</hi> So that God, in taking away any thing
from us, takes away but what is His own.</p>
                  <p>5. All Evils, come from the Hand of a Powerful
God, with whom there is no Contending. When
a great Philoſopher was chekt, for yielding in a
Diſcourſe he had with <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, he
gave this Anſwer, Should I not yield to him,
that hath Thirty Legions at command? There is
no Conteſting with Soveraignty, no Reſiſting
Omnipotency, no Striving with our Maker. The
Earthen Pitcher, by ſtriking againſt a Rock, doth
but daſh it ſelf to pieces.</p>
                  <p>6. All Evils, come from a Righteous God, that
can do His creature no wrong, <hi>Gen. 18. 25. Shall
not the Judg of all the Earth do Right?</hi> Rom. 3. 5.
<hi>Is God Vnrighteous,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that taketh
Vengeance?</hi> And he anſwereth it, with a <hi>God forbid.</hi>
So we may ſay, Is God Unrighteous, that ſendeth
Affliction? <hi>God forbid,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. <hi>All His wayes
are Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. All Evils come from that God, that can
bring Good out of Evil, and Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
that can turn Water into Wine, and make
us Spiritual Gainers, by Temporal Afflictions.
He ſometimes pulls down, to build up better;
and ſometimes takes away, when He intends a
greater Good.</p>

                  <p>We now come to the Reſolution of this great
Queſtion, Whether the knowledg, of what is good
for a man in this life, be ſo hidden from man, that
it may not in ſome meaſure be attained to; And
if ſo, What Directions are there, for the attaining
of this Knowledg?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:107590:61"/>

of <hi>what is good for a man in this Life,</hi> be ſo
hidden, That a Man cannot make a Judgement
of others conditions, yet we grant that he may
make a judgement of his own Condition. And here
I ſhall give in, ſome Directions to help Men, in
making a Judgement of their own Condition.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. General.</item>
                     <item>2. Particular.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. General Directions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Something is to be Known.</item>
                     <item>2. Something is to be Done.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. Something is to be Known, before we can
make a right Judgement of our Condition. So
the things to be Known, are theſe:</p>
                  <p>1. Who is the Framer of our Conditions; Who
it is Ordains and Appoints them, and puts us
into them? It is not, as the Heathen thought,
<hi>Quiſque fortunae ſuae faber,</hi> That every Man is the
Framer of his own Fortune; and ſo of his own
Condition. Conditions are Divine Allotments.
<hi>Miſery</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) ſprings not out of the Dust.</hi> And
the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That Promotion comes neither
from the East, nor from the West; but God is the
Judge:</hi> i. e. He is the great Orderer, and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of Conditions: He puteth down One, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
up Another. It comes not from the Eaſt or
Weſt; It comes not from Earth, nor from Man;
but it is God, that brings a Man, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
together, and that Frames it for him.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107590:62"/>
And it is impoſſible, that ever any Man ſhould
make a true Judgement of his Condition, That
doth not firſt Know, who is the Framer of it.</p>
                  <p>2. We muſt know the right way of making a
Judgement of Conditions. Except we know that,
it is impoſſible, but we muſt be Miſtaken. And, I
ſhall give you ſome Particulars concerning that:
<list>
                        <item>1. In Judging of Conditions, Take heed
of being over-Haſty. Haſty, and Raſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is ſeldom Right. We are to Weigh,
and Conſider well of a Condition, before
we make a Judgement of it. A Condition,
at the firſt Bluſh, may ſeem otherwayes then
it is. The Good, and ſo the Evil, of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
doth not appear preſently; It may lie
at the Bottom of it. The good of Affliction
doth not appear preſently: but the Apoſtle,
ſaith, <hi>Heb. 12. 11. It yeildeth the quiet fruit
of Righteouſneſſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, to them
that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> So, that we muſt
be Exerciſed in a Condition, before we
can make a Judgement of a Condition.
And the Apoſtle, in that Chapter, telleth
us, That an Afflicted condition, at the
firſt ſight, ſeems <hi>grievous,</hi> and not <hi>joyous:</hi>
but, <hi>afterwards</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it brings forth the
quiet fruit of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This was the
Errour of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends; they were too
haſty in making a Judgement of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
and ſo, it is no wonder they were
ſo Miſtaken about it.</item>
                        <item>2. In making a Judgement of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you muſt not judge of the Perſon by the
Condition, but of the Condition by the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107590:62"/>
Perſon. Some there be, that judge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
by the Condition; As the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
did of <hi>Paul,</hi> when they ſaw a Viper
hanging on his Hand; <hi>Surely, this Man is a
Murderer, &amp;c.</hi> Thus, ſome judge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to be Good, or Evil, according as
their Conditions are. So, they judge thoſe
to be Good, whoſe condition is Proſperous;
as thoſe in <hi>Malachi, Mal.</hi> 3. 15. called <hi>the proud
Happy.</hi> And, ſo they look upon thoſe as
Wicked, who are in an Afflicted condition.
Thus, <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends did judge of him, by
his Condition. Now, the right way of
making a Judgement of Conditions, is, To
Judge of Conditions by Perſons. To a
Wicked man, every condition is Evil:
And, to a Godly man, every condition is
Good. That, as the Expreſſion is, <hi>Tit. 1. 15.
To the Pure, all things are Pure:</hi> So, to thoſe
that are Good, all things are Good. If he
hath Proſperity, it cauſeth Thankfulneſs;
if Adverſity, it worketh Patience. <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 28. <hi>All things work together for Good, to
them that Love God.</hi> So that we muſt know,
we are to judge of Conditions, by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
When one came to <hi>Austin,</hi> and told
him of one that came to a ſtrange End, he
preſently asked, <hi>But, how did he Live?</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating,
That, a man was not to be judged
of, by the manner of his Death, if he were
Godly in his Life.</item>
                        <item>3. In making of a Judgement of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
you muſt judge of them, by what
Men are to, and in, their Conditions. I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107590:63"/>
have told you before, A condition is to a
Man, as he is to, and in, his condition.
It is, as a Man mannageth his condition.
Would you know, whether Proſperity be
Good for a Man? You muſt ſee how he
doth manage that condition; and how he
doth carry, and deport himſelf in it. If he
demean himſelf Proudly, and make the
Things he enjoyes, to be Fuel for his Luſt;
you may conclude, his condition is Evil
for him. So, on the contrary; Would you
know, Whether an Afflicted condition be
Evil for a Man? Mark how he Behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in that condition; If Fooliſhly, if Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently;
Either on the one hand, Deſpiſing
the Affliction; Or, on the other hand, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
at it: You may know, that it is
Evil for him. Of this, I ſhall ſpeak more
afterwards.</item>
                        <item>4. To make a Judgement of Conditions,
We muſt Know our Spirits, and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now, we cannot know the Spirits,
and Diſpoſitions of others; but we ſhould
labour to know our own, which we may
know; and thereby come to know <hi>what is
good for us in this Life.</hi> Some there are,
That will undertake to make a Judgement
of a condition, without ever eying, or
conſidering their own Diſpoſition. It is
with ſome Men, as it is with ſome that ſit
at the Wine: when they have drunk ſo many
Cups, yet they call for the other Quart, and
the other Pint, when they have Drunk too
much already; not conſidering what their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107590:63"/>
heads will bear. Conſider, as all heads,
ſo all diſpoſitions are not alike. This <hi>Agur</hi>
acknowledged in that prayer of his, <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. 8. <hi>Give me not Riches.</hi> He looked upon
them, as a heady and intoxicating Drink,
which was too Strong for him. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſpeaks of ſome, that are ſtrong to
drink Wine. Now a man of a weak Brain,
that will make their meaſure his, is eaſily
overtaken. We are apt to eye the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
condition of another, and to think
ſuch a condition is good for us; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
to have our condition made after
that Faſhion and Mode. But this is, as if
the younger child ſhould cry, to have the
coat of his elder brother, which would be
too long for him, and ready continually to
make him fall.</item>
                        <item>5. In making a Judgment of a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we muſt judg of it, by the relation it
hath to another condition, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is
Spiritual and Eternal. The ſaying is, that
what is the firſt, and beſt, in every thing,
is the Rule of the reſt: So the beſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt direct us, how to judg of lower
conditions. That condition is good for a
man, that makes his Spiritual Condition
the better: This is the fault of many, they
judg of conditions, without conſidering
how they ſtand in conjunction with, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to, their Spiritual and Eternal
Condition. We may ſafely conclude, that
that Condition is good for a man in this
Life, that is an advantage to him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107590:64"/>
to another Life. Many, little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this. We ſhould put the queſtion to our
ſelves, in every condition, Am I the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for being in this Condition, in relation
to the Spiritual and Eternal Good of my
Soul? Doth it hinder, or further my growth
in Grace? Doth it hinder, or further my
Salvation? Doth it ſet me, nearer Heaven,
or nearer Hell?</item>
                        <item>6. In making a Judgment of Conditions,
we muſt make uſe of Faith, and not Judg,
by Senſe and Opinion, not by Appearances;
Thoſe that Judg ſo, will never make a
Right Judgment of Conditions. An Eye
of Faith will ſee Good, in that wherin an
Eye of Senſe, yea of Reaſon too, can ſee none,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. It is ſaid, By Faith, <hi>Moſes</hi>
refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoahs</hi>
Daughter, &amp;c. Where ſee, what he refuſed
(<hi>viz.</hi>) to be called, the Son of <hi>Pharoahs</hi>
Daughter; which ſeemingly, was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Honour and Advancement, that a man
could attain unto; And then ſee what he
choſe, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to Suffer Affliction with the
People of God. One would have thought,
he had choſe the Evil, and refuſed the Good.
But by an Eye of Faith, he ſaw Evil in that,
that Senſe and Reaſon would have told
him was good; and Good in that, that
they would have told him was Evil. It is
obſervable, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. that all the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
are affixed, to unlikely conditions:
<hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit. Bleſſed are thoſe
that are Perſecuted for Righteouſneſs Sake.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107590:64"/>
Bleſſed are ye, when men Revile, and Perſecute
you, and ſpeak all manner of evil against you,
falſly for my Names ſake.</hi> This is to ſhew,
that the Judgment of the Word, and the
Judgment of the world, are contrary. Faith
will ſhew you, that the men of the world,
are <hi>infoeliciter foelices</hi> miſerable in being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
And the Children of God, are <hi>foelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
infoelices,</hi> happy in their being miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So that, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Without
Faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> So, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith, it is impoſſible to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of conditions. I ſhall cloſe this, with
an Anſwer, given to one, that paſſed his
cenſure upon a picture, as ill drawn, when
it was not ſo; <hi>Si meos oculos haberes, non ita
diceres,</hi> If thou hadſt mine eyes, thou wouldſt
not ſay ſo. Faith teacheth a man, to make
another Judgment of Conditions, then
Senſe or Reaſon doth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. Thoſe that will make a judgment of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
muſt know another thing, (<hi>viz.</hi>) What it
is makes a condition good, and what makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
evil for a man in this life. I ſhall in ſome
particulars ſhew, What it is, that makes a mans
condition good for him in this life.</p>
                  <p>1. An Intereſt in the Covenant. Where there
is that Intereſt, there is an aſſurance that all is
good, and all is for good. When we once come
to know our Intereſt in the Covenant, we may then
make a judgment of a condition. I ſhewed you
before; we are not to judg of perſons, by their
conditions, but of conditions, by the perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
25. 10. <hi>All the wayes of the Lord, are Mercy and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107590:65"/>
Truth, to them that keep his Covenant.</hi> So it is to
them that have an Intereſt in the Covenant. All
conditions fall under a Promiſe, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith, <hi>All ſhall work together for good.</hi> An Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
condition it ſelf, falleth under that promiſe.
So when it is ſaid, <hi>No good thing, will He with-hold
from them, that walk uprightly.</hi> Afflictions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
come under that promiſe. If Afflictions be
good for them, they ſhall have them; and if they
have them, they may be aſſured they are good for
them. It is the Covenant, and Promiſe, that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, to make a right Interpretation of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and of all the Dealings of God with us in
this life.</p>
                  <p>2. That which makes a condition good for a
man in this life, is the Enjoyment of God in a
Condition; and ſo we may conclude, that that
condition is good for a man in this life, in which
he enjoys God. The beſt condition, without God
in it, is evil; and the worſt condition, in which
we enjoy God, is good. God is the chiefeſt Good,
and that condition muſt needs be good, in which
we enjoy the chiefeſt Good. Look upon the worſt
of outward conditions, it is the beſt, if there be
an enjoyment of God the more in it. This was
the ground of <hi>Moſes</hi> choice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. that he
chooſe rather, the ſuffering of Affliction with the
People of God, then the enjoyment of all <hi>the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Treaſures of Egypt.</hi> He ſaw, God was to be
Enjoyed in that Condition. So that by this, we
may make a judgment of conditions: That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is good for a man in this life, in which he
enjoys the chiefeſt Good. The Apoſtle ſaith,
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 5. As our Tribulations abound for Christ, ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107590:65"/>
our Conſolations abound through Christ.</hi> When one
ſeeth Chriſtians abound in Tribulations, he would
think their condition evil; but when he cometh
to ſee their Conſolations abound in that condition,
he muſt needs conclude it good. To cloſe up this,
There is no condition good, without the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Chiefeſt Good. He that enjoys God
in a condition, enjoys Him, whoſe Favour is Life,
and whoſe Countenance is a Sun, to enlighten the
darkeſt condition. It is the Sun, that makes day,
let the Starrs be never ſo many, and ſhine never
ſo bright, yet it is night ſtill. So it is in reſpect
of conditions, let a man enjoy never ſo much of
the creature, yet without the enjoyment of God,
it is but a dark condition. It is His Countenance,
that makes the darkneſs of a condition, to be light
about us, <hi>Pſal. 18. 28. He ſhall make my darkneſs,
to be light.</hi> Mic. 7. 7. <hi>Though I ſit in darkneſs, the
Lord ſhall be a light about me.</hi> So that that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is good for a man in this life, that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth,
and ſhineth upon, with the beams of
His Countenance.</p>
                  <p>3. That that ſpeaks a mans condition Good for
him in this Life, is, The ſuitableneſs of his Spirit
to his condition. When the Spirit is not above
the condition. As it is to be obſerved in a Married
condition; the ſweetneſs of the condition lieth in
this, In the Suitableneſs of their Spirits. So, in
every condition, the ſweetneſs, and goodneſs of it,
lieth in the Suitableneſs that is between our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and our Condition. We ſee how it is with
ſome, That their ſpirits are above their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
their ſpirits are High, when their condition is
Low; and upon this, their condition doth not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107590:66"/>
pleaſe them. And this is the cauſe of much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
becauſe their ſpirits ſuit not with their
condition. This is the great thing we are to look
to; In making a judgement of conditions, to
ſearch, and find out, How our ſpirits ſuit with our
condition. Whether we can ſay, as the Apoſtle
doth, <hi>Phil. 4. 11. I have learnt, in every estate to be
Content.</hi> He had a ſpirit fitted for every condition.
So then, when your ſpirits and conditions ſuit, it is
one thing, by which you are to make a judgement
of your condition.</p>
                  <p>4. That which makes a condition Good for a
man in this Life, is, <hi>Peace within.</hi> What ever the
condition be Without, if there be peace Within,
it makes it good and ſweet to him. Want of that
imbitters a condition. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is a continual Feast.</hi> It Feaſts a man, and
makes him Merry in all conditions; and ſo makes
the worſt Outward eſtate and condition to be good
and ſweet to him. <hi>Iſa. 48. 22. There is no peace, ſaith
my God, to the Wicked.</hi> Put him into what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you will, he hath no Peace in that condition;
and that ſpoils all.</p>
                  <p>5. That, that makes a condition good for a
man in this Life, is, Doing the Work of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Conditions have their ſeveral, and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Improvements. In every condition, a man
ſhould put ſuch a Queſtion to himſelf, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
puts, <hi>Mich. 6. 8. And now, What doth the Lord
thy God require of thee?</hi> So, in every condition we
ſhould put this Queſtion to our ſelves; What is it
that the Lord requires me do, as the work of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells us of Duties ſuitable
to conditions, <hi>Jam. 5. 13. If any man be Afflicted,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107590:66"/>
let him Pray; If any man be Merry, let him ſing
Pſalmes.</hi> An Afflicted condition hath its Duties,
and a Proſperous condition hath it's: And by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Work, and performing the Duties of a
condition, we make a Judgement of it, Whether
it be good for us in this Life.</p>
                  <p>6. That, that makes a condition good for a
man in this Life, is, His living above his outward
condition. When, though there be a ſuitableneſs
of ſpirit to the condition, yet he takes not up
with his condition, but fetcheth in his Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from ſome higher thing. What is it, that
makes a Proſperous condition Evil to ſome? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, they look no further than their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
They look no higher than Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
&amp;c. and ſeek for all their comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
from them. And likewiſe, What is it that
makes an Afflicted condition Evil to ſome? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, they have their Eye only upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
they look no higher than their Troubles,
and Croſſes, and Afflictions. They ſee nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their condition; as <hi>Hagar,</hi> when ſhe was
wandering in the Wilderneſs, and the Water in her
Bottle was ſpent, ſhe concludes, that She, and her
Child, muſt Die: as though the Bottle was all that
ſhe, and her Child, had to live upon; when yet,
there was a Fountain near, but ſhe could not ſee
it. Let a mans condition be what it will, yet it
cannot hurt him, if he live Above it. Proſperity
cannot hurt that man, who maketh God his All, in
a condition. There is an Expreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 22.
concerning a Wicked man; That <hi>in the midst of
his Sufficiency he ſhall be in Straits.</hi> Thus it is with
ſome men, Let their condition be what it will, yet
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107590:67"/>
in the midſt of it they are in Straits: the Reaſon
is, Becauſe they live no Higher than their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the midſt of their Proſperity, and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
they are in ſtraits, by reaſon of their many
Cares, and Fears, and perplexing Thoughts, and
unſatisfied Deſires; and if ſo in Proſperity, much
more in Adverſity. Now, a man that lives upon
that, that is Higher than his Condition, hath ſuch
ſweet In-comes of Joy, and Peace, and Comfort,
and Contentment in every Condition, that he is
never in any Straits. Hence it is, the Apoſtle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 6. Godlineſs, with Contentment, is
great Gain:</hi> Or, it may be read thus, <hi>Godlineſs is
great Gain, with Contentment;</hi> i. e. It bringeth Gain
with Contentment. Now, what is Godlineſs? It
is an Heavenly impreſſion, and propenſion in the
heart and ſoul of a Man, whereby it is, in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
carried towards God. Now, what ever a
mans condition be, Godlineſs will make it Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and that with Contentment. Our Saviour
told his Diſciples, when they urged Him to Eate,
<hi>John 4. I have meat to eate, that ye know not of.</hi>
So it is with ſuch a man, that lives upon God, and
Chriſt, he hath, in every condition, that comfort, &amp;
contentment, that the World knows not of. Thus
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> lived above his condition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
6. 10. <hi>As Sorrowful, yet always Rejoycing; As having No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yet poſſeſſing All things.</hi> q. d. Men look upon
us, as thoſe that are in a ſad condition, being Poor,
and having Nothing; but we live upon ſomething
that is above our condition. So that every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is good to him, that hath ſomething to live
upon above his condition. That, as it is in reſpect
of Ordinances, ſo it is in reſpect of Conditions,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107590:67"/>
We are, in the Uſe of Ordinances, to live above
them, and to ſeek to find God in them: So in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
we are to live above them, and to ſeek to
God, for that comfort and contentment that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a condition. Before I leave this, I muſt tell
you, there is a two-fold living above ones condition.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Sinful:</hi> Ariſing from Haughtineſs of
Spirit.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Holy:</hi> Proceeding from Heavenlineſs of
Spirit.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. <hi>Sinful:</hi> When a mans Heart, and Spirit, is
not contented with its preſent Condition; when
his ſpirit is above his condition, and he thinks his
condition too low, and mean for him. This is Sinful.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Holy:</hi> When a man hath ſuch a Heavenly
Spirit, that cauſeth him, not to take up with the
things of his Outward condition; but lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Higher things. And this ſtands in Two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Living above the Comforts of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</item>
                     <item>2. Above the Croſſes of a Condition.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. Living above the Comforts of a Condition.
It is thus with a gracious heart: when the outward
condition is comfortable, yet he liveth upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
above the comforts of his condition. It is the
Apoſtles Counſel, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29. &amp;c. Let thoſe that
have Wives, be as though they had none, and thoſe
that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not.</hi> He liveth
upon higher things, than the comforts of a Wife,
So that it is, as if he ſhould have ſaid; The comfort
in a Wife, was nothing, in reſpect of the comfort
he finds in God, and Chriſt. And ſo he ſeeth, that
in his condition, there is nothing to rejoyce in,
in compariſon of higher things. As Chriſt ſaid to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107590:68"/>
his Diſciples, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, That the Devils
are ſubject to you; But rather rejoyce in this, That
your Names are written in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Living above the Croſſes of a Condition:
The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 29. Let them that weep,
be as though they wept not.</hi> To ſhew, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
ſhould live above the Croſſes of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
enjoying that that makes them weep, as if
they wept not.</p>
                  <p>7. That, that makes a condition Good for a
man in this Life, is, Watchfulneſs againſt the
Temptations that attend a Condition. There
muſt be ſtanding upon our guard in Conditions,
and watching againſt Temptations. Conditions
(as I have ſhewed you formerly) are attended
with Temptations. There are Temptations, that
attend a Proſperous, and an Afflicted condition.
Sathan layeth ſnares for us in every Condition; but
cannot hurt us, if we but once know his Devices.
He is ſubtle, and loves to Fiſh in all Waters; and
ſo he layeth Snares in all conditions. This then
ſpeaks a condition Good, when we Watch againſt
the Temptations of a Condition. The Apoſtle
writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> a young man, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22.
biddeth him <hi>flie the lusts of Youth.</hi> Youth hath its
Luſts, and Conditions have their Temptations,
which we ought to Watch againſt. A Proſperous
condition hath its Temptations, and an Afflicted
condition hath its Temptations. The Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. bids him, <hi>Charge them that are Rich
in this World, that they be not High-minded; and
that they trust not in uncertain Riches:</hi> Which
ſhews the Temptations that attend that Condition,
<hi>viz.</hi> High-mindedneſs, and truſting in Riches.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107590:68"/>
An Afflicted condition hath its Temptations too,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. Where, writing to them that were in
an Afflicted condition, he exhorteth them to avoid
two Extreams, in <hi>ver. 5. My Son, Deſpiſe not the
Chastning of the Lord; neither faint, when thou art
Rebuked of him.</hi> In an Afflicted condition, we are
apt, either to Deſpiſe the Affliction, or to be too
much dejected and caſt down under the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And therefore, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. he bids them <hi>lift up
the hands that hang down.</hi> So <hi>James</hi> 5. he ſpeaks
to Afflicted ones to be Patient, and ſtabliſh their
Hearts. And <hi>ver.</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>Grudge not one against
another, Brethren.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Groan
not one against another.</hi> In it, there is an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them, to watch againſt the Temptations
that attend an Afflicted condition. Some think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Apoſtle there forbids Murmuring Groans, which
ariſe from our being diſcontented at Providences:
This is one Temptation. Some think, they are
Vindictive Groans, proceeding from Revenge,
and Stomack againſt thoſe that were the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our Affliction: This is another Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Some think, are meant Envious Groans, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from their Envying at thoſe, that ſuffered
leſſe than they did: This is another Temptation.
Thus we ſee, That all Conditions have their
Temptations. And this is that, that ſpeaks a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
Good for a man; when, in his Condition,
he is watchful againſt the Temptations of it;
avoiding the Snares of it. Satan obſerveth wind
and tide in his Temptations; he obſerveth the
wind and tide of a Condition. He obſerveth,
whether the wind that bloweth, be a warm Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
wind of Proſperity, or an cold Northerly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107590:69"/>
wind of Adverſity; and accordingly he ſuits
his Temptations. It is the Condition that makes
the Temptation in ſeaſon. He ſeldom tempts a
poor man to pride: And therefore it is made, by
<hi>Solomon,</hi> a prodigious ſight, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 7. to ſee
<hi>Servants on Horſe-back.</hi> So he ſeldom tempts
Rich men to Steal; the reaſon, is, Becauſe ſuch
Temptations are unſuitable to their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>8. THat that makes a condition Good for a
man in this Life, is, Spiritualizing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
when there is an extracting ſomething that
is Spiritually good out of our outward, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Conditions. Alchymiſts tell us, There is
an Art, of turning baſer Mettals into Gold: So
there is a Heavenly Art, of Spiritualizing tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conditions, and turning them into Heavenly
Advantages. The Gracious man is the true Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt,
that can extract ſomething that is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
out of that which is Temporal; and what
concerns another Life, out of the things of this
Life. We muſt know, there is an Art of Byaſſing
conditions. A Bowl runneth according as you
ſet the Byaſs; ſo conditions are according to the
Byaſs you put upon them. When a condition is
Spiritually Byaſſed, it moves a man Heaven-ward:
Conſider how it is with Saylers; though they have
a Side-wind, yea, a Wind that ſeems to blow
againſt them; yet they have an Art of ſetting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107590:69"/>
their Sails ſo, that they will make an advantage of
thoſe Winds. So Grace, will teach every Man, ſo
to manage his Condition, that, let the Wind of it
blow from what place, or quarter it will, yet it
ſhall be Advantagious to him, for the carrying
him on, towards his deſired Haven, which is
Heaven. We muſt know; Outward conditions
are common to Good and Bad. But here lieth
the difference; The Godly man, from a Heavenly
Principle, makes a Spiritual Advantage of his
condition, when another doth not. Some, when
they are in Proſperity, or Adverſity, (being Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
underſtand not the Art of making a Spiritual
Advantage of a Condition.</p>
               <p>We know, there are ſome actions that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to Men, and Beaſts; As to Eat, Drink, and
Move, &amp;c. The Beaſt doth it, and Man doth it.
Now where is the difference? In this, when Man
doth them, they are Reaſonable Actions, they are
guided with Reaſon, and moderated by Reaſon;
but when a beaſt doth them, they are the actions
of a beaſt, and ſo they are but brutiſh. So it is in
reſpect of conditions, they are common to good,
and bad; but here lyeth the difference. A Godly
man, being indued with a Principle of Spiritual
Wiſdom, makes a Spiritual Advantage of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
be it what it will; when the other, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no ſuch principle, knoweth not how to do it.
It is with Godly Men, in their worldly conditions,
as it is with the Planets, which have a motion of
their own, contrary to that Rapt Motion of the
Heavens, whereby they are carried, and whirled
about, in twenty four hours. So it is with Godly
men, in their conditions, they are carryed about
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107590:70"/>
as the world is, in reſpect of conditions. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their outwards, they are in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with others, ſometimes Rich, ſometimes
Poor, ſometimes High, ſometimes Low, ſometimes
in Proſperity, and ſometimes in Adverſity: But
in theſe conditions, they have a different motion
from others; being directed by Grace, and the
Spirit of God, they move Heaven-wards. Even
in thoſe conditions, that ſeem to carry them down-wards,
they have a motion upwards. We know in
Scripture, Proſperity is called a Mountain; and
Afflictions are compared to, and called Waters. As
for Proſperity, which is called a Mountain, Grace
teacheth a man, to get on the top of it, from
whence he may ſee Heaven the better, as <hi>Moſes</hi>
did the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from the top of Mount
<hi>Piſgah.</hi> Some there are, when their Mountain is
made high, they ſet it between them and Heaven.
And alas! what can a man ſee, when he is at the
bottom, and foot of a Mountain? When a man,
is on the top of a Mountain, then the Face of the
Heavens, lyeth open to his View. Then a man
may conclude, A proſperous condition is good for
him, when it is not a Mountain, to hide Heaven
from him, but to raiſe him up, more towards
Heaven. So for an Afflicted Condition: Afflictions,
are in Scripture, compared to Waters. Thus it is
with ſome, when they come into theſe waters, they
ſink, and are over-whelmed. Theſe waters run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, and drown them. But with a Godly
Man, it is otherwiſe; he ſwims upon theſe waters,
and is like <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark in the Deluge, the higher
the waters were, the more it was lifted up, towards
Heaven: So the riſing of theſe waters of Affliction,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107590:70"/>
do but lift a Godly man up, nearer to Heaven. So
then, if a man would make a judgment of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he muſt ſee, whether they are Spiritually
good for him, by what Spiritual Extraction he
maketh out of them, and what Spiritual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he makes of them.</p>
               <p>9. That that makes a condition good for a man
in this life, is, An holy indifferency of Spirit, in
reſpect of conditions. When it is indifferent to
him, what condition he is put into, ſubmitting
to the Will of God, and reſolving, Gods Will,
ſhall be his. Then is a condition good for a man,
when his Spirit is brought to this indifferency.
In reſpect of Salvation, he is Abſolute; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of outward conditions, whether to be high
or low, he is indifferent, and ſaith, <hi>Let it be as the
Lord will.</hi> When there is this ſubmiſſion to God
in a condition, then it is good. Some there are,
that have indeed, an indifferency of Spirit, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Spiritual, and Eternal Good Things;
but none, in relation to thoſe good things that are
Temporal. They are indifferent, whether they
have Grace, or not, &amp;c. But concerning the things
of this life, it is with them, as with <hi>Rachel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
children, They muſt have them, or elſe
they dye. Then it is right, when there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
of Spirit, in reſpect of outward things.
When our hearts are not ſet, on this or that, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing; but we are indifferent, whether we have
it or not. If God will give them the things of this
life, ſuch Spirits will be thankful; if God deny
them, to them, ſuch Spirits will be content. Such
a Spirit had the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 4. 11, 12. Not that
I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in reſpect of want, for I know both
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107590:71"/>
how to be abaſed, and how to abound, &amp;c.</hi> And telleth
us withal, <hi>that he had learned, in every condition,
therewith to be content.</hi> (q. d.) As for theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, it is indifferent to me, whether I
have them, or have them not; I will not be my
own Carver, but am content, with whatſoever
condition God ſhall put me into. A Gracious
Spirit, is indifferent about all things, ſave-only
thoſe, that concern the good of his Soul. As that
Martyr, Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> anſwered, when one asked
him at parting, What he would have to the Queen,
No more but this, ſaid he, Tell Her Majeſty, If
ſhe will give me my Life, I will thank Her; if ſhe
condemn me to Perpetual Impriſonment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will
thank her; If ſhe will Baniſh me, I will thank Her,
If ſhe will Burn me, I will thank Her. Herein the
indifferency of his Spirit appeared; that, let the
Queen deal with him, how She pleaſed, it would
pleaſe him, and he ſhould therewith be content. Thus
it is with a Gracious Spirit, It is content to be in
what condition God ſeeth beſt for him. And this
indifferency ariſeth from the Conſideration of
theſe things:</p>
               <p>1. From the conſideration of Outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the Things of them, that they can
neither make a Man truly Happy, nor truly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.
Riches, and Honour, and ſuch things,
cannot make a man truly Happy. A man may be
Rich, and yet a Reprobate. Happineſs lieth in
higher Things, and higher Enjoyments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo
likewiſe, Troubles, and Croſſes, and Afflictions,
cannot make a man truly Miſerable. It is Sin,
not Sufferings, that doth that. This <hi>Chryſostom</hi> knew,
by returning that Anſwer to the Empreſs, who
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107590:71"/>
Threatned what She would do to him; Tell Her,
(ſaid he) <hi>Nil niſi peccatum timeo,</hi> I fear nothing
but ſin.</p>
               <p>2. From the conſideration of this, That he
is not at his own diſpoſing, but at God's, who
may do with him, what he will, and put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what Condition He pleaſeth. He knoweth, he is
not to be the Framer of his own Condition, and
therefore, leaves it to the Great God, to chooſe
and Frame his Condition for him.</p>
               <p>3. From the conſideration of this, The change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of Conditions; He conſiders this, If I
ſhould have Proſperity, it may quickly turn to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
God having ſet the one, over againſt the
other. And the conſideration of this changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is one thing that helpeth, to put the Spirit
upon this indifferency.</p>
               <p>4. From the conſideration of this, That he knows
not what condition is good for him in this life, and
thence concludeth, that that condition muſt needs
be beſt for him, that God ſeeth beſt.</p>
               <p>5. From the conſideration of this, What rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he hath to the world, that he is but a Pilgrim,
and Stranger here, only Travelling through it,
towards his Home. And ſo looketh upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
here, only as his Inn, in which he is to Lodg.
From this conſideration, ariſeth this indifferency of
Spirit. He is indifferent concerning his Inn, when he
conſidereth, It is not his Home; if he be well accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
it pleaſeth him, if not, yet he is contented,
conſidering this, I am not to dwell here. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to Gracious Spirits, are as weather is to
Travellers, whether it be Fair or Foul, being on
his Journy home-wards, he is content.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:107590:72"/>
10. That that makes a condition good for a man
in this life, is, A mans behaviour in his condition.
Then it is right, when nothing from God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth
us; and nothing from us, diſpleaſeth God.
When we are contented, with all the Lords deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with us; and make it our care in a condition,
that our carriage may be ſuch, that it may not
diſpleaſe him. Some there are, that if God put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
them into a proſperous condition, and waters of a
ful cup are wrung out to them, it pleaſeth them well.
But then, in that condition, it is not their care to
pleaſe God; they abuſe their Proſperity, to Pride,
and Luxury, Gluttony, and Drunkenneſs. As it is
ſaid of <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> Deut. 32. <hi>He waxed fat, and kicked.</hi>
Some there are, that if God put them into an Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition, are not pleaſed with what God doth,
neither do they pleaſe Him, in what they do, in
that condition. As thoſe Diſpenſations of God,
are unpleaſing to them; ſo their behaviour, in that
condition, is ſuch, that it is moſt diſpleaſing to
God. How many do Fret, and Murmur, and break
forth into the indecencies of paſſion, againſt God?
As that Wicked King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, <hi>This Evil is of
the Lord, why ſhould I wait any longer?</hi> So conſider,
Then a condition is good for a man;</p>
               <p>1. When nothing that comes from God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth
him, let him put him in what condition
he will. Let God ſet him up, or caſt him down;
let Him feed him, with pleaſant bread, or with the
bread and water of Affliction; Let Him ſet him
upon the Throne, or on the Dung-hill; Let Him
be a giving God, or a God taking away: Yet he
is not diſpleaſed with Gods dealings with him.
You may remember, what <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid, when the ſad
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107590:72"/>
News was brought him, concerning what God
would do by him and his houſe; his Anſwer was,
1 <hi>Sam. 3. 18. It is the Lord, let him do what he will.</hi>
Thus did <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> Iſa. 39. 8. Thus did <hi>Job,</hi>
when he received the ſad News, concerning the
loſſe of his Children and Goods, ſaid he, <hi>The Lord
gives, and the Lord takes away. Bleſſed be the Name
of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When we diſpleaſe not God in a condition.
When we are ſo careful of our behaviour, that we
ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal. 39. 1. I ſaid, I will take
heed to my wayes,</hi> &amp;c. He there, takes up a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
of not giving liberty to his Tongue, to
utter an impatient Word, or Syllable. So then,
if we would know, whether the condition we are
in, be good for us in this Life; we muſt enquire
concerning theſe two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Whether God's dealings with us,
pleaſe us; and our carriage, in our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pleaſe Him? The Truth is this,
Moſt of us, deſire that God would pleaſe us
in our conditions, and give us, what we
deſire. As <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſaid of the Woman of
<hi>Timnah, Give her me, for ſhe pleaſeth me well.</hi>
So ſay ſome, Give me this, and that, put
me into ſuch a condition, for it pleaſeth
me well. But here is the Sin, They have
no care to pleaſe God, in their condition.
It is with them, as with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
who asked meat, for their luſts. And as
thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh,
<hi>They ask, that they may ſpend it upon
their lusts.</hi> So that, a condition is then
good for us, when nothing from God,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107590:73"/>
diſpleaſeth us, and nothing from us, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth
God in the condition.</item>
                  <item>II. That that makes a condition good
for a man in this life, is, a mans enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himſelf in his condition. An holy
and comfortable enjoyment of a mans ſelf,
in a condition, ſpeaketh his condition good
for him. The enjoyment of God, and the
enjoyment of our ſelves, in a condition,
makes a condition good for us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Concerning a proſperous condition, How
many have loſt themſelves in that condition; that,
as we ſay of thoſe, whom Wine, or Strong Drink hath
overcome, that they are not themſelves. Some, are
ſo overcome with their proſperity, that we may
ſay of them, they are not themſelves. In the
midſt of their enjoyments, they enjoy not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
They poſſeſs not, but are poſſeſſed. The
world doth poſſeſs them. They are, at beſt, but
Servants, and Slaves to the world. The world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
them, but they do not enjoy themſelves.
<hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 2. of a man, to whom
God hath given Riches, but not power, to eat thereof.</hi>
Such a man, is a very Slave to what he hath, and
cannot find in his heart, to ſerve himſelf with it.
They ſuffer the world to eat out their very hearts,
with Cares, and Troubles, and Thoughtfulneſs,
ſo that they enjoy not themſelves. Know this,
that a quiet, and a comfortable enjoyment, of a
mans ſelf in a condition, is a good, and a ſweet
thing.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning an Afflicted condition. How
many are there, that do not enjoy, but loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in that condition? There are many, when
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107590:73"/>
they are loſers in the world, do loſe themſelves to
both, by their Impatiency, Murmuring, and
Fretfulneſs. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luk. 21. 19. In
your patience, poſſeſs ye your Souls,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>poſſeſs ye
your Selves.</hi> It telleth us, that an impatient man,
doth not poſſeſs, nor enjoy himſelf. It is with an
impatient man, as it is with ſome children, when
you anger them, by taking away what they have in
one hand, they throw away, what they have in
the other hand too. Thus Satan tempts ſome, to
throw away themſelves, when they find, that other
things are taken away; and ſo they loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a condition. Let me tell you, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
in which a man enjoyes Himſelf, is good;
in which he enjoyes his Reaſon, and regulates his
Affections, and Paſſions by it. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid,
<hi>That in the midst of his Aberrations, his Wiſdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with him.</hi> (i. e.) he had his Judgment, and
Underſtanding about him. We ſhould bring our
Affections, and Paſſions, to the Examination of
Judgment, and Reaſon. If he rejoyce, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him, to put this queſtion to himſelf, What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
have I for it? And if he grieve, What reaſon
have I for it? Is the thing worth my joy? and
worth my ſorrow? So, to cloſe up this, enjoyment
of a mans ſelf, conſiſts in this, in a ſweet tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Spirit, and temper of Soul; which neither
Proſperity, nor Adverſity can alter. It is an equal
Minde, in unequal Conditions.</p>
               <p>12. This makes a condition good for us in
this life, Our Adorning our Condition. There
are many, that are a ſhame to their conditions,
doing that, which is unbeſeeming their condition.
No man need to be aſhamed of his condition, if he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107590:74"/>
be not a ſhame, to his condition. The Apoſtle
ſpeaketh of Adorning our Generation, <hi>Phil. 2. 15.
Among whom, ye Shine as Lights, in the midst of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Generation.</hi> So ſhould a man adorn his condition:
Though it be Dark, yet he ſhould Shine in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherein ſtands the Adorning of a man's
Condition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Exerciſing and Acting the Graces
of a Condition. The Stars in the Firmament, are
an Ornament to it. So the Firmament of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
hath its Graces to Adorn it; the ſhining
forth of which, is the Adorning of the condition.
There are proſperity-Graces, and adverſity-Graces,
and the acting of theſe Graces, is the adorning of the
condition. A proſperous condition hath its graces, by
the acting and exerciſing of which, a gracious Heart
doth Adorn it. So an Afflicted condition, hath its
Graces, which adorn it. It is ſad to ſee, how many are
a ſhame, to their conditions; there being no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of grace, ſhining forth, ſuitable to their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
We muſt know, as all Relations, and Conditions,
have their Duties, ſo their Graces. Magiſtracy hath
it's: They muſt be men, fearing God, Ruling in the
fear of God, hating Covetouſneſs. Miniſtry hath
it's Graces, As the Apoſtle ſheweth at large, in his
Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy:</hi> Which Graces, are for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning
of their Profeſſions. So conditions have
their Graces too, by which they are Adorned. A
thankful Spirit, and a publique Spirit, and a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and inlarged heart, adorn a Proſperous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
As on the contrary, a patient, and meek,
and humble Spirit, ſubmitting wholly, to the Will of
God, adorns an Afflicted Condition. As a man by
Unthankfulneſs, and Self-ſeeking, &amp;c. ſhames a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107590:74"/>
Proſperous Condition: So ſome, by their Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
and Fretting, and Murmuring, &amp;c. ſhame
an Afflicted Condition: Of whom, we may ſay,
They ſhame their conditions, and their conditions
are a ſhame of them. How many are there, that
have made their condition to be evil ſpoken of, by
being a ſhame to their condition.</p>
               <p>Thus I have finiſhed the firſt ſort of General
Directions, concerning what is to be known
of thoſe, that will make a right Judgment
of Conditions.</p>
               <p>2. I now come to give you in, General Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
concerning what is to be done, by thoſe that
will make a right Judgment of conditions.</p>
               <p>1. He that will make a right judgment of his
condition, muſt be much in inquiring of the Lord
by prayer, what his minde, and meaning is in a
condition. As prayer is the means, by which we
come to know the mind and meaning of God, in
his Word, ſo alſo in his Works, and ſo in thoſe
conditions he puts us into. We read of <hi>Jeremiahs</hi>
inquiry, concerning the proſperous condition of
the wicked, <hi>Jer. 12. 1. Why doth the way of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
proſper?</hi> We are indeed, to take heed, of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
abſolute Interrogatories to God; as if he were
bound, to give an account of His Providences to
us. Yet we may lawfully go to Him, in a humble
way, to ſee what is His Minde, and Meaning
in a Diſpenſation, and in a Condition. It is our
Duty, to get as near God as we can, to know this.
This is one thing, <hi>Job,</hi> in his Afflicted condition,
did deſire of God, <hi>Job. 10. 2. Shew me, wherefore
thou contendest with me.</hi> (i e.) what this Affliction
meaneth? whether it proceed from love, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107590:75"/>
whether it intend good, or evil? Are you
in a proſperous condition, and would you make a
judgment of it, whether it be good for you? Or in
an Afflicted condition? The way to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your condition, is, to be much in ſeeking
to God by prayer, to know His minde, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a condition. Although the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
of prayer, as a Duty, moſt ſuitable to an Afflicted
condition, <hi>Jam. 5. 13. If any among you be afflicted,
let him pray.</hi> Yet let me tell you, Prayer is a duty,
that ſuits with every condition. As we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the meaning of God, concerning Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
ſo concerning a Proſperous condition:
if he putteth us into it, we are to begg of Him, the
interpretation of the condition. Many there be,
that never ſay, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> In
theſe enquiries concerning conditions, we muſt
know, we are not ſo much, to enquire after the
reaſons of Gods dealing ſo with us, as of our
duty, what we are to do in that condition. So
then, prayer is a means, by which we muſt come
to make a judgment of our condition. We ſhould
get as near God as we can, to hear what He ſpeaks
concerning our condition. As it is the Pſalmiſt's
expreſſion, <hi>Pſal. 85. 8. I will hark, what the Lord
will ſpeak.</hi> So we ſhould harken, What the Lord
will ſpeak, concerning our condition. There is
no man, can give a right judgment of an earthly
condition, till he hear ſomething from Heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. There was of old, this cuſtom among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> That it was not lawful, to propoſe any
matter of moment in the Senate, <hi>priuſquam de Caelo
obſervatum erat,</hi> before their Wizzards had made
their Obſervations from the Sky, and Heavens.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107590:75"/>
What they did Impiouſly, and Superſtitiouſly, we
ought to do Piouſly, in reſpect of conditions (<hi>viz.</hi>)
Not to make a judgment of them, till we have
heard from Heaven, concerning them. It is not
by the obſervation of the houſes of the Planets, or
their Aſpects, or their Oppoſitions, or Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſuch an obſervation is forbid by a voice from
Heaven. But we are to hearken, what the Lord
ſpeaketh to us, concerning our conditions; and
Prayer is the means, by which (though we are on
earth) we have an anſwer from Heaven. The <hi>Jews</hi>
had two means, by which they received Anſwers
from God. Firſt, by the Mouth of the Prophets,
when the Spirit came upon them. Secondly, by
the Prieſts, when they put on the Breſt-plate of
Judgment. Thoſe wayes of Underſtanding the
Minde of God, are ceaſed. We have the Word
to go to, and Prayer, to make uſe of, <hi>Jam. 1. 5.
If any man lack Wiſdom, let him ask of God.</hi> The
Apoſtle ſpeaks there, of a man in an Afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and ſpeaks to ſuch in an Afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as thoſe that need Wiſdom, both for the
managing of their condition, and for the making
a right judgment of it. He telleth them, what they
muſt do, they muſt ask this Wiſdom of God. It is
as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, When you are in ſuch
a condition, you need wiſdom.</p>
               <p>1. Wiſdom, to diſcern God's end in it, and to
find out the meaning of God, in a Diſpenſation.
When we receive outward good things, from the
Hand of God, or Afflictions, whether it be for
good, or evil; It tends much, to the quieting, and
and ſatisfying our Spirits in a condition, when we
can find out, what is God's end in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107590:76"/>
2. Wiſdom, to find out our duty in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There are ſeaſonable, and proper duties, which
belong to, and become every providence and
diſpenſation. Now here is Wiſdom, to find them
out, and to know what we have to do in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
It is ſaid of the men of <hi>Iſſachar, 1 Chron.</hi>
12. 32. <hi>They had underſtanding of the times, and
knew what Iſrael ought to do.</hi> So, there is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
required of a man, to know what to do in
every condition. As one, being invited to a Feaſt,
asked the Philoſopher, who was his Tutor, How
he ſhould behave himſelf; <hi>Remember thou art a
King's Son, (i. e.</hi>) Behave thy ſelf, as becometh
thy Birth, and Dignity. So here is Wiſdom, to
know the duties of our condition, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to behave our ſelves.</p>
               <p>3. Wiſdom, to regulate, and moderate our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and paſſions, in a condition. That a man
be not too much taken with the comforts, nor too
much troubled with the croſſes of a condition.
Now for the attaining of this Wiſdom, the Apoſtle
gives this Direction, that we muſt ask of God.</p>
               <p>2. He that will make a judgment of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
muſt be much in ſearching himſelf, to ſee what
he is in a condition. I have ſaid before, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is to be judged of by the perſon, and that
conditions are to men, as they are to, and in,
their conditions. Here is the miſtake of many, they
go to make a judgment of their conditions, before
they make a judgment of themſelves. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſpeaketh, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 3, 4. of them that ſee a
<hi>Mote in their Brothers eye, and diſcern not the Beam
that is in their own eye.</hi> They would go about to
reform others, before they reform themſelves.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107590:76"/>
Thus ſome would go to make a judgment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
before they make a judgment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and that Ignorance is a Beam in their eyes,
that keeps them from diſcerning a condition.
There are ſome (as I have ſhewed you) to whom
every condition is a Curſe; and ſome, to whom
every condition is a Bleſſing. The great thing we
are to do, is, to ſee of which number we are. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
77. we find <hi>Ver. 1, 2. David</hi> was in an Afflicted
condition, and ſee what he doth in that condition.
Firſt, he ſought the Lord, <hi>Ver. 2. In the day of my
trouble I ſought the Lord.</hi> He made his Addreſſes to
God. Secondly, he fell upon a ſearch of himſelf,
<hi>Verſ. 6. I communed with my own heart, and my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
made diligent ſearch.</hi> Where we ſee, he both
ſought the Lord, and ſearched Himſelf. So that
before a man can make a perfect judgment of a
condition, there muſt be a ſearching of himſelf.
There muſt be a communing with his own heart.
We muſt underſtand our ſelves, before we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
our condition. <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 2. No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
love or hatred, by what is before him.</hi> When a
man looks only upon the outward Diſpenſation,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Riches, and Honour, on the one hand; and
Croſſes, and Afflictions on the other: A man may
pore upon theſe, all the dayes of his life, and yet
be never the wiſer; he may ſtare on them, till his
eyes drop out, and yet not know, whether they
are good, or evil for him, whether they ſpeak
love or hatred. But then you will ask, What ſhould
a man do in this caſe, that he may know? He muſt
not look ſo much on things without him, as things
within him; he muſt not ſo much eye, what his
condition is, as what he is in his condition. It is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107590:77"/>
not for a man to look what God doth without, but he
muſt look what God hath done within him; to know
the meaning of an outward Diſpenſation. Hath
God made you one of His? hath He ſhed his Love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in your hearts? hath He given you, the
New Name, which none knoweth, but he that hath
it? have you, the Engravings of Heaven on your
Spirits? have you Love to Jeſus, written upon
your hearts? and Holineſs to Jehovah, upon your
Fore-heads? By this, you may know the meaning
of a condition. As it was ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> That he
knew, what was done in Heaven, by what was done
in his own heart. Much more may we know the
meaning of what is done on earth, by what is done
within us. The outward Diſpenſation is dumb,
and ſaith nothing of it ſelf, in reſpect of Love and
Hatred; it is ſomething within a man, that muſt
ſpeak that. There is an expreſſion, <hi>Pſal. 25. 14.
The Secret of the Lord, is with them that fear Him,
and he will ſhew them His Covenant.</hi> We muſt know,
in Gods Diſpenſations, there is a Secret; a Secret
of Love, and a Secret of Hatred, and this lyeth
hid in the Diſpenſation; ſo that a man, may look
long enough upon the outward diſpenſation, and
not ſee the Secret, that is in the diſpenſation. Now
the Godly Man, and he that feareth God, knoweth
this Secret of a Diſpenſation. God ſheweth ſuch
a one His Covenant, ſo that he finds all coming
in by Covenant, let it be what it will, whether out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Bleſſings, or outward Afflictions. In a word,
Thoſe that will make a judgment of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condition, muſt know, that all is Good, to
thoſe that are Good; and all is Evil, to thoſe that
are Evil. Wrath, and Hatred, and Hell, are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107590:77"/>
on a wicked Mans outward mercies, and on
a wicked Mans outward miſeries. Hell is Engraven,
on the very Tooth-ach of a Reprobate. As on the
contrary, Love is written, not only upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but alſo upon the Miſeries, of a Godly Man.
Bleſſedneſs is engraven upon his Afflictions, and
Perſecutions. So you ſee, that he, who will make
a judgment of his condition, muſt firſt make a
judgment of himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. He that will make a judgment of his outward
condition, muſt be ſure, to take a right view of his
condition. The not doing this, is one great
reaſon, why ſo many have been ſo groſly miſtaken
about conditions, calling Good, Evil; and Evil,
Good. We know, when a mans judgment is asked,
concerning the goodneſs and value of a thing,
he will firſt view it, before he gives his judgment
of it. So we muſt do concerning conditions, view,
before we judg. But you will ask, How may a man
come to take a right view of his condition, that
he be not miſtaken about it? For Anſwer to that,
take theſe Directions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He that will take a right view of a
condition, muſt view it by Scripture Light.
<hi>David</hi> was miſtaken, about conditions, till
he went into the Sanctuary, and by the
Light there, he ſaw, what he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diſcern. Many men, ſet up falſe lights,
and view conditions by them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the
Judgment and Opinions of others, and
their own Apprehenſions and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Theſe are Glaſſes, through which,
many look upon conditions, which make
but falſe Repreſentations. Some tell us, In
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107590:78"/>
the Opticks, there is a Glaſs, that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
a foul dirty way, ſo green and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
as if it were covered with Carpets.
Through ſuch falſe Glaſſes, do many view
their conditions. There are Magnifying
Glaſſes, that will repreſent the Object, far
bigger then it is; that will make a ſmall
Fly, ſeem a Hornet; a Straw, a Staff; and
a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, a Bean. Such a
Glaſs, a mans own apprehenſion, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is, in the viewing of his condition.
They make the things of a condition, ſeem
bigger to us, then they are. Thus ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
the comforts of a condition, and
the croſſes of a condition, are repreſented
to us, bigger than they are. Now, he that
will take a right view of a condition, muſt
lay aſide theſe falſe lights and glaſſes, and
muſt view his condition; by Scripture-Light.
And that for theſe reaſons:</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The Scripture will help a man, to make a
true diſcovery of the things of a condition. The
Scripture giveth us the beſt account of what the
things of a proſperous condition are, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Riches
and Honour, &amp;c. And it gives us the beſt account,
what Loſſes, and Croſſes, and Afflictions are. As
for the firſt, The Scripture telleth us, <hi>They are all
but Vanity.</hi> And that the beſt things of this world,
ſtand upon two lame Leggs, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Uncertainty,
and Inſufficiency. Nay, it is obſervable, it doth
not tell us the vanity of outward things, only No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
but delivereth it to us as a Truth, that hath
been Experimented and Tryed, by thoſe who
both had a Will, and alſo Ability, to make the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107590:78"/>
Experiment. Thus you find <hi>Solomon</hi> did; and, in
the Book of the <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> we have him, giving
in his Experiments, concerning the beſt of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, in this ſhort Sentence, <hi>All is vanity.</hi>
And then for Afflictions, the Scripture ſets up a
Light for us, for the taking a right view of them.
And telleth us, what Verdicts have been paſſed, by
thoſe who have had Tryals of them. Among others,
<hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>It was good for him, that he was
Afflicted.</hi> To cloſe this: Scripture Light, in reſpect
of this particular, muſt needs be a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to a man, in his taking a view of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>2. The Scripture will help us to view a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by diſcovering to us, What thoſe things are,
that make a condition good, and without which
a condition is not good. The Scripture is much,
in making out to men, what it is, that is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
<hi>Solomon,</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> ſheweth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
of men, concerning Happineſs, and makes
it appear by Experience, that it did not lie in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
or Pleaſures, or Riches, &amp;c. And Obſerve
how he cloſeth his Book, with a diſcovery of that,
wherein mans Happineſs lieth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 13. Hear
the concluſion of the whole matter, <hi>Fear God, and
keep his Commandements, for this is the whole duty
of man.</hi> It is the <hi>Totum hominis,</hi> the whole, and
the All of man. The Scripture, doth not only
diſcover to men, what the good and evil of this
world is; but alſo, what it is, that is good indeed,
without which, a condition is not good, and with
which, a condition is not evil. It ſheweth a man,
That, without controverſy, this is good for a man in
this life, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Pardon, and Peace, and Union
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107590:79"/>
with God, and an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. Thus
the Scripture helpeth a man, in viewing, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
him to diſcover, what is good indeed,
and makes a condition good to a man. It holds
out a clear light to a man, by which he may find
out, what it is, that ſpeaks his condition good.
<hi>Augustin</hi> ſaid, of <hi>Tullies</hi> Works, They were once
ſweet to him, but now he found, no ſweetneſs in
them, becauſe he found not <hi>Jeſus,</hi> mentioned in
them. The Scripture directs us, in the viewing
of a condition, to do, as a man doth, when he
cometh into a Richly-furniſhed-Shop, ſeeking after
ſome rare piece of ware; though many be brought
to his hand, yet he layeth them all aſide, till he
find the piece he deſireth, and looks for. So it is
in viewing the good of a condition, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
will direct a man, to lay all aſide, till he come
to diſcern, that which is good indeed. In a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
condition, when Honour, and Riches, &amp;c.
come to hand, it teacheth him, to put the queſtion
to himſelf, Are there not better things then theſe?
So in an Afflicted condition, it teacheth a man,
to lay his Croſſes, and Troubles, and Afflictions
aſide, and to put the queſtion to himſelf, Whether
there be not greater evils than thoſe? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evils of Sinning, be not greater, than evils of
Suffering. The Scripture teacheth a man, to view
a condition, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> to
find out <hi>David,</hi> whom the Lord had choſen. <hi>Jeſſe</hi>
brings forth his Eldeſt Son, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, That is
not he: he then, brought his ſeaven Sons before
him, And <hi>Samuel</hi> anſwered, Neither hath the Lord
choſen any of theſe: and then he cometh to <hi>David,</hi>
who was the man looked after. In taking a view
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107590:79"/>
view of conditions, we muſt know, the Rule is this,
In viewing a Proſperous Condition, you may ſee
Honour, and Riches, and other things of the world,
paſſing by you; But, put them by, bid them
ſtand aſide: Tell them, They are not the things,
that make a man happy. So, in the taking a view,
of an Afflicted condition, many evils may preſent
themſelves to us; But the Scripture telleth us,
That theſe are not the evils, that we are to look
upon, as the worſt of evils.</p>
               <p>3. The Scripture doth thus help us, in taking
a view of our conditions; It unvayles conditions,
and unfoldeth the Myſteries of a Condition; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, a man cannot take a right view, nor
make a right judgment of his condition. We find
<hi>David,</hi> ſtumbling at the proſperity of Wicked men,
and at the adverſity of Godly Men; He knew not,
what to think of it, When he ſaw waters of a full cup,
wrung out to the one, and waters of Affliction to
the other; he began to think, that he was on the
wrong ſide, and that he had made a wrong choice:
And theſe words were coming out of his mouth,
<hi>That he had cleanſed his heart in vain.</hi> (i. e.) He
was about to ſay, It was in vain for him, and
others, to be Godly, if thus they were dealt with,
in this life; if they muſt be afflicted, and chaſtned,
while wicked men have, what heart can wiſh.
Now, how came <hi>David,</hi> to have his Judgment
rectified, concerning theſe Diſpenſations of God?
He telleth us, He went into the Sanctuary, and
there he underſtood the Myſtery of theſe Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations:
There he found the Riddle Unfolded,
and theſe Providences Unvayled. The Word of
God, will help us, to Interpret the Works of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107590:80"/>
God. It will help us to ſee within the vayl of a
condition, and to ſee the Wheel within the wheel.
It will teach us, not only to look on the Motions
of the wheels without, but will ſhew us, the Motions
of the Wheels within. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1. he puts the
queſtion, <hi>Why doth the way of the Wicked proſper?</hi>
He viewed their condition, and wondred at it. It
was a myſtery to him, that ſuch men ſhould proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that did deal very Treacherouſly. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
did not at firſt underſtand the Myſtery; Had
he gon into the Sanctuary, he would have found,
The way of the wicked did not proſper. And he
found it afterwards, as appeareth <hi>verſ. 3. Pull them
out, as Sheep for the Slaughter, &amp;c.</hi> q. d. Lord, I
partly ſee into the Myſtery of this Diſpenſation;
I find that their proſperity, is but a preparing them,
for the day of Slaughter. That thou doſt deal with
them, as men do with thoſe Beaſts they intend for
the Slaughter; They put them into the fatteſt
Grounds, and the beſt Paſtures. Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man, in viewing a condition, to view it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both ſides: and indeed, till a man do ſo, he will
never make a right view of a condition. Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are like that Cloud, by which God guided
the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſs;
they have their bright, and their black ſide. Some
in viewing a condition, look only upon it's bright
ſide, when the condition may have a black ſide. So,
ſome in viewing a proſperous condition, look only
upon the bright ſide, whereas, if they looked upon
the other ſide, they would find it black, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.
So concerning an adverſe condition, ſome
look only upon the black ſide, and ſee nothing but
what is ſad; whereas, if they looked upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107590:80"/>
ſide of their condition, they might ſee It
Bright, and Guilded with Love.</p>
               <p>4. By Scripture-Light, we ſee another thing,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) How to improve a condition. We can never
take a right view of a condition, till we view It
with it's Improvements. It is in viewing, and
making a judgment of conditions, as it is in a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man's
viewing of Lands; He conſidereth,
Whether they are to be Improved. Though
they ſeem Bare, and Barren, yet he conſidereth,
Whether they may not be improved to be worth
ſo much an Acre. So, the right viewing of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is, to view them, with their Improvements.
Now the Scripture helpeth us in this particular.</p>
               <p>1. It will ſhew us, How the Saints of Old, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
their conditions. How they Husbanded,
both Proſperous, and Adverſe Conditions, and
what they made of them. And thus it helpeth us,
to view a condition with It's Improvements. As
the Scripture ſheweth us, What the Saints of Old,
were in their ſeveral Generations, ſo what they
were in their ſeveral Conditions; when they were
High, and Low; Rich, and Poor. It ſhews us,
How <hi>Job</hi> Improved his Condition, when he was
<hi>Job</hi> the Wealthy, and Honourable; And how he
Improved his condition, when he was <hi>Job</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
and Afflicted. It ſheweth us, what <hi>David</hi>
made of his condition, when he was <hi>David</hi> the
King, and when he was <hi>David</hi> the Perſecuted.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> wrote a Treatiſe, to ſhew, How a man
might get profit by an Enemy. The Scripture is
nuch in ſhewing us, how to make profit of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that by ſetting before us, the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that others have made of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:107590:81"/>
2. The Scripture teacheth us, the Art of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them. It not only ſheweth us, that they
are improvable, but withal ſheweth us, how we
may improve them. There is a Story of a Romane,
who was Accuſed of Witch-craft; The Reaſon
given was this, That when his Neighbours Land
brought forth little, his brought forth abundantly,
though there was but a hedg betwixt them. So
this was the Charge, That by Witch-craft, he
drew all the Strength, and Fatneſs of their Soyl
into his, and by that means, Enriched his own
Land, and Impoveriſhed theirs: Being brought
before the Judges, be brought forth all the Tools,
and Inſtruments, which he uſed in the Tilling,
and Manuring of his Land: and anſwered, <hi>Haec
ſunt veneficia mea,</hi> Theſe are my Witch-crafts; And
withal, told his Judges, I am at Work, when my
Neighbours are aſleep; I Work, when they Play:
They are negligent, and uſe not that kind of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
that I do; and this is the true Reaſon, why
my Crop exceeds theirs. Concerning conditions,
it is thus, There is ſuch an Art of improving them,
that ſome may be great Gainers, when others get
nothing by them. This Art the Scripture teacheth
us, How to make a Spiritual Advantage of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Conditions. This is an Art, that Philoſophy
teacheth not. Indeed, Philoſophy teacheth the Art
of Moral improvements of conditions, but not
Spiritual; Scripture onely teacheth that. Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
tell us, There is an Art, of turning Baſer Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
into Gold. Philoſophy goeth thus far, to
teach us the Art, of turning conditions (as I may
ſay) into Braſs, or Copper, or Silver; but it can
never teach us the Art, of turning them into Gold;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107590:81"/>
The Scripture only teacheth that. Whoſoever
readeth the Works of <hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> and others of
that ſort, ſhall find indeed, excellent Directions,
for the Moral improvement of conditions; but as
for a Spiritual improvement, they tell you nothing.
That was above their reach, and their light did
not attain unto it. Now this great Art, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teacheth; it teacheth a man the Art, of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Thorns, bear Grapes; and of making Thiſtles,
bear Figgs. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) When a condition is Thorny,
and Prickly, the Scripture ſheweth a man, that
he may gather ſweet and pleaſant Fruit, from the
Thorns, and Thiſtles, of his Condition. As the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. That <hi>Affliction yieldeth
the quiet Fruit of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Where you ſee
Thorns, bearing Grapes. In a word, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teacheth a man the Art, of Sayling by the
Wind of a Condition, let it blow from what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it will. It is reported, That thoſe that Sayle
into the <hi>Indies,</hi> find in ſome places, the Winds
blow conſtantly for ſix Months one way, and for
the other ſix Months, quite contrary. Let the
Wind of a condition, blow which way it will, either
from the North, or from the South; yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
teacheth a Chriſtian, the skill of ſetting his
Sayles ſo, as that they ſhall further him in his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards Heaven.</p>
               <p>5. By Scripture-Light, a man cometh to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the dangers of a condition. To diſcover what
Rocks, and Shelves, are in the Sea of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that he may know how to avoyd them.
A man can never take a right view of a condition,
till he hath viewed it, with it's Dangers, Snares,
and Temptations. Of theſe, the Scripture makes
a Diſcovery two wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:107590:82"/>
1. By way of Caution. So it Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
men, concerning the dangers of a
Condition, both Proſperous and Adverſe.
As you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 11, 12. and <hi>Deut.</hi>
8. 11, 12, 13. <hi>When thou hast eaten, and art
full; Take heed thou forget not the Lord thy
God.</hi> Forgetfulneſs of God, is that, that
is to be taken heed of in a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
The Scripture is frequent in giving
ſuch Cautions, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17. Pſal. 62. 10.
Jer. 9. 23. Let not the Rich Man glory in
his Riches, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Scripture preſents us, with the
Examples of thoſe, that have miſcarried,
and fallen by their conditions. It ſheweth
us, againſt what Rocks, ſome in their Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
have daſhed their Ships. <hi>Deut. 32. 15.
Jeſurun waxed fat, and kicked. Neh.</hi> 13. 26.
we find how <hi>Solomon</hi> miſcarried in his Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaid in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Dan. 4. 30. Is not this great Babel that
I have built, &amp;c?</hi> In Scripture, you have
the Saints ſet out to us, as in their Graces,
ſo in their Sins. You have heard (ſaith the
Apoſtle) of the patience of <hi>Job;</hi> ſo from the
ſame Scripture, we hear likewiſe of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency.
As it acquaints us with the pride
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were in their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
ſo with their murmuring, and repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when they were in adverſity. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
32. 25. it is ſaid of <hi>Hezechiah, After he was
recovered, that he rendred not again, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what the Lord had done to him; for his
heart was lifted up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:107590:82"/>
6. Scripture-Light, diſcovereth another thing
concerning Conditions; And that is this, What
are the Alloys, and Correctives, of a Condition;
without the knowledg of which, we can never take
a right view of Conditions. On the one hand,
the pleaſantneſs of a condition may deceive us;
and, on the other hand, the ſeeming ill-favoured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a condition, may make us miſtaken,
in making a judgment of it. The Scripture diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth
this to us, What are the true Correctives
of a Condition? What may allay the Sweetneſs,
and Pleaſantneſs of Proſperity, that they be not too
much lifted up? And what will correct the bitter
ingredients of an Afflicted Condition, that they be
not too much dejected and caſt down? It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with men in conditions, as it is with thoſe
that go to Sea, of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh,
<hi>Pſal. 107. 26. They mount up to the Heavens, and
they go down again to the depths.</hi> So it is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
A man in a proſperous condition, when
the waters of a condition are full, he is apt to be
high, and high-minded: But he muſt know, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a condition may fall, and that conditions
have their depths. There are the full Tides, and the
Ebbs of a condition. It is ſometimes full Sea with
a man; the comforts of a condition, flow in a pace,
and then a man is apt to be lifted up. And then
there is the ebb of a condition, when there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and diminiſhing of thoſe comforts; and
then men are apt to faint, and be caſt down. Now,
Scripture-Light diſcovereth to us, what helps we
have in this caſe. We know how it is with Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Nets, They have Lead, to make them ſinck;
and they have Cork at them, to make them ſwim.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107590:83"/>
And both theſe are in Scripture, put upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conditions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For a Proſperous Condition, There
is Lead put upon it, to keep a man Low,
and Humble; and to Sink him in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
The Scripture telleth us, of the
Vanity of Riches, and Honour, &amp;c. It tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, of the Brevity, Uncertainty, and
Inſufficiency, that is in the Beſt of outward
things. Withal, it acquaints us, with the
Temptations, Cares, Troubles, Diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherewith thoſe things are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It telleth us, That the increaſing of
them, is but the increaſing of Vanity, and
Vexation of Spirit. Again, it telleth us
this, That a mans happineſs lieth not in
them; that a man may have them, and yet
be miſerable; and that, being vanity, they
cannot cure a mans vanity. Now this is
ſome of the Lead, that the Scripture put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to a proſperous condition, to keep men
low, and humble in it. The conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe things, are as Ballaſt to a Ship,
which makes it Sayl eevenly, and ſteadily.
When a man is in a proſperous condition,
his ſpirit is apt to be lifted up; and ſo it
needs Ballaſt, to keep it from Fleeting at
random, upon the waters of proſperity.
Now the Scripture is much in ſhewing,
what it is that ſhould keep the Spirit low, in
a high condition. Thus, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17. Charge
them that are Rich in this world, that they
be not high-minded; and that they trust not in
uncertain Riches.</hi> (Obſerve); There is the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107590:83"/>
Ballaſt, and there is the Lead, to keep down
the Spirit in a Rich condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) They
are uncertain Riches, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31.
Brethren, the time is ſhort, and the faſhion
of this world paſſeth away.</hi> q. d. Remember,
The time is ſhort, for your enjoying of the
comforts of this life, and the faſhion of the
world goeth away; the world is upon Gate;
and Marrying, and Buying, and Selling, &amp;c.
will ſhortly have an end. I ſhall cloſe this,
with that place, <hi>Jam. 1. 10. Let the Rich
rejoyce, in that he is made low;</hi> The Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the place are divers, but without
doubt, the meaning of the Apoſtle is this,
(when he ſaith) <hi>Let him that is Rich, rejoyce
in this, that he is made low.</hi> That is, There
is no Rich man, but hath reaſon to be low,
and humble, if he doth rightly conſider his
condition. And that this is the meaning,
appears by the following words, <hi>For as the
flower of Graſs he ſhall paſs away.</hi> i. e. The
beauty and glory of his condition, is but
fading, and vaniſhing, like the Flower of
Graſs. Here is Lead, to make the Spirit
ſinck, in a high and proſperous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                  <item>2. Concerning an Adverſe Condition,
There the Scripture comes in with Cork,
to make it Swim, and to keep up the Spirit
of a man in that condition. That we may
not be too much caſt down; it hath it's
Correctives for the croſſes of a condition,
and ſomewhat to allay the bitterneſs of ſuch
a condition. It preſents us with ſomewhat,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107590:84"/>
that helps to keep the head above water,
and to keep a man from drowning, when
the waters of Affliction overflow. Scripture
puts ſomewhat under, to hold up the Spirit
in that condition; (<hi>viz.</hi>) Promiſes, and
Comforts, ſuited to ſuch a Condition;
With God's End in Afflicting; With the
ſweet Fruit of Afflictions; With what Good
many have gotten by their Conditions;
With what Afflictions are, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Glory that is to be Revealed.
Theſe conſiderations are as Cork, that the
Scripture puts to an Adverſe Condition.
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 5. As our Sufferings for Christ
abound in us, ſo our Conſolations through
Christ abound.</hi> Thoſe Conſolations are Cork
to the Condition. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi>
1. 9. <hi>Let the Brother of low degree rejoyce,
in that he is exalted.</hi> He ſpeaks there, to
Chriſtians that were in a low, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condition. And ſee, there was Cork,
to make them hold up their heads, and
ſwim in that condition; (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>he is Exalted.</hi> According to to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in his ſublimity,</hi>
being a brother, he is a Member of Chriſt.
And the Apoſtle ſetteth before Chriſtians,
the Dignity and Honour of their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Eſtate; to Counter-poyſe the Miſery,
and Obſcurity of Afflictions. Thus the
Scripture ſheweth a man, How he may be
preſerved from the dangers, of the heights
and depths of conditions; that neither
proſperity may lift him up too high, nor
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107590:84"/>
adverſity caſt him down too low; but that
a Chriſtian may have an equal Spirit, in
unequal conditions. There is nothing we
have in a Proſperous Condition, but we
have it by Divine Donation: And why
ſhould a Chriſtian then be lifted up, when he
hath nothing but what he hath received?
And there is nothing befalleth us in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Condition, but what is by Divine
Ordination; and why ſhould we then fret
at it? To cloſe this, The Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man, how to keep himſelf Sober in
Proſperity, that he be not overcome with
the Sweet and Pleaſant Wine of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
And alſo, Sober in Adverſity,
that he be not overcome with the Gall and
Wormwood of that Condition. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſpeaketh of a Drunkenneſs, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to an Afflicted condition, <hi>Iſa. 51. 21.
Hear thou this, thou Afflicted, and Drunken,
but not with Wine.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus for the Firſt Direction, for the
taking a right View of Conditions.
It muſt be done by Scripture-Light.</p>
            </div>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>II. HE that will take a right View of a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt take a right Standing for the
Viewing of it. Conditions muſt be viewed at a due
and convenient Diſtance. It is in the viewing of a
Condition, as it is in the viewing of a Picture;
the Art in Drawing, is beſt diſcerned at ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
diſtance. The reaſon why many are miſtaken
about their Conditions, is, Their ſetting their
Conditions too near them, when they take a View
of them. Thus they ſet the Comforts of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and the Croſſes of a condition, ſo near to
them, that they cannot take a right View of them.
It is with men, in this Caſe, as it is with a man in
the midſt of a great Wood, or in the midſt of a
great City. When he is at ſome diſtance from
them, he hath a fuller View of them, than when
he was in the midſt of them, becauſe his ſight is
bounded, and terminated, that he can ſee but a
little way. He ſeeth, it may be, but a Street, or
ſome part of a Street; When, being but at ſome
convenient Diſtance from the City, and having a
little advantage of Ground, he hath a full view of
the City, in reſpect of Greatneſs, Length, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
&amp;c. Thus it is, in reſpect of conditions; When
a man is in the midſt of the comforts of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the midſt of his Honour, Wealth, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
he ſeeth but a little way, and cannot take
a full View of his condition. So it is, when a
man is in the midſt of his Croſſes, and Afflictions,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107590:85"/>
he diſcerneth but a little of his condition. And
thus, not taking a right View of their Conditions,
they make a falſe Judgement of them. <hi>Solomon</hi>
hath a paſſage, <hi>Prov. 18. 1. Through deſire, a man
having ſeparated himſelf, ſeeketh, or intermedleth,
with all wiſdom.</hi> The words are diverſly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In the Margin we read thus, <hi>He that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
himſelf, ſeeketh according to his deſire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedleth
in every buſineſs.</hi> The meaning ſeemeth
to be this, That a man, that ſeeketh after Wiſdom
and Knowledg, hath his retirements; His deſire
of Wiſdom, makes him ſometimes come off from
his ſecular employments, and ſet them at a diſtance
from him. It makes him ſequeſter himſelf from
all his worldly Buſineſſes, that he may ſeek after
Wiſdom; and that he may be the freer for Study,
and Meditation, and a conſideration of things,
What they are. Thus it is, in reſpect of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If a man will take a right View of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and will get Wiſdom, to make a judgment
of it; he muſt, for a while, (as I may ſay) ſeparate
himſelf from it, and look upon it at ſome Diſtance.
The Apoſtle gives this Direction, for the taking of
a right View of conditions, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. Let
thoſe that have Wives, be as though they had none;
and they that Rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not;
and they that Poſſeſs, as though they poſſeſſed not, &amp;c.</hi>
This ſheweth us, that then we take a right View
of things, when we look on them at a diſtance.
Thoſe things are worſt ſeen, that we are on the
ſame ſide with. An Houſe is beſt viewed, when
we are on the other ſide the Street. So it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Conditions; we ſhould view the condition,
as though we were not in the condition. And ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107590:86"/>
for an Afflicted condition, we ſhould view it at a
diſtance. <hi>Let them</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that weep,
be as though they wept not.</hi> Thus the beſt view of a
condition, is, To look upon a condition, to
view it upon the other ſide of the Street, to view
it at a Diſtance. It is often-times Self in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that hinders from taking a right View of a
condition. If we could ſeparate our ſelves from
our Conditions, and look upon them, as other
mens Conditions, and not our own, we ſhould
take the better View of them. There was a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of this Nation, who had three of his Sons
drowned together in the River of <hi>Trent:</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had not, as yet, received the ſad tydings of
their Deaths. It was thought good he ſhould be
prepared for the tydings, before they came. Upon
this account, was that Learned, and Prudent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
Biſhop <hi>King,</hi> deſired to go to him. He very
wiſely managed the buſineſs. He did not, at firſt,
tell the Nobleman what was befallen him; but fell
upon a General diſcourſe of an Afflicted condition,
and ſo gave the Nobleman a view of his condition
afar off. The Nobleman aſſented to all the Biſhop
ſaid, and anſwered, That if God ſhould bring
him into ſuch a condition, he did hope, he ſhould
be content, and ſubmit to His will. Upon this,
the Biſhop brings the condition nearer to him,
and putteth this Queſtion to him: <hi>Admit the Lord
ſhould take from you, your worldly Enjoyments, your
outward Comforts; and ſhould break off the Olive-Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
from about your Table.</hi> The Nobleman anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That <hi>he hoped he ſhould be therewith content.</hi>
Upon this, the Biſhop came nearer, and told him,
It was his condition, <hi>That his Sons were drowned;</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:107590:86"/>
and therefore deſired him to do as he had ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If he had, at firſt, ſhewed him what was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he had been at a loſſe, in taking a View of
it. Herein was the Prudence of the Biſhop ſeen,
In giving him a View of it at a diſtance. So the
beſt way for the taking a right View of conditions,
is, To view them at a diſtance.</p>

               <p>I come now to the Particular Directions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the making a Judgement of Conditions:
And ſo, how a man may know, What is good for
him in this life. So here we are to ſhew, How a
man may make a Judgement, both of a Proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Adverſe Condition.</p>
               <p>1. Concerning the making a Judgement of a
Proſperous condition. The Queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi> How may a Man know, That a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
condition is good for a man in this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe things a Man may know it.</p>
               <p>1. If outward proſperity, be no hindrance, to
Inward and Spiritual Proſperity. It was the Wiſh
of St. <hi>John,</hi> concerning <hi>Gaius, 3. Epiſt. V. 2. I wiſh
thou mayest Proſper and be in Health, even as thy
Soul Proſpereth.</hi> Some think, that <hi>Gaius</hi> had a Sickly
Body, but an Healthy Soul. The contrary is ſeen
by many, They have Healthy, and Proſpering
Bodies, but Unhealthy, and Unproſpering Souls.
Thus it is with many, They have Proſpering
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107590:87"/>
Eſtates, but Poor, and Unproſpering Souls.
Their outwards, eat up their inwards; As <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
lean Kine, did eat up the Fat. There are
many, whoſe worldly Riches, do eat up their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
Though they are Rich in the world, yet
they are not Rich towards God, and in reſpect of
their Souls. How many are there, whom outward
Fulneſs cauſeth to deſpiſe the Hony-Comb of
the Goſpel? Remember this, When a mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condition, is accompanied with the Soul's
improſperity, it is naught for him. When, in a
proſperous condition, men are thoughtleſs of
their Soul's proſperity; This ſpeaketh a condition
Evil for a man.</p>
               <p>2. We may know it thus, If we uſe the things
of a Proſperous Condition with right Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<list>
                     <item>1. Of their Changeableneſs.</item>
                     <item>2. Of their Dangerouſneſs.</item>
                     <item>3. Of their Uſefulneſs.</item>
                     <item>4. Of their Inferiority.</item>
                     <item>5. Of their Emptineſs.</item>
                     <item>6. Of our own Mortality.</item>
                     <item>7. Of the Accompt to be given.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. If we uſe them, with a right Conſideration of
their Changeableneſs. Some there are, who, when
they are ſet upon a Mountain of Proſperity, think
their Mountain to be ſo Strong, that it cannot be
Removed. This was <hi>Davids</hi> fault, when he ſaid
in his Proſperity, <hi>He ſhould never be removed,
Job</hi> telleth us, That in the day of his Proſperity,
he thought of Adverſity. He looked upon the
things of his condition as changeable, and ſo he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107590:87"/>
found them to be; when of the Richeſt man in
the Eaſt, he became the pooreſt man in the world.
We muſt know, The beſt things of a condition,
are mutable: The Comforts of a condition, may
become Croſſes. Children are looked upon as
Comforts; And yet we read of <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he had
three Daughters, and that they proved ſuch croſſes
to him, that he was wont to call them, His <hi>Tria
Carcinomata,</hi> His three Ulcers or Botches: And he
was often heard to ſay, <hi>Vtinam vel coelebs vixiſſem,
vel orbus periiſſem.</hi> Oh, that I had either lived Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
or dyed Childleſs. It is then right,
When we uſe the things of a Proſperous Condition
with right Conſiderations of their Vanity, Brevity,
Mortality, Mutability. There was an Ambaſſador
from a Great Prince, that had this Sentence En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
upon his Watch, which he read once every
day, <hi>Favour may turn into Disfavour, and Grace
into Diſgrace.</hi> But of this, I have ſpoken in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Tract.</p>
               <p>2. When we uſe the things of a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
with the conſideration of their danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
that they are things in which men Uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſin, and in which they may Eaſily ſin. When we
conſider, what ſnares and temptations attend that
condition; and thereupon, we become more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
But of this we have ſpoken before, and ſhall
but touch it here.</p>
               <p>3. When we uſe the things of a condition, with
the right conſideration of their Uſefulneſs; that as
they are things uſeful, ſo to conſider, what uſe we
make of them. As they are eaſily made matter of
ſin, ſo they may be made matter of duty. In this
the excellency of a gracious heart is ſeen, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107590:88"/>
Duty out of that, out of which others make Sin.
<hi>Luke 16. 9. Make you friends</hi> (ſaith our Saviour)
<hi>of the unrighteous Mammon.</hi> Where Riches are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Unrighteous Mammon, as for other reaſons
ſo chiefly for this, Becauſe they are the things
that men eaſily, and uſually ſin in. Yet our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſheweth, they have their uſefulneſs, When he
ſaith, <hi>Make you friends of them.</hi> So then, Would
a man know, whether proſperity be good for him;
I would ask him this, What uſe he doth make of
the things of a proſperous condition? Proſperity
is to a man, as a man uſeth it: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. The
Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>of uſing the world, as not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it.</hi> Now, a thing is then abuſed, when it is
not put to the uſe for which it was given; but
put to wrong uſes. Thus there is an abuſing of
the world, and the things of a proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when we put them to wrong uſes. Thus,
many abuſe their Honour, and abuſe their Riches,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they make this uſe of them, To feed
their luſts, to hearden their hearts againſt God
and His Word, to raiſe their Names and Families,
to Oppreſs their Brethren, to make them proud,
and high-minded: This is making that uſe of them,
that they were not given for; and this is abuſing
them. God never gave theſe things, to be food
for mens luſts, to feed their pride, and to feed their
covetouſneſs. He never gave Riches, and Honour,
and Poſſeſſions to men, to make them proud, and
high-minded. Thus, many abuſe the good things
of this life; Their Wealth, their Apparrel, their
very Meat, and Drink; by putting them to other
uſes then God intended them for. As the Lord
complaineth, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 8. She did not know, that I gave
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107590:88"/>
her Corn, and Wine, and Oyle, and multiplied their
Silver, and their Gold, which they prepared for Baal.</hi>
They put thoſe things to other uſes, then God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them for. God never gave thoſe things
for that end, To ſerve <hi>Baal,</hi> and their Idols with
them. Thus we ſee, how the Lord telleth <hi>Iſrael</hi>
of her miſ-uſing, and abuſing the things of her
Proſperity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10, 11, 12, 13. He telleth
her, what He had done for her, how He had Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with Broidered Garments, and fine Linnen,
and Silk; He had decked her with Ornaments,
Chains, Bracelets, Jewels, and Gold; He gave
her fine Flower, and Hony, and Oyle. Now ſee,
to what uſes ſhe put theſe things, you ſhall find, to
ſuch uſes as God never intended them for; as you
may ſee, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. of the ſaid Chapter,
<hi>They bestowed all upon Idols.</hi> The Lord ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi>
7. 31. <hi>Of their burning their Sons, and Daughters, in
the fire, and Sacrificing them to the Idols, that he
commanded them not, neither came it into his heart.</hi>
So we may ſay, that many put the things of this
life, to that Uſe that God never commanded, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever intended. So then, in a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
we ſhould put this Queſtion to our ſelves,
What uſe we make of the things of the condition?
In a proſperous condition, Two things are to be
eyed by us, for the making a right uſe of the things
of the condition.</p>

ſee, What is a man Duty when he is in a

God giveth abundance of all things, that
we ſhould ſerve Him with joyfulneſs, and
gladneſs of heart. God doth not give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
to men, that they ſhould live
more proudly, but that they ſhould ſerve

of our hearts toward Him in Duty, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 18. Charge them</hi> (ſaith the

2. We muſt eye Patterns, and ſee what

example, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 1. when God had
given him peace, and proſperity, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
how he might honour God, with
what God had given him; and ſo reſolveth
upon building a Houſe for God: And when
he found it was the mind of God, that he
ſhould not do it, but his ſon <hi>Solomon;</hi> he
thereupon, did bequeath his Gold, and his
Silver, to <hi>Solomon</hi> for that uſe; and ſtirred

<hi>come from thee:</hi> and <hi>ver. 13. All things come
from Thee, and of Thine own have we given

12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You will there ſee, what uſe
he made of his Honour, Power, and Wealth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>4. When we uſe the things of a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
with a right conſideration of their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,
and Subordination, in relation to higher
things. This conſideration, will keep us from ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Hearts, and Affections on them. It will
make us ſet Honour and Riches, and the Beſt
things of this Life, upon the foot-ſtool, and not
upon the throne of our Hearts. In a proſperous
condition, we are to ſet the things of it in their
due place. Some there are, who ſet them ſo high,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which notes, The minding of thoſe things
with the whole Soul. This ſheweth, a man is not to
look upon the beſt things of this Life, as thoſe things
that are the Beſt. They are to have no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Affection, then there are degrees of Good
in them. It was good Counſel, that one gave to a
near Relation of mine, concerning his Horſe;
When ſhe ſaw him too much taken with him, ſhe
ſaid, <hi>Sir, love a Horſe, as a Horſe.</hi> So we ſhould
the Creature, but as the Creature; and the things
of the world, as the things that are inferior
to the things of another World. So, then it is right,
when we uſe the Good things of this life, with a
conſideration of their Inferiority.</p>
               <p>5. When we uſe the things of a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
with a right conſideration of their Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and vanity. When your condition is fulleſt,
yet you look upon the things of your condition as
empty, and that will not give ſatisfaction to the
Soul. As their Inferiority ſpeaketh them unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to the ſpirit of man; ſo their emptineſſe,
ſpeaketh them unſatisfactory. It is happy with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107590:90"/>
a man, when he is in a high condition, that he can
look upon the things of his condition, as low things;
and when he is in a full condition, to look upon
all the things of this condition, as empty. When
God changeth our condition, then (it may be) we
can do it. Then we can ſay, Now I ſee, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Riches, are but vain and empty things.
But it is beſt, when a man can, in the heighth of
his Proſperity, give ſuch a Cenſure of them. When
<hi>Gilimer,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> was brought priſoner
before <hi>Justinian,</hi> ſitting in Majeſty upon his Throne,
he cried out, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> This
he did, in his Adverſe Condition, when he
ſtood priſoner at the Bar. They were the words
of <hi>Solomon;</hi> but uttered by him, when he was in
the heighth of his Proſperity, and when he ſate
upon the Throne. The conſideration of the
emptineſs, and vanity, that is in the beſt things of
a proſperous condition, will keep a man from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up with them: It will keep a man from being
deceived by them, as promiſing more than they
can perform. Our Saviour ſpeaketh of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs
of Riches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. the Greek word,
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the impoſture, and fallacy of Riches.
It ſignifieth, a drawing out of the way. So there
is a deceitfulneſs in the things of a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
they are apt to draw a man out of the way,
to look for comfort, and contentment in them,
when it is not to be found. This conſideration,
will prevent thoſe Dreams that a man is apt to
have in that Condition. As we read, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 8. of
the dreams of the hungry and thirſty man, that
he Dreams he Eates and Drinks, but when <hi>he awakes,
his Soul is empty.</hi> Some there are, that Dream of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107590:91"/>
contentment, and ſatisfaction in their condition,
that at laſt find it but a phantaſie, and a dream.
Thoſe then, that would make a Judgment of a
proſperous condition, muſt put the queſtion to
themſelves, Whether they uſe the things of their
condition, with a conſideration of their emptineſs?
We ſay of Wells, when they want Water, that they
are empty, though they may be full of other
things; as Mud, and Sand, and Stones. So the
beſt things of this World, are but empty things;
becauſe they have not that in them, that the Soul
ſeeketh after, and that will give ſatisfaction to
the Soul. There is no Satisfaction, where there
is not Suitableneſs. Theſe things were never
made for the Soul; and therefore they can no
more ſatisfie it, than you can fill a purſe, or a cheſt,
with Learning.</p>
               <p>6. Do you uſe the things of a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
with this conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Of your own
Mortality? Then it is right, when we conſider,
As the brevity of Worldly things, and that they
have an end; ſo, when we conſider our own ends
alſo, this conſideration, will make us ſober in the
uſe of them. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. The Apoſtle exhorteth to
Sobriety, in the uſe of the things of this Life, upon
this ground, <hi>viz. The end of all things is at hand;
be ye therefore Sober.</hi> Where, by Sobriety, is meant,
A moderate uſe of the things of this Life; and the
Motive to enforce it, is this, <hi>The end of all things
is at hand:</hi> The end of your worldly Enjoyments,
the end of your Lives, and the end of the World
it ſelf. This is the Miſery, that many in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
condition, as they conſider not, What the
things of their condition are, <hi>viz.</hi> Corruptible,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107590:91"/>
and Changeable; ſo they conſider not, What them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are in their condition, <hi>viz.</hi> Frail, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
creatures. Some there are, that ſo uſe the
things of this Life, as if they ſhould, for ever, live
to Enjoy, and Uſe them. The Pſalmiſt telleth us,
What man is at his beſt eſtate, <hi>Pſal. 39. Surely every
man, at his best estate, is altogether Vanity.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
condition is, then, Ill for a man, when it
makes him forget his own condition; and it is good
for a man, when it holds an agreement with a
dying ſtate. 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29. Brethren,</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle)
<hi>the time is ſhort, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay,
You have but a ſhort time to enjoy theſe things,
To enjoy Wives, and Poſſeſſions, and all the things
of this Life: As you know not how ſoon they
may be taken from you, ſo you know not, how ſoon
you may be taken from them. <hi>The time is ſhort.</hi>
The time, in reſpect of the things themſelves,
and their continuance, is ſhort, and the time of
your lives is ſhort. If thoſe, that lived in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, gave themſelves ſo much to
the building of Cities; it was not much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at, becauſe they had more time before them,
then we have, who live in theſe latter ages. They,
by common courſe of nature, lived 500. 600. 700.
years; but our time is ſhort, it is drawn into a
narrow compaſs; And the conſideration of this,
will help us to be ſober, and moderate, in the
uſe of the things of that condition; and make us
look upon Honour, and Riches, and Relations, as
things that we muſt ſhortly part with. It will help us,
to uſe them with weaned affections, as a Traveller
doth the pleaſures of his Inn; he ſtandeth not to
build himſelf a houſe at every pleaſant place he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107590:92"/>
by; he conſidereth, he is on his Journy, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Home. It is good for a man in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
condition, to have thoughts of his Long-Home,
whither he is going. So then, the great
queſtion we ſhould put to our ſelves, is this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our uſing the things of this life, be ſuch, as
holdeth an agreement with a dying State? <hi>Jam.</hi>
4. 13, 14. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome, that
<hi>would go into ſuch, and ſuch a City, and there live,
and get gain: Whereas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you know not what
may be on the morrow; for what is your life? It
is but a Vapour, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You
conſider not your own Frailty, and Mortality; if
you did, you would not be ſo Carnally-confident
as you are. Remember in a proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you are thoſe that dwell in Tabernacles of
Clay, whoſe foundation is in the Duſt, and whoſe
breath is in your Noſtrils; dwelling in an open
houſe, and ready every moment to depart. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you muſt go down to the Grave, and
the glory of your condition ſhall not deſcend with
you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 17.</p>
               <p>7. Do you uſe the things of a proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with this conſideration, That they are things
for which you muſt give an Account? I ſhewed
you before, that they have their uſefulneſs, and
men muſt give an account, How they have uſed
them. We muſt know, a proſperous condition
hath many burthens, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of Dangers, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
Cares, Duties; and here is the greateſt
of all, that of an Accompt: <hi>Rom. 14. 12. Every
one of us, ſhall give account of our ſelves to God.</hi> By
giving an accompt of our ſelves to God, is (no
doubt) implyed; A giving an accompt of our ſelves,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107590:92"/>
in relation to our conditions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) What we have
been? What we have done? How we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
our ſelves in our conditions? What Glory
we have brought to God? What Good we have
done to others? We read, <hi>Mat. 25. There were
Talents delivered, and the Master called his ſervants
to an account, how they had uſed, and improved thoſe
Talents?</hi> Some make theſe Talents to be of five
ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Thoſe of Nature, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body, and Faculties of
the Mind.</item>
                  <item>2. Wealth,</item>
                  <item>3. Authority; as Power, and Offices.</item>
                  <item>4. Knowledg; as Arts, and Sciences.</item>
                  <item>5. Grace.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So then, the outward things of a proſperous
condition, are things to be accounted for, and
then they become evil to a man, when they cauſe
him to forget his accompt. Remember; We are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to God, for whatſoever we have from
God. The World is but God's great Family, He
is the Great Houſe-holder, and every man muſt
give an accompt to Him of the things wherewith
he is intruſted. We read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 2. How the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Steward is called to an accompt; <hi>Give accompt
of thy Stewardſhip, &amp;c.</hi> Every man is a Steward,
and hath ſomewat, wherewith he is intruſted.
Some have the things of the world, as Honour,
Wealth, Authority, &amp;c. Some have thoſe things
that concern the Body, as Health, Strength, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Some have thoſe of the Mind, as Wiſdom,
and Underſtanding. Now concerning All, there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107590:93"/>
is a ſtrict Accompt to be given. <hi>To whomſoever
much is given, of them ſhall much be required.</hi> God
expects, our Duties ſhould be anſwerable to our
Advantages that we have in a condition. We find
the Altar that <hi>Solomon</hi> made, was four times bigger
then that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> if you compare 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 1.
with <hi>Exod. 27. 1. Moſes</hi> his Altar was, five Cubits
long, and five Cubits broad; but <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar,
was twenty Cubits long, and twenty Cubits broad,
Now what is the reaſon of the difference? Surely
this, <hi>Moſes</hi> was in an unſettled condition, but <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
in a peaceable and flouriſhing Eſtate. And
God expects, that our duties and ſervices ſhould
be anſwerable to our worldly advantages. Let
me tell you, this conſideration of an accompt
you have to give, will keep you humble in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
condition; will put you upon improving
the things of your condition, for the glory of
God, the good of others, and your own benefit;
conſidering, they are things you are to give an
Accompt of.</p>
               <p>Thus for the ſecond thing, whereby a
Judgment is to be made of a Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Condition, Whether it be good
for a man in this Life.</p>
               <p>III. Then is Proſperity good for a man in this life,
When it doth not make him to forget the Afflictions
of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> It is then Evil, when our Proſperity
makes us to forget thoſe that are in Adverſity.
The Lord ſpeaketh of ſuch, <hi>Amos 6. 1. They were
at eaſe in Sion;</hi> ver. 4. <hi>They did lie upon beds of Ivory.
They did eat the Lambs out of the Flock: They did
Chaunt to the ſound of the Viol,</hi> (they had their
Muſick too.) <hi>Ver. 6. They drank Wine in Bowls,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:107590:93"/>
(they had their Wine too, and that in Abundance.)
<hi>And they did Anoint themſelves with the chief Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
(they had their precious Oyntments, ſo that
nothing was wanting.) Now, What is their Sin all
this while? Why this, <hi>They were not grieved for
the Afflictions of Joſeph.</hi> This was their Sin; Their
Proſperity had taken away the ſympathy, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling
they ought to have had of <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
Their Fulneſs, made them to forget
his Wants. Let me tell you, Proſperity is evil
for a man, when it makes him forget the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of others. It was Evil for thoſe, That they
were at <hi>eaſe in Sion;</hi> and, that they had <hi>their Ivory
Beds to lie upon,</hi> and <hi>their Lambs and Calves to
feed on;</hi> and <hi>their Muſick to delight them in;</hi> but
were not <hi>mindful of Joſephs Afflictions:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſee how they are threatned, <hi>ver. 7. They ſhall
go captive with the first that go captive:</hi> i. e. God
would firſt fall upon them. It is ſaid of <hi>Dives,
Luke</hi> 16. 19. That he was <hi>cloathed in Purple, and
fared Deliciouſly every day:</hi> But <hi>Lazarus</hi> could not
partake of ſo much, as the <hi>crumbs that fell from his
Table.</hi> We may ſafely conclude, That, that mans
Abundance is naught for him, that makes him to
forget the Wants of others: That, that mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
is naught for him, that makes him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Afflictions of others: That, that mans Eaſe
is evil for him, that makes him to forget the
Troubles, and Diſquiets of others. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. The
Apoſtle chargeth them, that they ſhould <hi>remember
thoſe that are in Bonds, as if they were bound with them.</hi>
q. d. Though you are at Liberty, yet let not your
Liberty deſtroy that ſympathy, and fellow-feeling,
you ought to have of your brethrens Bonds, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107590:94"/>
Miſeries. This ſympathy the Apoſtle calleth for,
<hi>Rom. 12. 15. Rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and
weep with them that weep.</hi> q. d. What ever a mans
particular condition is, It ſhould not hinder him
from ſympathiſing with others in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Rejoyce with them that rejoyce.</hi> As if he
ſhould ſay, It may be your particular condition
is Sad, and you have cauſe to Weep, in reſpect
of your own particular; yet if it go well with the
Publick, and the people of God in general, You
ought to rejoyce in their rejoycings. <hi>And then</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>weep with them that weep.</hi>
q. d. It may be, your particular condition may
be a Rejoycing-condition, nothing aileth you,
you want for nothing; Yet, if the Church, and
People of God, be in a ſad condition; You are
to Weep with them. <hi>Job</hi> telleth us, he did ſo
in the dayes of his Proſperity, <hi>Job 30. 25. Did
not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my
Soul grieved for the Poor?</hi> This he did, when
he had no cauſe to Weep in relation to himſelf,
his condition being a Rejoycing condition. You
may ſee, how, in the height of his proſperity, he
did ſympathize with thoſe that were in Affliction,
<hi>Chap. 29. ver.</hi> 6, 12, 13, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this, Let our Condition be never ſo
Proſperous, we ought to Bleed in others Wounds,
and to be Afflicted in all, wherein they are
Afflicted.</p>
               <p>Thus I have finiſhed the Firſt thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
How a man may know, Whether a
Proſperous condition be Good for
him in this Life.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="chapter">

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>2 I Now come to ſhew you, How a man may
make a Judgment of an Adverſe and an Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition; whether it be good for him in this
life. For let me tell you, That as it is not good
for all, that they have Proſperity; ſo neither is
it good for all, that they are Afflicted.</p>
               <p>Now, that you may know, whether an Afflicted
condition be good for you, Conſider this.</p>
               <p>I. In General, I ſhall mind you of what I have
before ſaid, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That he that will make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his condition, muſt firſt make a judgment
of himſelf. So that, to you that are in an Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition, I have two queſtions to put.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What you do in your condition?</item>
                  <item>2. What you make of your condition?</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. When God puts you into an Afflicted condition,
What do you do in that condition? What is your
carriage, and behaviour in the condition? Is it
ſuch, as becometh ſuch providences and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Doth your behaviour become your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> You will ask, What is a man to do in an
Afflicted condition, that he may be able to make
a judgment of it, Whether it be good for him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do you do the work of your condition,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107590:95"/>
and perform the duties of your condition? Then
it is good for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But then you will ask, What is the work,
and what are the duties, that he is to do in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
condition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall ſhew you that, in ſome Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. This he is to do, To endeavour the finding
out of this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) What every Affliction comes in
order to. When God putteth us into an Afflicted
condition, it is in order to ſomewhat; and it is
our duty, to ſearch out the mind and meaning of
God in it. Some there are, that walk up and down
(as I may ſay) in that condition, without ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
For what end it is they are Afflicted. As
thoſe, <hi>Iſa. 5. 12. They regarded not the work of the
Lord, nor the operations of his Hands.</hi> We muſt
know, Afflictions are ſome of God's Operations.
As it is God that bringeth a man and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
together, ſo a man and his croſſes; and every
croſs cometh in order to ſomewhat. The Refiner
kindleth his fire in his Furnace, in order to the
refining of his Mettal. The Phyſitian giveth Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
in order to Health. Remember, Every Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
is in order to ſomewhat. It cometh with a
meſſage from God. Now, our great work is to
find out, what the Meſſage is, Affliction bringeth.
When a man brings us Letters, we do not look on
the back ſide only, and the ſuperſcription, but we
look upon what is contained within, and what they
import. So it is in reſpect of Afflictions, They
bring us (as I may ſay) Letters from God, and
a Meſſage, in order to ſomewhat. The thing we
have to do, in an Affliction, is, not only to look
upon the endorſment, and outſide of the Affliction;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107590:95"/>
but we muſt break it up, and ſee what is written
within. I told you formerly, We muſt go to God
to know the meaning of a condition; <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5.
We read of <hi>a hand writing, and the King, and all
were troubled, to know the meaning of what was witten.</hi>
In an Afflicted condition, there is a hand-writing
upon it. The great thing we have to do, is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what is the meaning of it, and for what end
the Affliction cometh. Thus it is with many in
Affliction, they never inquire after the meaning of
an Affliction, though it cometh with Letters and
Meſſages; yet (as I may ſay) they put them in their
pocket, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did thoſe Letters that forewarned
him of his Death, when he was going to the Senate.
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> telleth of the Governour of <hi>Thebes,</hi> when
a Letter was ſent to him from <hi>Athens,</hi> to diſcover a
Plot that was againſt him, which was that night to
be Executed; and the Meſſenger told him, that
the Matter, contained in the Letter, was of high
Concernment, and that he muſt read the Letter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently;
His Anſwer was, <hi>Weighty matters for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
and that night he was Slain. Thus, ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look into the Letters, that an Affliction bringeth
us, and ſo deſpiſe the Affliction. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. the
Afflicted are there directed, what to do in their
condition, <hi>Verſ. 39. Why doth the living man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain?</hi>
This we ſhould not do. But then ſee, what
we ſhould do, <hi>Verſ. 40. Let us ſearch and try our
wayes, &amp;c.</hi> This is ſome of the work we have to do
in an Afflicted condition. As the Lord ſpake to
<hi>Joſuah,</hi> when the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled before the
men of <hi>Ai, Joſuah</hi> caſteth himſelf down before the
Lord, but the Lord bids him <hi>riſe up and ſearch, for
there was wickedneſs committed.</hi> As you may read,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107590:96"/>
                  <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 10. Where the Lord ſheweth him, what
was his duty, (<hi>viz.) To ſearch out the ſin, for which
that defeat came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This is another thing we are to do in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To ſet in, and joyn with
the Affliction, and to further it in the work for
which it is ſent. We muſt do by Afflictions, as
we do by Phyſick; we do not only take Phyſick,
but we alſo joyn with it, to further it in it's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
we keep our Chamber, we take Broth, we
forbear Studying and Working; and all this is to
further it's working. Afflictions, are Phyſick that
God giveth us: and then it is right, when we joyn
with the Phyſick, and further and help it in it's
Operation. When a Phyſitian adminiſtreth Phyſick,
to a diſeaſed Patient, there are three things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) The Phyſitian, the Patient, and
the Diſeaſe. And where any two of theſe joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
down goeth the third. If the Phyſitian
and the Patient joyn together, down goeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe;
if the Phyſitian and the Diſeaſe joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
down goeth the Patient; if the Patient and
the Diſeaſe joyn together, down goeth the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.
So it is in reſpect of an Afflicted Condition:
There is the Patient, the Phyſick, and the Diſeaſe.
Now what is the reaſon, that the Phyſick of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
doth ſome perſons no good? Surely this,
The Patient and the Diſeaſe joyn together. This
the Prophet telleth us in the caſe of <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi>
51. 9. <hi>We would have healed Babylon, but ſhe would
not be healed.</hi> Where you find the Patient, taking
part with the Diſeaſe. Thus, many in an Afflicted
Condition, take part with the Diſeaſe, and not
with the Phyſick. Affliction cometh, to ſet mens
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107590:96"/>
hearts and the world, men's hearts and their luſts,
at greater diſtance; but here is the miſery, that moſt
men take part with their Luſts, and not with their
Afflictions, to further them in the work for which
they are ſent. They do, in reſpect of the Rod, as
they do in reſpect of the Word. When they ſhould
take part with the Word, againſt their Sins; they
take part with their Sins againſt the Word: So,
when they ſhould take part with the Rod, againſt
their Luſts, they take part with their Luſts, againſt
the Rod. Thus did thoſe, <hi>Iſa. 1. 5. Jer.</hi> 5. 3.
They joyned with the Diſeaſe, and did all they
could to obſtruct the operation, and working of
the Phyſick of Affliction. This (as I may ſay) is a
croſſing our Croſſes, and afflicting our Afflictions;
when we hinder them in their working. And this
ſpeaks an Afflicted condition evil for a man in this
life. It is ſaid of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> That <hi>in his Affliction, he
tranſgreſſed more and more;</hi> This is naught.</p>
               <p>3. This is another work of an Afflicted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) to eye our Paſſions and Affections, more
than our Afflictions. To have an eye upon our
hearts, more then upon our hurts. Some, when
they are in an Afflicted condition, ſpend all their
time in poring upon their afflictions, as though
that were the only work of their condition: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the great work they have to do, is, to eye their
own hearts and ſpirits. Some look altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
when they ſhould look within. It is our own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in an Afflicted condition, that are our greateſt
Affliction. If the houſe within be kept dry, we need
not much to care, what tempeſts are without. We
many times complain of that, that is without us;
when indeed, the cauſe is within us. As we ſee it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107590:97"/>
is with a ſick man, he complaineth of the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Stool he sits upon, of the Bed he lieth
upon, of the unſavorineſs of the Meat he eats;
when the cauſe is inward. Were but his ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
removed, and purged away, the ſame Stool,
and Bed, and Meat, would content him. When
God puts men into an Afflicted condition, the
reaſon why to ſome it is ſo troubleſome, is, from
within, from their own ſpirits and diſpoſitions.
If they could but ſubdue their paſſions, and bound
their ſpirits, the condition would be well enough.
Poring upon Afflictions, is like a mans poring upon
rough and tempeſtuous Waters, which makes his
head giddy, and himſelf Sea-ſick: So it is with
ſome, they do but diſtemper themſelves, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether upon their Afflictions. Thus it was
with <hi>Job, (Job</hi> 2.) You find him poring upon his
<hi>Afflictions.</hi> And then ſee what the effect was, <hi>Chap. 3.
he opened his mouth, and fell a curſing the day of his
birth.</hi> Satan indeed thought to make him fall a
curſing his God, but he was deceived; yet he fell
to curſing the day of his birth, which was too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much.
The great work a Governour of a City hath
to do, when he heareth that the Country about
him are up in Arms againſt him, is, to look to the
Town within, to ſee that there be no tumults and
riſings within. It is good for us in a day of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to look to this, that our paſſions do not raiſe a
Mutiny. It was the ſaying of a Heathen, <hi>Intus ſi
recte, ne labores,</hi> Thou need'ſt not trouble thy ſelf,
if all be well within.</p>
               <p>4. This is another work of an Afflicted Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) To eye our Sins, more than our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Afflictions. Many in an Afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107590:97"/>
eye their Afflictions, but not their Sins.
They look upon what God doth againſt them, but
conſider not, what they have done againſt Him;
which if they did, it would make them complain
more of their ſins, then of their ſorrows. It would
turn their tears into another Channel; and cauſe
them to ſpend thoſe tears upon their Sins, that they
ſpend upon Afflictions. <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Why doth the
living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his
ſins?</hi> In their Afflicted Condition, they were full
of complaints, as we ſee, <hi>Verſ. 2, 3. &amp;c.</hi> But here
the Prophet giveth a check to them, <hi>q. d.</hi> We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of our Afflictions; our eyes are altogether
upon our Sufferings; Oh, but conſider, <hi>Man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
for his Sin.</hi> We ſhould eye our Sins, more
then our Sufferings, <hi>Pſal. 51. 3. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>his
ſin was ever before him.</hi> It is thus with ſome in an
Afflicted Condition, that their Sufferings are ever
before them, and not their Sins. When God Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
them, they can ſay, We are the perſons that
feel Affliction from God: but conſider not, how they
have ſinned againſt God. The good of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our ſins in an Afflicted Condition, hath
theſe benefits attending it.</p>
               <p>1. It will make us Juſtify God in all our
Afflictions. <hi>To acknowledg that all his wayes
are equal, and that he is righteous in all that
he hath brought upon us,</hi> Dan. 9. 14. There
is an expreſſion of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> Job 4. 17. <hi>Shall
mortal man be just with God?</hi> There is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of pride in every man by nature, which
is apt to ſhew it ſelf in the loweſt condition;
ſo that we are apt to have better thoughts of
our ſelves, then of God himſelf; and to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107590:98"/>
think, We are more juſt then God, when he layeth
Affliction on us. Thus thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 20. They
ſaid, <hi>The way of the Lord was unequal.</hi> It was from
looking only upon His wayes, and dealings with
them, without conſidering their own wayes, and
how They had dealt with him.</p>
               <p>2. As it will help us to clear Gods Juſtice, ſo to
admire his Mercy, in that he doth puniſh and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
us, leſs then our iniquities do deſerve. As the
confeſſion is, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13. They had been in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
70. years, and yet though their captivity were
long, they ſaw cauſe why they ſhould admire the
Mercy of God towards them. Looking upon their
ſins, they ſaw their Sufferings were leſs then they
did deſerve.</p>
               <p>3. This will help us to Adore the Wiſdom of
God, in making Afflictions to become cures of, and
remedies againſt, Sin. Afflictions at firſt came in as
puniſhments for ſin. While we look only upon our
Afflictions, we diſcern not the wiſdom of God in
ſending them, and ordering them for our good;
but when we eye our Sins, as well as our Afflictions,
then we find, they are ſent to cure the Soul of
ſome diſeaſe, as pride, and worldlineſs, &amp;c. This
will put a man upon putting this queſtion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Doth not this Affliction come to cure, and
kill my corruptions? Hath not the Lord ſent it to
take me off the creature, and to imbitter it more
to me? Hath not God done this to cure the Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Pride, or the Dropſy of Covetouſneſs, or
ſome Creature-Surfet? And hereupon a man falls
upon admiring, and adoring the Wiſdom of God,
in making Afflictions, Cures for our Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:107590:98"/>
4. Eying Sins as well as Afflictions, will help us
to poſſeſs our Souls in patience, and to ſuppreſs all
riſings and ſmoakings of paſſion, to which we are
ſubject in a day of Affliction. And this it will do,
by giving us to ſee that our Afflictions are leſs then
our iniquities do deſerve; and then there is great
reaſon we ſhould bear them patiently, when we
know we have deſerved greater. Why ſhould he
not patiently endure the akeing of teeth, that
knowes he hath deſerved the gnaſhing of teeth?
and the burning of a feaver, when he knoweth he
hath deſerved Burning in Hell? This will help to
make us patient, when we loſe a comfort, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
the conſideration of this, that we have forfeited
all our comforts, and deſerve to be deprived of
all.</p>
               <p>5. Eying our Sins as well as our Afflictions, will
make the burthen of Affliction much the eaſier, and
leighter. What is the cauſe that to ſome, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are ſo heavy? It is, becauſe their ſin is ſo
leight to them. Remember this, The heavier we find
our Sins to be, the higher we ſhall find our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be. Affliction muſt needs be heavy to thoſe,
who eye nothing but Affliction. When we compare
Evils of Suffering, with Evils of Sinning, we ſhall
find them to be leight, although they be never ſo
great. The reaſon why many complain of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of their Affliction, is, becauſe Sin is no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to them. VVhere Sin is found to be heavy,
Affliction will be found to be leight.</p>
               <p>Thus for the fourth thing we have to
do in an Afflicted condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:107590:99"/>
5. We are in an Afflicted Condition to do this,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) To keep our hearts open, and enlarged, in
the midſt of outward ſtraitnings. Afflictions are
ſtraitnings. As God dealeth with Nations, <hi>Job</hi>
12. 23. <hi>He enlargeth them, and straitneth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
So he dealeth oftentimes with particular
perſons. And afflictions are their ſtraitnings. God
bindeth up the face of our Comforts. As the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is in <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>by the frost, he bindeth up the
face of the waters:</hi> So by the Froſt of Affliction,
he bindeth up the face of our Comforts. Our
work then is, To keep our hearts thawed, and
open, when our outwards are as it were Frozen
up. It is our work to ſee, That in the mid'ſt of
our outward ſtraitnings, our hearts be not ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
towards God. It muſt be our work to keep
our hearts open, when the Lord ſhuts us up by
Affliction. Gods Afflicting, is called Gods ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up, <hi>Deut. 32. 30. Except the Lord had ſhut them
up.</hi> Sometimes a man and his comforts walke
together. God ſometimes turns a man looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Comforts, to walk at large in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them. And then ſometimes the Lord
ſeparates between a man and his comforts, and
buildeth a wall between them, that they cannot
come at one another. Thus the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,
<hi>Lam. 3. 17. Thou hast removed my ſoul
far from peace.</hi> And again, <hi>Lam. 3. 5. He hath
builded against me, and compaſſed me about with gall
and travel.</hi> And <hi>Verſ. 7. He hath hedged me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that I cannot get out.</hi> Here the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
of her ſhuttings up by Affliction. There
is a double hedg that God makes about a man,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) an hedg of Protection, that no Evil can
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107590:99"/>
come at him; (Thus he did about <hi>Job.</hi>) And then
a hedg of Affliction, that no Good can come at
a man, <hi>This is a hedg of Thorns.</hi> Thus the Church
complaineth, <hi>Lam. 3. 9. He hath encloſed my wayes
with hewen stone.</hi> She was ſhut up with ſuch a
Wall which ſpeaks ſtrong and impregnable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
Now the work we have to do, is, To
ſee that in the mid'ſt of our ſhuttings up, our
hearts be not ſhut up towards God. <hi>Jam. 5. 13.
If any be Afflicted, let him pray.</hi> Where the Apoſtle
ſheweth what is to be our work in an Afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Prayer. Several Conditions, have their
ſeveral Duties. In Proſperity, we are to give
Thanks; in Adverſity, we are to Pray. <hi>Eliphaz</hi>
charged <hi>Job,</hi> Job 15. 4. <hi>That in the day of his
Affliction, he did restrain prayer before God;</hi> That
he had inward reſtraints, when he was under out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reſtraints. It is our work in an Afflicted
Condition, to watch againſt that. Prayer is
the Duty that is proper for an Afflicted Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that ſuits with ſuch providences. And
this is ſome of the work we are to do in that
condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to Pray. We read, <hi>Iſa. 26. 16.
In trouble they have viſited Thee, they poured out
a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.</hi> It is
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s opinion, that there the Prophet ſheweth,
what was the behaviour of Gods People, and
what they did in the day of their affliction and
trouble, (<hi>viz.</hi>) they did Viſit the Lord; and ſo
ſhewed the confidence they had in God. <hi>q. d.</hi>
Lord, whereas Afflictions drive others from thee,
and ſet them at a further diſtance; yet thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
draw nearer to thee, and ſeek the more after
thee. Here is the work in an Afflicted Condition,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107590:100"/>
To viſit God, and to poure out a Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Him. Afflictions are God's Viſitations, and
when God viſiteth us with his Afflictions, we
ſhould viſit Him with our Supplications. When
He poureth forth our Comforts, and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us of them, (for ſo God's Afflicting is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
a pouring out) it's then our Duty to pour
out a Prayer before Him. <hi>David</hi> made this the
work of his condition, <hi>Pſal. 142. 2. I poured out
my complaint before him, I ſhewed him my trouble.</hi>
So <hi>Pſal. 18. 6. In my distreſs I called upon the Lord,
and cryed to my God.</hi> And this the Lord calleth for,
as that which we are to do in an Afflicted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Pſal. 50. 15. Call upon me in the day of trouble.</hi>
It is ſome eaſe to us, when a trouble falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, that we have ſome friend to repair to,
into whoſe boſom we may pour out our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
This is the great Priviledg, that in an
Afflicted condition we have a God to go to; to
whom we may make known our condition, and
ſhew Him our trouble, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 2.
In that condition, it is one great thing we have
to do, to go to God, to begg of Him what we
need for the condition: <hi>viz.</hi> Shoulders of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
for our Burthens, and a gracious Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Conditions. Chriſtians, you muſt
know, an Afflicted condition is then good for you,
when your hearts are kept open, when you have
inward Enlargements, in the mid'ſt of your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtraitnings.</p>
               <p>6. The work of an Afflicted Condition, is this,
<hi>viz.</hi> To keep the Ear open to Counſel and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Some there are, ſo taken up with
the thoughts of their Condition, that they will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107590:100"/>
not hearken to Counſel. As <hi>Marius</hi> the Romane
ſaid, <hi>He could not hearken to the Laws, for the
ratling and noyſe of Armes.</hi> So the noyſe of
Troubles, will not ſuffer ſome, to hearken to
the voice of Counſel. And ſo <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth
that it was his caſe, <hi>Pſal. 77. 2. His Soul refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
comfort.</hi> Elihu, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 8. ſheweth how it is
with Godly men when they are in Affliction. And
then <hi>Verſ. 10. He openeth their ear to Diſcipline.</hi>
We muſt know, Sathan is a great Enemy to the
doing the work of our Condition; he endeavours
to make us turn our Conditions into Sin, and
not into Duty. He doth all he can, to ſtop our
Ears againſt hearing Counſel and Inſtruction.
Remember, when you are in Affliction, there
cometh ſome Inſtruction with it. Now Satan
endeavours to open the Eye, but to ſtop the
Ear; he keeps the Eye open, to look upon the
Affliction; but he keeps the Ear ſhut, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, that it may not hearken unto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
The beſt way in an Afflicted Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to keep the Eyes ſhut, and the Ear
open. Not ſo much to look upon the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to hear Inſtruction. <hi>Micah 6. 9. Hear ye
the Rod.</hi> He doth not ſay, See ye the Rod,
<hi>but, hear ye the Rod.</hi> When men are under the
Rod, their eyes are open enough to ſee the Rod;
they can point to the Affliction, and ſhew what
it is. But the great thing they are to do, is
to hear the Rod. The Rod hath a Voice, which
ſhould be hearkened to. When an Affliction comes,
it comes (as I told you before) with ſome Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
from God; It comes with ſome Inſtruction;
and that we are to hearken to: We ſhould hear
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107590:101"/>
what God will ſpeak, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid in another
caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. When we ſee a flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we then prepare our Ears to hear a clap
of Thunder. When we ſee the Affliction, we
ſhould have our Ears open, to hearken to what
followeth. We read of <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he was in
the mouth of the Cave 1 <hi>King. 19. 12. There
came a strong Wind that brake the Mountains;
After the Wind came an Earth-quake; After the
Earth-quake, came a Fire; After the Fire, came
a ſoft still Voice.</hi> Remember, after the noyſe of
Afflictions, there comes a Voice; and we ſhould
hearken to that Voice. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 12. it is ſaid,
<hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chastenest, and
teachest him out of thy Law.</hi> The happineſs of
a man lieth not in his being chaſtened, but in
his being taught and inſtructed by his Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
A mute and dumb Affliction is Evil for a
man; and it is our deafneſs, that maketh the
Affliction dumb, when a man heareth not the
Affliction ſpeak. So then, in an Afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
we are to hearken to what God ſaith,
as well ſee as to what God doth.</p>
               <p>7. Another work of an Afflicted Condition,
is this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Framing the heart to a pious
Submiſſion. To get the heart into a ſubmitting
Frame. And this not only out of Neceſſity,
but out of Duty. It is excellent, when we can
bring our Hearts to a quiet Submiſſion to the
Will of God, in all theſe Providences and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.
It muſt not be onely a Neceſſary
Submiſſion. Such a Submiſſion is this, When a
man parteth with a Comfort upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
If God will take it away, I cannot help
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107590:101"/>
it; I am content to part with it, ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be otherwiſe. Thus they ſubmit to their
Condition, and yield to the parting with a
Comfort, when they ſee they can keep it no
longer. And this is that Submiſſion that ſome
reſt in, and think it ſufficient to ſay, There is
no remedy. But now there is another Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that hath more of Grace in it. And that is,
when God calleth for a Comfort from us, there
is free Reſignation of it up to God. As we
read of <hi>Abraham,</hi> When God called for <hi>Iſaack,</hi>
he preſently reſigned him up to Him. And
this Submiſſion proceedeth from Faith, which
works a Chriſtian to the denying of himſelf, and
to a complying with God in that, that is ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
contrary to his own deſires and content.
Thus we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. how <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith,
offered up his only begotten Son. By a hand
of Faith he preſents again to God, That Bleſſing
he received from Him. Faith teacheth a man
to receive a Mercy from God, and to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and to part again with it, and to be content:
And this not out of neceſſity, becauſe they can
keep it no longer, but there is a free reſigning
of it up to God. Conſider, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe Submiſſions, is ſuch, as is between
the death's and ends of men. Some men, when
they ſee they muſt dye, and that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
do yield out of neceſſity; and ſo their
Soul's are as it were taken from them. As the
expreſſion in the Goſpel is, <hi>Thou fool, this night
ſhall thy Soul be taken from thee.</hi> Whereas a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, makes his Soul a Free-will-Offering to
God. As our Saviour did his, <hi>Father into thy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107590:102"/>
hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> And as <hi>Stephen</hi> did
his, <hi>Lord Jeſus, receive my Spirit.</hi> It is ſaid,
<hi>Prov. 14. 32. The Wicked is driven away in his
Wickedneſs.</hi> (i. e.) He is thruſt, and forced out
of the world, whether he will or not. But the
Righteous hath hope in his Death; and that
hope makes him to Reſigne, and give up his
Soul to God: As we read of giving up the
Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>8. This is another work we have to do in
an Afflicted Condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To lay to heart
the Affliction. When God puts a man into an
Afflicted Condition, This is one thing God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from him, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 14. In the day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
conſider.</hi> In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 25. the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
of <hi>Jacob,</hi> That when God poured out
upon him the Fury of his Anger, and the
Strength of Battle: And it had ſet him on Fire
round about, yet he knew it not; and it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him, yet he layed it not to heart. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Original, it is thus, <hi>He did not put
it upon his heart.</hi> It is an Hebrew Phraſe, and
notes diligent conſideration of Affliction. Now
that you may not be miſtaken about this, you
muſt know, There is a double laying to heart of
an Affliction.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Carnal, ſinful and hurtful.</item>
                  <item>2. Spiritual, holy and helpful.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. There is a Sinful laying of Afflictions to
heart. When a man takes thoſe burthens that
lye upon his outwards, (<hi>viz.</hi>) His Perſon, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and layeth them as a burthen upon
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107590:102"/>
his Spirit; whereby a man troubles himſelf, when
God troubles him. When he layeth his troubles
without, ſo to heart, as to trouble himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
this is Evil. This is forbid, <hi>John 14. 1.
Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> The word in
the Original, ſignifieth ſuch a trouble, as is in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when the mud is ſtirred up; or as the Sea
is, when it is troubled with a Storm or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.
As we read in Scripture of the troubled
Sea, that it's Waters caſt forth Mire and Dirt.
It alſo ſignifieth ſuch a trouble as is in an Army,
when it is Routed and Diſordered; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Fear, and Diſtraction, and Confuſion.
So ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
(i. e.) Take heed of ſo laying your troubles to
heart, as to trouble your Hearts; to diſtemper
your Affections, and ſo to blind the Judgement,
that you can ſee and diſcern things no better,
then a man can in muddy water. This laying of
Afflictions to heart is unlawful; when they are
layed to heart, to diſquiet and diſtemper the
Heart, and to raiſe a Storm in the Soul, to make
it a troubled Sea; caſting forth nothing but the
mud of impatiency and diſcontent. Take you
a glaſs of water that hath ſome mud in it, and
let it ſtand ſtill, the mud ſettleth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and the water above is clear; but ſhake
this water, and then the mud ariſeth, and there is
confuſion; and the water that before was clear,
becometh muddy. So it is with our hearts and
affections, there is mud at the bottom, and
when they come to be ſtirred by Affliction, then
the mud ariſeth. This we ſhould take heed of,
of laying Afflictions ſo to heart, as to ſtir up
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107590:103"/>
the mud of impatiency and diſcontent.</p>
               <p>2. There is a laying of Afflictions to heart,
that is Spiritual, holy and helpful; This is
a laying them to heart, not for the troubling,
but for the bettering the heart. Not for the
making of the Spirit more Diſtempered, Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
Weak, and unfit for Duty; but for the
making of it more Holy, and Humble, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive;
this is a right laying of Afflictions to
heart. It is then right, when there is an apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the heart to the Affliction; to find out
what uſe and benefit may be made of it. When
we lay the Affliction to the heart, not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
it, but, as a plaiſter, to heal the diſeaſes
and diſtempers of it; (<hi>viz.</hi>) to heal it's Pride,
and Worldlineſs, and Vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſhould be
with us, in conſidering of, and laying Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to heart, as with the Bee which alights on a
Flower, and leaves it not till ſhe hath made
ſomething out of it; even out of the very bloſſom
of a Thiſtle, ſhe will get ſomewhat. So it ſhould
be, in reſpect of an Afflicted Condition, There
ſhould be ſuch an application of the heart to it,
as to get ſomewhat out of it, for the bettering
of the heart. <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 2. It
is better to go to the Houſe of Mourning, then to
the Houſe of Feasting: For this is the end of all
fleſh, and the living will lay it to his heart.</hi> Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to heart the ends of others, is the making
ſomewhat out of them, that is good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for our ſelves. It is our Duty to lay to
heart the Afflictions of others, much more our
own. The Lord telleth <hi>Babylon,</hi> Iſa. 47. 7. That
ſhe ſaid, <hi>She ſhould be a Lady for ever, and did
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107590:103"/>
not lay the Afflictions of his people to heart.</hi> As ſhe
laid them not to heart by way of Sympathy,
ſo not by way of Improvement. So then, to cloſe
this, Laying afflictions to heart, ſtands in this,
In having Impreſſions made upon our Spirits,
ſuitable to the Providence and the Diſpenſation.
We read of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> That <hi>in his Affliction he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
more and more,</hi> 2 Chron. 28. 19. God brought
<hi>Judah</hi> low, and <hi>Ahaz</hi> was put to his ſhifts; he gave
gifts to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> yet he helped him not.
And <hi>Verſe 22. In the time of his distreſs, he did
treſpaſs more against the Lord.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>This is
that King Ahaz!</hi> The meaning is, That the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
did not make an Impreſſion upon his
heart, ſuitable to the Providence and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
To cloſe this, It is then right, when
our Hearts anſwer to Providences, in laying Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
ſo to heart, as to make ſuitable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>9. This is ſome of the work we have to do
in an Afflicted Condition; We are patiently to
expect and wait upon God; Waiting is one of
our Duties in an Afflicted Condition. We are
to wait upon God for comfortable Supports in it,
and a ſeaſonable Deliverance out of it; <hi>Iſa. 8. 17.
I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his Face from
the houſe of Jacob.</hi> The Prophet reſolved to walk
dutifully, when God walked ſtrangely. We ſhall
find in an Afflicted condition, This is the Duty,
that is Commanded, Commended, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Saints in that Condition. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>Pſal. 27. 14. Wait on the Lord and he
ſhall strengthen thy heart; wait I ſay on the Lord.</hi>
Lam. 3. 26. <hi>It is good that a man ſhould hope, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107590:104"/>
quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lora.</hi> It is
ſpoken there in reference to an Afflicted Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And ſo we find the Godly have made it
their work in that condition to wait. <hi>David</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, <hi>He waited patiently for the Lord.</hi> Conſider,
Waiting is an Act of Patience drawn-out. The
Scripture hath two Expreſſions concerning it,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>Waiting on God.</item>
                           <item>Waiting for God.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                  </list>
Waiting on Him for Comfort in Affliction; And
waiting for Him, to deliver out of Affliction. Thus
did the people of God, <hi>Iſa. 25. 9. Lo, This is
the Lord, we have waited for him, and he will ſave
us.</hi> This is ſome of the work we have to do in
an Afflicted condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To wait on God,
and to wait for God. Affliction is apt to make
us ſhort-breath'd. To make us weary not only
<hi>in</hi> waiting, but weary <hi>of</hi> waiting. This we ſhould
look to, That though we are weary in waiting,
yet not to be weary of waiting. It was the ſaying
of that wicked King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 King. 6. 33. <hi>This
evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait any longer?</hi>
The great work we have to do in an Afflicted
Condition, is, To wait upon God. I have told
you before, It is God that brings a man and his
Afflictions together; and as it is He that openeth
a fore-door, to let a man into that condition,
ſo it is He that muſt make a back-door, to let a
man out. There are many that would make a
back-door of their own; but God is wiſer then
they, and knows how to deliver them. <hi>Job</hi> 14. 14.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107590:104"/>
                  <hi>All the dayes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of my appointed time,
will I wait till my change come.</hi> And this is ſome
of the work we have to do in an Afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) To wait till our change come.
Now waiting upon God in Affliction, ſtandeth
in theſe two things,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In a Silence of Spirit. A waiting Spirit is a
Silent Spirit, it makes no Noyſe or Clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Lam. 3. 26. It will wait quietly for
the Salvation of God.</hi> Pſal. 62. 1. <hi>My Soul,
wait thou upon God.</hi> According to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
it is, <hi>Be Silent before God.</hi> Where
there is waiting upon God, there is no
murmuring; There are no impatient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
There is a deep ſilence of the
Soul in reſpect of paſſion, though not in
reſpect of Prayer. There is a ſpeaking
to God, but not againſt God. A waiting
Soul, is a praying, but not a paſſionate
Soul. Remember; When God's hand is
upon our Backs, our hands ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Mouths.</item>
                  <item>2. In a ſweet Submiſſion of Spirit to God, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's time for Deliverance. There
is our time, and there is God's time. As
Chriſt told <hi>Mary, Mine hour is not yet come.</hi>
This is Waiting, to ſtay the Lords leiſure,
and to wait His time. It was wickedly
ſpoken by that King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Who ſaid,
<hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait any
longer?</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, he ſhould
have argued thus, This evil being of the
Lord, therefore there is reaſon I ſhould
wait.</item>
               </list>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:107590:105"/>
10. Another work of an Afflicted Condition,
is this, To make all out of God, that we need
in that condition. Living on God, and living by
Faith, are ſome of the great Duties that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that Condition, <hi>Iſa. 50. 10. Is there any
that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light? Let
him stay himſelf upon his God.</hi> While we are in
a proſperous condition, we have Creature-props
and ſtayes, and we are too apt to ſtay our ſelves
upon them: And therefore the Lord pulleth
them away, to make us ſtay our ſelves upon
Him. As the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa. 3. 1. Behold, I
take away the stay and the staff,</hi> &amp;c. The Church,
in the day of her Affliction, made all out of
God, <hi>Mic. 7. 8. Though I ſit in darkneſs, yet the
Lord ſhall be a light about me.</hi> Faith will help us
to look upon God as an Univerſal Good. We
know there are many particular things, and (as
it were) pieces of comforts, that muſt concurr,
to make a mans outward condition good. Our
good here below, is a Compounded good; A
Wife is a part, and Children a part, and Riches
a part, and Health a part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a man by an
Eye of Faith, ſeeth that God is all this, and
more. As <hi>Elkanah</hi> told <hi>Hannah, Am not I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to thee then ten Sons?</hi> So the Lord is more
to a Chriſtian, then all worldly Enjoyments.
The things of the world (though enjoyed in the
greateſt meaſure) can never make a Condition
comfortable without God: But the enjoyment
of God, will make a condition comfortable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. It was <hi>Davids</hi> courſe, to place God
as his Strength, where greateſt danger was:
<hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the strength of my life:</hi> His
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107590:105"/>
Life was in greateſt danger: And it was his
way, to fetch ſupplies from God in his greateſt
wants. When he wanted a Rock, a Fortreſs, a
Comforter, a Deliverer; he made the Lord all
theſe. And this is ſome of the work we have to
do in an Afflicted condition.</p>
               <p>Thus we have finiſhed the Firſt thing,
by which a man is to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an Afflicted Condition;
whether it be good for him in this
life or not? (<hi>viz.</hi>) By conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he doth in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="chapter">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:107590:106"/>
               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>2 WE come now to ſhew you, that you are
to make a judgment of your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by what you make of your condition, and
what you have gained by it. The great Queſtion
you are to put to your ſelves, is, Whether you
are Spiritual gainers or loſers by your condition?
The truth is this, Every Temporal condition
is Evil for a man, by which he is a Spirituall
loſer. In an Afflicted condition, all will confeſs
they are Temporal loſers; They will tell you,
they have loſt Houſes, and Eſtates, and Wife, and
Children, and this, and the other Comfort:
But the Queſtion is, Whether you are Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
gainers, by your temporal loſſes. I have told
you before, An Afflicted condition, is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that may be improved to Spiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages:
Although it ſeemeth a barren condition,
yet it is improveable. <hi>Iſa. 41. 19. God ſaid, he
would plant in the Wilderneſs, the Cedar, Shittah
Tree, and the Myrtle Tree, &amp;c.</hi> He ſpeaks there
of making the Wilderneſs Fruitful. An Afflicted
condition, is a Wilderneſs-condition, and we
ſhould ſee what Fruitfulneſs there is in it. It is
ſometimes with conditions, according to what
the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh in another caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.
34. <hi>He turneth a fruitful land into barrenneſs.</hi> And
<hi>Verſe 35. He turneth a Wilderneſs into Springs of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107590:106"/>
Water.</hi> There are ſome conditions, that ſeem
outwardly fruitful, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Proſperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And theſe ſometimes are turned into bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs;
ſome are ſpiritually barren in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Some there are, whoſe condition is a
Wilderneſs, and yet this condition is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſprings of water, and is made fruitful. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhould ſee, Whether they are fruitful in the
land of their Affliction. You have a paſſage, in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 52. That <hi>Joſeph</hi> called his Sons Name
<hi>Ephraim, For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath made me fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the land of my Affliction.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould
look, what fruit their Afflicted condition beareth,
and what they gather from it. It is a condition
planted with Thorns and Thiſtles; but I have told
you before, That there is a Spiritual Art, of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Figgs, from theſe Thorns; and Grapes,
from theſe Thiſtles. God, in Afflicting, intends
our profit, and gain, and good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. It
is our work, to ſee whether we profit by Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
We can never ſay, An Affliction is good for
us, till we can ſay, This Affliction is for my
profit. And, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>It is good for me that
I have been Afflicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This having been ſpoken in General, I ſhall
now come to ſhew you in ſome particulars, how
you may know, Whether you are gainers by an
Afflicted condition.</p>
               <p>Before I come to ſpeak to them; You muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
under what Notions and Names, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
preſenteth them to us: By which you may
ſee, What is God's aime, and end, in ſending
them. And wee ſhould ſee, whether the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
hath done that work upon us, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107590:107"/>
to the Ends and Intentions of God, for
which he ſent it. Now that will be diſcovered
thus, by conſidering theſe things.</p>
               <p>1. Affliction is God's Furnace, <hi>Iſa. 48. 10. I
have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction.</hi> Iſa.
31. 9. When God Afflicted Jeruſalem, he is
ſaid, <hi>To have his Fire in Sion, and his Furnace in
Jeruſalem.</hi> Affliction is God's Fire and Furnace.
Now, what is the Fire and Furnace to do? It
is to Melt, and Try; and Refine, and Purify.
Chriſtians, in an Afflicted Condition, are to ſee,
Whether the Furnace hath done this work upon
them? Whether it hath Purified and Refined
them? They are to conſider, what they were
when they went into the Furnace, and what
they are when they come out. We read, <hi>Zach.</hi>
13. 9. <hi>God ſaith, he would bring a third part through
the fire, and he would try them as Silver is tryed.</hi>
Job (<hi>chap.</hi> 23. 10.) ſaith in his Afflicted Condition,
<hi>When he hath tryed me, I ſhall come forth like
Gold.</hi> (i. e.) Pure and Gliſtering. He ſhould
come forth better then he went in. This is the
great thing we have to do, to ſee whether we
come better out of the Furnace of Affliction,
then when we went in; whether we come forth
like Gold. The Furnace doth two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>It
<list>
                        <item>1. Melteth.</item>
                        <item>2. Refineth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. It melteth that, that is meltable; And we
are to ſee, What melting work Affliction hath
done upon us. Some are not melted, becauſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107590:107"/>
they are as ſtones in the Furnace. Caſt a ſtone
into the Furnace, it goeth in a ſtone, and it comes
forth a ſtone. It is heated, but is not melted.
There are many come out of an Affliction, the
ſame they went in. It is ſaid of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> at the
end of every Plague that befell him, That his
heart was hardned. He went in hardned, and
ſo he came out; he went a ſtone into the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
and ſo he came forth. It is our great work
in an Afflicted condition, to ſee how we come
forth, to ſee whether Affliction melteth us. There
is an expreſſion, <hi>Pſal. 107. 26. Their hearts mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
becauſe of trouble.</hi> We ſhould ſee, Whether
Afflictions do melt our hearts? Whether it hath
melted a Proud Heart into Humility? An hard
Heart into Softneſs? A Rebellious Heart into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?
<hi>Ephraim</hi> confeſſeth, Affliction wrought
this work upon him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. Thus you are
to ſee, What Affliction hath wrought upon you
by way of melting.</p>
               <p>2. You are to ſee, What Affliction hath done
by way of Refining and Purifying. That is the
other work of the Furnace, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To Refine.
It is to ſeparate the droſs from the Silver; and
to take away impure mixtures. When you went
into the Furnace you went in droſs, but do you
come forth as Gold? Some come forth but droſs.
The Lord ſpeaks of ſuch, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 29, 30. They
went in droſs, and ſo they came out. <hi>Verſ. 29.
The Bellows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed in the
fire, the Founder melteth in vain.</hi> The Lord there
ſpeaketh of Himſelf, as a Founder that hath taken
much paines, to little purpoſe: He had burned
his Bellows, but all was in vain, the wicked were
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107590:108"/>
not taken away. <hi>Verſ. 28. They were Braſs and
Iron.</hi> God looked that they ſhould have been
Silver and Gold, when they were in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.
Gods Furnace of Affliction, is, for a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of Metalls, to turn Iron and Braſs,
into Silver and Gold: But they were baſe and
corrupt ſtill. At beſt, they were but Reprobate
Silver; As the Prophet ſtyles them, <hi>Verſ. 30. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
Silver ſhall men call them:</hi> Or as it is in
the Margin of your Bibles, <hi>Refuſe Silver;</hi> Such
Silver, from which the droſs would not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
by the Fire of the Furnace of Affliction;
ſo they came out of the Furnace as they went
in. We read, <hi>Ezeck. 24. 12. God had ſet Iſrael
on the fire, but yet her great ſcum went not out of
ber.</hi> It began to boyle up, but it did not boyle
out. <hi>Verſ. 13. They were not purged.</hi> They came
off the fire as they went on. The great work
you have to do in an Afflicted condition, is, To
ſee what Refining work Affliction hath done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you.</p>
               <p>2. Affliction is God's School. Now in a School,
there is a Rod and a Book: The one for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
the other for Inſtruction. Thus it is in
God's School of Affliction, <hi>Pſal. 94. 12. Bleſſed
is the man whom thou chastenest, and teachest out of
thy Law.</hi> Whom thou chaſteneſt, There is the
Rod: And teacheſt out of thy Law, There is the
Book. This we are to do in an Afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
To ſee what God's Rod hath made us
to learn out of God's Book. The Rod cometh
for two ends,
<list>
                     <item>1. To drive ſomewhat out of us.</item>
                     <item>2. To drive ſomewhat into us.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:107590:108"/>
1. The Rod cometh to drive ſomewhat out
of us. <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth us, <hi>Prov. 22. 15. Folly is
bound</hi> (or riveted) <hi>in the heart of a Child, but the
Rod of Correction drives it away.</hi> The Rod is to
whip Folly and Stubbornneſs out of a Child;
and when it doth this work, then it is good.
We are to ſee, What the Rod hath driven out of
us. There is folly bound up in all our hearts,
and we muſt ſee, Whether the Rod of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath driven it away. <hi>Ephraim</hi> makes this
confeſſion, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. Thou hast chastiſed me,
and I was chastiſed; I was as a Bullock accustomed
to the yoak,</hi> &amp;c. There was an unruly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed
ſpirit in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but the Rod of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſubdued it: As he acknowledged, <hi>Verſ. 19.
Surely after I was turned, I Repented.</hi> The Rod
gave him a Turn, and he was Reformed by it.
Our great Work in an Afflicted Condition, is,
To ſee what the Rod hath driven out of us;
And whether, when we were out of the way, it
hath whipped us into the right way. <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Pſal. 119. 67. Before he was Afflicted he went astray.
David</hi> was a Rambler till God whipped him.
<hi>But now I keep thy Precepts.</hi> q. d. I was a very
careleſs obſerver of thy Precepts, but now thy
Rod hath whipped it out of me.</p>
               <p>2. The Rod cometh to drive, and beat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
into us. It comes to ſet on Leſſons and
Inſtructions. Correction cometh for this end,
To ſet on Inſtruction. You have a paſſage of
<hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33. 16. Of God's ſpeaking once or
twice, and man perceiveth it not. <hi>Verſ. 16. Then
he openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
(i. e.</hi>) When men will not hear, God
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107590:109"/>
cometh with Afflictions, and openeth their ears,
and ſetteth on his Inſtruction with a Witneſſe.
God's Corrections, are to Seal his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Inſtructions many times make no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
till the Rod comes and Seals them, and
puts the Stamp upon them. The queſtion we are
to put to our ſelves in an Afflicted Condition,
is, What Inſtruction the Affliction hath Sealed to
us?</p>
               <p>1. Can you ſay, The Rod of Affliction hath
Sealed an Inſtruction to you concerning God,
What he is? We read of <hi>Manaſſeh, 2 Chron.</hi>
33. 12. <hi>When he was in Affliction, he beſought
the Lord his God, and then (ſaith the Text)
he knew that the Lord was God.</hi> No doubt
but he knew it before, but he heeded it not,
till the Affliction came and Sealed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to him.</p>
               <p>2. What Inſtructions hath Afflictions Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning your ſelves? Can you ſay,
We have often heard, What a Proud, and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and Perverſe-Creature, man is; <hi>Like
a Bullock unaccustomed to the Yoak.</hi> Such a
creature I my ſelf am, apt to forget my God,
and to forget my ſelf: But alas! I took no
notice of theſe Inſtructions. But now Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath opened mine Ear, and Sealed this
Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>3. What Inſtructions hath Afflictions Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning the Creature? I have often
been inſtructed of the Vanity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of the Emptineſs that is in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Comforts, of the Uncertainty that is in
Riches, and all worldly Enjoyments: And
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107590:109"/>
have been called upon, to uſe all theſe things
with weaned Affections, and right conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of their Brevity, Mortality, Mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
But theſe Inſtructions I heeded not in
the day of my Proſperity. But now my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
hath Sealed theſe Inſtructions. I now
ſee what the creature is, and what all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things are, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Vanity and Vexation
of Spirit. When <hi>Solon</hi> the Wiſe, came to
viſit <hi>Croeſus</hi> the Rich, <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſhewed him his
Wealth, and asked him, Whether he thought
him not the happieſt man living? <hi>Solon</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Nemo faelix ante obitum;</hi> Thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
be unhappy for all this, before thou dieſt.
<hi>Croeſus</hi> did then but laugh at what <hi>Solon</hi> ſaid.
But afterwards, when he had loſt the Battle
againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and had his City taken, and
was bound to a Gibbet over a Great Pile
of wood, to be burned in the ſight of the
<hi>Perſians;</hi> He cryed out aloud, <hi>O Solon, Solon!
Cyrus</hi> asked him the meaning of it; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>That</hi> Solon <hi>had told him this before,
but he believed him not.</hi> We are to ſee, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Affliction hath Sealed this Inſtruction
concerning the creature's vanity.</p>
               <p>4. What Inſtructions hath Affliction Sealed
concerning Sin? Can you ſay, I have been
informed of the Evil of Sin, what a bitter
thing it is, That though it be ſweet in the
mouth, yet it will be Gall and Worm-wood
in the end. Theſe Inſtructions I have often
heard, but heeded them not. But now Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
hath Sealed theſe Inſtructions. It
hath given me to ſee, The Evil of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107590:110"/>
Pride, Covetouſneſſe, and of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving
the Creature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. What Inſtructions hath the Rod ſealed
concerning Duty? I have heard, out of Gods
Word, much concerning my Duty, What I
ought to do; but I was a careleſs, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Hearer.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I have heard, it was my Duty, In a
Good day, to prepare for Evil dayes. But
this Inſtruction I heeded not. I could not
believe there would be a change in my
condition: But now Affliction hath ſealed
this Inſtruction.</item>
                  <item>2. I have heard, that this was my Duty,
To pity others in their Miſeries, and to
have a fellow-feeling of others Afflictions.
But theſe I heeded not. I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Afflictions of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> I was
not afflicted in the Afflictions of others:
But now the Rod of Affliction hath ſealed
that Inſtruction.</item>
                  <item>3. I have been Inſtructed concerning
Obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhould be cloſe, and
conſcionable: But alaſs! I heeded not the
Inſtruction: I was looſe, and formal, and
took that liberty to my ſelf, that the Word
did not allow. But now the Rod hath
ſealed this Inſtruction; It hath taught me
to be more ſtrict, and cloſe in my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as it did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 71.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:107590:110"/>
Thus we are to ſee, Whether the Rod
of Affliction hath ſealed theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<hi>Pſal. 94. 12. Bleſſed is
the man whom thou chastnest, and
teachest out of thy Law.</hi> Then it
is right, when with Affliction, and
Correction, there goeth Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and when the Rod of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſealeth inſtructions out of the
Law.</p>
               <p>3. We have Affliction preſented to us under
another Name and Notion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it is
God's <hi>Plough, Pſalm.</hi> 129. 3. Every Inſtrument
in Affliction, is God's <hi>Plower:</hi> And every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
is God's <hi>Plough,</hi> that makes Furrowes
upon our Backs, our Eſtates, and Families. Now
conſider, What is the work of the <hi>Plough?</hi> It is
to break up the Ground, and to fit it for the
Seed, that it may bring forth a Crop. Now,
how ſhall we know it was good for the Land that
it was Plowed? but by the Crop it brings
forth. If it bring forth nothing but Weeds, or
Bryars, or Thorns, we cannot ſay, That it was
good for that Land, that it was Plowed. <hi>Joh.</hi>
15. 1. God is compared to a Husband-man. Now
a Husband-man hath two things to look to.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Field.</item>
                  <item>2. Vineyard.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For his Field, he hath a Plough: For his
Vineyard, he hath a Pruning-knife. Afflictions
are both theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:107590:111"/>
1. Afflictions are God's Plough for his Field;
And whoever are the Inſtruments in Afflicting,
they are but God's Plow-men. An Husband-man
hath his day-labourers under him: So hath
God, ſome that labour about the Ear, the Heart,
and the Inward-man: And theſe are his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
1 <hi>Cor. 3. 9. We are labourers together with
God; ye are God's Husbandry, or God's Tillage.</hi>
And then God hath another ſort, that deal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a mans outwards, and thoſe are, Such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
as he makes uſe of, in Afflicting. An
Husband-man in his Field, hath ſome to Plow,
and break up the Earth: And he hath ſome to
Sow, and caſt abroad the Seed. Thoſe that
Sow, are his Miniſters, who by their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
caſt abroad the Seed, when the Plough of
Affliction hath broken up the Ground. It is not
the Husband-man's work, to be alwayes Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he hath his time to be Sowing too. As you
may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 24. God's Afflicting, may well
be compared to Plowing, and that in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Plowing altereth and changeth the
face of the Earth. If you Plowe up a
green Meadow, you alter the Face of it:
It's Verdure, and Greenneſs, and Beauty
is gone. The Plough turneth a pleaſant
Meadow, into a fallow Field. Thus Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
changeth the face of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
It turneth a <hi>Naomi,</hi> into a <hi>Marah,
Naomi</hi> ſigniſieth, pleaſant, and <hi>Marah</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 20. It is ſaid, in <hi>Mic. 3. 12.
Sion ſhall be Plowed as a Field. Sion</hi> had
been as a beautiful Meadow, Fair, Green,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107590:111"/>
and Pleaſant; But God by Afflicting her,
would make her look like a Fallow-field.
Thus, you find the change, God's Plough
of Affliction, made in <hi>Job's</hi> condition: It
quite altered the face of it. <hi>Job</hi> 29. 2,
3, 6, &amp;c. he ſheweth you, how fair and
flouriſhing his condition was, before God's
Plough went over him: But <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. He
telleth you, what a change it had made
of the face of his condition.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. The Plough overturneth the Earth, and
layeth the bottom uppermoſt. It turneth that
downward, that was upward, and that upward,
that was downward. So doth Affliction, Where
that Plough comes, it hideth that that was green,
and turns it out of ſight, (<hi>viz.</hi>) our Comforts,
and caſteth earth upon them. As the expreſſion
is, <hi>Iſa. 24. 1. Behold, the Lord maketh the Earth
empty, he maketh it wast, he turneth it upſide down.</hi>
This the Plough of Affliction doth when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
It turneth our comforts and worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
upſide-down.</p>
               <p>3. The Plough where it cometh, maketh fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
And maketh ſuch marks and prints on
the earth, that a man may know where the Plough
hath gone: So that we can, for along time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſay, This ground hath been Plowed. So Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
make furrows, and leave marks behind
them, upon a mans Eſtate, and Body, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Relations; that one may ſay, Here hath
the Plough of Affliction hath gone. Thus it did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Shiloh,</hi> Jer. 7. 12. <hi>Go ye to my place which was
in Shiloh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ſee what I did to it, for the
wickedneſs of my people Iſrael.</hi> This was a long
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107590:112"/>
time after God had inflicted his judgments
upon <hi>Shiloh,</hi> yet ſhe lay as a Fallow-field
ſtill.</p>
               <p>The great work we have to do, is this, To ſee,
What work the Plough of Affliction hath done.
You muſt know, Plowing is a relative work; It
is in order to ſome other, and ſome further thing,
as to Sowing, and to Harveſt. We are to ſee,
Whether our Affliction have been followed with
a fruitful Crop. I have told you before, The
Plough of it ſelf doth no good, there muſt be
ſomething elſe, or elſe there will be no Harveſt.
There muſt be Sowing as well as Plowing. This
we are to do, to ſee, Whether we are Sowed,
as well as Plowed. And to ſee, What Crop is
brought forth, and groweth in thoſe furrows of
Affliction? Whether it be not weeds and hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
as the expreſſion is, Hoſ. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>4. We are to look upon Afflictions, as God's
Phyſick, and as thoſe Phyſical means and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that God uſeth for the curing of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.
As Phyſitians have their wayes of curing
corporal Diſeaſes, by Diet-drinks, and Sweatings,
and Purgations: So the Lord hath his Wayes and
Means of curing our Spiritual Diſeaſes. As there
are diſeaſes to which our bodies are ſubject, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
Surfets, and Feavers, and Dropſies, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions;
ſo there are the like in our Spirits.
It is the ſaying of one, That there is no Beaſt
on the Land, but it hath it's like in the Sea:
So, there is no diſeaſe belonging to our Bodies,
but our Souls are ſpiritually ſubject to. There is
the Tympany of Pride, the Dropſy of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Conſumption of Envy, the Feaver of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107590:112"/>
Paſſion: The Spirit hath it's Surfets and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.
Now, Afflictions are ſome of thoſe
means and remedies God makes uſe of, for the
curing theſe Diſeaſes. The great thing we are
to enquire after, is, What work the Phyſick of
Affliction hath wrought upon us.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Afflictions are God's Diet-drink. It
is made up with Gall and Wormwood.
So the Church telleth us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 19. So
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 20. we read of the Bread of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and the Water of Affliction. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
80. 5. We read of the Bread of Tears, &amp;c.
Phyſitians give things to their Patients, that
may not be toothſome, yet may be whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.
We are to ſee, What Operation
this Diet-drink hath had upon us, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it hath weaned us from the world.
There is a Diſeaſe Phyſitians call <hi>Pica,</hi>
which is a deſire to feed upon Traſh: As
ſome Women and Children, will eat Earth,
and Coales, and the Clay of Walls. Such
a Diſeaſe we are all ſuctject to, having a
ſtrong appetite and deſire after low earthly
things, too baſe for the Spirit to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now can you ſay, This Diet-drink
of Affliction hath cured you of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe?</item>
                  <item>2. Affliction is God's <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> his
blood-letting. God's Afflicting is His take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome blood from us. And when God
doth it, He doth it in the right Veine.
When He takes away Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
&amp;c. then he bloodeth us in one
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107590:113"/>
Veine. When he taketh away Wife or
Children, Then he letteth us blood in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Veine. We are to ſee, What good
our Blood-letting hath done us, Whether
it hath taken down our high Colour, and
our high Looks? We are to ſee, Whether it
hath taken away any of our corrupt Blood?
Whether it hath cured our Ranckneſs of
Pride, and Feaveriſhneſs of Paſſion. There
is an Expreſſion, <hi>Iſa. 17. 4. That the glory
of Jacob ſhould be made thin, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his fleſh ſhould be made lean.</hi> (i. e.)
God would let them blood by His Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
to cure their Pride, and all their
other Spiritual Diſeaſes.</item>
                  <item>3. Afflictions are God's Purgations, To
purge out of us Peccant and Malignant
Humours, They come to purge out of
us Pride, Covetouſneſs, &amp;c. We are to
ſee, VVhether Afflictions have purged us,
not only by moving theſe corrupt humours,
but by removing of them. <hi>Iſa. 27. 9. By
this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.</hi>
This is our work, To ſee what ſinful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
affliction hath purged away. How
many Purges hath God given to ſome by
Afflictions, and yet they have not removed
Obſtructions. Afflictions are to remove
Obſtructions: to make way for the Word
to come to the Heart. It comes to the Ear,
but the work of Affliction, is, to make way
for it to come to the Heart. The great
Queſtion, we are to put to our ſelves, is this,
VVhether Affliction, hath opened a way
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107590:113"/>
for Inſtruction to come to our Hearts?
St. <hi>Bernard</hi> told a brother of his that was
a Souldier, and a man of a Diſſolute and
Prophane life; When he ſaw him ſleight
the good Counſel he had given him, He
clapt his hand on his ſide, and ſaid, <hi>One
day God will make way to this heart of
yours, by ſome Spear or Launce.</hi> (i. e.)
He ſhould receive ſome Wound in the
Warrs, and then he would think of his
Admonitions: And ſo it fell out.</item>

Counſel or Direction can you give me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conditions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) for the chooſing or refuſing
a condition; ſo that I may not do what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
the Will of God, and to my own good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer to this, I ſhall give you in
ſome Directions, with which I ſhall conclude this
Subject, and they are of two ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Some
<list>
                        <item>General.</item>
                        <item>Particular.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. General. You muſt not be your own chooſers
of conditions, but let God chooſe for you. As
the Pſalmiſt's expreſſion is, <hi>Pſal. 47. 4. He ſhall
chooſe our inheritance for us.</hi> It is good for us,
not to be our own chooſers of conditions, but
to let the Lord chooſers for us. It is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
thing, and that that ſpeaks much Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Will of God; When in reſpect of
outward conditions, we can ſay, Lord, Thou
ſhalt chooſe for me. There are many that are
diſcontented if they may not be their own chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
And ſay, (as <hi>Rachel</hi> did concerning chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
Give me this, or give me that, or elſe I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107590:114"/>
dye. Herein is the pride of man ſeen, That he
muſt have, what he would have, or elſe he thinks
it not well, and is ready to charge God fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Thus it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> becauſe he could
not have his will in the deſtruction of <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
and in the enjoyment of his Gourd; he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flyeth ont into paſſion againſt God himſelf:
As you may read, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. VVhen God repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the evil concerning <hi>Nineveh,</hi> it diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Jonah</hi> exceedingly, and he was very angry.
And ſee, In a pett he would dye, <hi>Verſ. 3. Take
away my life from me, for it is better for me to
dye then to live.</hi> What was the cauſe of all this?
<hi>Jonah</hi> could not have his will in the deſtruction
of <hi>Nineveh;</hi> and ſo thought it was better to dye,
then not to have his will: So far did paſſion
tranſport him. And then concerning the Gourd,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. We read, how it ſprung up to ſhadow
<hi>Jonah,</hi> and he was exceeding glad of the Gourd.
But when the Gourd was ſmitten, and withered,
<hi>Jonah</hi> was exceeding angry; And ſaith, <hi>Verſ.</hi>
7. <hi>It is better for me to dye, then to live.</hi> Yea,
he proceeds ſo far, as when <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. God asked
him, VVhether he did well to be angry for the
Gourd, as to anſwer, <hi>I do well to be angry even
to the death.</hi> Now, what was the cauſe of all
this? But only this, That <hi>Jonah</hi> could not have
his own will, and be his own chooſer. So the
great direction, is this, Let the Lord chooſe your
condition for you, and let it be as the Lord will.
VVe are apt to be our own chooſers, and this
cauſeth much ſin and ſorrow. Thus we read of
thoſe, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. After the death of <hi>Gedaliah,</hi>
the Forces under <hi>Johanah,</hi> were in a great ſtrait,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107590:115"/>
VVhether they ſhould ſtay in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi>
or go into the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They reſoved at
firſt, the Lord ſhould chooſe their condition for
them; And thereupon they come to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
to enquire of God what they ſhould do;
And reſolved what ever Anſwer they had from
God, whether it were Good, or whether it were
Evil, they would hearken to it. As you may ſee,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 3, 5, 6. But we find, for all this, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to be their own chooſers, and to have
their own wills: And the Prophet telleth them,
That they diſſembled in their hearts, when they
ſent him to enquire of the Lord. For when
God had chooſen for them, and told them what
He would have them do, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to go into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
they would none of his choice, but into <hi>Egypt</hi>
they would go. This is that we are to take heed
of, of being our own chooſers of Conditions;
but let the Lord chooſe for us. So take notice
of theſe moving conſiderations, VVhy we ſhould
make the Lord, the chooſer of our conditions,
and not be our own chooſers.</p>
               <p>1. Now in Goſpel-times, we are not under
a Diſtinct Covenant for Temporalls as the <hi>Jews</hi>
were. The Law was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> a Conditional
Covenant for Temporalls, (<hi>viz.</hi>) for outward
Proſperity, and long Life, and temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> VVe find the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi>
runneth moſt upon temporal promiſes.
As we may read, <hi>Deut. 28. Lev.</hi> 27. And hence
it was, the people of God in thoſe times, did
ſo much ſtumble at the Proſperity of wicked men,
and the Afflictions of Godly men; As <hi>David,
Jeremiah, Habakkuk,</hi> and others did. But now
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107590:115"/>
under the Goſpel it is otherwayes. Since the
coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, and his pouring
forth of Spiritual Bleſſings upon His Church,
by the Holy-Ghoſt; He doth not feed his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
with the hopes of thoſe things that are
temporal. The <hi>New-Testament</hi> runs moſt upon
Spiritual promiſes: Only here and there, ſome
Temporal ones are inſerted, and intermixed;
which (we muſt know) are to be underſtood with
an exception; and that they ſhall be performed,
both when, and as, God ſeeth good. They do
not alwayes intimate what ſhall be, But onely
this, That, what ever be, it ſhall be for good.
So then, having a Covenant made up of better
promiſes, then thoſe that are temporal, it ſhould
make us willing to be at God's diſpoſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
temporalls. It ſhould make us ſay, Lord,
ſeeing thou haſt by Covenant, ſettled the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
things upon me; Deal with me for outwards
as thou wilt.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond moving Conſideration is this, Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs
to be the chooſers of our own Conditions.
Such is our folly and ignorance, that, if God
ſhould leave us to our own choice, we ſhould
make a very fooliſh choice. We ſhould chooſe
conditions, as little children do Books, when
they come into their Fathers ſtudies, (<hi>viz.</hi>) by
their gilt Covers, and the gay Pictures that are in
them. So would many chooſe conditions, rather
by what they ſeem, then by what they are: rather
by the fineneſs, then by the fitneſs of a condition.
As a child chooſeth a Coat, he looks not ſo much
at this, Whether it be fit, as whether it be fine
and trimm. If God ſhould leave us, to chooſe our
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107590:116"/>
own conditions, we ſhould be apt to chooſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
conditions for our ſelves. Our chooſing,
would be like a child's in an Apothecaries ſhop,
who chooſeth the moſt painted box, when it may
be, there is nothing but Rats-bane and Poyſon
in it. We are apt to judg of Conditions, by
their outſide, and never look what is within the
condition. That man that looks no further then
upon the outſide of a condition, will never make
a right choice. He will be of the number of
thoſe, of whom the Lord ſpeaketh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 15, 16.
Who were apt <hi>to chooſe the evil, and refuſe the
good.</hi> We are indeed children in making a choice
of conditions: Ready to take Rats-bane for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
Hemlock for Parſly, and the Berries of
deadly Night-ſhade for Cherries. As there is
need for a great deal of Spiritual Wiſdom, to
judg of conditions; ſo alſo to chooſe conditions.
The conſideration of our weakneſſe and folly,
ſhould move us, to make the Lord our chooſer
for us. How quickly ſhould we undo our ſelves,
if the Lord left us but to our own choice. We
ſhould inſtead of Bread, chooſe Stones; inſtead
of Fiſhes, chooſe Serpents; inſtead of Food,
chooſe Poyſon; and inſtead of Bleſſings, chooſe
things Burthenſome; and inſtead of what is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Good, we ſhould chooſe only what is good
in Appearance. Men would chooſe Conditions,
as many do Wives, (<hi>viz.</hi>) by their outwards,
not their inwards. They chooſe Rich and Fine,
rather then fit Wives; Whereas the comfort of
Marriage, lieth in fitneſs and ſuitableneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
The fineneſs of a Shoo, is not that that
makes it eaſie, but the fitneſs; ſo it is not the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107590:116"/>
of a condition, but the fitneſs that makes
it good. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> telleth us this Story of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
He put away his Wife; his Friends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
asked him, VVhat fault he found with her?
Is ſhe not Honeſt? Is ſhe not Beautiful? He put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out his Foot, ſhewed them his ſhoo, and
ſaid, Is not this ſhoo new? Is it not finely made?
And yet none of you know where this ſhoo pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me. So, if we ſhould be left to chooſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
by their outſide, we ſhould chooſe that
condition that doth look fine, but yet may prove
evil and uneaſie to us.</p>
               <p>3. A third moving conſideration, is this, We have
a God that is Infinitely Wiſe, and therefore there
is great reaſon, we ſhould leave the choice of
our condition to Him. He made man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
knowes what is beſt for man: He formed
man, and therefore knowes how to frame his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<hi>Pſal. 103. 14. He knoweth our frame.</hi> It
is there meant, of our outward frame, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
The frame of our bodies: But it is true of our
inward frame, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the frame of our Spirits.
So, He muſt needs know beſt, what condition is
beſt for us.</p>
               <p>1. He knows what is in man. It is ſaid
of Chriſt, (which ſpeaks his Divinity) <hi>Joh.</hi>
2. 25. <hi>He knew what was in man.</hi> God
knowes man's inwards, and knowes what
outwards will beſt ſuit with him. He that
made us, knows what condition is beſt for
us. He that hath taken meaſure of our
Bodies, beſt knowes how to fit us with a
Garment: And he that hath meaſured
our Foot, beſt knows how to fit us with
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107590:117"/>
a Shoo. And God that knowes our Spirits,
knowes beſt what condition will ſit them. <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 9. He is called, <hi>The Father of Spirits.</hi> They
come from Him who is the higheſt SPIRIT, as
from the Fountain. And he is called, <hi>Num. 16. 12.
The God of the Spirits of all fleſh.</hi> He is the God
of Spirits, and therefore muſt know the temper
of Spirits, and what condition will beſt ſuite
with them. As He that hath the Meaſure of
our Bodies, is the fitteſt to make a Garment for
us; and he that hath the Meaſure of our Foot,
is fitteſt to make a Shoo for us: So he that hath
the meaſure of our Spirits, is moſt fit to chooſe
our conditions for us.</p>
               <p>2. As He knoweth what is in man, ſo He
knoweth what is in conditions; He knoweth what
Effects they will have upon men. As he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Spirits, ſo he knoweth what conditions
will agree with them. We are ſo ignorant, that
if we were left to chooſe a condition, we ſhould
chooſe that, that may be unſuitable. It is with
many in chooſing conditions, as it is with ſome
in drinking Wine, who (as I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
ſwallow it greedily becauſe it is pleaſant,
but conſider not it's Strength and Operation,
and ſo become Intoxicated and Drunken by it.
This ſheweth, He is fitteſt to chooſe our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for us, that knoweth, both what is in us,
and what is in conditions; and knoweth how
our hearts and conditions will ſuit when they
meet. We read of <hi>Hazael,</hi> That he knew not
the Operation, that Honour and Promotion,
would have upon his Spirit: When he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Anſwer to the Prophet, <hi>Am I a dog, that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107590:117"/>
I ſhould do this?</hi> How many have deſtroyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by chooſing thoſe things, whoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they knew not. We many times know the
Names, when we know not the Natures, and
Properties, of things. VVe know Proſperity by
Name, when yet we know not it's Operations.
VVe know Conditions as ſome know Hearbs, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
their Names, but not their Vertues; but the
Skilful Phyſitian knoweth them. God knowes
what is in Conditions, and what Operation and
Work, they will have upon our Spirits; And
therefore is fitteſt to chooſe our condition for
us.</p>
               <p>4. A fourth moving conſideration is this, God's
Soveraignty and Lord-ſhip over us. He is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Majeſty, and we are dependent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
We have a common ſaying, That beggars
muſt not be chooſers. VVe are all beggarly
creatures, that have nothing but what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from God. VVe live on Him, and depend
on Him every day, for our daily bread. Now,
to be our own chooſers of conditions, ſuits not
with this. He is a proud and ſawcy beggar, that
will be the chooſer of his own almes. VVe muſt
know, God hath put us all into a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.
This ſhould keep us humble, and
work us to a ſubmiſſion unto the will of God, and
to be diſpoſed of by Him. VVe read of <hi>Pharoah,</hi>
how he forgot himſelf in this particular, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
29. 3. He waxed proud, becauſe his Land was
watered by the River <hi>Nilus.</hi> Thus it was in that
Country, They had not ſhowres from Heaven,
as other Countries had: For, <hi>Nilus</hi> at a certain
time did overflow, and ſo did enrich the Land.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107590:118"/>
Upon this, <hi>Pharoah</hi> thought, that he depended
not upon God, for the fruitfulneſs of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and preſumes to ſay, <hi>Is not the River mine?</hi>
VVe muſt know, we are all dependent creatures:
VVhat we have, was firſt in God's Hand, before
it was in ours: As what we give to a beggar, was
firſt in our hands, before it was in his.</p>
               <p>5. A fifth moving conſideration, is, Our own
unworthineſs. VVhat do we deſerve? VVe forget
this, when we would have our own wills. VVhen
we would chooſe our Conditions, may not the
Lord Anſwer us, as we do a proud beggar, that
is not contented with his almes, VVhy, what
do you deſerve? Let God put us into what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he will, we ſhould conſider, It is better
then we do deſerve. It is the confeſſion of <hi>Jacob,
Gen. 32. 10. I am leſs then the least of all thy
mercies.</hi> VVho is it, that can look upon himſelf
as ſuch, and yet ſtand upon it, to have what he
will?</p>
               <p>6. A ſixth moving conſideration, is, To let the Lord
chooſe our condition for us, is the way to have
comfort in our condition. There is no loſs in
it: VVhereas we ſhall be loſers, in being our
own chooſers. There is comfort in leaving our
ſelves to God, to chooſe our condition for us.
Let the condition be never ſo uncomfortable, yet
this puts comfort into it; That it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that God hath choſen for me, and ſo
muſt needs be beſt for me. A mans condition
may be ſuch, as may not ſuit with his own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
will and deſires; yet, this is that, that gives
comfort to a Chriſtian, VVhen he can ſay, This
is not a condition that is of my own chooſing, but
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107590:118"/>
the Lord hath choſen it for me. VVe read of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> when the Lord called him out of his
own Country, he went forth, not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went, <hi>Heb. 11. Abraham</hi> did not loſe
by doing this, and by making God his chooſer
of a place for him. To cloſe this; Know, you
will be no loſers in the end, in letting the Lord
chooſe your condition for you. Remember what
<hi>Moſes</hi> told <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 8. 16. That God did all
that he had done to them, <hi>to do them good at
their latter end.</hi> VVe may be aſſured, when we
leave it to God to chooſe our condition for us,
it ſhall be, firſt or laſt, good for us.</p>
               <p>7. A ſeventh moving conſideration, is this, They
have always been loſers, that have been their own
chooſers of conditions. Look through the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
you will find that they were, at firſt or laſt,
unhappy in their choice: And that thoſe, who
would have their own wills, had, in the end, no
cauſe to rejoyce. VVe read of <hi>Rachels</hi> paſſionate
wiſh, <hi>Give me children, or elſe I dye.</hi> And what
got ſhe by it? <hi>She died in Child-bearing.</hi> VVe
read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 18. of thoſe, that required <hi>meat
for their lusts.</hi> God gave them meat for their
hunger, but they muſt have meat for their luſts.
And ſee what came of it, <hi>Verſ. 30. While the
meat was yet in their mouths, the Wrath of God
came upon them,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall refer you, to <hi>Jer. 42. 10.
Jer. 43. 9, 10. Jer.</hi> 44. 26, 28. VVhere you may
ſee, What thoſe got, that would be their own
chooſers. Remember, this makes a condition a
ſnare to us, When it is a condition of our own
chooſing. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; They that
will be Rich, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Rich whether God will or
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107590:119"/>
no: Who make it their aim, and deſign, and
full purpoſe to be Rich, come of it what will,
we may ſee, what comes of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) They <hi>fall into
temptations, and into ſnares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may a man know, that he is
not the chooſer of his own condition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In General. Conſider this, Conditions
are the higher and lower Rooms and Seats, in
this great Houſe of the World. As you know at
a Table, there are the higher and lower Seats.
As we read, <hi>Math. 23. 6. That the Phariſees did love
the uppermost Seats at Tables.</hi> VVe are apt to
affect the higher conditions, but we ſhould look
to this, Whether the place we sit in, be the place
of God's chooſing? VVhether we did not place
our ſelves? But, whether it be the place the
great Maſter of the Family placed us in? Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Counſel of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 8, 10.
It is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, in reſpect of his Prieſtly
Office, <hi>Heb. 5. 5. He glorified not himſelf to be
made an High-Priest.</hi> (i. e.) He did not place
himſelf in that Office. It was not an Office of
his own chooſing, but he was called to it by the
Father. VVe ſhould conſider, VVhether we do
not take the Honour to our ſelves, of placing
our ſelves in conditions? VVe read, when <hi>Elijah</hi>
was threatned by <hi>Jezabel,</hi> 1 King. 19. 3. <hi>He fled
for his life to Beerſheba which belonged to Judah;
he fled out of Iſrael, and thence he went to Horeb,
and came into a Cave.</hi> See <hi>Verſ. 9. Behold the word
of the Lord came to him, And he ſaid to him, What
doest thou here, Elijah?</hi> And ſo he asked him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Verſ. 13. What doest thou here, Elijah?</hi> And
we find he could give no good account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107590:119"/>
there. We ſhould conſider when we are in a
condition, What account, we can give to God
of it. What anſwer we can make, when we are
asked, How came you there? When we are either
in a Proſperous or an Adverſe condition, and are
asked, How we came there? what anſwer can
you give? Can you ſay, Lord, It is the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that thou haſt choſen for me; and I am here
by thy Diſpoſal and Appointment?</p>
               <p>Now, this having been ſpoken in General; I
ſhall come to ſhew you in ſome particulars, How
a man may know, that he is not the chooſer of
his own condition.</p>
               <p>1. He that is not his own chooſer, is not guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his own Counſel, but by God's Counſel.
He conſulteth more with God, concerning a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
then with his own Heart and Spirit. It
is thus with many; when they look upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they fall to Conſulting with their own
Carnal Hearts, and Carnal Friends, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
What is for their outward Eaſe, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and Profit: But ſay not, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>It is
good for me to draw near to God.</hi> They ask not
Counſel of God, concerning their Condition.
<hi>Ezr.</hi> 8. 21, 22. when <hi>Ezra</hi> was to go from <hi>Babylon</hi>
to <hi>Jeruſalem, he asked Counſel of God.</hi> It is ſaid,
<hi>He proclaimed a Fast at the River of Ahava, to ſeek
of God a right way for them, and their little ones,
and for all their ſubstance.</hi> Where you may ſee,
They would have God chooſe their way for them.
We read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 36. When <hi>Saul</hi> made the
Motion of going after the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and to fall
upon them by night, The people anſwered, <hi>Do
whatſoever ſeemeth good to thee:</hi> But the Prieſt ſaid,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107590:120"/>
                  <hi>Let us draw near hither unto God.</hi> (q. d.) Let us
not be our own Counſellors, but let us ask Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of God. Now in asking Counſel of God
concerning a condition, we are to look to this,
That it be,
<list>
                     <item>1. Without Diſſimulation.</item>
                     <item>2. Without Self-Reſervation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Without Diſſimulation. We read of
thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. that would have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
inquire of God for them: They
made as though they would Steer their
Courſe, by his Counſel. But yet we find,
they would be their own chooſers. For
the Prophet telleth them, <hi>Verſ. 20. You diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in your hearts, when you ſent me to
enquire of the Lord.</hi> They ſent to enquire
of God, when they were reſolved before
what to do.</item>
                  <item>2. Without Self-Reſervation. Of this
were thoſe guilty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 6. Though they
ſaid, <hi>Whether it be good, or whether it be
evil, we will obey the Voice of the Lord.</hi>
(i. e.) Let God's anſwer be what it will, we
will hearken to it. And yet we do find,
That, becauſe the Lord's Anſwer did not
agree with their wills, They would not
hearken to it. So that we ſee, When they
made that promiſe to the Prophet, it was
with this Reſervation, Provided, that the
Anſwer that comes from God, be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our deſires. Thus they became their
own chooſers, and rejected the Counſel of
God, to their own deſtruction.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:107590:120"/>
2. This ſpeaks, we are not our own chooſers
of Conditions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When Lawfull means are not
neglected; nor Unlawful means uſed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When Lawful means are not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the avoiding of the Evils of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
There are many that do create
croſſes to themſelves. We are to bear
thoſe Croſſes that God layeth upon us;
but we are not to make our own croſſes.
There is little comfort, in bearing a croſs
that is of our own making. It is one
thing, when God makes us ſick, or poor,
&amp;c. And another thing when we make
our ſelves ſo, by the neglect of means.</item>
                  <item>2. When Unlawful means, are not uſed
to mend and better our outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Some there are that God hath placed
low: And, not being contented, they fall
upon the uſe of unlawful means, to raiſe
themſelves: And will not waite for the
Invitations of Providence till God bid
them ſit up higher. There is an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Prov. 28. 30. He that maketh haste to
be Rich, ſhall not be Innocent.</hi> There is a
making haſte to be Rich. Some will not
keep the Road, but will break Hedges,
and think to find a nearer way to be Rich,
by the uſe of unlawful means.</item>
               </list>
               <p>3. This ſpeaks, we are not our own chooſers
of Conditions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When croſs-Providences
do not diſcontent us. When what pleaſeth God,
pleaſeth us. When we can ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Shall
we receive good at the hands of God, and ſhall we
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107590:121"/>
not receive evil?</hi> It is then right, When what
pleaſeth God, pleaſeth us. There is a known
Story, of the anſwer that a Shepheard returned
to ſome Travailers, who asked him, <hi>What weather
they ſhould have? Such weather as I pleaſe,</hi> ſaith he; and
told them, <hi>The weather would be ſuch as God pleaſed,
but what pleaſed God, pleaſed him.</hi> It is then
right, When what pleaſeth God, pleaſeth us.</p>
               <p>4. This ſpeaks, that we are not our own chooſers
of conditions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When outward good things
are prayed for, and outward evills are prayed
againſt, With ſubmiſſion to the Will of God. Our
Saviour telleth us, <hi>John 5. 30. He came not to
ſeek his own will, but the Will of Him that ſent him.</hi>
And when he was to drink of that bitter Cup,
though he had prayed, it might paſs from him;
yet he addeth, <hi>Mat. 26. 39. Not my Will, but
Thine be done</hi> So <hi>John 12. 27. Father</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>Glorify thy ſelf.</hi> When he had prayed before, to
be kept from that hour, yet he cometh in with
this, <hi>Father, Glorify thy ſelf.</hi> (q. d.) What ever
becometh of me, Yet <hi>Father, Glorify thy ſelf.</hi>
We ſhould Imitate Jeſus Chriſt in this, and ſay,
<hi>Lord, Let not my will, but thy Will be done.</hi> VVe
ſhould in praying, either for outward good things,
or againſt outward evills, ſay, as thoſe did, <hi>Acts</hi>
21. 14. <hi>The will of the Lord be done.</hi> VVe have
an expreſſion, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 14. This confidence we
have, that if we ask any thing according to his Will,
he heareth us.</hi> This is the way to be heard,
when we ask not only according to his Revealed
Will, but with Submiſſion to his Secret Will.
The Rule for the right uſing of the great Ordinance
of Prayer, is, Asking according to the VVill of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107590:121"/>
God. It is not asking according to our own wills.
It is not to ask what we will, for that is to be
our own chooſers. In prayer, there is a making
known of our deſires to God, both for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
the good things that we need, and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the evils that we fear; and, in all this, there
muſt be a ſubmiſſion to the will of God. In the
beſt of Saints, there is Grace and Nature. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would have it's will, but then Grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and cauſeth a ſubmiſſion to God's will; And
ſaith, as our Saviour did, <hi>Let not my will, but
thine be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. You may know, you are not your own
chooſers of Conditions, by this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When
you are not too careful about the Iſſues, and
Events of things. It is thus with ſome, They
can be content to uſe the Means; but trouble
themſelves, about the Iſſue, and Event. Some
are content, that God ſhould preſcribe them
the Means, but they would appoint the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
When we can uſe Means, and leave the
Iſſue to God, without a diſtruſtful thought, then
it is right. We have an expreſſion of <hi>Joab's,</hi>
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 13. When the children of <hi>Ammon</hi>
came againſt <hi>David,</hi> he ſent <hi>Joab</hi> forth with his
Army to give them Battle; and the Counſel
that <hi>Joab</hi> gave to his brother <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> was this;
<hi>Be of good Courage, and let us behave our ſelves
Valiantly for our People, and for the Cities of our
God; and, let the Lord do that which is good in his
ſight.</hi> q. d. Let us uſe the Means, and leave the
Iſſue, and Succeſs, to God. <hi>Joab</hi> knew, that
the iſſues of Warr, were in the hands of God,
and therefore left them to Him. Our thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107590:122"/>
about the Iſſues of things, proceedeth
from a deſire that is in us, to be our own choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.
This is forbidden, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. In nothing be
careful.</hi> The care forbidden, is about the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
and Events of things: And ſuch a Care
beſpeaks a fear, that things will not fall out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Deſires, and Expectations; and
ſpeaks our deſire of being our own Chooſers.</p>
               <p>6. This ſpeaks our not being our own Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of a condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When we have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and can reſt upon Providence to bring it
about, without ſhewing the way, how to do it.
Remember, we are to ſerve Providence, but not
to go before it. When we go about, to teach
Providence its way, How to bring to paſs a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
this ſpeaks a deſire in us, of being our
own chooſers. Thus it was with <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> when
the promiſe was concerning her Sons, That <hi>the
elder ſhould ſerve the younger:</hi> Yet ſhe could not
be content with that, but muſt deviſe a way of
her own, how to bring it to paſs. As if God
needed her Sin, and her Shifting, to bring to
paſs, what he had promiſed. Providence need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not our Midwiſery, to bring to paſs Gods
Purpoſes. Concerning them, we may ſay, as
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Midwives did of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
That <hi>they were lively, and were Delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Midwives came to them.</hi> So, let me ſay
of Providences, and Promiſes, They need not
our help, for their being Delivered. The truth
is, we are too apt to mix our Wiſdom with
God's, and to direct his Providence how to
Work. <hi>Job</hi> 38. 2. (<hi>Saith God) Who is this, that
darkneth wiſdom, with words without knowledge?</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:107590:122"/>
How many be there, that darken providence with
their own ſinful Inventions? As though they
would teach God, how to bring to paſs, and
perform his own Promiſes. It is then right, When
we can wait upon God, for the performance of
his Promiſes in his own Way; And this ſpeaks,
We are not our own chooſers.</p>
               <p>7. This ſpeaks we are not our own chooſers
of a condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When we can wait God's
time (if it be ſad), for the change of it. There
is an Expreſſion of the Lord's, <hi>Jer. 49. 19. Who
will appoint me the time?</hi> Some there are, that
will preſume to appoint God the time, when
He ſhall alter things, and change their condit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
We read, <hi>John 2. At the Marriage of Cana
when they wanted wine; Christs Mother ſaid to him,
They have no wine,</hi> Verſ. 3. But he anſwereth her,
<hi>Verſ. 4. Mine hour is not yet come.</hi> Thus we would
ſet God the time, of changing our Water into
Wine. When we need a Mercy, then is our time
to ſeek it; but we are to wait God's time for
the beſtowing of it. We are not to ſet God a
day, but wait. As <hi>Habukkuk</hi> ſaid he would do,
<hi>Hab. 2. 1, 2, 3. He would get him into his Watch-Tower.</hi>
He knew the Viſion was for an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, and ſo would wait God's time, for the
deliverance of his people.</p>
               <p>8. This ſpeaks, we are not our own chooſers of
conditions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When the Iſſue and Succeſs,
and Event of things, doth not diſcontent us.
Of this I have ſpoken before, and therefore do
but touch it. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a paſſage, <hi>Quadr-Serm.</hi>
6. <hi>Enitendum ut ſit nobis cum Deo una volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas;
&amp;, quaecunque ei placent, placeant &amp; nobis,</hi> We
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107590:123"/>
ought to endeavour, that our wills may be one
with God's; and that whatſoever pleaſeth Him,
may pleaſe us. But of this I have ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But ſome may ask, Whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a man to wiſh, that a thing had fallen out
otherwiſe then it did? As when a loſs or croſs
befalleth us, Whether we may lawfully wiſh, it
had not been ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to the Anſwer of
this Queſtion. So, we muſt diſtinguiſh between
things that are
<list>
                     <item>1. Offenſive to God.</item>
                     <item>2. Troubleſome to us.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For things that are Offenſive to God,
VVe may lawfully wiſh they had not been.
VVe find the Lord himſelf wiſhing that, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
81. 13. <hi>O that my people had hearkened to me,
and that Iſrael had walked in my way.</hi> So that,
To wiſh, that thoſe evills that offend God,
had not been, is lawful.</item>
                  <item>2. There are Evils Troubleſome to us. And
about them lieth the Queſtion, VVhether it
be lawful for us to wiſh, whether ſuch evils
had not befallen us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For anſwer to that: Though in ſome caſes it
may be lawful, yet I ſhall ſhew you in ſome caſes
it is unlawful.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When the wiſh proceedeth from an
unwillingneſs to be under the Croſs. We
may ſit down and bewail the ſtate of things,
and ſo may wiſh things were otherwiſe
then they are; but then we muſt ſee,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107590:123"/>
that this proceeds not from delicacy of
ſpirit, and unwillingneſs to be under the
Croſs. A Chriſtian ſhould love to ſuffer,
though he loveth not that which he ſuffereth.</item>
                  <item>2. The wiſh is Evil, when it proceedeth
from Murmuring and Diſcontentedneſs of
ſpirit, with the Providences and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of God. Then to wiſh, ſuch and
ſuch a thing had not been, is ſinful, and
a kind of ſecret blaſphemy; When we fall
upon cenſuring God's Adminiſtrations:
This is to make our ſelves wiſer than God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now conſider in what caſes we may wiſh things
had not fallen out, ſo as to make ſuch wiſhes
lawful.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When they are not Abſolute, but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical.
When the wiſh is only thus; If God had
been ſo pleaſed; or, If the Lord had ſeen it good.</item>
                  <item>2. When it is only by way of bewailing the
ſtate of things, but yet there is a willingneſs
to ſubmit to God.</item>
                  <item>3. When in theſe our wiſhes, we mix Faith
with our Tears; and, under black and ſad Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,
we believe that God is good, and
good to us. As the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 73. 1.
Yet God is good to Iſrael.</hi> To cloſe this: We are
to conſider two things,
<list>
                        <item>1. We may wiſh that, that God wills
not, and yet not ſin. As the deliverance
of a people from Judgment, whom God
intends to Deſtroy.</item>
                        <item>2. We may ſin in wiſhing, and deſiring
what God willeth, (I mean in reſpect of
His Secret Will) as the death of a Father,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107590:124"/>
a Child; and Husband, a Wife: For whoſe
lives we may lawfully pray, when they are
ſick, though it may be the will of God that
they ſhall dye. This yet to be with a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to His will, though not yet Revealed.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus I have given you Directions in General,
concerning your chooſing of conditions.</p>
               <p>I now come to give you in ſome particular ones.</p>
               <p>1. Seek not great things for your ſelves, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
only things that are convenient. We are apt
to have our longings after things that are unfit
for us. We read of thoſe, <hi>Rom. 1. 28. Who did
things that were not convenient.</hi> So there are many,
who deſire things that are not convenient, <hi>Jer. 45.
Verſ.</hi> the laſt, The Lord giveth <hi>Baruch</hi> a ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
for this, <hi>And ſeekest thou great things for thy
ſelf? Seek them not.</hi> We ſhould ſtill remember
<hi>Agur</hi> his wiſh, <hi>Prov. 30. 8. Feed me with food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for me.</hi> According to the Original, it is,
<hi>Feed me with the bread of my allowance.</hi> (i. e.) that
that is my proportion. <hi>Tremelius</hi> rendreth it, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſum,</hi>
mine allowance. Some think, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſum</hi>
ſignifieth, a monthly proportion of food,
deriving the word <hi>a menſe:</hi> Some think, it is <hi>a
metiendo,</hi> from meaſuring. So <hi>Agur</hi> prayeth for
his meaſured allowance, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) ſuch an allowance
as did ſuit with the neceſſary occaſions of his life.
We read of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was going to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi>
Gen. 28. 20. that <hi>he vowed a vow;</hi> And
ſee what he deſireth of God? It is, <hi>bread to eat,
and rayment to put on.</hi> He deſireth not Honour, and
Riches, and great things, but things neceſſary and
convenient. He deſireth not delicates, (as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did) <hi>to be meat for his lust, but bread
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107590:124"/>
for his hunger:</hi> If thou wilt give me (ſaith he)
<hi>bread to eat.</hi> And then he deſired not cloaths
for his pride, <hi>but raiment to put on,</hi> (viz.) cloaths
to cover his nakedneſs. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16.
among thoſe Aphoriſms or Aphoriſtical, precepts,
he gives concerning practice, he gives ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
conditions, <hi>Minde not high things, but
condeſcend to men of low estate.</hi> Minde not high
things, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And whereas our
Tranſlation reads it, <hi>condeſcend to men of low estate,</hi>
in the Greek, it is only, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and may
be rendred, <hi>low Things.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that it ſhould be the neuter gender, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>high things.</hi> It is as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
had ſaid, <hi>Mind not high things, but condeſcend to
low things.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 8.
Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.</hi>
Contentment is the reſt of the Deſire; having that
that is neceſſary and convenient, we ſhould deſire
no more. And the Apoſtle gives the reaſon, <hi>Ver. 7.
For we brought nothing into this world, neither may we
carry any thing out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I ſhall do Two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. Shew you the Good of deſiring only
what is fit, and convenient.</item>
                     <item>2. How a man may judge of Conveniency,
and how he may know what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. Conſider the Good of deſiring what is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convenient, and of that condition that is fit
for us.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is the condition that is freeſt from
Temptations, and ſo the beſt condition. The
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107590:125"/>
temptation commonly lyeth beyond the line of
conveniency. The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 9.
That they that will be rich, fall into many
ſnares, &amp;c.</hi> When men are not content with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
things, and convenient things; but they
muſt have Great things, and an Abundance;
they lay themſelves open to, and fall under,
many temptations. This <hi>Agur</hi> doth acknowledg,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. In a Storm, that Ship is in leaſt
danger, that carrieth the loweſt Sayl. The
things of this Life, are things we eaſily ſin in;
Great things make us lyable to great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And this is one reaſon, why the apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth,
that Prayer ſhould be made for great
Perſons, <hi>viz. For Kings, and ſuch as are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Chriſtians, you are to obſerve, there are two
ſorts of perſons the Tempter is ready to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to get advantage of;
<list>
                     <item>1. Of ſuch as are in a High condition.</item>
                     <item>2. Of ſuch as are in a Low condition.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Such as are in a high condition; who ſail with
Top, and Top-gallant. Hence it is, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaith, <hi>It is hard for a Rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> It is rare, to find Great men,
and Rich men, Good men.</p>
               <p>2. Such as are in a Low condition, and are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
with it; That would have higher, and
fuller Sailes: <hi>i.e.</hi> Better, and greater things. Theſe
through their diſcontedneſs, lay themſelves open to
Temptations. It is obſerved of Witches, who have
given themſelves up to the Devil; that they are (for
the moſt part) ſuch as are Old, and Melancholy
Women eſpecially, &amp; ſuch as are of the poorer, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107590:125"/>
meaner Sort: And one reaſon of it, is, Their being
diſcontented with the means of their condition.
Remember this, Our being contented with things
convenient, without ſeeking great things for our
ſelves, will free us from many temptations. There
is a Story of a Roman, that had great Bribes ſent
him, and other great Rewards promiſed him: The
meſſenger that brought them, found him at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with a diſh of Turnips. He gave this Anſwer
to the meſſenger, <hi>Carry back your Preſents: he that
can be content with ſuch Fare, needeth them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A convenient eſtate is, the eſtate that is moſt
eaſy. Thoſe are fit things that are moſt eaſy; that ſhoo
is the eaſieſt, that fits our foot. It is ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Gen.</hi> 13. 2. that he <hi>was very rich.</hi> The Hebrew
word rendred rich, ſignifieth Heavy, <hi>viz. Abraham
was very Heavy.</hi> Great things are burthenſom, and
heavy things; when things convenient are not ſo.
They are attended with a double burthen.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A burthen of Duties</item>
                  <item>2. A burthen of Cares.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. A burthen of Duties. Much will be required
of thoſe, to whom God hath given much of the
things of this Life. The more Honour and Riches
any have, the more Duty is expected.</p>
               <p>2. A burthen of Cares. Great things are attended
with great Cares, and great Fears. <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 12. The
ſleep of a Labouring man is ſweet, but the abundance of
the Rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi> The Rich mans
care of getting, and his fear of loſing, depriveth
him of his reſt. It is with ſuch, as it is with thoſe
troubled with that diſeaſe called <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> or
<hi>Night-mare;</hi> they feel a burthen in their ſleep, and
think they have a Mountain lying upon their breſts.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107590:126"/>
Know this, A Convenient eſtate is the moſt eaſie,
and is not attended with thoſe troubles and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
as Great things are. We know, Garments
that ſit cloſe to us, are eaſieſt for us. A looſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a Cloak, &amp;c. in a windy day, becomes
troubleſom. A ſtaff is a help to a man in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but a Bundle of ſtaves is a burthen. From all
this, you may gather, That a convenient eſtate is
the moſt eaſie.</p>
               <p>3. A convenient eſtate is the ſafeſt, and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
in reſpect of outward dangers. It makes us
leſs liable to Envy, and Hatred. The Hiſtorian ſaid
of the Roman Emperours, That they got nothing
by being Emperours, <hi>niſi ut citius interficerentur;</hi>
but that they were killed the ſooner. Low Trees
ſtand in thoſe Tempeſts that overturn the tall ones.
Great things do but ſet us upon a Pinacle, from
whence we are ready, every moment, to fall, and
break our Necks.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider this, Things convenient, are moſt
commodious for us as Chriſtians. Do but conſider,
what Chriſtianity is compared to, in Scripture; and
you will find, That great, and ſuperfluous things,
do not ſuit with it. It is compared to three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>To a Race.</item>
                  <item>To a Warfar.</item>
                  <item>To a Pilgrimage.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. To a Race. 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 24. Know you not, that
they that run in a race, run all,</hi> &amp;c. They knew it well,
for the <hi>Isthmian</hi>-Games were at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Verſ. 24.
<hi>So run that you may obtain.</hi> This ſheweth that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
is a Race: Now when a man is to run a
Race, he chooſeth that habit that is moſt leight.
Some have loſt the Race, by the over-burthening
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107590:126"/>
of themſelves. It is thus with ſome, They never
know when they have enough: And never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Can I run this Race with all theſe cumberſome
things about me? They load themſelves with thick
clay, which unfits them to run that Race. This
made our Saviour ſay, <hi>That it was hard for a Rich
man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> That man
that deſireth only convenient things, hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of him that burtheneth himſelf with things
unneceſſary and ſuperfluous. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Heb. 12. 1. That we ſhould cast off what preſſeth us
down, and run with patience, the race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us.</hi> The things of this life, are things that are
burthenſome and heavy, and muſt needs make us
run the Race with the more difficulty. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this, with a Story I have heard of a Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
that had two Benefices: He being viſited by a
Miniſter upon his Death-bed, and ſpeaking of his
hope of going to Heaven: The Miniſter Replied,
Our Saviour telleth us, <hi>That narrow is the way,
and strait is the gate that leadeth to life.</hi> And do
you think to enter Heaven, with two Steeples on
your back?</p>
               <p>2. Chriſtianity is compared to a Warfar. As
you may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 18. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 12. Now, how
is it with ſuch men as goe to War? They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
not themſelves with the Affairs of this life.
2 <hi>Tim. 24. A loaded Souldier, full of ſpoil and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is unfit to fight.</hi> Convenient things are moſt
fit for Chriſtian-Souldiers; and when we deſire
things beyond the line of conveniency, we forget
that by our profeſſion we are ſuch.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſtianity is called a Pilgrimage. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are ſaid to be Strangers and Pilgrims. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107590:127"/>
deſire not to burthen themſelves with things
unneceſſary and cumberſome. I told you before,
a ſtaff in a Journy is helpful, but a bundle of ſtaves
is burthenſome. It was the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
to wear long garments: But when they were to go
a Journy, they did truſs and tuck them up, that
they might not hinder them in their Journy. A
long garment is apt to make us fall. Convenient
things are moſt ſuitable for us, as we are Pilgrims.</p>
               <p>Thus, you ſee the good of things, only-Convenient.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>WE now come to anſwer another Queſtion,
that ſome may Ask, concerning, What is
convenient? that ſo they may know that they deſire
not things unfit, and unproportionable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many that hearken to the voice
of Covetouſneſs, but not of Conſcience; and ſo are
miſtaken in their judging of what is competent,
and convenient for them. We muſt know, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
knoweth no competency, but is ſtill crying,
Give, Give. The Greek word for Covetouſneſs, is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>an having of more.</hi> When it hath this,
and that, and the other thing, yet it never hath
enough. A covetous man never knoweth what is his
<hi>demenſum,</hi> and due proportion; and ſo, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
I ſhall ſhew you in Four particulars, How you
may judg, What is competent, and convenient for
men in this Life.</p>
               <p>1. That that Nature requireth, <hi>viz.</hi> Meat and
Drink to nouriſh and feed the Body, and Clothing
to keep it warm. Among the Rules that Wiſe men
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107590:127"/>
give for the regulating of our deſires, This is one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we ſhould deſire naturally, according to Nature;
and indeed, they make it the Fundamental rule. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is content with little, when Covetouſneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with nothing, let a man have never ſo much. It
was the ſaying of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> when once he
had had a fall upon the earth; being riſen up, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
viewed the Impreſſion his body had made upon
the ground: <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how little, by Nature, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us, and yet whole Kingdoms will not content us.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is content with few things: This the Heathens
knew. <hi>Socrates</hi> could ſay, when he ſaw great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
carried through a City: <hi>O, how much can I be
without!</hi> It is the ſaying of <hi>Seneca, Parabile est quod
natura deſiderat, et expoſitum ad manum est; admanum
est quod ſat est.</hi> That is ready at hand, that nature
deſireth, and will ſuffice it. Remember, Nature is
contented with a little, and Grace with leſs.</p>
               <p>2. That that is fit for the Eſtate wherein God
hath ſet us. This is another rule, given for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
of our deſires, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That we are to deſire,
by our Relation; (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in reference to the place
wherein God hath ſet us. We muſt know, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencies
are not all of one ſize and meaſure: That
that may be a competency for one, may not be ſo
for another. We muſt know, there are diſtinctions
of perſons. God hath made ſome to be high, and
ſome low. As in the world, he hath made Mountains
and Vallies; ſo there are in the world, men of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Degrees, and Eſtates, and theſe have their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Competencies, Conveniencies, and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Agur</hi> (no doubt) was a man of quality, (ſome
think he lived in the dayes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> others think
in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>). He prayeth for what was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107590:128"/>
convenient for him. Then a man exceedeth the line
of conveniency, when he deſireth things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the State, Calling, and Condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God hath ſet him.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe are convenient things, that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for us, in relation to the Charge we have, and for
the maintaining of our Families. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
5. 8. ſaith, <hi>He is worſe than an Infidel, that provideth
not for his own, eſpecially thoſe of his own houſe. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
hath an obſervation, <hi>Eccleſ. 4. 8. I have ſeen</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>a man that hath neither Child nor Brother,
and yet there is no end of his labours.</hi> (viz.) he never
hath enough, although he hath none to provide for,
but himſelf.</p>
               <p>4. Thoſe things are convenient, that are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
needful, for the future, and the time to come.
The Scripture condemneth not a care of providence
but commends, and commands it, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 14. The
Fathers ought to lay up for the children,</hi> &amp;c. As we read
of <hi>Joſeph, Who fore-ſeeing the ſeaven years of famine,
laid up Corn before hand.</hi> To cloſe this: only ſeek after
things that are more for uſefulneſs then delight; and
things whereby you may be made more ſerviceable
to your God, and things that ſuit with the preſent
condition of times. This was <hi>Baruch's</hi> failing, of
which the Lord telleth him, <hi>That in ſad, and evil
times, he ſought great things for himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus for the firſt. That we ſhould not ſeek great
things for our ſelves, but things Convenient.</p>
               <p>2. Seek after thoſe things, that are, without doubt
and diſpute, and without controverſy, good for a
man in this life. When a man ſeeketh after Riches,
and Honour, &amp;c. There is ſome queſtion to be made,
Whether theſe things are good for him? But there
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107590:128"/>
are ſome things, that, without diſpute, are good for
a man in this life. The Apoſtle hath an expreſſion,
1 <hi>Cor. 9. 26. I therefore ſo run, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as not for
an uncertainty.</hi> I have told you before, it alludes to
the <hi>Isthmian</hi>-Games, where Running, and Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
were the chiefeſt Excerciſes. And he telleth
you, that thoſe that run thoſe Races, though they
run for a Crown, yet it was but for a corruptible
Crown: They did but run for that that was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and corruptible; but he, for thoſe things that
were certain and incorruptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Some may ask, But what are thoſe things
that are good without doubt, without controverſy,
for a man in this life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though we are not able to tell you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
outward things, What are good for a man in
this life? Yet we can tell you, of ſome things that
are indeed good. Thoſe things are of two ſorts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. General.</item>
                  <item>2. Particular.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. General. Godlineſs is good for a man in this
life, and that without controverſy. We find, how
much the Scripture doth Magnify and Extol it, as
that that is abſolutely and really Good. It ſpeaks
that of Godlineſs, that it never ſpeaks of Riches, or
Honour, or any worldly thing, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is profitable to all things, having the promiſes of
the life that now is, and of that that is to come.</hi> This
the Scripture never ſaid concerning any worldly
things. Profit we know, is that that moſt men look
after. And we ſay, Thoſe Arguments drawn <hi>ab
Vtili,</hi> from Profit, are the moſt moving. Now we ſee,
Godlineſs is profitable for all things, not only for
the life to come, but for this life too; It is profitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:107590:129"/>
1. For all perſons: the things of this world are
not ſo. Godlineſs is profitable for High, and Low;
for Old and Young; for all Sexes, Men, and Women;
for all Relations, Parents and Children, Maſters
and Servants.</p>
               <p>2. It is profitable for all things: For all the
Actions and Buſineſſes of your lives: For all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions: For all Civil Actions: You cannot Buy
or Sell, nor converſe with men as you ſhould,
without this: Yea, it is profitable in reſpect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Actions, you cannot Eat, nor Drink, nor
do any other thing to the glory of God, without
Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>3. It is profitable at all times. It is profitable in
Health, in Sickneſs, in the time of Youth, and of
Old-age; in the time of Peace, and in the day of
Trouble, when Riches will not profit. As <hi>Solomon</hi>
telleth us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, (which is the chief) Godlineſs is profitable
for both worlds. It is profitable in relation to this
world. It hath the promiſes of this life. And it is
profitable, in relation to the world to come. It
hath (as the Apoſtle telleth us) the promiſes of that
life that is to come. In Scripture, there are no
ſuch promiſes made to any man, as he is Great, and
Rich, and Honourable, but as he is Godly. To
cloſe this, The Scripture ſpeaketh this of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
That <hi>it is gain with contentment, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 6.
Which ſheweth, how it differeth from all worldly
gain. <hi>Godlineſs is great gain with contentment.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
may be gain, but it is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
But Godlineſs is gain, with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
It is gain in the mid'ſt of loſſes: It makes
a man contented, whether he hath little or much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:107590:129"/>
To Covetouſneſs, there is nothing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
But Godlineſs, ſheweth a man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in God; which makes him ſay, not
only with <hi>Eſau,</hi> I have enough; but to ſay
with <hi>Jacob,</hi> I have all. Now for Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. It is good for a man in this life, to eye more
the enjoyment <hi>of</hi> God, then enjoyments <hi>from</hi> God.
This is good without controverſy, and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
Some there are that poſſeſs much in this life,
but never put this queſtion, Do I enjoy God, with
the things that I receive from him?</p>
               <p>2. It is good for a man in this life, To rejoyce
more in the God of his Mercies, then in the Mercies
of his God: Some rejoyce in this, That their Corn,
and their Wine, is increaſed, and that they have
goods laid up for many years: This ſpeaks world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
not Godlineſs. Godlineſs teacheth a man
to rejoyce more in the Creator, then in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
More in the Fountain, then in the Stream:
More in the Sun, then in the Stars. <hi>Pſal. 4. Thou
hast</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) put more joy into my heart, than
they had, when their Corn and their Wine increaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This is, without diſpute, good for a man in
this life, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To ſerve God chearfully, however
He ſerve us, and deal with us. Selfiſhneſs will
teach us to ſerve God, while he ſerves us. He ſhall
have Duty, while we have Mercies: He ſhall have
Work, only while we have Wages; according to
the Antient Proverb, <hi>No penny, no Pater-noster.</hi>
Godlineſs will deſtroy this mercinarineſs. Sathan
would perſwade the Lord, that <hi>Job</hi> did ſerve him
only upon that accompt; but he found it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>4. This, without diſpute, is good for a man in this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107590:130"/>
life, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To keep God, whatſoever we loſe for
keeping Him: And to pleaſe Him, whomſoever we
diſpleaſe. Wordlineſs will teach us, to keep Him,
while we can keep our worldly pref<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rments: But
Godlineſs will teach us, to keep Him, though we
loſe all for keeping Him.</p>
               <p>5. This, without diſpute, is good for a man in this
life (<hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) To remember God in all our wayes, and
to eye his Glory in all the Actions and buſineſs of
this life. 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether you eat or drink, or
whatſoever elſe you do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. This, without diſpute, is good for a man in
this life, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To Conſecrate all his outward
things, and enjoyments, to the Service of God. We
read, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 3. When <hi>Benhadab</hi> ſent this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to <hi>Ahab, Thy Silver and thy Gold is mine: Thy
Wives and thy Children (even the Goodliest) are mine.
Ahab</hi> returned this Anſwer, <hi>I am thine, and all
that I have is thine.</hi> So it is good for a man to
ſerve the Lord, with the things that he enjoyes, as
thoſe things that are His. We read, How <hi>thoſe</hi> in the
primitive times, <hi>Acts 4. 35. that had poſſeſſions, ſold
them, and laid them down at the Apostles feet.</hi> So it
is good for a man, To lay down all (as I may ſay)
at the Feet of God.</p>
               <p>7. This is good for a man in this life, without
diſpute, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To give the things of another life
the preheminence. This our Saviour ſheweth us, in
<hi>Mat. 6. 33. Seek first the Kingdom of God, and it's
Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. We are to ſet Heaven, above
Earth, and Heavenly things, above all worldly
things. It is not good for a man, to give the things
of this life, the upper hand of the things of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
We find, how Jeſus Chriſt hath placed things,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107590:130"/>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16. (viz.) <hi>Length of dayes on the right hand,
and Riches and Honour on the left.</hi> The right hand
is given to Eternity, and the things of Eternity;
when Riches and Honour, &amp;c. are ſet at the left
hand. We read of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 48. 14. When he
heard his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſick, he came with his
two Sons, to viſit his Father, and preſented them
to him, to receive a bleſſing from him: But that
Son that he brought to his Fathers right hand,
he put his left hand on. Thus it is with many,
They ſet thoſe things at the right hand, that Jeſus
Chriſt ſetteth at the left. It is good, when we ſee
the things of this life, ſtriving to get the uppermoſt
place, To bid them come down, and ſit lower.</p>
               <p>Some may ask, What is it that ſpeaks our giving
the things of another life, the Preheminence?
<hi>Anſwer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. When we give them the preheminence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Eſteem. When they are the things moſt
prized and eſteemed by us: As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
84. 10. <hi>That one day in God's Court, is better than a
thouſand.</hi> It is good for a man in this life, to think
meanly of the things of this life, in compariſon
of the things of another life. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 17. When
God's infinite perfections are looked on, all the
things of this world are as nothing: All Nations
before him are as nothing, and they are counted to
him leſs then nothing. So ſhould we make account
of the things of this life, as nothing, in compariſon
of that life that is to come.</p>
               <p>2. Giving them the preheminence, in reſpect
of Affection, <hi>Colloſ. 3. 2. Set your Affections on
things Above, and not on the things of the Earth.</hi>
It is good for a man in this life, to have his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107590:131"/>
weaned from the things of this life, and
wedded to the things of another life. Though we
have the things of this life in our hands, yet thoſe
things ſhould not have our hearts. Remember,
our Affections were made for better things, than
things below.</p>
               <p>3. Giving them the preheminence, appears in
reſpect of purſuit, (<hi>viz.</hi>) When the things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
life are chiefly ſought after: According to
the command of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 6. 33. Seek first
the Kingdom of God.</hi> Joh. 6. 27. <hi>Labour not for the
meat that periſheth,</hi> &amp;c. The things of another life,
are the things that are primarily, and principally
to be ſought after.</p>
               <p>4. Giving the things of another life the Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
appears by this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in making the
things of this life ſerviceable, to thoſe of another
life. The Lord ſaid concerning <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,
The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Thus many make
the things of Heaven, to ſerve their inferiors;
giving the better hand to the things of this life.</p>
               <p>5. Giving the things of another life the Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
will appear by this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and diſadvantages that relate to another
life. When an Heavenly advantage is more to us,
than an Earthly one; And when an Heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
is more to us than a temporal one.
It will appear thus, When we do that, that is to
our diſadvantage, when the diſadvantage only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
this life, and the thing done, concerns the
life to come. This did <hi>Moſes,</hi> in forſaking <hi>Egypt,</hi>
He did that that was ſeemingly diſadvantagious to
him, in relation to this life. We read of thoſe,
<hi>Heb. 11. 35. They accepted not deliverance.</hi> The
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107590:131"/>
meaning is, They accepted it not, upon the tearms
upon which it was offered. To have had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was a temporal advantage: But to have accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it upon thoſe tearms, (they found) would have
been an Eternal diſadvantage to them. Upon this
accompt, did the Martyrs of Old, refuſe life when
it was offered them: They ſaw a temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
cloy'd with an Eternal diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Seventh thing, that is good for
a man in this life.</p>
               <p>8. This is good for a man in this life, without
diſpute, (<hi>viz.</hi>) So to live, and ſo to walk, (what
ever his condition be) as that he may fetch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from the conſideration, of what his condition
in another life ſhall be. Some there are, that being
in a proſperous condition, draw all their comfort
from it. Of ſuch <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, They have their
Portion only in this life: They comfort themſelves
only with what is their Portion here, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what their condition will be hereafter. It
is thus with gracious ones, (what ever their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be) They can ſay, My refreſhment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
floweth not from the things of my condition,
and the Springs below: But from the conſideration
of this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) What my condition ſhall be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and ſo from the Springs Above. Thus in the
ſaddeſt condition, we find the Saints of God, have
comforted themſelves with that. As you may ſee,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. Heb. 11. 10. Rom. 8. 18. Heb. 10. 34.
Heb. 13. 14. Heb.</hi> 4. 9. To cloſe this, It is good,
when our preſent condition in this life, is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the conſideration, of what it ſhall be in
another life. It may be, our houſe doth not pleaſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107590:132"/>
us, but it is comfortable to think, we <hi>ſhall</hi> have a
Pallace. It is the Pſalmiſt's expreſſion, <hi>Pſal. 66. 12.
Thou broughtest us through Fire and Water,</hi> yet <hi>thou
broughtest us forth into a Wealthy place.</hi> Remember,
that the Wealthy place, that is beyond our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
gives a gracious Heart comfort, in the worſt of
temporal conditions.</p>
               <p>9. This is good for a man in this life, without
diſpute, (<hi>viz.</hi>) What ever his portion in this life
be, To make God his Portion. Let his Portion
be a Portion of Comforts, or a Portion of Croſſes:
It is good to have a Portion above all this, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
The God of all comfort. As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his Son
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was a dying, <hi>Gen. 48. 22. I have
given to thee, one Portion above thy Brethren.</hi> It is
good in the beſt outward condition, when we can
ſay, I have a Portion above all this. We find
in Scripture, the Saints of God, comforting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
with this and that.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When they had ſomewhat elſe to glory in.</item>
                  <item>2. VVhen they had nothing elſe to glory in,
or fetch comfort from.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. VVhen they had ſomething elſe to glory in,
and fetch comfort from: VVhen they have had
a large portion of outwards; yet they have rejoyced
in this, That the Lord was their Portion. Thus
<hi>David, Pſal. 16. 5, 6. Pſal.</hi> 119. 57.</p>
               <p>2. The Saints have Gloried in the Lords being
their Portion, when they have had nothing elſe
to boaſt of. Thus did the Church, when in a ſad
condition, <hi>Lam. 3. 24. The Lord is my Portion, ſaith
my Soul.</hi> This the Church ſpake, in the day of
her Captivity. You muſt know, God is the beſt
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107590:132"/>
Portion. VVere a mans portion in this life, as
larg as from Sea, to Sea; were it as Glorious a
Portion as <hi>Solomons</hi> was, yet it is nothing, except
we have the Lord for our Portion. God is a Soul-Portion,
and muſt needs be the beſt Portion;
VVhich will appear, if we conſider theſe things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Excellency.</hi> The Soul is an Excellent
thing; and baſe things, (ſuch as the things
of the world are) can never be a fit portion
for the Soul. God is Supereminently, and
Unconceaveably Excellent; and therefore,
in Scripture, Great and Excellent things
(according to the Original) are called the
things <hi>of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Spirituality.</hi> The Soul is a Spirit.
God is a Spirit: And nothing but a Spirit,
can be a portion for a Spirit. The Soul is
the ſpirit created, and God is the Spirit
Creating: And nothing can be the portion
of Spirits, but he that is the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Spirits.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Infiniteneſs.</hi> Nothing but what hath
Infinite Fulneſs in it, can be the Soul's
Portion. There is an Image of God's Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs

Infinite, and ſo needs an Infinite Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Everlastingneſs.</hi> The Soul liveth for
ever, and ſeeketh an everlaſting Portion.
VVhen <hi>Baſil</hi> was tempted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Lievtenant, with offers of Mony, and
Preferment: He returned this Anſwer,

Preferment that will indure to Eternity. God
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107590:133"/>
is a Portion for ever.</hi> Pſal. 73. 26. <hi>He is my
Portion for ever.</hi> He is the Soul's Portion
in this life. As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal. 142. 5.
Thou art my Portion in the Land of the living.</hi>
And he is the Soul's Portion in the world

15. <hi>God will be all in all.</hi> There he will be
ſuch a Portion as is above Expreſſion, above

Bleſſed is the man, whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and
whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> He ſets not the Crown of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs,
upon the head of the Rich man, or the
Great man; but on the head of that man, whoſe
iniquity is forgiven. Pardon of ſin, is radically
every good thing. VVhen <hi>Iſrael</hi> had committed
that great Sin, the firſt thing <hi>Moſes</hi> prayeth for,
is pardon of their ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 32. Pardon of ſin,
is that, without which</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The beſt worldly condition, cannot
make a man happy. Let him be a Rich
man, a Great man; yet he is not a happy
man, except his iniquity be forgiven, and
his ſin be pardoned. Worldly things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mount a man above the evill that is in
ſin, and ſo he muſt needs be unhappy. It
is ſaid of <hi>Naaman,</hi> That he was a Great,
and Honourable man, but he was a Leaper;
that imbittered all. So, let a man be what
he will for his outward condition, ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned
will ſpoil all. What comfort hath
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107590:133"/>
a Great man, if he hath the Stone in the
Bladder, or the Gout? So, when ſin is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned,
it imbitters the comforts of the
beſt worldly condition. If we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the quinteſſence of all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
into one Catholick and Univerſal
comfort, yet it would do nothing, to cure
the evil of ſin.</item>
                  <item>2. The worſt worldly condition, cannot
make a pardoned man Miſerable. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of a pardoned condition, is ſuch, as
is not to be over-topped by any diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in any worldly condition. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſpeaking to the man, ſick of the <hi>Palſy,</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Mat. 9. 2. Son, be of good comfort,
thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Pardon of sin, is
the greateſt comfort. <hi>Iſa. 40. 1. Comfort ye
my people, (ſaith the Lord).</hi> And one thing
wherewith they were to be comforted, was
this, <hi>That their iniquity was pardoned.</hi> Could
we extract, out of all worldly Evills, the
quinteſſence of them, into one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Univerſal Miſery (As it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of <hi>Caeſar-Borgia,</hi> That he was ſo skilled,
in the Art of Poyſoning, that he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the Poyſon of a hundred <hi>Toads,</hi> into
one drop): Yet all this would not amount
to the Miſery that attendeth ſin.</item>
               </list>
               <p>11. This is good for a man in this life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſpute, To lay up Treaſure there, where
things are Pureſt, and things are Sureſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
To lay up Treaſure in Heaven: According to our
Saviours Counſel, <hi>Mat. 6. 19, 20. Lay not up for
your ſelves, Treaſures on earth, where the rust, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107590:134"/>
moath doth corrupt, &amp;c.</hi> Some may ask, But is it
not good for a man to lay up Treaſures on earth?
Let me tell you, It is not good for you, to have
thoſe for your only Treaſure. They are Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that Ruſt may corrupt, or Theeves Steal.
But would you know, what is good for a man
indeed, in this life? It is, laying up Treaſure in
Heaven. There things are Pure, <hi>no Rust to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
them;</hi> and there things are Sure, <hi>no Theeves
to Steal them.</hi> It is Wiſdom in treaſuring up of
things, not to reflect upon the place from which
we are going; but upon the place, to which we
are going. Were a man only for this life, and were
this world only, to be his continuing City; then
it were ſomewhat, to lay up Treaſures here: But
remember, this life is but a paſſage to another;
and it is good to lay up our Treaſure there, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are going. It ſhould be with us, as with
a man that is removing into another Country;
He ſends his Treaſure before hand thither, and
keeps no more about him, then what will ſerve
him for his Removal. So, that without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
this is good for a man in this life, To lay
up Treaſure in Heaven.</p>
               <p>12. This is good for a man in this life, without
diſpute, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To ſeek after diſtinguiſhing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
Conditions in themſelves, are un-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. We ſhould, therefore, look
after thoſe things that ſpeak diſtinguiſhing, and
not common, Love, <hi>Pſal. 4. 6. There be many that
ſay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) Who will ſhew us any good? But
Lord, Lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
us.</hi> This is a diſtinguiſhing thing: Corn, and
Wine, and Oyl, are not. But the light of God's
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107590:134"/>
countenance is. Chriſtians, remember, that the
outward things of a condition, are but common,
without the Graces of the Condition.</p>
               <p>13. This is good for a man in this life without
diſpute, (<hi>viz.</hi>) To keep peace within, however
things are without. A good Conſcience, is a good
thing for a man in this life. An Heathen could ſay,
as I told you before, <hi>Intus ſi recte, ne labores,</hi> If all
be well within, never trouble thy ſelf. <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſaith of a good <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that it <hi>is a continual
Feast.</hi> A good Conſcience is an Heaven, and an
evil one, is an Hell in this life.</p>
               <p>14. This is good for a man in this life, without
diſpute, (<hi>viz.</hi>) For a man to keep himſelf, in a
continual preparation for Death. This is good
for a man without controverſy. And it will appear
by theſe particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is not good for a man to live one
hour in that eſtate, wherein he dare not
dye. Dare you dye in an Unbelieving, and
an Unregenerate Eſtate?</item>
                  <item>2. It is good for a man to dye daily, and
to keep himſelf in a dying diſpoſition. When
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> The
meaning is, That we ſhould ſtill keep our
hearts in a praying Frame. So, when we
ſpeak of dying daily, The meaning is, That
by daily meditation of, and preparation for,
Death, we ſhould dye daily. A Lyon ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſeen, is the more terrible.</item>
                  <item>3. It is good for a man in this life, To
do every thing ſo, as that it may hold an
agreement with a dying condition. This
is that we ſhould look to; Whether, in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107590:135"/>
ſeeking the things of this life, we ſeek them
ſo, as that our ſeeking, holds an agreement with
a dying ſtate? Do you uſe the world, as though
you uſed it not? Do you do every Duty, as if it
were your dying Duty?</item>
                  <item>4. It is good for a man in this life, To live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day, as if it were his laſt day; and to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that every day, that we ſhould be found doing
at our laſt day. Some think that good at Death,
that they looked not upon as good in Life. O that
men would conſider, that what is good at the laſt
hour, muſt needs be good every hour! As on the
contrary, What is evil at Death, muſt needs be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
in Life.</item>
                  <item>5. It is good for a man, ſo to live, that when he
comes to die, he may have nothing to do but to die.
It is a folly in many, to put off all, till Sickneſs and
Death come. <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth upon men, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 1.
To remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth.</hi>
It is a madneſs in people, to leave the hardeſt work,
to the worſt and weakeſt State. To cloſe all: Let
me tell you Chriſtians, That it is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi>
that after he had ſerved his Generation, by the
Will of God, (or, as ſome read it) After he had
ſerved the Will of God in his Generation, he fell
a ſleep. How many fall a ſleep, before they do their
work? And put off their bodies, before they put
off their ſins.</item>
