            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

printed at Venise, after that translated into the
French langage and printed at Lyons, and now
translated &amp; printed for thee to reade in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
tounge. Enquire not of the Author, he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
and to know him would do thee but litle
good. Reade the booke deuowtly, regard the mater
of it attentyuely, it may do the much good in theis
euill dayes. This may be counted among the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
euils with which this age is infected, that thei
which are called christians are miserably diuided
about Christ. And yet in truth as the apostle saith
vnto vs,<note place="margin">

whom are all things, and we in him, and our lord
Iesus Christ by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are al things, &amp; we by him.
To discourse on this diuision and the cause thereof
would be to some pleasing, to some it would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing.
For what one truth can please myndes so
diuersly diuided? wold God it could please all to
become one in that one Christ whose name we al do
carie. In this litle booke is that benefite which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mith
by Christ crucified to the Christians, truly &amp;
comfortably handeled: which benefite if all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
did truly vnderstand and faithfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
this diuision would vanish away, and in
Christ the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shold become one. To this end
reade this booke and much good in Christ may it
do to all them which do reade it. Amen.</p>

            <p>I Cannot maruell ynough wherof it
commeth that all of vs are more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

that we take the one so much to hart,

minds are so drawen away &amp; peruerted, that
the more we be beset rownd about and loden
with the benefits of GOD our souerein Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so much the more become we blookish
and as it were distraught and out of our wits,
ronning after our owne lustes and vanities,
where through (as though wee had drunke

mispend our whole time, bwisying our heads
like litle children that go seeking of pinnes in

in his kinde giueth glory to the Lorde? yea,

thee: demaund of the fowles of the aire, and

him haue al of vs our being, mouing, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewance.
Such is the speech of all creaturs.
Onely man, who is made after the image and
likenesse of god, indewed with vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
memorie, and reason, (shewing himselfe in
that beehalfe more vnhappie than the brute
beasts,) passeth ouer the abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of so great
benefyes with his eyes shet, betrampling and
beraying them with his feete, as a swyne doth
precious stones: In somuch that after he hath

ignorance &amp; vtter blyndnesse. O lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
state of reasonable man, who can hope
for any change in thee, except it be from euil
<pb facs="tcp:21698:4"/>
to worse, seing thou hast no knowledge at all
of God, and that, all his benefits are despysed
through thyne extreme vnthankfulnesse in
this behalfe? If so many creatures wherwith
this whole howge worlde is garnished to thy
vse: and (to touch thee yit more neerely) if
the cunning compacting togither of thyne
owne bodie, which may well be called a little
world, as wherin a man may behold the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
wisedom of the workmaister: if thy soule
wherin shineth the inuisible image of of the
euerlasting God: if thyne owne lyfe: if the
consideration of so great abundance of good
things whereof he giueth thee the vse euery
day, are not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ynough to moue the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of thy hart: at leastwise yit oughtest
thou of reason to be inflamed and prouoked
by the benefyte of all benefyts, and by that
most precious gift which he hath made vnto
thee of his owne propre and only Sonne, who
is the very image of his substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; in whom
dwelleth the whole fulnesse of the Godhead,
togither with all the treasures of wisedom, &amp; al
knowledge: Yea &amp; so much ought it to moue
thee the more, bicause that without hauing re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard
that thou wart his great enemie, he hath
layd all thyne infirmities vpon his backe and
made him to dye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse for thy sake,
<pb facs="tcp:21698:5"/>
punishing thy sinnes in him, for the which
thou thy selfe haddest deserued eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Go now thou vnthankful persone, and
deuise all the excuses that thou wilt: and they
shall serue thee to no purpose, but to accuse
thee and to giue sentence againste thy selfe.
The wonderfull creation, order, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of this howge world, can giue thee know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
of his fatherly loue, wisedome, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power, although not in all poynts to the
full. But in Iesus Christ crucifyed, all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells
of gods mercie are opened vnto thee at
large and perfectly. There is no more any
veyle that can hinder thee from the knowing
of so great loue. Seest thou not how that at
his deathe the veyle vvas rent asunder in the
myddes? And when he cryed that all was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
&amp; bowed down his holy head, he gaue
a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that peace was made betwene God and
man. Let vs therfore henceforth learne O my
brethren to acknowledge the souerein bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
which we haue receiued by Iesus Christe
crucifyed Let vs behold the perfectnesse of
his lyfe, and his most holy Doctrine. Let vs
open our eyes at the vnmeasurable bryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his euerlasting truth, and let vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
our force folow the way wherein he hath
gone afore vs. Let vs with a cheerful and glad
<pb facs="tcp:21698:5"/>
hart imbrace the crosse which he hath set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs: and discharging our shoulders from
all burthens and al sinne wherin we are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
let vs ronne with pacience to the combat
that is appointed for vs, hauing an eye to the
beginner &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plisher of faith Iesus Christ,
vvho in stede of worldly glory susteyned the
crosse, and despyzed all the shame therof. Let
vs put of the old man with all his vvretched
and combersom dooinges and greuous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
and cloth our selues with the new man
vvhose yoke is sweete and burthen lyght. Let

And specially the simple people and such as

that the Author (vvhosoeuer he vvas)

But euen as in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mertyme we see the
Riuer Saon go gently to ioyne himself vvith
the Riuer of Rhone, without doing anye do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

deere spouse Iesus Chryst, without staying at
any other thing: that ouermaliciouse should
he bee, which would looke awrye on him, or
by any meanes let him of his course.
And thus my brethren fareye well in

GOD created man after
his owne Image &amp; likenesse,
making him, as in respect of
his bodie, impossible: and as
touching his Soule, rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse,
true, good, mercifull, and holie. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he being ouercome with desyre of
knowledge, had eaten of the Apple that God
had forbidden him: he lost the sayd image &amp;
likenesse of God, and became like the brute
beasts, &amp; like the diuel who had abused him.
For as touching his Soule, he became vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightuous,
vntrew, cruell, pitilesse, and the
enemie of God: and as touching his bodie,
he became passible and subiect to a thousand
inconueniences and diseases: and not onely
like, but also inferiour to brute beasts. And
euen as if our forefathers had obeyed God,
they should haue left vs their rightuousenes
and holines as an heritage: euen so by being
<pb facs="tcp:21698:7"/>
disobedient vnto God, they haue left vs the
inheritance of vnrightuousenesse, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and gods displeasure in such sort as it is
vnpossible for vs (through our own strength)
to loue God, or to frame our selues vnto his
holy will. Nay we be enemies vnto him,
as to one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> must punish our sinnes bycause
he is a iust iudge, and therfore can we not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

be short, our whole nature was corrupted bi

the other in beleuing. For if thou confesse
our Lord Iesus Christ with thy mouth, and
beleue in thy hart that God hath raysed him

               <note place="margin">Esai. 64.</note> that
all our rightuousnesse is as a defiled cloth of

Homilie of humilitie,<note place="margin">S. Basil.</note> sayeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Christian
ought to hold himself for rightuouse through
beléefe in Iesus Christ, and his wordes are
theis. The Apostle sayeth that he which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth

hath made Iesus Christ to be our wisedome,
rightuousenes, holinesse, and redemption, to
the end y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he which would glorie should glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
in the Lord, bicause that the perfect and
sound glorying is to glorye in the Lord. For
in so doing, a man presumeth not vppon his
owne rightuousenes, but acknowledgeth his
want of the true rightuousenes, and that he
is made rightuouse, only by beléeuyng in
Iesus Christ. And Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> gloryeth of
the despyzyng of hys owne rightuousenesse,

and of his séeking of Christes rightuousnes,
by fayth which commeth of GOD. Sainct

his fayth is imputed for rightuonsnes,

rightuous as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, séeing that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
became not rightuouse by the déedes
of the Lawe, but onely by fayth? Then is
not the Lawe néedefull, forasmuch as the

through onely fayth, according to gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouse
<pb facs="tcp:21698:24"/>
purpose, as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayeth. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
coufirmeth that which he hath sayde, by
the Prophetes example,<note place="margin">Psal. 31</note> saying: Blissed is
the man whome God accepteth for rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse
without workes: wherby <hi>Dauid</hi> mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that those men are very happy, whom
GOD hath determined to accept for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse
before him, by onely fayth without
any paynes taking or obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Law
on their behalfe. Thus sheweth he the blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
of the time wherein Christe was
borne, in so much as the Lord himself saith:
Many rightuouse men and Prophetes haue
coueted to sée the thinges that you sée, and to
heare the thinges that you heare, and haue
not heard them. The selfesame thing say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Sainct <hi>Ambrose</hi> in expounding the first

without workes and without any desert, &amp;
receiueth forgiuenes of his sinnes by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Also he affirmeth the same thing in an

him to dwell in our harts, and clotheth our

wherunto he moued Iesus Christ whyle he

obedientnes vnto God, louingnes, and
other perfections, wherthrough we recouer
the image of god. For this selfesame causes
Iesus Christ did rightly attribute blissed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
vnto this inspyred fayth: which blissed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
cannot be without good works &amp; holines

fayth onely: yit for all that they will
become neuer the more slouthfull to do good
workes. For Christes spirit is the spirit of
loue: and loue cannot be ydle, nor cease from
the dooing of good workes. But if we will
say the truth, a man can do no good workes,
except he first know himselfe to be become
ryghtuouse by fayth: for before he knoweth
that, his doing of good workes is rather to
make himselfe ryghtuouse than for the loue
and glorie of God: and so he defyleth al his
works with selfeloue for the loue of himself
&amp; for his own profite. But he that knoweth
himselfe to bée become ryghtuouse by the

Also we may like<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this holy faith to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
which is in Iesus Christ: who being ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
man (but withoute sin) dyd wonderfull
thinges, healing the sicke, giuing sight to the
blind, walking vppon the water, and raising
vp the dead, vnto lifte agein: &amp; yit theis mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uelouse
workes were not the cause that hée
was GOD. For before he did anie of those
things, he was God and the lawfull and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libegotten
sonne of God, and he neded not to
work those miracles to make himself god bi
them, but forasmuch as he was god, therfore
he did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so, the miracles that Christ
wrought made him not to be god, but shewed
openly that he was God. In likewise, trewe
faith is as it were a godhead in the sowle of
a christian, which doeth wonderouse works
and is neuer weary of well doing: and yit
those works are not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a

néedeth he to worke all those good workes to

become such a one. But forasmuch as he is a
Christian by fayth, like as Iesus Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man was also God by his Godhead: he
doeth all those good workes, which make not
the christian to be rightuouse and good, but
shewe him to be good rightuouse &amp; holie. So
then, like as Christes Godhead was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause
that he wrought miracls: euen so faith wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
through loue, is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> good works
that a chzisten ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth. And like as a man
may say of Iesus Christ, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he hath done this
miracle or that, and that those miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they glorified God, were also a great
honor vnto Iesus Christ as he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who
for his obedience euen vnto death, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
at gods hand in his resurrection,
and had gyuen vnto him all power but in
heauen and earth, which he had not afore as
in respect of his manhod, but deserued it by
the vnion which is betwixt the word of God
and the manhod of Christ: So doth faith in a
christian, which faith by reason of the vnion
that it hath with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soule, attributeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing
to the one which is proper to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
it commeth, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
the christian euerlasting life for hys
good works bicause good works are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> frutes
and testimonies of liuely fayth, &amp; procede of
<pb facs="tcp:21698:32"/>
it as light procedeth from a flame of fyre, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as I haue sayd heretofore. And by
this holy faith which imbraseth Iesus christ
it commeth to passe that our sowle is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Christ and is so vnited and knit to
him, that whatsoeuer Christ hath merited &amp;
deserued, the same is imputed vnto the soule
as though it had merited &amp; deserued it. And
therfore S. <hi>Austin</hi> sayth that God crowneth
his owne giftes in vs.<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> Of thys vnion of the
soule with Iesus Christ, Christ himself bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
good record wher he prayeth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(sayeth he) for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only: but also for all those
that shall beleue in me through their word,
to the end they may be al one thing, that like

appereth euidently, that if we beleue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word
of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> (who preached that Iesus

               </gap>s togither Herein we agrée with
them, that we stablish works, affirming that
the fayth which iustifieth cannot be without
good works, and that those which are become
rightuouse are they that doo the good workes
that may rightly be called good workes.<note place="margin">1. Peter. 2</note> But
we differ from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this, that we say, that
faith maketh men rightuouse withoute the
helpe of workes. And the reason is redy:
namely bycawse that by fayth wée putte on
Christ,<note place="margin">Gala. 3.</note> and make hys holyness and rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousenesse
to bée ours. And seyng the cace so
standeth, that Christes rightuousenesse is
gyuen vs by faith: Wée cannot be so thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
blynde, and vnhappye as not to beleue
that he is of suffycient abilitie, to make vs
(acceptable and ryghtuouse before GOD.
Lette vs saye with the Apostle,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.</note> if the blud of
Oxen and Gotes and the asshes of a Cow
sprincled, clenzeth the vncleane, as touching
<pb facs="tcp:21698:33"/>
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> clenzing of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flesh: how much more shal the
blud of Iesus Christ who by the euerlasting
spirit offered himselfe vndefiled vnto God,
clenze our consciences from dead workes to
serue the liuing God? I prey thée now, thou
good &amp; deuout christian, consider well which
of theis two opinions is the trewest, holyest,
and worthiest to be preached: Ours, which
aduaunceth the benefyte of Iesus Christ, &amp;
pulleth down the pride of man which would
exalt his owne works ageinst Christes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
or the other which by affirming that
fayth of it self iusti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieth not, defaceth the glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
and benefyte of Iesus Christ and puffeth
vp the pryde of man, who cannot abyde to be
iustified fréely by our Lorde Iesus Christ,
without some merit of his owne. But (saye
they) it is a gret quickning vp to good works,
to say that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh himself rightuouse
before good by means of them. I answer, that
we also confesse that good workes are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to god, &amp; that he of his mere grace and
frée liberalitie recompenseth them in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.
But we say moreouer, that no workes
are good, sauing those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as (S. <hi>Austin</hi> saieth)
are done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are become rightuouse
through fayth, bicause that if the trée be not
good, it cannot yeld good frute. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb facs="tcp:21698:33"/>
we saye that such as are become rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse
through faythe, forasmuch as they
knowe themselues to be ryghtuouse through
Gods rightuousnesse purchased by Christe:
make no bargayning with GOD for their
workes, as though they would bwy their
maner of iustification suche as it is, with
them: but being inflamed with the loue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

And like as I am clothed with Iesus christ

haue my neighbor in Christ to cloth himself
with me &amp; with my goods likewise, for the
loue that I beare him for christes sake. He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

And as in Iesus Christe hath indured al the

And this is too folowe Christs steppes,
according as sainct <hi>Peter</hi> sayeth. For when

for asmuch as the lyfe of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

that our fayth béeing fyned like golde in the

the blissednesse which the Psalmist speaketh

to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne. But
it standeth a christian in hande, to take good

to sinne: for this doctrine belongeth
to none such as honor them selues with the

not into despayre as though the blud of christ

we should celebrate the remembrance of his

our trubbled consciences myght be assured

<pb facs="tcp:21698:41"/>
till the testator be dead, but hathe full poure

Christ make his Testament, wherin he pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>misethe
forgiuenesse of sinnes, and the grace
and good fauour of himselfe and his father,
togither with mercie and euerlasting lyfe.
And to the intent that the sayd Testamente
should be of full force, he hathe confirmed it
with his owne preciowse blud and with his

sayeth, that Iesus Christe is the mediator of

When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> christian is at it, he must

Looke how much care we haue of our

féeleth anye gréefe, which spreddeth not it

of their election and predestination,
as of a thing of very great force to stirre vp
the mynds of the true Christians to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of God, and to the performance of good
works. And for the same cause our good lord
Iesus christ speaketh openly of this holy pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>destination,
as one that knew of howe great
importance the knowledge thereof is to the
edifying of his elect. But perchaunce thou
wilt say to me, I know wel that they whose
names are written in heauen, haue cause to
liue in continuall ioy, and to glorifie GOD
but in word and deed: but I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I knowe my selfe to bée an excéedinge

weake and frayle sinner, from the violence
wherof I am not able to defend my self, but

afflicted and troubled with dyuerse tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
methinks I do as it were behold with
myne eyes, the wrath of God squorging me.
Too answere to theis dowtes of thyne, I say
my ryght dere brother, that thou must assure
thy selfe, that al theis are but temptations of
the deuill, who by all meanes séeketh to rob
vs of that faith and confidence that springeth
of faythe and assurethe vs of Gods good will
towardes vs. He laboreth to strip our sowle
out of this preciouse garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for he knoweth
that none is a trew Christian, except he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
Gods word which promiseth forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of all sinnes, &amp; peace to all them which
accept the grace of the Gospel. Uerely I say,
that he which vppon theis promises of God,
perswadeth not himselfe assuredly, that god
is a mercifull and louing father vnto him,
nor with stedfast co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence loketh to receyue
the inheritance of the heauenly kyngdome
at his hand: is not faythful in dede, &amp; maketh
himself vtterly vnworthie of gods grace. In
respect whereof sainct <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth that we
be the temple of God,<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.</note> so farforthe as we
<pb facs="tcp:21698:49"/>
firmely mainteine the confidence and glory
of our hope, vnto the ende. And in another
place he exhorteth vs that we shuld not giue
ouer our trust,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10</note> which hath great rewarde of
recompence. And therfore my brethren, let
vs giue our whole indeuer to do the will of
God, as it becommeth good children, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that we sinne not, as néere as we can.
And although we fall oftentimes into sinne
through our own frayeltie: yet let vs not by
and by surmise, that we be vessels of wrath,
or that wée bee vtterly forsaken of the holy
Ghoste: for wee haue our Aduocate Iesus
Christ before God the father, and he is the
attonement maker for our sinnes. Let vs
bethinke vs of the opinion of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
who fayeth, that none of the Saincts is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse
and without sinne: and yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

The Lord (sayeth <hi>Salomon</hi>) chastiseth

life, to all suche as beleeue that all

the children of GOD: and bicause we bée
his children, hée hathe sent the Spirit of his

he) that are guided by the spirit of GOD,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
are the children of God: for ye haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
again the spirit of bondage in feare:

               </gap>
spirit beareth our spirit record, that wée bée
the children of GOD. Now then, if we be
children, wée bée also heires. And we must
marke well, that in these twoo places the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> speaketh plainly, not of
any speciall reuelation, but of a certeine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
which the holy Ghost doth commonly
yéelde to all such as receyue the grace of the
Gospell. Then if the holy Ghoste assure vs
that we be Gods children and heires: why
should we doubt of our predestination? The
same man sayeth in the same Epistle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> whom
hée hath predestinated, them hathe hee also
called: and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath called, them hath he
<pb facs="tcp:21698:51"/>
also made rightuouse: &amp; whom he hath made
rightuouse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also hath he glorified. What
shal we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say to al these things? if god be on
our side,<note place="margin">A true mark of predestis nation.</note> who can be against vs? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if I plainly perceiue, that God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me by giuing me fayth and the fruiets of
faith, that is to wit, Peace of conscience, mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tification
of the flesh, and quickening of the
spirit, whether it be in whole or in parte:
why should I doubt that I am not predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated?
And moreouer we saye with Sainct
<hi>Paule,</hi> that all true christians (that is to wit,
all such as beléeue the Gospell) receyue not
the spirit of this world,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> but the spirit that
commeth from god: by the inspiration wher
of they discerne the things that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them. What maruell then is it, if wée
know that god hath certeinly giuen vs euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life? But there are some which saye,
that no man ought to presume so farre, as to
boast himselfe to haue the spirit of GOD.
They speake in such wyse, as if the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
should glory of the hauing of it for his owne
desertes, &amp; not by the onely &amp; mere mercie
of God: and as though it were a presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
to professe him selfe a christian: or
as though a man could be a Christian with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauing of Christes spirit: or as though
<pb facs="tcp:21698:51"/>
we could without flat hipocrisie say that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is our Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> or call God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if the holy ghost moued not our hartes
&amp; tungs to vtter so swéete wordes.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12</note> And yit
notwithstanding, euen they that count vs
presumptuouse for saying that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs his holy spirit, with faith, forbid vs
not to say euery day <hi>Our Father,</hi> but rather
commaund vs. But I would haue them too
tell me, how it is possible to separate faith &amp;
the holy gost asunder, séeing that faith is the
peculiar work of the holy ghost? If it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to beléeue that the holy ghost is in
vs,<note place="margin">He that glorieth not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he hath y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ghost, is no true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> why doth sainct <hi>Paule</hi> bid the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
try them selues whither they haue faith
or no, affirming them to be reprobats if they
know not that Iesus Christ is in them? But
in very déede, it is a great blindnesse to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the christians of presumptuousnesse for
taking vppon them to glorie of the presence
of the holy ghost, without which glorying,
there cannot be any Christianitie at all.
But Iesus Christe (who cannot lye) sayeth,
that his spirit is vnknowen to the worlde, &amp;
that they only do know him,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> within whome
he dwelleth. Then let them begin to become
good christians, and put away their Iewish
minds, &amp; imbrace the grace of the holy gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb facs="tcp:21698:52"/>
in good earnest: and then shall they
know that the good and true christians both
haue the holy Ghost, and also acknowledge
themselues to haue him. But some one may
say to mée, that the christian can not by any
means know that he is in gods fauour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some speciall reuelation: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that he cannot knowe whither he be
predestinated or no.<note place="margin">Eccle. 6.</note> And hée may specially
alledge these woordes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> A man

doe you thinke it reason to conclude, that a

of the administration of the gospell, hée
ment that his hart misgiues him not of any
misdealing therin, and yit for all that, that
he is not sure he hath done his whole duetie
to the full, and therein obteyned the prayse
of rightuousenes to Godward, as if hée had
done all that pertained and was conuenient
to be done by a faithfull Steward: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in speaking of his office, like a iust and

               </gap>eferred all things to the only iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

these words of the Apostle Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> and
considereth the wordes going afore them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
some iudgement, and likewise the woordes

and that he knewe well howe the crowne of<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4</note>
that righteousnes was layd vp for him in

that no creature in heauen,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> earth, nor hell
was able to separate him from the loue of
God,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> and that he longed to dye bicause hée

it meaneth not that they should feare the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement

presently ready to condemne them: for (as
I haue said already) by the record which the
holy ghost giueth to thier spirit, they knowe
that God hath chosen them and called them,
of his owne mere mercy, and not for their

the Christians that haue once fasted

themselues quyte and cleane of this childlie

charitie, like as the slauish feare is suche an

a man may plainely perceiue, that the good
Christian ought neuer to doubt of the forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenesse
of his sinnes, nor of Gods fauour.
Neuerthelesse, for the better satisfying of
the Reader, I purpose to set downe here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
certaine authorities of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy Doctors,
which confirme this foresayd truth. Sainct
<hi>Hilary</hi> in his fifth Canon vppon Matthewe
sayth, it is Gods will, that wée should hope
without any douting of his vnknowen will.
For if the beléefe be doubtfull, there can bée
no rightuousenesse obteyned by beléeuinge.
And thus wée sée,<note place="margin">S Hilary</note> that according to Sainct
<hi>Hilarie,</hi> a man obteyneth not forgiuenesse of
his sinnes at Gods hand, except he beléeue
vndoubtedly to obteyne it. And good right it
is,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> that it should be so. For he that douteth,
<pb facs="tcp:21698:56"/>
is like a waue of the Sea, which is tossed &amp;
turmoyled with the wynd. And therfore let
not such a one think to obteyne any thing at
gods hande. But let vs here sainct <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stin.</note>
who in his Manuel counsele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h vs to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the sayd foolish imagination, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to dispossesse vs of the foresayd good
and sage assurednes. Let such foolish imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(sayeth he) murmur as much as it
listeth, saying: who art thou? how great is
that glorie? by what desertes hopest thou to
obteyne it? I answer assuredly: I know in
whome I haue beléeued, and I know that he
(of his great loue) hath made me his sonne:
I know he is trew of his promis, and able
to performe his word: for he can do what he
will. And when I thinke vppon the Lords
death, the multitude of my sinnes cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may
mee: for in his death doe I put all my
trust. His death is my whole desert, it is my
refuge, it is my saluation, my life and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
&amp; the mercie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is my desert.
I am not poore of desert, so long as the lord
of mercie fayleth me not. And sith the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Lord are manie: manie also are
my deseruings. The more y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he is of power
to saue, the more am I sure to be saued. The
same sainct <hi>Austin</hi> talking with GOD in
<pb facs="tcp:21698:56"/>
another place, sayeth that he had despayred
by reason of his greate sinnes and infinite
negligences, if the woord of god had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commne
flesh. And anon after he sayth theis
words: All my hope, all the assurance of my
trust is settled in his preciouse blud, which
was shed for vs and for our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In him
my poore hart taketh breth: and putting my
whole trust in him, I longe to come vnto
thée O father, not hauing myne owne rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousenes,
but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ryghtuousenes of thy sonne
Iesus Christ. In theis two places sainct <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
sheweth playnly, that the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must
not be afrayd, but assure himselfe of ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousenes,
by grownding himselfe, not vppon
his own works, but vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preciouse blud
of Iesus Christ, which clenzeth vs from all
our sinnes, and maketh our peace with god.
Sainct <hi>Barnard</hi> in his first sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vppon the
Annunciation sayeth most euidently,<note place="margin">S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</note> that it
is not ynough to beleue that a man can haue
forgiuenes of his sinnes,<note place="margin">Eche one must bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>larly that hie sinnes are relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him freely.</note> but by gods mercie:
nor any one good desyre or abilitie to doe so
much as one good worke, except God giue it
him: no nor that a man cannot deserue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
lyfe by his workes, but if GOD giue
him the gift so to beleeue: But besydes
all theis thinges (sayeth Sainct <hi>Bernard</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:21698:57"/>
which ought rather to be counted a certayne
entrance and foundation of our faith), it is
néedfull that thou beléeue also,<note place="margin">Eche one must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that his sinnes are relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him freely.</note> that thy sins
are forgiuen thée for the loue of Iesus christ.
Sée how this holy man confesseth that it is
not ynough to beléeue generally the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sinnes: but he must also beléeue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that his owne sinnes are forgiuen
him by Iesus Christ, and the reason is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at hand, namely, that forasmuch as God
hath promised thée to accept thée for rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse
through the merites of Iesus Christ, if
thou beléeue not that thou art become righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse
through him, thou makest GOD a
lyer, and consequently thou makest thy selfe
vnworthie of his grace and liberalitie. But
thou wilt say to me, I beléeue well the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of sinnes, and I know that GOD.
is true: but I am afrayd that I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shie
to haue so great a gift. I aunswer, that
the forgiuenesse of thy sinnes shall not bée a
gift or frée grace, but a wages, if God should
giue it thée for the worthines of thy works.
But I replie vppon thée, that God accepteth
thée for rightuouse, and layeth not thy sin too
thy charge, bicause of Christs merits, which
are giuen vnto thée and become thyne by
fayth. Therefore, following the councell of
<pb facs="tcp:21698:57"/>
Sainct <hi>Bernard,</hi> beleue thou, not only the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giuenesse
of sinnes in generall, but also apply
the same beléefe to thine own particular per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son,
by beleuing without any dout, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> all thy
misdoinges are pardoned thée through Iesus
Christ. And in so doing thou shalt giue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnto God, by confessing him to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and trew &amp; shalt become rightuouse and
holy before God, forsomuch as by the same
confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holines &amp; righteousnesse of Iesus
Christ, shal be communicated vnto thée. But
to returne to our purpose of predestinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I
say, that by the thinges aboue mencioned, a
man may euidently perceyue, that the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
of predestination doth not hurt, but
rather greately profit the trew Christians.
And I thinke not that it can hurte the false
Christians and reprobates. For albeit that
such maner of folk would beare them selues
in hand and pretend to the worldward to be
of the nomber of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> predestinate: yit can they
neuer perswade their owne consciences,
which wil euer bée gnawing and crying out
to the contrarie. But yit it séemeth greatly,
that the doctrine of predestination may hurt
them. For they be wont to say: If I bée of the
nomber of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reprobates, what shall it auaile
mée to do good works? And if I be of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:21698:58"/>
of the predestinate, I shalbe saued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any laboring of myne to do good works.
I answer thée at fewe wordes, that by suche
diuelish argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts they increace gods wrath
ageinst themselues, who hath disclozed the
knowledge of predestination to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to make them whot, and not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld in the
loue of God: and to set them foreward and
not backward vnto good workes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the trew Christian, on the one side hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himself assuredly predestinated vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
lyfe and to be saued, not at all by
his owne merites, but by Gods electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who
hath predestinated vs, not for our own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
lakes but to shewe the greatnesse of hys
mercie: And on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other side indeuereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to do good workes after the example of
Iesus Christ, as much as if his saluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
vppon his own policie and paynesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
As for hym that ceasseth to do good by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Doctrine of predestination, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if I be predestinated, I shalbée saued
without streyning of my self to do good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes:
he sheweth euidently, that his traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is not for the loue of God, but for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue
of himself. By reason whereof, the workes
that he doth may perhaps be good and holy to
the sight of men but they be wicked and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
<pb facs="tcp:21698:58"/>
before the Lorde God, who hath
an eye to the intent. And hereuppon it may
be gathered, that the doctrine of predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
worketh rather good than harme to the
false christians. For it discouereth their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
which can not cure it selfe so long as
it lyeth hidden vnder the mantel of outward
works. But I would haue them that saye, I
will not streyne my self to do well, for if I
be predestinated, I shalbe saued without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of my self so much: I say I would haue
them tell mée, how it happeneth, that when
they be diseased, they say not also, I wil haue
neyther Phisicion nor phisick: for looke what
God had determined vppon mée, cannot but
come to passe? why eate they? why drincke
they? why till they the ground? why plant
they Uines? and why bée they so diligent in
dooing all thinges conuenient for too su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne
the body? why saye they not also,
that all theis turmoylynges, pollices, and
trauels of ours are superfluouse, forasmuch
as it is not possible, but that what soeuer
God hath foreséene and determined concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our lyfe and death, muste néedes come
to passe? And therefore if Gods prouidence
make them not negligent and idle in things
perteining to the body. Why should it make
<pb facs="tcp:21698:59"/>
them more slothfull and negligent in that
which concerneth the Christen perfection,
which without all comparison is farre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
than the bodie? But for asmuch as wée
sée that neither Iesus Christe nor Sainct
<hi>Paule,</hi> for any doubt of offending the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
haue forborne to preache the trueth,
which is necessarie to the edifying of the
chosen, for the loue of whom the euerlasting
Sonne of GOD became man, and was put
to death vppon the crosse: wee also in like
wise ought not to forbeare the preaching of
predestination to the true Christians, for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as wee haue seene, that it importeth
great edification. Now are we come to the
end of our purpose, wherein our chief intent
hath bin (according to our small power) to
magnifie the wonderfull benefite which the
Christen man hath receyued by IESUS
Christ crucified, and to shewe that faith, of
hir self alone iustifieth, that is to witt, that
God receyueth and holdeth them for rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse,
which beleeue stedfastly that Chryste
hath made full amends for their sinnes: how
beit that as light cannot be separated from
Fyre which of it selfe burneth and deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
all things: euen so good woorks can not
bee separated from fayth, which alone by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="tcp:21698:59"/>
iustifieth. And this holy doctrine (which
exalteth Iesus Christ and represseth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth
the pryde of man) hath and alwayes
shalbe reiected and fought against by such
Christians as haue Iewish mindes. But
happy is hee, who folowing the example of
Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> spoileth himselfe of his owne
rightuousenesse, and would haue none other
rightuousenesse, than that which is of Iesus
Christ, wherwith if he be clothed and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled,
he may most assuredly appeere before
God, and shall receiue his blissing and the
heritage of heauen &amp; earth: with his
only Sonne Iesus Christ our lord,
to whom be all honor, praise &amp;
glory from this time forth
for euermore.
