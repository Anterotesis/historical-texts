         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE scope and intent
of Christian Religion
seemes onely this, to
raise vp man from the
deapth of miserie and
sinne, to the state of
happinesse and saluation, from whence
he is fallen: in effecting whereof, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
powerfull and all-sufficient meanes is
<hi>Christ crucified,</hi> God in our nature, our
nature with God, God &amp; man reconciled
<pb facs="tcp:3385:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the person of Christ, who was both
God and man; here is the great propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
sacrifice. For particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof, there is requisite in euery
one, <hi>Faith,</hi> which (supposing our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
blindnesse and ignorance) takes our
selues from our selues, placeth vs in
God, seeing him, and beholding him, we
see no more then he himselfe hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<hi>Hope,</hi> (supposing our naturall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
and fearefulnes) notwithstanding
the number and weight of our sinnes, yet
casts a sure and strong anchor vp into
Heauen, and there laies holde on Gods
promises; <hi>Charitie,</hi> (supposing mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
disobedience and rebellion) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
a conformitie of the head to the
members, and of the members betweene
themselues. Thus Faith looks to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and truth of Gods nature, stands
astonied at the mysteries, and takes all
the articles of our Creede for her lessons:
Hope fastens on the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, by the feruencie of Praier,
<pb facs="tcp:3385:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the strong apprehension of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
making the Lords Praier her pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
and president: Charitie considers
the rule of Gods iustice, desires to square
all our actions according to leuell, and
lookes to the tables of the Lawe, as her
obiects. Here is the fabricke of the
Church, Faith laies the foundation,
Hope buildes vp the walles, Charitie
giues it a couering, <hi>for Charitie doth couer
a multitude of sinnes:</hi> but how shall mans
naturall weakenesse attaine to these
Theologicall vertues? As in all great
buildings, so likewise here there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and tooles appoynted to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
our defects; and these are chiefely
and principally Sacraments, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
else God hath commanded for
his reasonable seruice. This is in effect the
summe of Christian Religion, this is the
summe of our ordinarie Catechisme.
Thus before wee can raise man, he must
first acknowledge his fall: he that shall
intend to make any buildings in Gods
<pb facs="tcp:3385:4"/>
Church, must lay the foundation in
mans fall: for this is the porch or first
entrance which leades vs to Christian
Faith; and therefore speaking hereof, I
thought fit to speake to the capacitie of
the naturall man: herein I shall not need
to straine his vnderstanding, to impose a
yoake of faith, when as his owne reason
shall reueale it in the substance, though
not in the circumstance.</p>
            <p>This fall of man appeares in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of man, which being truely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
may teach vs what wee are in our
selues. The greatnesse of our woe shewes
the large extent of our sinne: this world
which we inhabit, is but a vale of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the happinesse of this world, is onely
a painted miserie; in this miserie we may
acknowledge the great mercy of God,
who first created vs in happinesse, and
notwithstanding our sinnes hath still or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
vs to happinesse; and in these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
he hath giuen vs some ease, as much
as is befitting our present state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb facs="tcp:3385:4"/>
in sustaining these miseries, hee
hath inabled vs with patience, and the
holy comfort of his spirit; and euen our
greatest miseries hee hath taken vpon
himselfe, the more to teach him compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and with his miseries to satisfie for
ours. Thus not onely the blessings and
good gifts of God, but likewise our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
set forth his goodnes. And thus as
I haue endeuoured to shew the mercy
and prouidence of God in generall to
whole mankinde, especiallie for our
soules health and saluation; so here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
bolde to write vnto your Maiestie,
I could doe no lesse, then take some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the temporall blessings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God hath blessed vs aboue other
people. This blessing especially consists
in gouernment, whereby we receiue the
fruites of peace, of plentie, of happines,
and liue securely vnder the protection
of our Princes; this blessing seemes to
bee proper to this nation, proper to this
present age wherein wee liue: for I will
<pb facs="tcp:3385:5"/>
not speake how in former times, this our
Land was distracted with small principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and gouernements; when it should
seeme the greatest part lay waste in bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and confines, when the strength was
diuided within it selfe; I will onely
beginne with the last age of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
            <p>When as the dissention had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
between the two houses of Yorke
and Lancaster, it pleased God so to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that the house of Yorke staining it
selfe with his owne blood, when a cruell
and mercilesse tyrant did murther most
innocent and harmelesse Children, and
thereby vsurped the Crowne; this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
being likewise extended to others,
and a most reuerend Bishop being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to safe custodie; (<hi>God remembring
Ioseph in all his troubles</hi>), his prison was his
castle of defence, and his close keeping
did serue as a counsell-Chamber for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie,
where this reuerend Prelate, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the greatest lay subiect, as
<pb facs="tcp:3385:5"/>
it were a representatiue Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Lords Spirituall and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
Church and state together conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
did there contriue the happy means
of their deliuerie, <hi>to bring in Henry of
Richmond to suppresse this tyrant.</hi> And God
blessed the successe accordingly, that so
still the same goodnesse of God might
appeare vnto vs, which was once manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to the Israelites vnder the tyrannie
of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> where the poore innocent
children were likewise put to death, <hi>the
crie of my afflicted people is come vp vnto
my eares,</hi> Exod. 3. 7.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Henry of Richmond</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
did therein seeme to promise vnto the
world all happie successe; for men were
well perswaded of that familie, being all
of them most eminent for great vertues
and qualities (as may appeare) <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. for
his behauiour and courtesie: the <hi>Fifth,</hi> for
his valour and magnanimitie: the <hi>Sixth,</hi>
for his iustice and pietie. Now in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:3385:6"/>
of this <hi>Henry,</hi> it is strange to obserue
the prouidence of God; whereas the
<hi>Cambro-Britaines</hi> (whom we improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
call <hi>Welsh</hi>) were the most ancient
inhabitants of this Iland, being excluded
and exiled into the most remote and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
parts, and there not suffered quietlie
to rest, but brought vnder yoake and
subiection, and hauing once beene van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht,
yet could neuer bee admitted to
the common libertie of subiects; and
therfore flesh and blood could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it selfe, or patiently endure such a
bondage, but vpon all occasions they
did continuallie reuolte: beholde, this
good King <hi>Henry</hi> descended from them,
bearing their name, and therefore by
them making his first entrance into this
happy Kingdome, (in token and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
whereof he gaue his eldest Sonne the
name of <hi>Arthur</hi>) it hath pleased God,
that since that time, no people hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
more loyall and obedient to their
Princes then they. So that now, that
<pb facs="tcp:3385:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which before was spoken more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and is at this time still carried in
the Armes of our yong Princes (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>)
it is truely verified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the letter; God laughing at the
counsells of men, can erect the pillar
of his prouidence in the vaine thoughts
and cogitations of man.</p>
            <p>Thus in his person, we may consider
the quieting and pacifying of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
now being possessed of the Crowne,
whereas (in humane policie) his sworde
might haue kept it, as it was wonne by
the sworde, yet it should seeme, that hee
respected rather the good of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the good of posteritie. And
therefore by the happinesse of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> severall fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
by whose diuision so many bloodie
bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailes had beene fought; our cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was practised vpon our selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our
Townes became vnpeopled, our land
was left desolate, and fourescore Nobles
and Princes of the blood Royall were
<pb facs="tcp:3385:7"/>
slaine and murthered, so that mens
mindes were daily distracted, and vpon
euery dislike of the present gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
men had free refuge to that part,
which they conceiued might bee most
for their aduantage: miserable was the
condition both for Prince and Subiect,
but now are the roses vnited, the houses
conioyned, by a most inseparable bond;
for chaines and linkes of iron are not of
such strength and force, as are the bonds
of mariage.</p>
            <p>After the happinesse of his mariage,
followes the happinesse of his issue and
succession: for his issue male ending in
females, and gouerning this Scepter
with great glorie and magnificence, for
the space of a fullage, it pleased God so
to dispose in his prouidence, that this
wise King being to place his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in mariage, the one into Scotland,
the other into France; and question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made by some of his Counsell where
the eldest should bee bestowed? his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb facs="tcp:3385:7"/>
was, that hee had rather bring
Scotland into England, then carrie Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
into France: as it were foreseeing
in his wisdome (like a Propheticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
the meanes and occasions whereby
these Kingdomes might happilie be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and God blessed the successe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
For whereas since that time, by
all likelihoode and probabilitie, this
Kingdome should haue beene vnited,
sometimes to Spaine, sometimes to
France, and once, by an intended mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to Scotland, though otherwise so
backt with violence and force, as being
more vnnaturall, was therefore lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God: but God, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the vniting of these kingdomes,
had likewise appointed the meanes; lest
the greater should seeme to conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne
the lesse, therefore the lesser kingdome
should containe in it selfe the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
to the greater. And thus this
good King being inferior to none, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for valour, (for so hee attained his
<pb facs="tcp:3385:8"/>
Crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for wisdome, being trained
vp in the schoole of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth,
hauing tasted both fortunes, made wise
by experience; or for his iustice and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
leauing behinde him full coffers, and
a plentifull treasure, hee died: for what
should we expect but all happie successe
from the Sonne of such a vertuous, such
a godly, and most religious Mother, as
was the <hi>Lady Margaret Countesse of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (in these our daies) wee see the
full accomplishing of all those blessings,
which were then onely in hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
For in the person of our most
gracious King, besides all the blessings
which were contained in <hi>Henry,</hi> wee see
the perfect vniting of these kingdomes:
God forbid that I should any way para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell,
or make comparison betweene the
Graund-childe and his forefathers, this
were fitter to bee done betweene stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
yet sure I am, that not in any one
propertie our Soueraigne comes short
<pb facs="tcp:3385:8"/>
of his Progenitors. For being to vnite
two seuerall Kingdomes, it pleased God
to giue him a disposition accordingly,
such an open and louing heart general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to all (as being to gouerne people of
diuers nations), that for the truth of his
loue and affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole World, or
at least this whole Iland might not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
seeme to bee his natiue soyle;
such a bountifull and magnificent mind,
(as hauing many kingdomes to be the
obiects of his bountie), that infinite and
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berlesse they are, who haue found the
sweete benefit of his beneuolence, either
for profit or honour, or both; besides
his wisdome and learning, wherein by
many degrees hee hath surpassed all his
Progenitors; his gouernement being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his nature, so milde, so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
that it seemes to be paternall, <hi>as
if Iacob were now amongst his sonnes, and
had the promised land in possession.</hi> In so
much, that since his Maiesties most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
ariuall to this kingdome, there hath
<pb facs="tcp:3385:9"/>
followed such a generall Peace, as that
for such a time wee neuer enioyed the
like: for here amongst our selues, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of our Nobilitie hath suffered
death; the subiects in generall haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
such a free course of iustice, and
such a secure time, that had it not beene
for the monster of our age, the most
horrible treason that euer was inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(the Gun-powder plot), assuredly we
should haue much doubted, whether it
were possible for the minde of man to
hatch any treason, against so louing, so
gracious, and such a mercifull Prince.
And in regard that this kingdome hath
alwaies swaied a great part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and hath giuen lawes vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp;c. it hath pleased God, that since
his Maiesties comming to the Crowne,
many bloodie warres haue been app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>sed
by his most gracious mediation; and
notwithstanding that the occasions did
often appeare, which did seeme to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
blood-shed and warre, yet God in
<pb facs="tcp:3385:9"/>
his mercy hath so preuented it, as that
there was neuer conceiued such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
expectation of an vniuersall Peace to
ensue.</p>
            <p>And whereas not any Nation vnder
the Sunne, hath heretofore so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
ouer this Iland, as the Danes; by
his Maiesties most happie Marriage,
wee are now secured from all feare, and
seeme to bee much strengthened by the
alliance of a most stoute and warlike
people; in so much that both for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
loue, and brotherly affection to your
Maiestie, as likewise for the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of this Kingdome, wee haue twice
seene, to our great ioy and comfort,
<hi>The most valiant and couragious Prince,
The high and mightie Christian the fourth,

Maiesties person, (for the truth of loue
cannot alwaies stay the leisure to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

on with ceremonies). And thus
God to shew the perpetuall league and
couenant made with vs, hath so happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
contriued, that the meanes for our
perpetuall peace, might be for euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
that Nation, which heretofore
hath been at our backs to pursue vs, now
stand like sure friends to backe and to

            <p>For our most noble Prince <hi>Charles,</hi>
considering that the continuance of our
happinesse depends vpon his hope and
expectation, I will forbeare to speake;
onely thus much I may say, that being
descended from such noble Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as he partakes their nature, so their
vertues, carrying a name, which hath
beene most fortunate to the Christian
world, his naturall disposition and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
being such, as seemes to promise
the enlarging of our happinesse; <hi>My

being most free from all affectation

not from the best grounds), yet

               </gap>one the great necessary,
and naturall causes for the preseruation of
this vniuerse (suppose the motion and course
of the heauens, the preseruation of elements,
and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ike), but also to comprehend the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
and free actions of man; so that God
<pb facs="tcp:3385:13"/>
working in man works according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mans nature, the freedom of mans will
subsisting with the ouer-ruling hand of Gods
prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (for thus the causes are subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted),
and God working in nature, doth no
way destroy his owne workes and that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
order, which he himselfe hath appointed
from the beginning.</p>
            <p>This prouidence doth not onely extend it
selfe to the great and most noble actions of
man (suppose the gouernment of kingdoms, &amp;
Empires, and whatsoeuer else may concerne
the life and saluation of man), but it descends
much lower, and as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehends the care and
protection of dumbe beasts, so it stoopes euen
to the meanest and basest action of man, as the
falling downe of his haire, &amp;c. for wheresoeuer
God begins the action, and makes a creature
of nothing, there the same God with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
and subsequent prouidence, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his own worke; for if it be left to it self,
it will againe returne vnto nothing.</p>
            <p>For euery man daily to consider, how God
hath dealt with him in his prouidence, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:3385:13"/>
it is a most Christian and godly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
free from all superstitious vanitie, such
as I doe greatly recommend to thy practise,
such as I my selfe (sinfull and wretched man
that I am) haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually found in the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
course of my life; what neither blind fortune,
nor the trickes and subtilties of wit, nor the
power and strength of man, could euer haue
compassed, I haue found that God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
hath freely wrought and effected. To
let passe all other things which are proper and
priuate to my selfe (if thou pleasest to peruse
this hom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly Pamphlet), I thinke it not vnfit
to acquaint thee with this one accident.</p>
            <p>When first I made choice of my text, I had
thought to haue finished it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of one houre, and hauing waded into it,
(supposing it to be a subiect which did well
deserue my labours), God did so dispose of it,
that this whole treatise doth onely containe
the first part or branch of the text. Secondly,
hauing gathered some obscure and straggling
notes for mine owne priuate vse, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>as I
may boldly say, that no man did euer more

               </gap>rds
of mine should once hinder the Presse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from my heart, that there might be some
generall vacation, that new bookes might for
a time cease, that wee might finde at length
some leisure to peruse, reuiew, and reprint the
old Fathers; not contenting our selues with
patcht peeces, and broken sentences, but that
they might be heard ingeniously to speake for
themselues. For as we doe recommend the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Scriptures, so let vs not neglect the
best Commentaries and Expositions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that so the heate of our zeale, which
now is wholy wasted in controuersies and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
might then be spent in the practise
of pietie and deuotion, &amp;c. Notwithstanding
this my resolution, yet I was easily moued
(and the rather because I doe not remember
any booke written of this Subiect) to publish
this treatise.</p>
            <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> perusing whereof foure things there
are, wherewith I thinke fit to acquaint thee:
<pb facs="tcp:3385:14"/>
first, though (I confesse) I haue herein made
vse of other mens workes, yet I did forbeare
to set downe any quotations, not that I desire
to wrong them, but that I think it vnfit, when
occasion did not moue me, or necessitie inforce
me, there to vse many needlesse and idle quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
Secondly, though the punishment and
fall of man appeares chiefly and principally in
respect of his preparation to grace; yet my
selfe supposing at this time, that I speake only
to the naturall man, I thought fit to forbeare
speaking of that subiect, vntill first I should
make it appeare, that there is a sanctifying
grace, which is no way tyed or intailed to our
nature, which I haue reserued as a fit subiect
to bee treated of in the third branch of my
text. Thirdly, in the latter end of the second
part, speaking of the vanitie of the creatures,
if therein according to the condition of that
subiect, I shall somtimes intend (though much
against mine owne naturall disposition) in
this my long tedious discourse, to giue thee
some case and recreation, I hope it shall proue
no way offensiue, no not against the seuerest
<pb facs="tcp:3385:15"/>
and strictest discipline of the Church; seeing I
can therein iustifie my selfe, by the practise
and president of most deuout Fathers, and
others most reuerend Diuines in all ages.
Fourthly, speaking there of many worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
my intent is, onely to discouer them to
be but shadowes, in respect of a true blisse, that
so euery man might fall into some dislike with
himselfe; yet (I confesse) that many things
may, and ought still to be continued, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the state and condition wherein we liue,
as namely <hi>the ceremonies of Honor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My desire is, that thou wouldest iudge of
the whole, by the whole; of the parts, by the
parts: for if the whole be taken together, I
hope I shall not be found wanting or defectiue
to my intended scope. If sometimes I prooue
somewhat obscure, God (who knowes the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of my heart) can beare me witnesse, how
free I am from the least affectation of obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
and therefore you must either blame my
weakenes, as not conceiuing things aright, or
not able sufficiently to expresse mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits:
or else you must consider the subiect
<pb facs="tcp:3385:15"/>
matter whereof I write, which being very
difficult in it selfe, must necessarily admit
words of Art to vnfold it. To conclude, I
thought fit to continue this treatise, in the
same forme wherein it was first framed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
that the God of truth should giue a
gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ter blessing to the relation of a truth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would my time or leisure permit me to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. And if it shall please God, that this
booke finde happie successe, so that some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
good may thereby redound vnto Gods
Church, whereby I shall be the more incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to proceede in those parts which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine;
though I purpose to giue full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(as farre foorth as it lies in my power),
yet if possibly I can, I will tye my selfe to the
houre-glasse: ingeniously confessing, that as all
other builders are commonly mistaken in their
first workes, so my sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e haue erred in laying
the foundations, or setting vp the porch of
this building.</p>

Christ; and we in their loines, descended from them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

am fallen into a cold sweare, and am suddenly stroken
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3385:17"/>
with great feare and confusion, as indeed this world,
subsisting betweene Heauen and Hell, partakes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of both; the extreames, and allaies; the excessiue
ioyes of the one, with the feares and terrors of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
making a strange mixture betweene hope and
feare: for when I obserue the course of things, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
actions and inclinations of men; when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the diseases of these times, together with all the
signes, tokens, and symptomes: alas, alas, I feare a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse,
I feare a relapse, lest the world in her old doting
age, should now againe turne infidell, and that the end
of vs be worse then the beginning. The sicke patient
indeed will not confesse her disease: but this doth not
acquit her, rather it makes her state more dangerous:
neuer so much boasting of faith, as there is at this day;
for to many it serues as a soueraigne medicine, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
antidote, to exclude the necessitie of good
workes: or if any one should professe open heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme

            <p>But when I consider,<note place="margin">The grounds of this feare.</note> that nothing is of such difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

himselfe to the worship, seruice, and the immoderate

of faith: for if the vnderstanding be sufficiently
informed, and throughly resolued, the will must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow her directions; and to their rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmental
our outward actions must be squared out,
and measured accordingly: for euery tree is knowne
by his fruits, and euery thing according to the inward
existence, so hath it an outward operation: if our hearts
were inligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ned, they could not produce such workes
of darknesse; if the fire were kindled, it could not bee
accompanied with such coldnes of charitie. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I pray' pardon me, if I haue not so much faith, as to
beleeue the faith of many, that make an open profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of faith; or at least giue me leaue, as in all actions
and policies of state, so in religion, sometimes to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and preuent the worst: and therefore while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
labour in repairing the walles, some in erecting
and couering the roofe, some in beautifying and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Temple, giue me leaue to search the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which though it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>and vpon a Rocke, Christ Iesus
being the head corner stone of the building, against
whom neither storme nor tempest, no not the powers
of hell can preuaile; yet if I shall in some sort discouer
the strength of this building, we our selues may better
secure our selues in the certaintie and infallibilitie of
our faith; the deepe and sure foundation will keepe vs
from wauering, and it may likewise serue to preuent
the assaults and attempts of the heathen. Herein I shall
follow the practise of wise husbandmen, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
digge and lay naked the roote, that so the tree
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3385:18"/>
may fructifie, and bring foorth fruite in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>Especially for the honour of our progenitors, to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the proceedings of those great Magi,<note place="margin">The Magi.</note> together
with the iust motiues and grounds of their happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion,
I wil follow their steps, runne the same course,
and take the same pilgrimage with them guided by a
starre, the light of reason, the contemplation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I will direct my course to Ierusalem, the place of
Gods worship; where the law of God, which giues the
best testimonie of God, is kept in safe custodie; there
I will make a great outcrie, a solemne proclamation,
<hi>Vbiest, quinatus estrex Iudaeorum:</hi> then after due search
of the Law and the Prophets, I will hasten to Bethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
where I will adore God in the manger, the Sonne
of God in a cradle.</p>
            <p>Thus in this great world you may obserue, that first
there was a state of nature, which was the forerunner
to the Law: then followed the Law, which was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue
to the Gospell: now at length succeeds the
Gospell, wherein there is the fulnesse of knowledge, as
much as is befitting our nature and present condition:
if an Angell from heauen shall teach any other way,
let him be accursed: and yet we may expect some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reuelation of the mysteries of Christs kingdome,
when wee our selues shall be more capable thereof,
which shall be in the state of happinesse and glorie.</p>
            <p>Thus vndertaking to search the ground-worke of
religion, I will claime vnto my selfe these two priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
First, in the foundation no man sets iewels or
pretious stones; rubbish or vnhewen stone will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
when wee looke only to the strength of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
If I could vse many quotations of Fathers,
Councels, Canons, Schoolemen, or humane learning,
I would forbeare to doe it, these shall serue to polish
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3385:19"/>
and beautifie the Temple: but I will neuer admit them
to the ground-worke, left in stead of props, they might
seeme to vndermine and weaken the foundation, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
should relie vpon such incertainties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in laying the foundation, no man is ouer
curious in the workmanship; caruing and cutting
may well be spared, when we regard only the strength
of the building: Pardon me if my stile be vulgar, and
that I doe not obserue a right methode; for I will take
vnto my selfe this libertie, and in liew thereof I will
only intend demonstratiue proofe.</p>
            <p>I will bee more sparing in alleaging Scripture,
though it be authenticall and sufficient in it selfe: yet
here I will not expose it to the battell, for I am to deale
with the heathen, her seruants and handmaides. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and common sense shall stand in the forefront,<note place="margin">Naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall be our guid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and
beare the whole brunt of the combat. Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they doe not proue their owne principles, but as
they are linckt together in a golden chaine, so they do
mutually and reciprocally performe this dutie to each
other, especially the Metaphisicks, which as a superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent
takes no particular charge, but visits her whole
prouince; confirmes the principles of Arts; appoints
their circuits and bounds, and giues them their due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
Such is the force and efficacie of truth, that
wheresoeuer or howsoeuer disposed, still she carries
the same stampe, and stands alike affected to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of her selfe, and is alwaies readie prest either
to fight, or to bee deposed, in defence of her owne
right.</p>
            <p>Since man, according to his condition, is naturally
lead by sense, for want of a better guide, I will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to conduct him, from sensible obiects by the
light of his owne reason, to the knowledge of things
spirituall: and to this end I haue made choice of this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3385:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
text; <hi>The naturall man cannot comprehend the things of
the spirit of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The intent of the author.</note> Wherein I will shew first the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
of nature, in attaining the least part of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

contented, and yeeld her assent to the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

this shall be the scope and intent of my speech.</p>
            <p>But how shall I (that am a naturall man) presume to

meanes to obtaine this spirit is inuocation and prayer:

as if man could conspire against himselfe, or that
the testimonie of the whole world could preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the cabinet-counsel and knowledge of his own
soule; as if that God which reueales the mysteries of
grace, were not the same God which first laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of nature. To whom shal a man giue credit and
trust, if the inward light of his owne soule shall serue as

and discourse, we shall neuer be able to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

and prophecies haue ceased, which were wont to

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3385:20"/>
could not altogether excuse them; for then I should
vpbraid God, with his owne workmanship; how shall
the vessell say vnto the Potter, why madest thou mee
thus? yet certainly their case would seeme much more
fauourable, to the eares of an indifferent man; and
for my selfe, I would humbly surcease my duty &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and desire God to vse the ministery of Angels,
for the conuersion of man; for flesh and blood cannot
preuaile against the naturall inclination of flesh and
blood: nothing can struggle or striue against nature,
the current and streame is so violent: for nature is the
foundation, whereupon wee must build: now if the
walles, or the roofe seeme ouer great, or ouerthwart to
the foundation, no maruell if the whole building fall
to decay. The Philosopher will testifie as much: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
intus delitescens prohibet alienum:</hi> bee the water
neuer so scalding hot, yet will it returne to her first and
naturall coldnesse. The Poet wil say as much in effect:
<hi>Naturam expellas furc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, licet vsque recurret:</hi> set the
naturall man vpon the racke, yet is it impossible that
euer he should beleeue any thing contrary to the light
of his owne reason: this is a naturall inclination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to her selfe, and it is no way contradicted in
Scripture; for the naturall law, the Ceremoniall law,
and the Iudiciall law might together subsist; and at
this time the Morall law, imprinted in mans owne
heart, is no way abolished: now as is the will of man
inclined to our actions, so is our vnderstandings dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to our faith, both of them defectiue, and neither of
them opposite; and therefore the Apostle doth heere
place spirituall things much aboue nature, farre tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
nature, beyond the Sphere of nature, but no
way contrary or opposite to nature.</p>
               <p>Thus by the grace of God it shall well appeare, that
reason, and mans naturall vnderstanding, are so farre
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3385:21"/>
from ouerthrowing the principles of Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that they seeme rather greatly to confirme and
strengthen them.<note place="margin">A generall Answere.</note> See here the goodnesse of God;
though God needs not the testimonie of man, the Sun
at noone day needs not to bee discouered by the light
of a candle; yet for mans owne satisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
hee requires the witnesse and testimonie of
man: <hi>Tabernaculum posuit in sole, legem in corde:</hi> truth
is not repugnant to truth; nature supports grace; and
as both of them proceed from one fountaine, so the
same God, who is the author of both, will not destroy
his owne workes: <hi>Sed agit secundum modum vnius cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iusque
naturae:</hi> If God requires faith in the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
conformity in the will; then vndoubtedly the
same God hath first infused in them an inclination to
both. Compare the vnderstanding to the eye: suppose
you were to apply some medicine, some plaister or
salue; at the first indeed it seemes to put out the sight,
but at length it purgeth and cleanseth the eye: naturall
reason (I confesse) of it selfe is defectiue, and cannot
apprehend the mysteries of faith; but being once cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and enlightened by faith, sanctified by grace, it
serues to confirme and strengthen the grounds and
principles of faith; and therefore our Diuines suppose
reason to haue the same reference to faith, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leauen had to the sacrifices of the Law; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Scripture signifieth, one by the other: <hi>Beware of
the leauen of the Pharisees,</hi> Matth. 18. that is to say, as
the Interpretors expound; beware of the humane wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and subtiltie of the Pharisees. Now leauen it was
excluded from the sacrifices, Leuit. 2. And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
of Leuit, it was commanded, that the sacrifices
should bee laid and offered vp vpon leauened bread:

was, that leauen should be no part of the sacrifice, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3385:21"/>
yet no sacrifice to be performed without leauen: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or humane knowledge must not enter into, or
comprehend the mysteries of faith; and yet the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of faith must necessarily presuppose the ground-worke
and foundation of reason: <hi>Principia religionis
sunt nobis innata:</hi> reason informes man, that the end of
mans creation consists not in man himselfe, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
shall tast and see corruption, but in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and seruice of his maker; to him there is due, not
onely the subiection of the body, with humility and
reuerence; but likewise the obedience of the soule; the
will denying it selfe, and made conformable to Gods
law; the vnderstanding acknowledging his own blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
prostrating it selfe to the light and information
of faith; there must be a totall and absolute subiection,
befitting the infinite and absolute Empire of the diuine
Maiesty: and hence it is that neither the vegetatiue,
nor the sensitiue, but onely the reasonable creature is
made capable of religion: and hence it is that the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

tearmes, that no aduantage, or iust exception
should be taken; I doe heere protest, that I will vse no
other weapons to conuince this naturall man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the light of his owne naturall reason: I will lay aside
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3385:22"/>
Scripture, Fathers, Councels, the vniforme and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
consent of the whole world: I doe onely appeale
to himselfe, and to his owne knowledge. I stand vpon
the goodnesse and equitie of my cause; and therefore
I doe not feare to make him, that is the aduerse partie
in the suite, the iudge of my cause.</p>
               <p>Thus farre indeed I must excuse my selfe; I can doe
no lesse then sometimes vse the phrase of Scripture,
considering my profession, my habite, bred &amp; brought
vp in the Schooles of the Prophets; speaking to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Auditorie, in a religious time, and place. Againe,
sometimes you must giue me leaue to suppose that for
a truth, which afterward I will bring to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;
for all cannot be proued in an instant. Haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and forbeare mee a while, and I doe heere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that if my whole and entire speech shall bee duly
examined, the burthen and waight of my arguments
shall onely relie vpon naturall reason.</p>
               <p>In the first part of my text, concerning the naturall
man,<note place="margin">A more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diuision of the Text.</note> I will speake of these three things: first, that by
the light of nature we doe discerne, and acknowledge
the corruption of nature. Secondly, that by the light
of nature we are sufficiently instructed, that nature is
no competent guide, to conduct vs to a supernaturall
end. Thirdly, that nature being thus defectiue, there is
some higher stare and condition, whereunto being
once admitted, wee may bee directed to happinesse. So
in the first part, in the naturall man, I will consider na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
corrupted, nature defectiue and imperfect, nature
supplied by grace. Secondly, in the other extremitie I
will consider, first, how farre the naturall man may
wade into the knowledge of the Deity. Secondly,
what is exempted from his knowledge, and wherunto
he must not approch, <hi>videlicet,</hi> to the things of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God. Thirdly, in the disproportion consisting in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3385:22"/>
knowledge, I will first consider the reason why these
things are concealed from reason. Secondly, how man
shall satisfie the curiosity of his owne minde, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his owne ignorance, in the humble submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his owne soule, together with a sufficient warrant
for our faith, and security.</p>
               <p>I shall not here neede to describe the naturall man;
for it is not vnknowne vnto you, that God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Who is the Naturall man.</note> by vertue
of his promise, to preserue and continew the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
order, which was first instituted in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath tied himselfe to impart some things vnto the
creatures, as necessary and essential to the being, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the creature cannot subsist; other things are
added, as onely accessary to the nature, and these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon the free-will, and choyce of the giuer.
Hence it is that there are seuerall kindes; and sorts of
creatures; and to euery kinde, there are seueral and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
properties allotted; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> and the reasonable creature: so
of reasonable creatures, some haue onely an instinct of
nature, a reasonable and discoursiue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oule, wherein the
principles of humane knowledge are ingrafted: others,
besides this little sparke of reason, are further enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
by the assistance of Gods spirit, as children
taught by their Schoole-master. Now conceiue man
onely consisting of nature, without hope of happines,
or any further direction of grace (such as were the
morall Heathen, the vncircumcised Gentiles) which
stare and condition euery man claimes, by vertue of his
first birth; and here you haue the naturall man descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
Now that there should bee such a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
man, and man; that grace should be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from nature, I wil not here insist vpon the proofe:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3385:23"/>
for by Gods helpe it shall easily appeare, by the sequell
of my speech.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but nature in generall is much
corrupted; which doth more argue the corruption of
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>in particular, being that whole nature is directed to
man. First it appeares, in that shee is more plentifull,
and abounding in euill, then in good: <hi>Vna est recta li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,
curuae infinitae:</hi> there is but one straight and direct
passage,<note place="margin">More euill then good.</note> but there are many infinite by-waies, and
pathes: there is but one truth, answerable to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
truth, which is but one, and one alone, aboue
the Sphere of the creatures: but there are diuers and
infinite falshoods: there is but one state of a sound and
whole constitution; but diseases, and distempers are
numberlesse: to euery vertue, there are many vices op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
to euery meane, there are many extreames. If
nature were indifferent, and indifferently affected,
as well to the one, as to the other; then might wee
claime (according to the course and rule of iustice) an
equall ballance. Suppose with the Maniches, that there
were two distinct principles, one of good, another of
euill; yet both of them should be alike bounded in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and should share alike in their actions; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in time, the one would deuoure and extinguish
the other: but considering that there is onely one
fountaine, from whence whole nature proceeds; and
that the fountaine onely of good, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of euill: certainly this malignitie of nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not from her first institution, but from some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accidentall corruption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if many snares were laid to intrap vs, and
many euils, counterfait and disguised in the habite of
goodnesse,<note place="margin">Nature more inclines vnto euill, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good.</note> should assault vs; it would then stand with
the prouidence and perfection of nature, that if shee
could not vtterly abolish them, yet to frustrate their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3385:23"/>
to decline from those euils, and to make the
creatures more warie, and cautionate: but it falles out
farre otherwise, cleane contrarie; whereas being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
betweene generation, and corruption, shee should
equally partake of both, according to rule, measure, &amp;
proportion; obserue the disparitie, there is but one
way of production, one manner of birth, a framing
and fashioning in the wombe; but there are infinite
by-waies, which leade to destruction and ruine; fire,
water, sword, famine, diuers and seuerall mischances:
many moneths are required for the constitution of a
body, but in an instant it is suddenly dissolued. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that any part of man were rotted, or consumed;
this part, vnles incision be made, will vndoubtedly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the whole body: but why should not the whole
body, being greater in quantity, indued with that
actiue and soueraigne quality of heate, rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and striue to regaine this one corrupted member,
and to restore it to perfection? One man infected with
the plague, is able to inflame the whole City: why
should not the whole City rather, being perfect and
sound, recall this one infected member? One beast
tainted with the murren, destroyes the whole flocke;
and all creatures finde it a rule in their actions, that, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius
est destruere, quàm componere;</hi> it is easier to pull
downe, then to build; it is easier to deface, then to
perfect. See here, nature discouers her selfe, or at least
seemes to complaine of her owne wants: shee is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
she is corrupted; and therefore no longer to be
held as a louing mother, or as an indifferent iudge; but
to be accounted as a partiall step-dame, wholly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and enclining to corruption.</p>

contrariety in their actions? The Starres in generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the earths fruitfulnesse; each one in particular
hath his seuerall office and dutie: if vertue be added to
vertue, and their influence together concurre, it should
rather further and perfect the action; certainly some
ouer-ruling hand and prouidence stirres vp these vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3385:24"/>
and thereby intimates the reciprocal opposition,
as of the earth to the heauens, so of the heauens to the
earth; but the root of this dissention first bred, and is
still fastened in the earth, from whence proceeds the
first occasion of these tumults.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I will leaue the heauens, and come to these
lower regions; for we are fallen, we are fallen, from the
heauens to the earth,<note place="margin">The elements against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note> and heere I will take a suruey of
nature: What is it that preserues natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the same
state, wherein she consists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Philosopher will tell
you: <hi>Discors elementorum concordia:</hi> is it possible
that a well ordered, and a well gouerned state, should
onely be vpheld and maintained with banding and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
this seemes to detract from the prouidence; for
it stands with the condition of creatures to bee finite,
and to receiue bounds and limitations, as in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so in their actions, and qualities; neither can it
stand with wisedome or iustice, that creatures should
thus trespasse vpon creatures, and offend each other,
without any sufficient vmpire, or indifferent iudge to
take vp the controuersie. Shall I tell you the reason?
Man, who was principally ordained for Gods seruice,
as all other creatures for man; man (I say) breaking
his owne bounds, being <hi>nexus &amp; naturae vinculum,</hi> it
must necessarily follow, that all the rest of the creatures,
which were bound and knit together in man, should
likewise be inordinate, &amp; ouerflow their owne banks:
if the Captaine and guide first breake the ranke, no
maruell if the souldiers fall to confusion. But in the
meane time, how stands the Deity affected to this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and change? <hi>Metit vbi non semina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> hee had
neither part nor portion in mans sinne; yet like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Alchemist, hee drawes water out of the hard
rocke, he turnes this sinne to a further manifestation of
his owne glory: hee created not the elements thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3385:25"/>
but leauing them to themselues, then began
the insurrection. Now God like a cunning States-man,
so fortifies each partie and faction, and in a iust bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
weighes out their strength, that being equally
matched, the combate is so doubtfull, as it prolongs
the battell, and at length, in a time best knowne to
himselfe, hee shall no longer interpose himselfe as an
vmpire; but vnbridle them; and giue them free power
to reuenge their owne wrongs, and worke their owne
wrath, and then shall follow the dissolution of nature.
Thus one and the same cause serues as a present token
of mercy, and as a future engine of iustice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, but I should leese my selfe, I should long
wander in the vast and huge elements; let it suffice, that
none of them are perfect and pure in their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places and wombes.<note place="margin">Of compound bodies.</note> I will descend to mixt and
compound bodies: Here seemes to be the pitch't field,
the place appointed for the combate and encounter of
the elements: see how they take aduantage of the

of the best parts; as of the strongest holds: they haue

according to the periods of ages, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of complections, they haue their conquest, their

for if I should proceed in this subiect, I should onely
make a compound of that which before I haue spoken
simple: I will in these mixt bodies, select some proper
defects onely incident to them: I will not here accuse,
I will not arraigne, I will not condemne nature (with
the Paracelsian) for gathering together the cast-away-seedes
of the creatures; and exhaling them to the
wombe of an vpper region, doth there bring forth a

               <p>Secondly, speaking of things compound, giue mee
leaue to compound my argument of two reasons, not
onely in imperfect creatures,<note place="margin">The Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> but likewise in the most
perfect. You shall obserue a strange imperfection, the
wonder of reason, the astonishment of Philosophie;
behold, behold, the cruell and bloodie Antipathie of
creatures; this cannot proceed from elements, or any
temper of contrary qualities; for the elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
in their owne natiue and proper qualities, are
not so malignant and trecherous: the constitution of
a body may soone bee altered and changed, but you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3385:26"/>
shall neuer be able to separate the antipathie and hate:
all creatures seeme to bee bred of the same mother
earth, they feede on the earth, and are dissolued to the
earth: whence is the breach of their loue? how came
they seuered, and disioyned in affections? once they
were lodged, and harboured in one common Arke,
from the inundation of waters; did they there striue
for preeminencie, and fall to banding and factions?
seemes it not a great disparagement to the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of nature, that whereas all creatures were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
onely for mans vse, yet some of them should play
the tyrants amongst themselues, and feed onely vpon
blood; and like common Pyrates and robbers, seaze
vpon booties and preyes.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes I heare some punie Philosopher say, that
this antipathie in nature, is recompensed by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sympathie:<note place="margin">The Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed by a Sympathie.</note> if this were so, yet were it no sufficient

               <p>Hitherto (you will say) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue only insisted in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,<note place="margin">An obiection answered.</note>
and this supposed corruption did only appeare in
reference and relation to others: for true it is, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing chiefly intends his owne proper happinesse
and perfection: now as a meanes to obtaine this, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to ouertop others, that suppressing them, it might
exalt it selfe, though I doe not approue this obiection;
for nature should be a well gouerned corporation,
consisting of many members and branches; euery part
according to his owne kinde, should be ranked in his
seuerall order, and euery one in particular should prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
and chiefly intend the perfection and preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole, as appeares by daily experience: for
the earth will ascend, or the heauens will bow downe
and descend, rather then an emptinesse or vacuitie
should bee admitted in nature: and therefore euery
thing should containe it selfe within his own bounds,
and not endamage his neighbours: yet for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
satisfaction and contentment, I will descend to
particulars within themselues.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Are there not monsters in nature, either defectiue or
superabounding in parts, or differing from the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
kinde? The Philosophers (who fight most in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
defence to iustifie her actions) say indeede, that
monsters doe much detract from the perfection of that
particular nature, but not of nature in generall. A mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
defence, I confesse, as if the generall did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
the particular, as if the whole could subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3385:27"/>
parts; or that there could be a different condition
of the whole from the parts. But, I pray', how doe they
excuse nature in generall? Forsooth, though deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
appeares in the error, yet the varietie serues for the
ornament: then it should seeme, that the Sunne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
only of light, for want of diuersitie should bee
base and contemptible, while euery plant and weede
of the fields were highly esteemed, for the various and
delectable colours. It should seeme that nature can no
way set foorth her owne beautie, but she must bring
vgly, deformed, mis-shapen monsters vpon the stage of
this world, that so other creatures base in themselues,
yet comparatiue, in respect of others deformitie,
might seeme beautifull.</p>
               <p>Monsters are rare, and seldom appeare to vs, though
Affrica be a fruitfull mother of monsters, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
come to the seuerall kindes in nature of the two
sexes. Certainly the males are the more noble,<note place="margin">Females are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of greater heate, and of a better constitution:
but nature being more and more defectiue, brings
foorth the females in a farre greater number: whereas
in the time of mans innocencie, in the state of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the number should haue been equall.</p>
               <p>Not to insist in the sexes, I will descend to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the dumbe creatures. You shall hardly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
any tokens or signes of ioy, <hi>solus homo est risibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi>
but for sorrow and griefe,<note place="margin">The actions of the creatures be token her sorrow.</note> you shall finde very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and pregnant testimonies. There is in euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

obserue, how apt they are to complaine, in so much
that the very breathing, <hi>inspiratio &amp; exspiratio,</hi> seemes
to my eares to haue the sound and note of a groane.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3385:28"/>
Scripture doth likewise witnes as much in effect; the
creatures being subiect to vanitie, groane vnder the
burthen of sinne. Some creatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Iordane, wash thy vncleannes, thy filth and leprosie
of sinne.</p>
               <p>If the actions as fruites, betoken corruption, then I
will further proceed and search out the roote of this
corruption, which I finde to be in nature her selfe: for
euery thing containeth in it selfe the inbred seedes of
corruption, and the more perfect the creature is, the
more apt for corruption;<note place="margin">The more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, the more apt for corruption.</note> as if corruption did belong
to the perfection, in this corrupted state of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
or that nature were enuious, and would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
the one without the other. The finest wooll soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
breedes the moth; the most delicious fruite is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

                  </gap>uie. Lest
thou shouldest thinke, that outwardly the creatures
were only annoyed, and that the roote were sound
and entire, behold nature discouers her selfe, and
shewes the impostume to haue first bred in that radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
humour, which is the foundation of nature: for
as it is in trees and in plants, if any one branch or leafe
doe miscarrie, the roote is vnsound; so is it in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
workes of nature, these being corrupted, doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
argue the corruption of nature.</p>
               <p>But you will say, that all this doth onely argue a

weakenes or imperfection,<note place="margin">An obiection answered.</note> but no punishment or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in nature: for it stood in the will of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to make it more or lesse perfect, as are the seuerall
parts in respect of themselues. Now suppose that all
these imperfections were absent, and that God should
ordaine nature, better by many degrees then now she
is extant; yet still there should bee limitations and
bounds of her goodnesse; and for want of a greater
height of perfection, wee might still challenge her to
be in the state of corruption. This obiection will faile,
if the premises be duly considered; for my reasons are
grounded vpon nature, supposing the state wherein she
consists, and not in reference to any higher condition,
wherein she might haue been, first ordained by God:
and therefore for the vpshot and conclusion, I will vse
this last reason.</p>
               <p>Nature is able to bring nothing to perfection, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
speake in her owne kinde, and in the state wherein she
stands, and therefore acknowledge euen in the same
state her corruption and punishment:<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ture brings nothing to perfection.</note> for at first it
stood with the wisedome of the founder, according to
the scope and marke aimed at, and intended in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to impart vertue and strength to the creature; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
directed nature to these ends, she should of her
owne selfe attaine to those ends. But see the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
see how she failes in her purposes: Man, without
education, is like the dumbe beast, sauage and wilde:
the dumbe beasts of themselues are meerely vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
the horse must be taught to hold vp his head, to
learne his pace, and must bee trained vp for the seruice
of warre; the trees want lopping, pruning, &amp; grafting;
the sweete and the bitter Almond doe not differ in
kinde, but onely in husbandrie and vsage; plants must
be watered and digged; the earth mellowed and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
mettals purified and clensed: and by whom shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3385:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all this bee performed? if by a superiour agent, then
might it be done without disparag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment; but if a base
and inferiour should vndertake to controwle and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
nature in her actions, this were a high contempt
and indignity. Here are not second causes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the concourse and influence of their first mouers,
but nature is to bee taught and instructed by her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
to receiue her last and finall perfection from her
vassall and slaue, that ill-fauoured ape, mistrisse Arte,
forsooth, the learned gossip, which doth all things by
imitation, taking her grounds and principles of action
from nature; she must be sent for as a mid-wife to help
the deliuerie: and hence issues such numbers and
troupes of Artes, together with such infinite inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men; and among others, the Chemicall Arte,
though it deserues high commendation, being rare
and wonderfull in her operations, yet with her vaine-glory
and ostentation, shee hath greatly wronged and
prouock't nature, in so much that if nature were not
wholly cast downe and deiected, rather then she would
endure the intolerable boasting and bragging of
Mountebankes, shee would attempt the vttermost of
her power.</p>
               <p>To conclude this one poynt,<note place="margin">The summe of all the former reasons.</note> considering, first, that
nature so much aboundeth in euill; secondly, and is so
much enclined vnto euill; thirdly, considering how the
heauens stand affected to the earth; fourthly, how ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
amongst themselues; fifthly, how mixt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
one to another; sixthly, and in themselues
what defects and imperfections there are; seuenthly,
how Art serues like a cobler, or tinker, to peece vp the
walles, and to repaire the ruines of nature: I hope it wil
sufficiently appeare that she is corrupted, and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
from her first perfection, which certainly was
intended by the founder, and by all probable conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3385:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was imparted to her, in her first institution. I could
bee infinite in this point, but indeed it is not so perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
nor doth it so nearely concerne my text; I haue
already alleaged seauen arguments to this purpose;
seauen is a perfect number; as I challenge a rest on the
seauenth day, so heere I will rest in my seauenth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now in this great vprore and tumult of nature,<note place="margin">A transition to man.</note> when
heauen and earth seeme to threaten a finall destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
giue me leaue with the Marriners of <hi>Ionas</hi> ship, to
cast lots, and search out the first occasion of this euill.
Alas, alas, the lot falles vpon man: man alone of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, in regard of the freedome of his will,
and the choyce of his owne actions, being onely capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the transgression, the rest of the creatures are
wholly excluded from the offence; the punishment (I
confesse) appeares in them, but chiefly and principally
in man: I will therefore descend from the great world,
to this little world, which first set on fire, and inflamed
the whole; for I should greatly wrong my selfe, if I
should loose so much time, as to take a generall suruey
of nature, to wander in the desarts and caues of the
creatures, to search out their imperfections; I will
therefore tie my selfe to man, and by man alone the
fall &amp; corruption shall manifestly appeare. My proofes
and arguments I will dispose into three seuerall ranks:
first, for such things which seeme to bee proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to man, in regard of his constitution, whereof all
nature cannot furnish vs with the like example and
president;<note place="margin">The three parts of this Treatise.</note> and therefore wee may well suppose, that
they are the peculiar punishments of mans sinne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
I will speake of mans condition in generall, and compare man with the beast of the field; whereby it
shall appeare, that our misery is far greater then theirs,
contrary to the first intent and institution of nature,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3385:30"/>
wherein she gaue vs a greater dignitie, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
should impart a greater measure of happinesse.
Thirdly, I will insist in those particular punishments of
sinne, which are related in Scripture to bee the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the first sinne; wherein I will shew the truth,
the certainty, and I will examine them by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
and light of our naturall reason.</p>
               <p>Speaking of mans co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he consists of seuerall and different parts, which
appeares by his composition, and dissolution; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
faculties resident in seuerall vessels; the seuerall
senses tied to their seuerall organs; whereas if his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were simple, and not compounded, it should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no such variety of parts, no such diuersity of functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but shall haue a state constant and stable, homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall,
euery way like vnto it selfe. If then man be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
then assuredly nature requires the fewest
principles; as there appeares onely action or passion in
man, so more is not required in man, saue onely the
two seuerall fountaines of action, or passion; then let
me spare my selfe a needlesse and vnprofitable labour,
for the whole world did euer acknowledge in man, as
in all other creatures, matter, and forme. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lay downe this as a ground-worke or supposition,
that man consists of two parts; a body sensible, materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
corruptible; and a soule<note place="margin">Man consists of a body and soule.</note> intelligent, spirituall, and
incorruptible: for his body, I will referre him to the

but really consisting of a true body, and such a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as tends to corruption: if any man doubt of it, I
could wish that his pasport were made, that with the

to discourse, to gather one truth from another, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in it selfe the seedes of all knowledge. If any man
seeme to denie this, I will not argue or conuince him
by reason, for hee is not capable of a reasonable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
but (for his punishment) I will ranke him in the

violently carried by an instinct of nature, but hauing

let vs first flie aboue the conuexitie of the heauens,
where elements, and elementarie bodies cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.
Can you conceiue, that there should bee a vast
wildernesse, vnhabited, vnpeopled, lie naked and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or rather furnish't with heauenly and spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
according to the condition of that place, as is
this elementarie world, with bodies grosse and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall?
the Philosophers shewing the worlds perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the diuersitie of creatures; some materiall, some
spirituall, &amp;c. as likewise by the various and strange
motion of the heauens, which being simple bodies,
should haue one simple motion; and yet their motion
being not simple, not for the preseruation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3385:31"/>
and that in their owne proper places, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
other creature hath rest, peace, and contentment,
doe hence vndoubtedly conclude, that the heauens
are moued by intelligences, and in token hereof, there
are influences, qualities not materiall, the operation
whereof cannot bee preuented by application of any
other elementarie or contrary qualitie: and such is
the force of these influences, as that the Moone being
the weakest of all other planets in power, yet is able
to moue the huge Ocean, without any corporall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
or instrument. And surely the heauens can bee
no otherwise moued then by intelligences,<note place="margin">The Angels are Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> which in
effect are Angels: for in nature, no reason can bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
why they should moue, not mouing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but for others, and therefore are moued by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
or looking to them and to their outward forme,
no reason can be assigned, why they might not as well
moue from the West to the East, as from the East to
the West; and the motion it selfe is so strange and so
wonderfull, that the minde of man being an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
spirit, notwithstanding our studies, our circles,
excentric, concentric, epicicle, and the like, yet wee
cannot possibly describe the motion, and trace out
their paths, but we must be inforced to vse impossible
suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that the earth should turne vpon wheeles,
and moue with her owne weight, or that there should
be penetration of bodies, which is a farre greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie:
and therefore this strange and wonderfull
motion must needs be effected by some intelligent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Thus the schoole of the Heathen did acknowledge
as much in effect, concerning the truth and certaintie
of Angels, as our Christian faith doth oblige vs for our
beleefe.</p>
               <p>Let vs descend from heauen vnto earth: Consider
how the elements themselues doe exceede each other,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3385:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in finenesse and rarietie, and therein come neerer and
neerer the nature of spirits; insomuch that the fire and
the aire are scarse sensible, the sight not apprehending
them. Are there not motes, which cannot be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but in the Sunne-beames? and in euery dumbe
creature, is not the forme spirituall,<note place="margin">All formes are spirituall.</note> as being the more
noble part of the creature, though hidden and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
hauing both wombe and tombe in the matter, and
therefore being impotent of her selfe, wants a naturall
instinct for her guide and direction? If this forme were
not spirituall, then what penetration of bodies should
be admitted? how slowly should the actions proceed,
considering little wormes, which in themselues and in
their whole bodies are scarse sensible? What should
we thinke of their forme, they haue varietie of senses,
of motion, they haue varietie of parts, of members, of
limbes, and of ioynts? or why should all qualitie bee
immateriall, were it not because they proceed from the
forme which is immateriall; as on the contrary, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
is therefore extended and seemes to be grosse and
terrestriall, because it proceeds from the matter, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

applied for dime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sions: but of all qualities, it doth more
manifestly appeare in the obiects of our sight, as colour
and light, which are diffused in a moment, thorough
the compasse of the whole world, and finde no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their passage. Thus certainly the formes of
things are substances immateriall: but most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for mans soule which is reasonable, were it not freed
and exempted from any elementarie composition, it
could neuer iudge aright of all bodies; but according
to her temperature, thereafter should follow her cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
thereafter her appetite and inclination, so that the
freedome of mans will should suffer violence. If then
you will suppose in man, a true iudgement of things,
and a free libertie in his choice, you must conceiue the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3385:32"/>
soule as a spirit, which is the ground and foundation of
both, whereby hauing onely the diuine concourse and
assistance, she is not carried with any naturall instinct,
as a dumbe instrument, but is the roote and fountaine,
as of her faculties, so of her actions.</p>
               <p>If this soule bee spirituall, then certainly immortall,<note place="margin">The immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the soule.</note>
as being exempted &amp; freed from the opposition and
contrarietie of elementarie qualities, whichis the only
motiue and inducement to corruption: she compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
and vnderstands things immortall, some of them
being bare and dumbe instruments ordained only for
her vse and seruice, suppose the Sunne, the Moone, and
the Starres: and therefore wee cannot thinke, that she
should be of lesse perfection, as touching her time and
continuance. The desires of the soule are infinite, shee
intends nothing so much as eternitie: this is naturally
ingrafted in all of vs, and nature cannot faile in her
ends. Consider the maine infusions, which euery man
findes in himselfe: sometimes his minde, either in
dreames, or in the strong apprehension of his owne
thoughts, seemes to presage euill, and this euill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
followes. Seldome or neuer doe any great
accidents befall vs, but the minde seemes to prophecie
and foretell such euents. Consider againe the many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and apparitions, which from age to age haue bin
discouered among the dead, whereof the best authors,
the most learned and iudicious make mention. For as I
cannot excuse all superstition in this kinde; so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and simply to denie this truth, were heathenisme
and infidelitie.</p>
               <p>The course and order of the whole vniuerse requires

his prouidence in the preseruing of nature, and

which iustice, as it is most commendable in man, so is it
much more eminent in God. This iustice, in respect of
the whole world, must onely bee exercised vpon man:
for all the rest of the creatures are carried with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and streame of their nature; only man hath a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursiue
reason, whereby he may consult of his owne
actions; and being once resolued, he hath a free will for
his owne choice and election, and therfore man (aboue
all other creatures) must be accomptable for his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
And to this end, God hath giuen him this propertie,
that hauing once performed a worke, he begins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
and examine things past; that so it might serue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a sampler for amendment, or as a corosiue for
repentance. Vpon this due examination there followes
either such a ioy and contentment, as cannot arise from
a sensitiue part, nor cannot bee imparted to a dumbe
beast: or else such a terror, such a feare, such a sting of
conscience, as makes man, aboue all other creatures,
the most miserable. Now I confesse with the heathen,
that in the course of this life, Gods iustice doth not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
appeare: and rather then this iustice should
suffer the least eclipse or imputation, I will shake the
foundations of the earth, and proclaime a new heauen,
and a new earth. And in the mean time, to finde out
the infallible effects of this iustice, I will rake vp the
ashes, and in the dead embers of mans putrified and
corrupted carcase, I will extract an inuisible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
soule; which being the suruiuor, shall be liable
to the paiments of debts; and according to the sins or

               <p>Hauing spoken of the seuerall parts of his constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
now at length wee haue agreed vpon man, wee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3385:33"/>
haue laid hold on him, and apprehended the partie:
now let vs proceed in our plea, put in our bils and our
articles, and take our exceptions against him. My first
obiection is this:<note place="margin">That one part of man should be corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the other incorruptible.</note> All other creatures subsist, as long as
their forme subsists; for the matter and the forme are
both twinnes, concelued in the same instant, vnder the

continuance of being, and the like successe in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

and yet contained within the brittle vessell of his weak
flesh; as if she were no part of man, but did inhabit in
Tents, and in Tabernacles in the wildernesse, alwaies
remouing and changing her dwelling, hauing no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
mansion house to containe her.</p>
               <p>What things are coupled in nature, should necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
symbolize, and bee tied together by some band,
which should equally partake of both. Here is the flesh
and the spirit vnited; but where is that band, which
being neither flesh nor spirit, should partake of both,
and couple both; where is the league or the amitie?
Here are no intelligencers assigned to their celestiall
orbs, no Angels conuersing with Angels; but the flesh
with the spirit, corruptible with incorruptible, mortall
with immortall, liue together vnder one roofe, they
are the household seruants of one man, and are linckt
together in one person: whereas the Philosopher saith,
<hi>Corruptibile § incorruptibile differunt plusquam gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi>
Things corruptible and incorruptible, they do not
differ in number, they doe not differ in kinde; but they
seeme to belong to a diuers and a different world, the
world of eternitie, and the world of corruption: and
therefore in reason should not admit any fellowship or

league of amitie, consisting in a mutual sympathie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

the dissolution?</p>
               <p>That man should die, when the better part of man is
yet extant; that for want of the more ignoble and base
part (the vse of the bodie) the soule should not be able
to exercise her faculties, either of growth and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
or of sense and motion; but like a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
widow should be strictly tied to her thirds, only
the intellectuall part, being her owne proper dowrie,
hauing gotten no surplusage to her estate, by vertue of
her mariage. When the husband is once dead, then is
the wife let at libertie, from the law of her husband;
but the soule is excluded from any second mariage,
and cannot couple herselfe to another; she is inforced
to a widowhood, and cannot obtaine the like fredome
in her choice, which formerly she had in the time of her
virginitie. All nature, the whole world cannot affoord
the like president: and therefore acknowledge, that it
proceedes from the corruption of man, as a proper and
peculiar punishment to man.</p>
               <p>You will say, that this property makes the difference
of his nature, as differing from all other creatures; from
the Angels in regard of his flesh; from the beasts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

of his spirit: and therefore no marueile, if this be
proper and peculiar to himselfe, as being the speciall
difference of man, and not any punishment of sinne,
This obiection proceedes from an error; for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of man consists in the reasonable soule, and not
in the mortalitie or immortalitie of parts: so I will
proceede to a seconde argument.</p>

the soule concealed in shame: the eyes will not dare to
behold; chaste eares would bee offended to heare; let
not any tongue presume to speake, the vncleannesse of
mans birth; see how he crouches with his head on his
knees like a tumbler, wallowing in his owne excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
feeding vpon the impurest blood, breathing
thorough the most vncleane passages; in so much that
Christ, who came to be spit vpon, to bee whipt, to bee

neuer endure the basenesse of his conception. I speake
not of the foulnesse of mans sinne and concupiseence;

for as the sensatiue hath more noble faculties then the
vegetatiue; so hath it more parts and more offices as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for her seruice; then why should not some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and some addition bee made betweene reason
and sense? Man consists of a liuer for his nourishment,
of an heart for his vitall spirits, of a braine for his sense:
this is all, and all the beasts of the field haue as much.
But you wil answere me, that man hath (in this time of
corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) as many parts, as euer the first man is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to haue, or to bring with him from Paradise, in the
state of perfection. My answere is, that the grace, which
in the time of mans innocencie did accompanie nature,
supplied all the defects, and was sufficient of it selfe: but
man being depriued of that grace, might iustly claime
and challenge (according to the excellencie of his own
condition) something in nature, some super a bounding

soule, aboue the state of the sensatiue.</p>
               <p>You will say, that her prerogatiue consists not in the
number, but in the goodnesse and qualitie of parts:
Princes may finde entertainment in priuate mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

the strange and wonderfull operation of the creatures

their naturall workes; the knowledge whereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are directed in these actions, consists in the
phansie; hee will easily confesse, that in their inward
senses, they cannot but farre exceede man. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
that mans temper and senses, though otherwise
none of the best, yet are best applied and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for mans seruice and vse, as they are the dumbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of a reasonable soule. This is a fond &amp; an idle

giue any sufficient entertainment to so royall a spouse;
yet the weake abilitie and power would be accepted,
if the flesh did performe what it might. For if an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Ladle should intend to match with her seruant;
the greatest motiue and inducement would be, that in
stead of a husband, hee would be her slaue, she should
haue the rule and sole gouernment, and all his care
should be to giue her contentment: a very forcible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I confesse. Now let vs examine how well the
flesh hath performed this dutie and seruice.</p>
               <p>Behold in the parts of man a great opposition, and
antipathie, between the flesh and the spirit (as it were)
encountring each other.<note place="margin">The opposition betweene the flesh and the spirit.</note> Can a kingdome diuided in it
selfe proceed from nature, which intends an vniforme
order and course in the creatures? I grant there may be
contrarietie of qualities in one and the same subiect,
consisting of contrarie elements, for here the subiect
is capable of contrarietie: but in parts of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of different condition, where the one by nature is
subordinate to the other; that there should be such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
it is <hi>exemplum sine exemplo,</hi> the whole fabrick
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3385:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and course of nature cannot parallel this with a presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
that man should reflect vpon his owne actions,
should suruay, and view his owne workes, and that his
owne soule should discerne and condemne the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and practise of his owne flesh; that man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
and discontented, should say in the agonie of
his minde, <hi>I see another law in my members, rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the law of my spirit:</hi> Doubtlesse, <hi>non sic fuit ab
initio,</hi> both of them proceede from one God, both of
them are parts of one man, and therefore (as fellow
yokemen) should tend ioyntly together, to one and
the same end, the happinesse and perfection of man:
as in nature there is no contrarietie betweene the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

rather helping and furthering, then any way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
or opposing each others propertie; only in man,
in man alone consists the difference. And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it not as the first intent and institution of
nature, but as a punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of sin; God, requiting mans
disobedience, to shew the high wisedome of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
&amp; the proportion of his iustice, sets the parts
of man at enmitie with themselues, which before did

               <p>You will say, that this is but a light skirmish; some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
little disagreeing hinders not the loue, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
the affection; all this enmitie proceedes from
one ground,<note place="margin">No manner of subordination.</note> that the parts, being of a different kinde,
must likewise be carried with a different inclination.
I will therefore further insist, that in man there is not
that consent, and harmonie of parts, which is requisite
for the vnitie of a person: sometimes the soule proues
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3385:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>

take this for the ground and foundation of their truth.
Is it not yet resolued who should beare rule? or must

lies heauie on the stomacke, as she knowes the disease,
and feeles the burthen; so why should not the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
soule haue power to remoue it? Seemes it not a
great disorder in nature, that in the bodie of man there
should bee two subordinate soules; and both of them
should haue their seuerall and distinct operations, as if
they should rather constitute two seuerall creatures,
then ioyntly concurre to the vnitie of one person; the
sensatiue soule intending the workes of nature, the
reasonable soule taking only charge of such things, as
require free choice and election: could not all things
be more easily performed by one and the same faculty,
as in al other creatures? Then should there be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difficultie to cleanse the vncleane blood, to purge
the grosse melancholie, then now we finde in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
some spot or blemish from the outward skinne;
then should not the secret causes of sudden death (as it
were priuie conspiracies) suddenly assault and attempt

man, but man in his owne wisedome should timely
foresee, and preuent them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore serue fibres, muscles or tendons for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,
retaining, or expulsion of foode, if the soule
hath no power to apply them? The perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature
(especially) consists within her most secret pauilions:
shall the soule bee able to moue the thigh,<note place="margin">How the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are disposed.</note> the legge,
the arme, the whole body? and yet the least scruple of
poyson lying in the ventricle, shall she not be able to
disgorge and expell it? In other creatures (I confesse)
there is an ordinarie course of nature, as in all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
an ordinary instinct of nature: they haue a time of
rising, a period and time of setting; they can no more
order their steps, or their waies, then they can change
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or growth. But it should be otherwise
in man, who as he is Lord of his outward actions; so he
should haue the full power and command of himselfe,
and of the most inward and secret operations of his
own body: for the same reason would sufficiently serue
to direct both alike. But see, see, whole man is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and therefore neither body with soule, nor soule
with her faculties can together consist; all is in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore,
since wee forsooke him, who is the very bond of
all peace, and agreement.</p>
               <p>If neither opposition betweene both, nor want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
subiection and right gouernment seemes strange, then
I will tell you a greater wonder. The soule and the
body,<note place="margin">The soule and the bodie are strangers to each other.</note> though parts of one man, and mutually subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
together; yet are they strangers one to another,
not any way acquainted with the counsels and secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of each other. Whatsoeuer is proper and peculiar to
the soule (for her faculties, her nature, and powers) she
doth not any way impart it to the whole man, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by way of reflection: looking vpon the actions wee
iudge of the substance; and so wee might doe if wee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3385:37"/>
among strangers and heathen, though certainly
the soule cannot be ignorant of her self. Againe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is proper to the body, as forme, figure, the vse
and disposition of the inward parts, notwithstanding
that the soule first squared out the body, and fashioned
the members for her owne vse and seruice, <hi>anima fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur
sibi domicilium;</hi> yet she knowes them not, and
therefore must learne them againe by inspection, and
dissection of mans body: a cruell, bloody, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
spectacle, I confesse; yet such as must be admitted
in schooles, rather then wee should be ignorant of our
owne bodies. Thus farre as the soule and the body are
the obiects of our knowledge: now in their owne ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
see how they are estranged from each other.</p>
               <p>Parts as they cannot subsist without the whole, so
neither should they bee able to worke of themselues;
but in man you shall obserue actions, which are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to either part, to the soule and to the body, and
cannot be imparted to both. Though the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of man bee earthly, made of the earth, feeds on
the earth, and is dissolued to the earth, and therfore the
soule doth lesse discouer her selfe by her proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then doth the materiall body;<note place="margin">An extasis.</note> yet it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to Philosophie, that there is an extasis of the
soule, wherein she is carried in a trance, wholly and
only intending the intellectuall functions, while the
body lies dead like a carkasse, without breath, sense,
motion, or nourishment, onely as a pledge to assure vs
of the soules returne. And vpon her returne, hauing tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with God, or been transfigured in the mount, shee
giues the body no such intelligence or message, but
deemes it as a dumbe beast, not fit to bee acquainted
with so high mysteries; so that the whole man is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
what hath befalne the better part of himselfe.</p>
               <p>Now see how the body requites this vnkindnesse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3385:37"/>
and diseurtesie. It is naturall to euery forme, that if it be
extant,<note place="margin">Our infancie.</note> it should bee alwaies in action; especially the
more noble forme finds the greater imployment: but
obserue the difference in man; for many yeeres after his
birth, he is like an vnreasonable creature, feedes on the
pappe, and lies in the cradle, intending only the actions
of nature, and giuing no outward appearance of his
reasonable soule; in so much, that were it not for the
feature and forme of his body, you should hardly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
his kinde: whereas in all other creatures you
shall instantly discerne, in the first moment of their
birth, actions proper and peculiar to their state and
condition.</p>
               <p>But I will passe ouer our infancie, we haue forgotten
those daies, being now arriued to our full age: I will
therfore make a second instance; once within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

               <p>Lest I should be thought a theefe or a coward, thus

their rage and their furie, besides themselues: how are
they tormented, tied to the stakes, whipt with cords,
dieted with hunger, tempered with coldnes? The irons
enter into their flesh, they are vsed in the nature of wild
beasts; but their greatest miserie is, that they haue no
feeling of their owne miserie. Thinke not this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Lunatickes; the heauens haue their actions, and God

who are of a milder constitution, with whom I may
more freely conuerse, and to whom I may approch
with lesse feare; for these are innocents and ideots,<note place="margin">Ideots.</note> let
vs heare how wisely they will answere for themselues?
But I will spare them that labour, for if you can teach
them to aske meate in their hunger, drinke in their
thirst, to complain of coldnesse when it pincheth them,
here is the height and top of their learning; as yet they
are not arriued to common sense; yet commonly they
are men of sound bodies, sanguine complections, good
health, long life, nothing is wanting, but onely that in
man, you shall not finde man. A president without
patterne, a punishment onely proper and peculiar to
man; no other sensible creature, either in his birth, or
his sleepe, or in his madnesse, much lesse in the whole
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3385:38"/>
course of his life, did euer appeare without sense: who
euer saw a quick plant without sappe in the roote? But
in token, that the first sinne of man was the curiositie
of knowledge, (for the penaltie of this sinne) God hath
reserued in his owne power, the free disposing of mans
reason; that notwithstanding his reasonable soule, his
education, learning, or discipline; yet God hath not
tied himselfe to concurre with man in the action; a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
which being in the same kinde, and seeming na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and essentiall to the same kinde, God neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to the rest of his creatures.</p>
               <p>I will now alter and change my course: for hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
spoken in generall of the nature of the soule, and of
some particular persons, and states of men, vpon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
occasions; I will now speake in generall of whole

owne kinde, but only a power and capacitie to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
In the vse and exercise whereof, sometimes the
minde is distracted with varietie of her own thoughts,
and cannot intend to direct the edge of her vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but our wits are wandring and a woolgathering;
here the soule is growne impotent and weak, and hath
not the power of her selfe: and yet in the meane time,
how is she perplexed and tormented with ignorance,
possessed with an immoderate thirst of knowledge,
with a curiositie of knowledge? And on the other side,
what great difficultie and labour appeares in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of wisedome? It is gotten by long experience,
and the triall of many conclusions: all ages are not
come to that staiednes, which is requisite for the att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of wisedome. When it is gotten, when it is at the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3385:39"/>
height, then our memorie begins to faile vs, wee know
not how to keepe such a treasure: or else you shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
a sensible change in our nature; for being old, we
grow young againe, not in yeeres, but in affections;
there is no difference betweene the toyes and fond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of youth, and the forgetfulnes and dotage of age, both
are the same in effect: and here wisedome seemes like a
motheaten garment, which hath been heretofore of
some value, but now, for want of rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

serues for no further vse or imployment.</p>
               <p>Thus farre the soule in her selfe. Now let vs see
what comfort and furtherance she receiues from the
body.<note place="margin">The soule is hindred in her knowledge by the body.</note> Parts should haue the greatest reference to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as wanting each others helpe, and supporting
each other: so that it stood with the wisedome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of nature, in the beginning to fit and to square
them one for the other; so that the body in reason
should further the actions of the reasonable soule. But
it falles out otherwise, a full stomacke sends vp grosse
fumes, which intoxicate the braine: the largest and
best diet, can spare the least, and that the worst nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for the sensatiue spirits: the fattest soile yeelds
the foggiest wit; while the fruitlesse sands, the heath,
the rockes, the mountaines, seeme to make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for their barrennesse with a plentifull inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But to come to the immediate actions of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
what greater obstacle or hindrance can
be, then is the burthen and weight of the body? our
mindes distracted with senses, the senses not rightly
informing; sometimes deluding with snowes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
deceiuing with fancies; neuer apprehending
things in their true value and proportion; and when
they are best disposed, yet their bill of information
must be further examined: for we doe not receiue the
things themselues, but the <hi>species</hi> or images of things,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3385:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which being presented to our vnderstanding, most
commonly wee iudge according to our passions. But
what doe we receiue from the senses? surely sensible
obiects, and not intelligible obiects; for the senses are
onely imployed in particulars, which doe not belong
to the court or cognizance of the vnderstanding, which
onely conceaues the generals; as if the sense should
speake in an vnknowen tongue, or in a strange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
And therefore the vnderstanding must first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
and giue them a new tincture, before they can
come to his censure, hence proceeds that distinction
of schooles, <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> and <hi>intellectus patiens,</hi>
whereas all sense consists in one passion.</p>
               <p>You will say, that although the vnderstanding bee
inforced to make his owne obiects,<note place="margin">The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing makes her owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</note> yet is it donne with
the greatest facilitie, and ease, a naturall action. For the
soule out of her owne actiuitie, is able to abstract, her
owne obiects from the matter, and to giue them a like
condition to her selfe; assuredly, all the difficulty in
knowledge consists in raysing these obiects. Wherfore
serue all the rules of Logicke? why should we striue so
much for a right method? were it not that the difficulty
consists in the discouery of the truth. The Lawyer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
high commendation, if he can truly open his
cause, though hee neuer passe his iudgement. From
whence ariseth all the diuersities of mens opinions,
when as reason is the same in all men? We doe not differ
about coulors, we do not differ about sensible obiects:
onely the difference is in the discouery of a truth,
which in effect is asmuch as in raising these intelligible
obiects; for if the truth lay open and naked, all men
would easily assent vnto it. Me thinks it should stand
with right reason, that as sense hath sensible obiects; so
things themselues should present themselues to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that the minde should not busie her selfe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3385:40"/>
to make her owne obiects intelligible, but should one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passe her iudgement and censure. This is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of dumbe beasts in regard of their sense; this is the
state of the Angels, in regard of their infusion; and this
should haue bin the state and condition of man, were it
not, that man is falne from the state of his first integrity,
and happinesse, to a state of corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> From the vnderstanding let vs come to the will;
strange it is to obserue the intestine warre,<note place="margin">Our will is distracted.</note> which man
wageth with himselfe, possessed with contrary iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
insomuch that he proues a stranger to himselfe,
not knowing the resolution of his owne minde. And
thus breaking forth into contrary wils, not knowing
how himselfe stands affected, sometimes hee will,
sometimes he will not one and the same action; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the selfe same, giuing no cause of the alteration
and change of his will. Thus not guided by nature, as all
other creatures are, hee stands like a blind man, and
knowes not how to make choice of his own wayes.</p>
               <p>How vnfitly hath nature disposed of mans will;<note place="margin">How the boundlesse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of man do perplex him.</note> it
seemes that al other mans faculties are finite, contained
within very narrow bankes. The wisdom of man is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes,
and serues onely to giue him occasion to see
his owne ignorance, <hi>hoc vnum scio, me nihil scire,</hi> this
only I know, that I know nothing. The power of man
is weaknesse, all his wealth seemes to be meere begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but the desires and appetites of man are infinite, and
boundlesse. So that in his greatest abundance poore
man is discontented, and much perplexed with his
owne wants. What shall I say of man? where shall hee
seeke contentment and rest? or whom shall I accuse?
for man himselfe, I finde him thus ordained by nature.
I will therefore make my complaint against nature, she
is corrupted, and hauing no true contentment in her
selfe, she will not confesse her owne basenesse, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3385:40"/>
to conceale it and to delude man. And to this end
obserue her subtiltie, she giues man an infinite desire,
intimating that she hath an infinite treasure; but our
desires are therefore infinite, because wee receiue no
contentment at all, and so still wanting, still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For nature that first brought vs together, and made vs
importunate sutors, to haue the creatures in a plentiful
measure, hath on the other side, very cunningly set
such a difference and disparity betweene both, that we
shall neuer obtaine our request. As for example, man
desires wealth by his labour and industrie, together
with Gods blessing; wealth is purchased and gained,
this wealth is laid vp in the purse, the chest, or the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
house very safely (I confesse) but not so fitly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
for the minde is still emptie, and therfore still may
desire. If I were hungrie, and that for my sake, you
would fill another mans belly, I might pine with your
charitie.</p>
               <p>But in the meane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

nature is to be blamed; for there is a disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
both: who euer saw a bushell filled vp with
learning, or a pottle-pot stuft vp with wisedome?
Things spirituall cannot replenish materiall vessels,
neither can bodies penetrate and satisfie the desires of

but she doth further practise to set the seuerall faculties
of the soule in opposition to themselues. A good wit
neuer agrees with a good memorie, I speake not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the multiplicitie of inuentions, which thereby
might seeme to ouerpresse the memorie, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
and good in her selfe, but it ariseth from the
very constitution. A moist braine full of spirits is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for inuention; but the cold and drie temper longest
retaines the impression. Good wits cannot agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselues, but fall to banding and factions;
and the wittie professions seeme to oppose each other,
the one desiring to make the other hateful and odious,
and the other striuing to make it poore, base, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
Sometimes you shall discerne wit without
discretion; and heere that inestimable treasure of wit,
seemes to bee wholly vnprofitable, and vnseasonable,
being committed to a fooles keeping: and here nature
makes man a wittie foole, giuing him the substance
of wit, but denying the right vse and application. Thus
doe the faculties iarre among themselues; which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is as much, as if I should say, The soule did disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with it selfe; for the faculties are the soule, and the
soule is the faculties.</p>
               <p>And as it is in our selues, so likewise in others. The
wittie Poet will breake his iests on the Constable: but
here is the mischiefe, his memorie will serue him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

of the Metaphysicks. Practicall arts can neuer
be attained vnto by speculation, but must bee learned
by experience. If learning be not fitted to thy capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
suppose thy weake braine should be imployed in
the Metaphysicks, it will make thee a learned foole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
thy selfe. And generally, the best naturall wits
can hardliest endure any painfulnes in studie, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to receiue all by infusion: and lest they should
ouer boldly aduenture vpon learning, at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
they are scared away, with words of art and with
notions. If still they proceede, then much reading or
plodding duls the vnderstanding; night-watchings
and candle light, distemper the body, and dazle the
minde. On the other side, the best wits are soonest abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

ashamed of them, as eating, drinking, sleeping, yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
&amp;c. I will not speake of the most vncleane and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
parts, some things may bee conceiued, which may
not be spoken. Who euer held it any part of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation

               <p>But you will ascribe it to the strict and austere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

these actions with shame and contempt. True indeed,
of all the sects in the world, Christian religion hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
been most famous and eminent for strictnesse of
life, and mortification of flesh; which in my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as it hath formerly giuen the greatest growth to
religion; so the neglect and decay thereof, in these our
daies, will be the greatest blow to religion. But herein
I will excuse our selues: for not the Christian alone,
but the Turke and the Heathen, both say and practise
as much in effect. You will then say, that religion in
generall, agrees in this one point, as teaching all men a
maidenlike modestie, to forbeare the outragious lusts
of the flesh, and therein sets the difference betweene
man and beast, and thus along continued custome, may
at length seeme to bee nature. I cannot rest in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
but I must fasten this shame immediatly vpon
nature her selfe. Obserue then not onely in man, but
likewise in the dumbe creatures: Are not those parts
which serue for excrement, or generation, concealed
and hidden either in place and situation, or else with
feathers, with haire, or some other couering, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>Suppose I were to examine a guiltlesse innocent

man? together with a continual expectation, what
euill might befall him, were it not, that it proceedes
from a guiltinesse of conscience? How often vpon any
relation of the least mischance, do we strike our breasts,
our thighes, wring our hands, stampe on the earth, and
then suddenly looke vp to heauen, as if these outward
annoyances could not any way concerne vs, were not
the roote of this corruption within our selues? And
therefore nature seemes to punish the roote, to curse
and defie the earth, to acknowledge the guilt, together
with the iust and due vengeance of heauen.</p>
               <p>If any greater misfortune befalles vs, then we begin

cannot be without a iust ground, first presuming and
presupposing an inward and secret corruption, they
are apt to suspect themselues: whereas the foolish and

is therefore laid open and manifest, to God,
to Angels,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our selues appeares in our seruice of God.</note> to men. How falles it out, that by an instinct
of nature, in all our religious worship and seruice of
God, we first begin with the punishment of our selues?
Sacrifice (I thinke) is naturall to man, that in liew of our
hearts, and for the sparing of our own blood, we should
offer vp the blood of others. Before the Law was giuen
in Mount Sinay, there was a sacrifice: for God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
this knowledge, not onely in the Ceremoniall
law, but in nature her selfe; that both nature and law
might guide and direct vs to the sacrifice of his sonne:
so that a sacrifice is common to all nations, common
to all religions. The Heathen at this day vse in their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
the launcing of their flesh, the spilling of their
owne blood, the scourging of their bodies, appearing
naked before their Altars. The Idolaters of old time,
how cruelly they tormented themselues, offering vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with the best part of their substance, their owne
sonnes and their daughters in a bloody sacrifice? The
Iewes, how strict were they in obseruing their fasts;
how curious in their washings, putting on their haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
and ashes? The Christian in his seruice of God,
prepares himselfe with inward mortification and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ceremonies; the one serues as a potion of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse,
to purge his inward vncleannesse; the other as
a plaister or salue to couer his vlcer, as truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that inwardly and outwardly, wee are wholly
corrupted: and therefore both tend to edification.</p>
               <p>For the Angels, there are two sorts of them, either
good or bad: but we scarce heare any mention of the
good Angels, of our guardian Angels; for so Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3385:45"/>
saith, God hath giuen his Angels charge ouer vs;
and Angels are appointed as Gods messengers for our

to a meere casualtie and chaunce, rather then we
will ascribe it to them; as being guiltie to our selues,
that through our sinnes and corruptions, wee doe not
deserue mercie and compassion, but iudgement and
vengeance. Whereas on the contrary, for those euill
spirits, the firebrands and instruments of Gods wrath,
these are they which wee feare; vpon euery occasion

and generally (these bad spirits) they are the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

seeme to bee ignorant and wholly vnacquainted with
the instruments of Gods mercie; but are daily frighted
and astonied, and indeed much perplexed and endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by them, who are appointed for the execution of
his iustice: as if we did rather conuerse with them, then
with Angels of light, which doth surely argue the fall
and corruption of man.</p>

could not stand with the diuine prouidence, were it
not, that they are the particular punishments of mans

of one man, yet they should not bee acquainted with

comelinesse of parts, the gifts of the body, will not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
accompanie the gifts of the minde; but are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
from each other, and that all the actions of
the bodie either betoken 10, shame, 11, or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
12, or slauerie. Let these allegations bee duly
examined, and I doe not feare to come to a triall: for I
doe here call heauen and earth to witnesse, that these
things cannot stand with the wisedome of nature, the
goodnesse of nature; neither haue they conformitie to
the rest of the workes of nature: and therefore they
serue as an extraordinary punishment, for some offence
vndoubtedly, signifying the fall and corruption
of man. And thus much for the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

my peace with God, I will now fall to my intended
taske.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My second kinde of arguments seemes to be built
vpon these three grounds and foundations: 1. The
mercie of God doth ouerflow all his works, and all his
attributes, like oyle vpon liquours. This is plaine, for
mercie begins his actions;<note place="margin">Mercie begins Gods actions.</note> God workes vpon nothing,
therefore nothing could moue him to worke, but his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3385:49"/>
mercie. Now if all things in man did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>auour of mercy,
it were a strong presumption, that the same mercie still
discouers her selfe, in the continuance, which did first
appeare in the creation: but if otherwise you discerne
miseries and afflictions in man, acknowledge the fruits
of Gods iustice, iustice, which must necessarily presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some offence; or else could admit no difference,
nor be distinguished from wrong and oppression. Now
iustice supposing an offence, could neuer begin the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for we could not offend, when as yet we were not:
and therefore acknowledge that the fruites of Gods
iustice, together with mans transgressions, are both
twinnes, borne in one instant, or at least producing
each other, and standing in a mutuall and reciprocall
relation to each other; the offence to the guilt, the guilt
to the punishment. So that the punishment is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
in time to the production of man; first wee were
existing, before we were punished.</p>
            <p>Especially considering, that Gods intent in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was onely according to the nature of goodnesse,
(<hi>vt sit communicatina sui ipsius</hi>) to impart his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and attributes to the creatures:<note place="margin">Miseries are the fruites of iustice.</note> but when I finde
sorrowes and griefes in man, I begin to enquire, where
is the originall? for in God there is no sorrow, no
griefe, no maladies, no afflictions, no diseases, no
death: God did only desire to impart himselfe; whence
proceedes the malignitie? were it not, that some after-corruption
hath stained mans nature. The good wheate
was first sowen, then came the ill husbandman, <hi>qui su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-seminauit
zizania,</hi> who did abuse the freedome of
his owne will to his owne shame, chusing rather to die,
then to liue. And here the thistle and cockle first began
to appeare, making man, the creature of Gods mercie,
the fauourite of those times (as I may so speak), the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of Gods iustice, the subiect of Gods punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:3385:49"/>My second ground is this: If miseries incident to
our nature do befall vs in such number, and measure, as
that they do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arre exceed all our own ioyes; in so much
that our nature seemes to be ouerprest with their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and weight, and that our conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be farre
better,<note place="margin">Our miseries doe exceed all our ioyes.</note> not to bee, then to bee: then certainly the state
and condition of man is cleane altered and changed
from the first institution thereof. For it could not stand
with the act of creation, or the goodnesse of the Deity,
to make of nothing, that, which in effect is worse then
nothing: So God should descend lower then himselfe,
not perfiting, but confounding the creatures; and that
nothing, which was before the creation, should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beare comparison, but likewise be preferd before the
state of some creatures. Now indeede the thought of
mans miseries, here in the course of this life, seemed of
that moment to the ancient and heathen Philosophers,
that it was generally held and concluded among them,
for a truth, that <hi>melius est non nasci, quàm nasci;</hi> it were
better not to be borne, then to be borne: So that a wise
man might be excluded from sorrow, he would neuer
thirst after ioy; to be dead, we regard it not, but to dye,
here is the torment.</p>
            <p>For the beleeuing man and the true Christian, who
(besides the miseries of this life, which he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to be the rod of Gods wrath,<note place="margin">The miseries of a Christian man.</note> for the punishment
of sinne) is likewise perplexed with the feare and terror
of hell, where that rod shall bee turned to a serpent.
How many of them haue cursed the day of their birth?
How earnestly haue others besought their speedy disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?
Doth not Christ witnesse of that sonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that it were better for him, if he had neuer been
borne; or that a milstone were chained to his neck, and
both cast into the bottomlesse Sea? Is this a priuate and
particular case, and doth it only concerne <hi>Iudas?</hi> Is not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3385:50"/>
the number of the elect very small, while whole troupes
and infinite multitudes of reprobates (though neuer so
bold and confident of their owne righteousnesse) are
daily reiected? And in the elect people of God, what
strange agonies and conflicts appeare betweene the
flesh and the spirit? Doth not the way to heauen lie by
the gates of hell, when men with feare and trembling
must worke out their owne saluation? If the righteous
shall scarce answere one for a thousand, where shall the
vngodly and sinner appeare?</p>
            <p>My third ground is this: Certaine it is that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
were ordained for man, and for man alone the
whole earth was created. Now supposing all other
things to be directed for man,<note place="margin">Mans miseries are g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beasts.</note> the state and condition
of man (according to right reason) should farre excell
theirs, as in worth and dignitie, so in true ioy and all
manner of contentment; nature should be more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and beneficiall to man, then to the rest of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
As for example, in a house consisting of master
and seruants, if plentie, case, and contentment can bee
found vnder the roofe of that house, you will conceiue
it in the masters person, and not in the seruants: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you will suppose, a very preposterous order, that
things are not as they ought to be disposed; and that it
is some particular grieuance, for some particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
and thus it befalles man.</p>
            <p>Doe you doubt, whether the creatures were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
onely for mans vse? I will not conuince you with
reason, I could wish that you would forbeare the vse of
the creatures; doe not commit theft, defile not your
hands with blood; for in truth you haue no right vnto
them, if they were not appointed for your seruice. But
for this one time we will acquire you:<note place="margin">The beast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their skinnes serue for our clothing; their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kasses for
our foode, or inward liuing; their strength for our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3385:50"/>
some of them for our sports and delights, some
for necessitie; they haue no more strength or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dge,
then is fit for our seruice, and vse: the horse can
make choice of his foode, learnes his pace, remembers
his way; and for his strength, it serues onely as a dull
instrument, to be moued by others. But God herein
deales with other creatures, as politike and practising
states-men deale with their seruants; who desire to be
attended by such, and of such kinde; who are either
pages for age, or otherwise honest good men, who
know better how to obserue the condition of seruants,
then to prie into the secrecies and counsels of their
masters.</p>
            <p>Now suppose, that the very same miseries both for
number and qualitie, were alike incident to man and
to beast; yet mans miserie were to be reputed much
greater,<note place="margin">Their miseries are together compared.</note> in regard of his personage, his dignitie and
condition. If you strike or wrong a gentleman, the
offence is much greater, then if it were done to a
clowne or a seruant: but considering that mans body
is much more tender then theirs, of a more excellent
constitution, and therefore more sensible of wrongs;
assuredly the paine and the torment, which he suffers
in those miseries, is farre greater then theirs. A wound
in the eye doth much more torment man, then in the
hand or the foote, but most especially considering the
pride and haughtinesse of his owne minde, hauing a
truer feeling, and a stronger apprehension of his owne
wrongs, that when the smart is once past in the skinne,
or in the flesh; yet still the thorne seemes to take deepe
hold in the braine. And thus man disquiets himselfe
with his owne thoughts, that he should be thus dealt
withall, perplexed and tormented like a slaue; that it
should not bee in his power to preuent the like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
but he must lie open and naked to all dangers;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3385:51"/>
he must stand vpon his guard, yet like a disarmed and
weaponlesse man, must wholly commit himselfe to
their mercie: these very thoughts, as they come neerest
the heart, so are they a farre greater corrasiue, then the
wounds in the flesh. But I will spare my selfe all this
labour; for I will not speake much of those miseries,
which are common to both; but onely of such as are
proper and peculiar to man, and therein wee seeme to
exceed them by many degrees.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly in effect, considering that many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are incident to man, contrary to the first intent of
our creation,<note place="margin">The summe of these three grounds.</note> which was a worke onely of mercie: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the large extent of our miseries, which seeme
to ouerpoyse all the rest of our blessings, contrary to
the rule of iustice, if punishment doe not first presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an offence; and contrary to the nature of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which being nothing but happinesse, should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
impart nothing but happinesse, vnlesse our deserts
shall otherwise require: considering (I say) how many
miseries doe befall man, common to other creatures,
man, who is exempted from the ordinary ranke, and
condition of other creatures: considering againe, how
many punishments are proper and peculiar to man (as
if nature were more mercifull to other creatures then
vnto man) notwithstanding the high dignitie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of his state and condition: I hope the fall and
corruption of man, shall hereby sufficiently appeare,
euen to the blindnes and darknes of our naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
without any further reuelation of grace; mans own
reason shal discouer his fall, being no way taught or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
herein, by the light &amp; direction of Gods spirit.</p>
            <p>These are the three grounds, which seeme rather as
seuerall degrees of one and the same foundation, which
is laid vp and buried in the tombe of our miseries: and
therefore I pray' pardon me, if I be not ouer strict and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3385:51"/>
curious in my method,<note place="margin">He excuseth his method.</note> though I speake promiscuously,
and confound them together: for miserie betokens
confusion. A confused stile, and a disturbed method, is
fittest to discourse of our miserie, which cannot consist
with the right vse of our reason, or vnderstanding. In
stead of an eloquent phrase, or a learned discourse, if I
shall vse sighes, teares, sobbes and complaints, thereby
to moue your compassion, this would proue the best
lecture of miserie. And if I shall lay open your selues to
your selues, and that my tongue shall serue, as a glasse
to discouer your miserie; in stead of the foote and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of my speech, at the clause of a sentence, I pray'
vse this short eiaculation and prayer, <hi>Iesu fili Dauid
miserere nostri:</hi> According to our miserie extend thy
mercie (sweete Iesu), clothe our nakednesse, couer our
shame, heale our infirmities; for thou art our house of
defence and our castle.</p>
            <p>In the numbring of our miseries, I must here exclude
such as are especially and principally related in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for I will reserue my selfe to speake seuerally of
them in the third part. Now if I shall twice repeate any
onething, then you must conceiue that it is proper to
miserie, and to miserable men, to spend their whole
time in telling and retelling one and the same ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
For their heart is replenished with sorrow, and
out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh;
considering that my condition is the same with others,
and speaking of them, I speake of my selfe: yet here in
deede I am but a bare reporter; neither would I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
to bee a counterfeit, the more to moue your
pitie and compassion; nor doe I desire long to detaine
you with vaine and needlesse repetitions: May it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
please you, to consider the difference in handling
each miserie, and you shall likewise easily obserue the
different narration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:3385:52"/>Speaking of mans miseries, I will begin with mans
first beginning or birth. Man only (besides his naturall
birth) is conceiued in sinne, and death is the wages of
sinne;<note place="margin">The miserie of his birth.</note> sometimes the wombe prooues likewise his
tombe; and sometimes in his birth (being of a viperous
kinde) hee proues a murtherer, and causeth her death,
which first gaue him life: comming out of the wombs
prison, <hi>occisipotius quàm nati imaginem gerit,</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the image rather of a flaine and a murthered man,
then of a man newly borne, for he is borne with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of blood. And being thus borne, hee is not set at
libertie, but foorthwith carried to the place of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and execution; and as hee came, so shall hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
borne with sorrow and griefe, he shall dye with
paine and lamentation. He is carried (I confesse) not
on the hurdle, but first in the armes, then in the cradle,
it may be in a coach, sometimes in a chariot; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
at length it will be a coffin: sleeping or waking,
be the waies neuer so many, neuer so different, neuer so
crooked, yet still he is carried on his iourney; howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the winde blowes, the tide will carrie his vessell.
Our life is a kind of dying; for when it is gone, then we
are dead: the wine is in spending, when first it is broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
then wee begin to dye, when f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Alas, alas, I doe not loue that any one, with his subtilty
and tricks of Logicke, should play with my miseries;
in truth, in truth, I am more then halfe dead: for heere
is my death, my infancie is dead vnto me; my youth is
dead vnto me; the ripenesse and fulnesse of my age is
dead vnto me; that which remaines, it is the worst part
of my age, the dregges of my age, wherein I can expect
nothing, but sorrow, griefe, and vexation.</p>
            <p>Thus man at his first comming into this world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres
the penaltie of a flatute, <hi>statutum est hominibus

to returne. He is the sole pilgrime and stranger,
and all other creatures are the natiue inhabitants; hee
hath no terme of yeeres assigned him by lease, and if
hee liues out the full scope of his time, yet when hee
hath once attained old age,<note place="margin">The account of his life.</note> and then can best iudge of
the time past, as hauing had it once in possession; all
his whole life seemes like the dreame of a shadow, as
a tale that is told, as yesterday; though to others it
may seeme a long time, as all things seeme great in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
And of his age, let him cast vp his accounts,
and deduct the time of his infancie, the times of his

his sorrow and griefe; and he shall finde, that the least
part of his age hath past with any contentment.</p>
            <p>But why should I speake of the course of his life,
when seldome or neuer hee attaines to that period
which nature hath appoynted; rising by degrees,<note place="margin">The shortnes and vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his life.</note> and
falling againe by the same steps and degrees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

common and vsuall, as in plants, and in trees, so in the
dumbe beasts, if you will exempt them from mans cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
and slaughter. But for the life of man, here is the
greatest vncertaintie; we are outwardly and inwardly
euery way assaulted, and sometimes our life is dissolued
with a poysonous breath, without any thunder-bolt,
or cannon-shot: and marueile not, for wee consist of
the earth, and the earth is soone scattered and easily
dissolued with the winde. Clockes and instruments of
iron are alwaies out of square, and still want mending.
I doe much wonder, how mans body lasteth so long,
were not the same mercie and goodnesse of God in the
continuance, which did first appeare in the creation:
and yet vpon so weake a foundation, as is the life of
man, wee build vp huge towers, and conceiue great
mountaines in our imagination.</p>
            <p>Assoone as man comes into the world, he begins to
discouer his nakednesse and impotencie; he is not able
to goe, not able to speake, he can neither helpe himself,
nor desire the helpe of another: only his trade is, not to
sing,<note place="margin">His weakenes in his birth.</note> but to crie, thereby to testifie his miserable state
and condition. Whereas all other creatures are no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
brought foorth, but are likewise apparelled by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
as she giues them their foode, so likewise she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
them a liuerie; some a strong hide, others a warme
fleece; the fowles of the ayre she deckes with soft fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
wrought about with diuers colours: to the
plants and the trees she giues a rinde and beautifull
leaues. These are all apparelled by nature, and that in a
much more sumptuous manner then man; for <hi>Salomon</hi>
in all his roabes, was not to bee compared to one of the
lilies of the field.</p>
            <p>All other creatures are borne with weapons, both
offensiue, as hornes, hooffes, tuskes, clawes; or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,
as swift slight, a skill and subtiltie to hide it selfe, a

guiltinesse in vs, an innocencie in them: for howsoeuer
the dumbe creatures groane vnder the burthen of sin,
yet is it vnder the burthen of mans sinne.</p>
            <p>All other creatures are fed from aboue, God feedes
the Rauens from heauen, and nature makes their
prouision; in the first houre of their birth, they seeke
their portion of victual; without any guide or direction
they know the way to the teate, and thus they are able
to helpe themselues.<note place="margin">He wants more helpe then the beasts.</note> Only man wants a keeper, or a

for of himselfe he hath no meanes to preserue himselfe,
but would vndoubtedly perish, if the same mercie of
God, which first appeared in the wombe, did not stirre
vp pitie and compassion in our tender hearted parents,
to take the care and charge ouer vs. And thus is man, in

prouoke their appetite; yet for the most part, they haue
not the strongest bodies, the ablest constitutions, the
longest liues, or the greatest succession of issue: it is not
bread alone that nourisheth, but the vertue and power
which God imparts vnto bread. And howsoeuer God
doth ordinarily concurre with his second causes; yet
in man, in whom Gods prouidence doth most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
appeare, sometimes to the wonder and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Physitian and Naturalist, God denies his

beasts with their bleating and bellowing they sing a

to the skilfull Musitians: some of them keepe their due
times; others haue their continued notes, that al might
please with varietie: while the woods, the groues, and
the rocks, with a hollownesse of their sound, like a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
instrument, sends foorth an eccho, and seemes to
vnite their song. Only man, as being a wild and a fierce
creature, hath no certaine note or tune; his painfulnes
in learning shal recompence his delight in the hearing;
his instruments are the guts of dead creatures, a token
of his crueltie, and the remainder of his riot. With these

to be defectiue and destitute aboue all other creatures,
euen in that, which was the first end and scope of his
creation.</p>

their excessiue labour, or through their distempered
foode or waters, are subiect to surfeits: but for those
wilde beasts, which do not commit themselues to mans

all riots, so from all surfeits; notwithstanding the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and plenty of their foode, especially at some sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And here appeares our corruption, no creature so
inclined and apt for a riot; no creature so subiect to a
surfeit, and all our diseases, for the most part, arising
from a surfeit: intimating the first gluttonie and surfeit
of mankinde, in eating the forbidden fruite. Herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

            <p>As it is in their diet, so in all other actions of the

yet are they not so much inclined to their lust, as is
man. And sometimes the more impotent man, the more

All men are not delighted with sweete meates, the

Other creatures haue their senses more exquisite, for

if any one man can doe the like, it is to his paine
and his torment: some old ach, or brused sore, or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie

sorrow. You will say, that man cannot so well intend
the actions of his sense, as they, in regard of his other
imployments, being taken vp with the weightier af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of his reasonable soule. But suppose that man
should turne beast, and proue an hireling onely for the

knowledge? No certainly, the old shepheard (after

as in vs.</p>
            <p>But suppose mans temper to bee the best, then there

which serues for our kitchin, and is the well-spring
of all our diseases.</p>
            <p>The many distempers which happen to man, seeme
to shorten his age, which indeed carries not the same
proportion with the age and life of the creatures. One
and twentie yeeres passe,<note place="margin">The course of mans age.</note> when wee liue vnder the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie,
and tuition of others, not able to dispose of our
selues. Hitherto wee are in the cradle: now triple this
time, and it will amount to sixtie three yeeres, not one
of a hundred doth arriue to that age. As you walke in
the streetes, obserue the number of passengers, iudge of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3385:58"/>
their yeeres by their complections; or looke into the
Register booke of your Churches, and you shall finde
more liuing vnder the age of thirtie, then aboue. Now
from this age to sixtie three, there remaines thirtie
three yeeres; a long time, I confesse, in respect of mans
age: for the wisedome of the law, the common course
and practise of these times, doth proportion one and
twentie yeeres to three liues: before man comes to the
age of fifteene, most commonly he hath lost the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of his kinsmen and friends. And hence it
is, that euery man desires to free his lands from ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
though otherwise they are the eldest sonnes of
such men, who are vsually matched very young, and do
no way indanger their liues. If man comes vnto fortie
yeeres, then all his acquaintance is among the dead:
he scornes to conuerse with young men, to take their
counsell or aduice, whom he knew boyes without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and are still boyes, in respect of himselfe.
Whereas all other creatures doe attaine to their full
perfection of growth, and strength, long before they
attaine vnto the third part of their age; and for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their workes of nature, their breeding, the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their bodies, the continuance of their liues, you
shall finde a farre greater certaintie in them, then in the
condition of man.</p>
            <p>For the length of mans age, as some other creatures
exceed man, so man exceeds the most of the creatures;
for after the fall and corruption of man, yet still the
mercie of God hath appeared in the preseruation of
mans life,<note place="margin">The length of mans age.</note> to assure vs of that immortalitie, which wee
should haue enioyed in our integritie; and to bee the
earnest of that eternitie, which hereafter wee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
in our flesh. It stood with the power of God,
and with the honour of our creation, that creatures
should decline by degrees, hereafter as they were more
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3385:58"/>
or lesse distant from that first mould, made by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
hands of God, and his owne workmanship.
And therefore the Patriarkes, with their ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y hundred
yeeres, farre exceeded their posteritie; but at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
it should seeme that God appointed a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of yeeres for mans age, that hee might be the
more terrified from attempting of sinne, by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the frailtie of his owne life; and that God might
neuer be inforced to punish mans sinne, with the like
heauie iudgement of waters, whereby hee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the breach of his promise.</p>
            <p>Considering all the infirmities of mans nature, and
the weakenesse which seemes to bee proper and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to his condition, the life of man is farre shorter,
then is the life of the creatures: for here in this world,
by the course of Gods prouidence, there ought to bee
a lineall succession; the father should liue, and take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of his sonne, vntill his sonne should bee able
to prouide for himselfe: and herein, if you shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
man with the beasts, you shal find him farre short,
and very much defectiue.</p>
            <p>Considering againe the difficultie of many trades,
of many professions, which are necessarily required
for the vpholding of mans life, the learning whereof
takes vp the greatest part of his age;<note place="margin">The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mans age with the creatures.</note> for we haue not
our workes by a naturall instinct, like the creatures,
neither are we fit to serue, fit to learne, vntill wee come
to the age of sixteene yeeres, and then wee must stay
out our prentiship. Suppose I were to vndertake the
profession of a Scholler; almost twentie yeeres would
runne ouer, before I could learne the rudiments of
Grammar, and then not thirtie yeeres will suffice to
attaine to any perfection of Arts. We can make no
addition of our owne, wee can adde no new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vntill a longer time be expired: and therefore it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3385:59"/>
stood with the diuine goodnesse, that the father might
be able to instruct his owne sonne in Gods law; that
seeing the motion of the heauens (the reuolution
whereof cannot bee discerned within lesse then the
compasse of mans age) he might worship the power of
the Deitie: and hauing a long time of miserie, and
great varietie of accidents, his time might likewise bee
prolonged, and the occasions often renewed, for his
true repentance and sorrow; and yet in his whole
time, he should not be able to secure himself, the respite
of one houre.</p>
            <p>The age makes not for the happinesse of a creature:
for we must consider, not how long we haue liued, but
how well we haue liued: and therefore I will speake of
the delights of this life,<note place="margin">The delights of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then mans.</note> wherein the dumbe beasts
seeme farre to exceede man. For these are not to be
proportioned according to their number, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the capacitie of their nature. They haue no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
(I confesse) they haue no houses, no furniture, for
they want none, here is their greatest comfort and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.
Man only, that is the stranger and pilgrime, he
must pitch vp his tent, set vp a house, or habitation for
himselfe; the proper and natiue inhabitants, are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
prouided for by nature her selfe. It would be a
disparagement for vs to set vp our seeled houses, if our
weakenesse and tendernesse would permit vs to liue in
the open ayre, vnder the faire couering of the heauens,
bespangled with glorious starres; vpon the pauement
of the earth matted, or rather fringed with greene
blades. Whether would you iudge him that is already
satisfied with foode; or the hungrie and rauenous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant,
that still requires more and more foode, to be
the happier? Whether would yee preferre him, that
hath all the helpes of physicke, being sicke, or him that
in perfect health requires no physicke at all? and this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3385:59"/>
is the condition of dumbe beasts, in respect of man.</p>
            <p>For the pleasures and sports belonging to bruite
beasts, you see that Princes and Nobles take their
greatest pastime, in those royall games of Hawking,
and Hunting. I would gladly know,<note place="margin">The pleasures of the beasts.</note> whether the Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
receiues more delight in the sport, or the Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?
the one being an actor in the businesse, it being
more agreeable to the nature thereof; the other a bare
spectator in the game. Heere is no violence, no coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but a free and a voluntarie flight, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without resistance, without danger or perill. When
the sport is ended, then is the Hawke carried vpon the
hand, as it were in triumph, an honour well befitting
the state of a Prince: neither will she entertaine into
her seruice men of the meanest condition and place;
but such as expect other mens attendance, and take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues the highest titles of dignitie, do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
make themselues seruants and slaues to their
Hawkes. As much may be said for the Hounds, who
sometimes (besides the benefit of their sports) share in
the best part of the Venison.</p>
            <p>I would not here willingly haue you suppose, that I
were a Proctor, entertained to speake in the behalfe of
dumbe beasts: neither doe I here purpose to acquit or
excuse them from their miseries;<note place="margin">The dangers of both.</note> but onely to lessen
theirs in proportion to ours; giue me therefore leaue
further to compare them together, in such heauie acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and dangers as happen to both. First from the
elements themselues, the ouerwhelming inundations
of water; the vnresistable violence of fire; the ayre
with anoysome and infectious breath bringing a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence;
the earth not yeelding her fruites, causing a
famine; the inward diseases which are common to
both; the outward wrongs and grieuances, which they
sustaine from each other; the seruices and slaueries
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3385:60"/>
whereunto they are subiect: and lastly their slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Suppose that man, together with a dumbe beast,
should fall into any danger of waters; all the beasts of
the field, of what condition soeuer, doe naturally swim
to saue themselues:<note place="margin">Man is more subiect to the danger of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then the beasts.</note> onely man, who seemes to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disposed for it, then any other land creature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his vpright &amp; straight figure (as it were) resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the forme of a vessel, a broad and spatious breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
that so the greater quantitie of water suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, might vphold it the better, extended armes and
legges, together with the palmes of his hands, and the
soles of his feete (as it were) in stead of oares; his bones
not so massie or weightie as theirs, the rest of his bodie
being like vnto theirs: yet only man is defectiue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and must learne that by art, practise and experience,
which they haue by a naturall instinct; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
man, of all other creatures, is onely inforced to
commit himselfe to the danger of waters. But obserue
and you shall finde it in a farre greater wonder; as long
as heate continued in the body, which by all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
should eleuate and lift it vp, to preserue the body
together with life; then behold, the waues and the
deepe striue against nature, the one swallowing, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ouerwhelming mans body: but when his dead
carkasse for a few daies hath rested in the waters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be to disgorge him, lest otherwise he might taint
the sweete sauour; or desiring to make some recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for his death, that he might haue a Christian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
whom the sea thought vnworthie of life; at length
she returnes him, and sends him to the shore, when his
body is breathlesse and cold, much heauier then it was
wont; and therefore with the stockes and the stones
might well haue sunke to the bottome, and there ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
continued in a tombe of waters, were it not, that the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3385:60"/>
liuing should receiue some instructions from the dead,
and be admonished by the feare and terror of death.</p>
            <p>Hauing diued into the waters, now giue me leaue to
approch, &amp; to drie my selfe by the fire; only man, of all
other creatures,<note place="margin">Man only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the danger of fire.</note> findes vse of this element, for his foode,
and for his warmth: other creatures seeme to liue in a
temperate zoane, clothed sufficiently against the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
cold blast, and shaded sufficiently against the scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
heate of the summer. They haue their dennes and
their caues without any chimneyes or stoues; only man
stands in want of fire: and therefore if wee looke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the benefit, first let vs acknowledge the infirmity
to be proper and peculiar to vs; and especially to the
weakest of vs, to women, children, and old age: and as
we receiue the benefit, so must we stand to the danger;
sometimes the losse and consuming of all our substance
and goods; sometimes the burning of our owne flesh,
neither members nor liues are alwaies secured; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
contraries together conspire against man, the
water serues to carrie the violence of heate, and scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
our hands and our shinnes; sometimes the very
foode or sustenance of man being ouer rashly taken,
in stead of a delicious taste, burnes the tongue and the
palate. O happie other creatures, that are exempted, as
from the vse, so from the danger of fire!</p>
            <p>When I consider these accidencies of water and fire,
I must necessarily conclude, that both the deluge of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the future d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssolution by fire; both of them are
first and principally directed for man, as the fruites of
his offence, so the effects of his punishment: though
secondarily they might intend the dumbe creatures, as
they serue for mans vse and ministrie,</p>
            <p>To come to the neerer elements, which are more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
vnto vs, and wherewith wee are better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
First for the contagious ayre, no creature is so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3385:61"/>
to a generall infection and pestilence, as is man. In
this one Citie we haue buried three thousand a weeke,<note place="margin">Plagues and infections inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to man.</note>
and so for many weekes together much about that
number, when the plague hath continued within the
kingdome for many yeeres. This plague, it doth not
arise from the food or any distemper of our bodies, but
from the ayre; it is a poyson which workes vpon the
vitall spirits, and seeming to neglect other baser and
inferiour parts first sets vpon the heart, striking at the
roote of life, and suddenly in a moment it brings vs to
ruine. If the partie himselfe shall happily escape, yet
still the infection continueth, though the garment bee
worne out with vse, consumed with the moath, yet in
the bare threads the poyson will priuily lurke: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ayre cannot sufficiently pearce, the fire cannot
cleanse, mans prouidence cannot preuent; but it findes
out some lurking hole, some shelter or couering to
hide it selfe, vntill at length it bursts into vengeance,
to the wonder and astonishment of nature. Summer
and winter both serue alike to harbour such an vnkind
ghest; it will inhabit the bare walles rather then it
will be excluded; the dumbe creatures, the dogs and
the mice shall serue to scatter it; especially fruite shall
nourish it, for it was the forbidden fruite, which gaue it
the first entrance and occasion. Marueile not how mans
sinne, like an hereditarie disease, should bee together
propagated with his seede, when the breath of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils
may thus worke vpon thousands at once, vpon the
strongest and ablest bodies, to their vtter dissolution
and ruine.</p>
            <p>But plagues are rare, and seldome befall vs, they sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
either the opening of the earth; when a poysonous
and putrified breath, inclosed in the bowels of the
earth, doth finde out some vent, and infects the plants
and the fruites; or else they are caused by some strange
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3385:61"/>
coniunction or opposition of starres. For I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of Gods immediate and extraordinary actions,
these I will passe ouer with silence, and reuerence, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at his iudgements: but sure I am that God is the
God of nature, and hee can vse naturall meanes, for the
punishment of mans sinne: thus plagues are sometimes
foreseene and foretold. But to come to those infections
which are vsuall and ordinary; how many places are
there, where Physitians forbid our habitation? the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of Essex, Rumney in Kent, the Fennes of Ely, the
Marshes of Lincolne, the Woulds in the North, the
Moores in the South, the Downes in the West. These
are all vnhabitable places, and cannot agree with mans
health, as if God had not giuen the whole earth for
mans vse. They are wealthie (I confesse) if they were
healthie; the soile is rich and fat, it agrees with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all other creatures, makes them plumbe and in
good liking (man only excepted).</p>
            <p>Let vs leaue those noysome and pestilent countries,
and come we to the pleasant and healthfull foyle. Take
this one Citie, which certainly is seated as well for
health,<note place="margin">Noysome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Cities.</note> being a sandie drie ground, and as conuenient
for marchandise, in regard of this kingdome, as any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is, or can be in the world: yet in regard of commers,
their close buildings, the societies of men, for want of
fresh ayre, sometimes for the noysome trades, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the ditches and vaults; how many streetes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes,
lanes, are made inhabitable? All the Wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffes of
London, Stepney, and S. Ptooleys will testifie as much
in effect. Marueile not, that the Gentrie make choice
of the Suburbs, and begin to build in the fields, they
are wise in their owne generation; they desire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
and conueniencie of the Citie, but the ayre and
the breath of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes I am like the Doue, which flew out of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3385:62"/>
               <hi>Noas</hi> Atke: for hauing been tossed with the waters ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
scorched my wings with the fire,<note place="margin">The famine of man in respect of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> not able long to
subsist or to houer in the pestilent aire, I must search for
some resting place here vpon earth, our mother earth.
For wee are made of the earth, we are nourisht by the
earth, and wee shall be dissolued to the earth; and yet
notwithstanding, this earth, sometimes for want of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fruites, will affoord vs the fruites of a famine, as
leannesse, feeblenesse, palenesse, wannesse, &amp;c. In the
famine of the creatures, wee share with them, but they
no way partake with vs; their sorrow makes for our
sorrow, for they are directed to our vse; but whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
griefe or want is ours, is properly our owne, and no
way concernes them. If God punish the earth with a
great drought, as it causeth a barrennesse in nature; so
it argues the barrennesse of our nature, in respect of
good workes. And as the earth opens and gapes for
raine, so mans guts and bowels (like Horsleaches) shall
suck and not be satisfied, for want of due nourishment;
then the dumbe creatures want sustenance and foode,
which they testifie with their cries, and their groanes.
And the time shall succeede, when man shall finde a
want of the creatures; and notwithstanding his cryes,
and complaints, though hee could neuer be perswaded
to a religious fast, yet at length (maugre his appetite
and riotous disposition) hee shall be inforced to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence.</p>
            <p>The creatures vndoubtedly, are not so subiect to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
as is man; some of them cause a dearth amongst
vs, when God giues the labours of our hands (the fruits
of the earth) to bee deuoured of the Grashopper and
Catterpiller, as much better deseruing them, then wee
wretched &amp; sinful men: to others (as it appeares in the
Ant) God hath giuen a greater forecast &amp; prouidence,
to make her prouision in due season out of our plentie,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3385:62"/>
then man hath or can haue, notwithstanding his reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
soule.<note place="margin">The beasts not so subiect to a famine as man.</note> Some creatures there are, which feed vpon
the bare elements, or other common foode, and haue
alwaies a like plentie. Beares being hungrie will eate
earth and stones, vntill conuenient time serue, to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
themselues with better foode: the Eastridge will
deuoure Iron, and therefore she lends her feathers to
the Campe for their beautie and ornament, as being the
excrement of their weapons. Sometimes the clawes of
beasts yeelds nourishment to the stomacke, vntill the
stomack againe returne it with great thankfulnes, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the liuer, by the veynes, to the parts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
it was borrowed: As in nature there seemes a kind of
circular conuersion, the fruites of the earth doe fatten
beasts, and the dung of beasts doth fructifie the earth:
and thus it befalles some of them, in case of necessitie.</p>
            <p>Creatures there are which sleepe all winter, and are
committed to the safe custodie and protection of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
returning with the Sunnes returne, and freed from
the sorrow,<note place="margin">Their famine is ours.</note> partake onely in the ioy of his presence. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
following (as it should seeme) the course and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the heauens, doe alter and change their cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and affoording vs their companie onely in the
plentifull times, they neuer share in our wants. Many of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the hardest times, seeme to be in the best plight;
the white frost fattens the birds, and the Rabbets, while
poore man creepes to the fire, and complaines of the
weather. To conclude, if any one of them smart, and be
pined in their foode, it is man that shall taste of that
iudgement, who feeds on their flesh; their punishment
lights vpon vs, and ours no way concernes them: any
one of them will serue for our smart, the rot of sheepe,
the murraine of beasts, the tainting of fishes, and here
is our vnhappie condition.</p>
            <p>Leauing the elements, let vs come to our bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3385:63"/>
of elements. Why should man be more subiect
to diseases,<note place="margin">How man is subiect to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</note> then all other creatures? Not any part of
man without seuerall and special diseases; not any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his age wherein sicknesses and infirmities doe
not watch and attend their opportunitie, arising from
the very constitution of his body; the small poxe &amp; the
measles creepe in his cradle; the wormes, the scabbes,
and the botches attend him to schoole; in his youth,
hot agues and plurisies, like burning seas with their eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings
and flowings going and returning according to
their fits &amp; their seasons, to the wonder of nature, &amp; the
astonishment of the Physitian; in his elder yeeres, the
stone, the gowte, the strangullion; then ruptures, aches,
and coughes; at length the dead palsie, the apoplexie,
the lethargie giues him his deadly wound. Thus man
stands to be baited, while all the diseases, like so many
furies, some gnaw at his throte, others th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some dart at the kidneys, others aime at the heart;
all nature cannot supplie the like president. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
giue me leaue (though I offend much against the
rules of art) to compare man to man himselfe, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
state of man, to the picture of that man which
stands in the forefront of an Almanack; the Lion strikes
at the heart, and the back, while Cancer nips the breast
and the stomacke, Sagittarius shootes at the thighes,
Capricorne buts at the knees: and here you haue the
liuely representation of man.</p>
            <p>Euery time and season hath his proper and peculiar
diseases. In the spring time, when nature seemes to
make restitution for the cold winter, that as wee were
formerly exiled from a garden, so now a garden should
be brought vnto vs,<note place="margin">The diseases of the season.</note> (which indeed is an excellent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
and figure of mans resurrection, and his restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the lurking and hidden diseases first to appeare, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the fruites of the earth, as a principall fruite
of the earth, heere is worke and imployment for the

to draw all heate out of our bodies, and leaues them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
and weake; we are wearie and sweate with our

is busied in making her prouision, then wee desire
immoderate sleepe, as if the worke did little concerne
vs.</p>
            <p>But when we awaken, and see nature in her full beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

of old aches. See then, we cannot couer our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
with leaues, but here is the fruite of the first
fruite that euer we tasted. Autumne is the time of the
greatest mortalitie, and this proceeds especially by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of fruites, an vndoubted token and remembrance
of that first forbidden fruite. Thus is poore man alwaies
sicke with continuall fits, he begins with the spring, for
in the spring the world had his beginning; hee findes
some abatement in summer, for then hee is smothered
and choaked vp with heate; but in Autumne his fits
are renewed, vntill winter approch, which hath resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
not to old age (as some suppose, and this were
sufficient) for old age is a continuall sicknesse, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie;
but to death it selfe, consisting of barrennesse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no difference betweene the fruitfull vine, and the
vnprofitable sallow: all woods must then serue alike
for the fewell, as all the whole world shall at length
be consumed in a generall combustion.</p>
            <p>From the diseases, let vs come to the cure: and first
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3385:64"/>
for the dumbe beasts. All the beasts of the field know
what is profitable for their food,<note place="margin">The easie cure of dumbe beasts.</note> their sight, their sent,
their owne knowledge sufficiently informes them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the season and time, thereafter they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
their diet; as is most befitting their nature, you
shall finde their habitation and dwelling; if sicknesse
attach them, they seeke no further helpe, but only their
owne naturall instinct; they begin the cure with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
and abstinence, that so nature might streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
her selfe; then they seeke some physicall hearbe,
they know where it growes, they know in what dosis
to take it, and the manner of application: here is short
worke, I confesse. But come wee to man, and I feare I
shall proue tedious in my discourse. Man alone (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the diseases whereunto hee is subiect)
doth infinitly exceed theirs, both for number and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
yet wants he all those helpes, which nature hath
supplied to all other creatures in a plentifull manner:
and therefore man must intend a long course of studie,
very harsh and very difficult to supplie his defects, <hi>ars
longa est &amp; vita breuis.</hi> When I consider those large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of <hi>Galen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The difficultie in mans cure.</note> 
               <hi>Hippocrates, Auicen, &amp;c.</hi> me thinks it
would aske a mans whole life to peruse them. It were
wel, if the Physitian might be priuiledged and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
withall for his health, vntill he had finisht the course
of his studies; but commonly in the middest of them,
sicknesse preuents him; setting the nature of diseases
before his own eyes, they sease vpon his flesh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his great learning, and the strong bulwarke of
his physicke. Is it possible that all these huge and large
volumes, farre exceeding mans body in largenesse and
weight, should not bee able sufficiently to describe it,
but that euery yeere should finde out some place &amp; part
of mans body for a new incroaching disease, vnknowne
to the Ancients, and wondred at by the professors?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:3385:64"/>In prescribing their physicke, obserue how curious
they are, it appeares by their dosis, their waights, oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
dragmes, scruples, graines, as if they were able to
square out, and to proportion nature to a iust rule and
leuell, to poyse and to ballance her to the inch: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their innumerable Recipe's,<note place="margin">Our physicke not so certaine as theirs.</note> their compositions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </gap>s and infinite ingredients; whereas cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, that there are but foure first qualities, &amp; euery
one of them may be allaied by his contrary. Wherfore,
I pray', serues so great varietie? I had thought that it
had been to hide and couer the mysteries and secrets of
their art, to make it seeme wonderfull and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible;
or else to raise the price of their physicke, to
make their own wares sale-able. But shall I tell you the
reason? In truth I feare they doe but guesse at their
physicke: Philosophie, whose search is deeper in nature,
seemes ingeniously to confesse as much, when as in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creature she placeth certaine hidden and secret qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which the reason of man cannot finde out, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
not the degrees of those qualities: and therefore
euery Physitian is an empirick, his learning is gotten
by experience, and not by reason or discourse; though
otherwise Scripture can giue him this testimonie, that
the profession it selfe is very honourable, as being the
appoynted meanes vnder God, for recouering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
our health.</p>
            <p>From the Physitian let vs come to the Apothecaries:
When I see their shops so well stored and furnisht with
their painted boxes and pots, in stead of commending
the owner, or taking delight and pleasure in the shop,
I begin to pitie poore miserable and wretched man,
that should be subiect to so many diseases, and should
want so many helps for his cure, I could wish y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his pots
were only for ornament, or naked and emptie, or that
they did but onely serue for his credit, for he is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3385:65"/>
man that can liue without them. But here I can doe
no lesse,<note place="margin">Our distastfull physicke.</note> then take some notice of their physicke; most
commonly the medicines are more fearefull then the
disease it selfe, I call the sicke patient to witnesse, who
hath the triall and experience of both. As for example,
long fastings and abstinence; a whole pint of bitter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pils that cannot be swallowed, noysome distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and vnsauourie vomits, the cutting of veines, the
launcing of sores, the fearing vp of members, the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out of teeth: here are strange cures, to teach a man
crueltie; the Surgeon shall neuer be of my Iurie.</p>
            <p>In fetching this physicke (these Indian drugs) thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
doe yeerely endanger their liues, through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of the Climate, going to a new found world,
they goe indeed to another world:<note place="margin">The Indian drugges doe not agree with our bodies.</note> where (as I suppose)
that the physicall hearbe of euery countrey is most
proper and fit for the inhabitants of that countrey, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the course of Gods prouidence; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Physitians owne aphorisme, that a cure
gently performed according to naturall degrees, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
most commendable. Their hearbes doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with our constitution; yet such is our wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that sometimes with taking their physicke, wee
ouerthrow the state of our bodies; and in stead of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
we make our selues artificiall stomackes, when
our English bodies must proue the store-houses of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
drugges. There is a great distance in the Climat,
and therefore we should not rashly vndertake such a
iourney, to ioyne together things so farre separated
in nature. Sometimes againe with taking too little
physicke, we doe but onely prouoke and stirre vp those
humours, which we cannot expell: sometimes the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of one disease, is an inducement to another; lest
there should be an emptinesse or vacuitie in nature,
there must be a succession of diseases in mans body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:3385:65"/>The diseases of our bodie come to vs in poste, or on
horsebacke, but they depart from vs on foote, very lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely
and softly; and in our cures, nothing so easie as
to commit an error,<note place="margin">The errors of physicke.</note> and being once committed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so dangerous. If the bodie be scalded with the
heate of thy bloud in a feauer, and that thou desirest to
giue it some vent; take heede, for if thou doest it not, in
a iust measure, it will straight turne to a Dropsie. Is thy
stomacke ouerloaded with ill humours, and that thou
desirest a vomit? sometimes it will draw on a phrensie.
Doest thou desire to purge thy distempered bodie?
take heed of crampes and conuulsions.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all physicke, and all other meanes,
which God hath appointed for the recouerie of our
health, yet is it generally acknowledged, that there are
certaine incurable diseases.<note place="margin">Some diseases are incurable.</note> Here the Art discouers the
weakenesse of her strength, and yet doth seeme to boast
of the foresight of her skill: being able to effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
not able to rouse vp nature, she seemes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of nature, and by incurable diseases, concludes,
that the wound and corruption of nature, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength
of nature, is incurable. For if there were such a state of
mans health, as could not bee annoyed with sicknesse,
this were some recompence; but now all things seeme
to sound corruption. We iudge of the state of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
by the excrements, and when our bodies are at the
best, they must needs be defiled; since of the best nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
they make the worst excrement, and thereby
doe giue a sufficient token of their owne corruption.
What a miserable comfort is it to the sicke patient, to
heare his Apothecarie, Surgeon, or Empirick very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
to discourse in the commendation of health; to
tell of their former cures, of their soueraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines?
And yet at length forsaking their patients, to wil
them to prepare themselues, for it lies not in the power
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3385:66"/>
of Art alwaies to prescribe a remedie.</p>
            <p>From the inward diseases, let vs come to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wrongs and iniuries, which we sustaine from each
other, and these seeme to proceede for want of good
order and gouernment.<note place="margin">The good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beasts.</note> But for the absolute gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among the dumbe creatures, hee that shall well
consider the common-wealth of the Bees, how strict
they are within the territories of their owne Hiues;
how iust they are in putting those statutes in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
concerning idle persons and vagabonds, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the employment of day labourers; what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
order there appeares betweene them, how great
the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is from the inferiour to the superiour! he
will easily confesse, that the greatest temporall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of man, which consists in a good gouernment,
whereby he is secured of his person and state, is much
more eminently discerned amongst beasts, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men. I will not onely insist in the Bee, who
seemes to teach vs a platforme and president of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Monarchie: it is long since agreed and concluded
in Philosophie, that such disorder, such difference and
disagreement, such hate and enmitie, as is between man
and man, cannot bee found in the rest of the creatures,
<hi>nisi inter dispares feras,</hi> vnlesse it be in beasts of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
kinde; and in the deserts and wildernesse, where
rauenous creatures doe together inhabite. Such is the
prouidence and gouernment of nature, that they liue
as peaceably as wee doe, in our best walled fortresses
and townes: the Citie gates though shut, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
threaten as dangerous home-bred conspiracies,
as they doe secure vs of outward forraine inuasions.</p>
            <p>Howsoeuer, I would not taxe any law or kingdome
in the world, with a conniuencie and toleration of
iniustice; yet certaine it is, that as in the naturall body
of man, the parts neerest the heart are aptest for inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3385:66"/>
and in the remote parts, nature seemes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and expell all excrements and filth: so is it in the
gouernment of kingdomes,<note place="margin">The ill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongst men.</note> it is not alwaies safest to
liue neerest the heart, nor is it secure to liue in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
distance. For euery kingdome hath his skirts and
his borders, where the poore and pettie gouernours, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
out of the sight of the world, and making some
counterfeit shew of their owne greatnesse, doe so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loinc
and presse vpon the poore commons, that indeed
their life seemes to be a thraldome most intollerable:
which to a generous and braue minde, that truly values
the naturall right of his owne libertie, is a yoke vnsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable.
For to liue vnder a Monarchie, is no thraldome
but libertie; for in this corrupted state, of the creature,
there must be a gouernment, and this gouernment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth
a subiection: when this subiection is onely to
one, it admits of the least inconuenience, and therefore
is to be admitted as in nature, so likewise in reason.</p>
            <p>But I may speake it to Gods glorie, and to our owne
comfort, there is no nation vnder the Sunne, wherein
iustice hath a more free and current passage then heere
amongst vs.<note place="margin">The good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of this nation.</note> Our Commons haue their voyces and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
in making their owne lawes; matters of fact do
passe by the verdict of a Iurie; we are not acquainted
with the taxes and pillages which are vsed in other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and indeed we are wholly vnacquainted with our
owne happinesse, <hi>bonum carendo magis quàm fruendo
agnoscimus.</hi> If wee did but see the daily practice of the
Princes in Italy, and elsewhere, wee could not possibly
be vnthankfull, to the present gouernment in which we
liue, vnder the safe protection of our most gratious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
King <hi>Iames,</hi> whose raigne God long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ouer vs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now at length to speake of the seruices and slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
both of man and of beast, if the dumbe creatures
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3385:67"/>
seeme to performe any dutie or seruice to man, as man
himselfe is not freed from the like or the same seruice,<note place="margin">The seruices of man and beast.</note>
so is he tyed vnto them in a very large measure, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
their labours abundantly. As for example,
is the horse appointed for the seruice of warre, for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and carriage? there are likewise footmen and
pikemen, as well as horsemen in Campes, and both of
them aduenture alike, the horse and the rider both of
them share in the danger. Now for his hire or rewarde
in the field, hee shall haue his trappings and furniture
very rich and costly, as the goodnesse of his mettall
and courage requires: when hee returnes, his lodging
or stable roome was first built by mans labour, his food
was prepared by the haruest man, hee must haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
seruice and attendance by man; the Black Smith
must waite on his heeles; and so for the rest; there is
a plough man and carter, as well as there is a plough or
a teame; and he that lookes to receiue any profit by the
creature, must first performe his dutie and seruice to
that creature. And therefore no marueile, if he takes as
his owne fee belonging to his place, their cast-away
garments, as skinnes, wooll, feathers, and silke from the
poore worme, which he fits and prepares for himselfe,
not without great labour and industrie, which hee
weares rather as a liuerie to betoken the base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a seruant, then as a badge or a token of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
soueraigntie.</p>
            <p>Not only our seruice, our care and charge ouer them,
but generally the slauerie of man, seemes to bee much
greater then theirs. First that it is in the same kind: for
if wee were to attend Angels,<note place="margin">The seruices of man in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> or some higher powers,
assuredly our condition would be more tollerable; but
here <hi>homo homini lupus,</hi> one man proues a slaue to an
other, and must submit himselfe to the will of a tyrant.
It is not vnknowne to all trauellers, that in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3385:67"/>
there are captiues and slaues, sold in their markets,
they beare a certaine price and rate, and commonly
are valued vnder the price of a horse: see what account
and estimation man doth here make of himselfe; and
surely hee iustly deserues this punishment to fall vpon
his whole kinde, when as the Son of God was bought
and sold for a price, who was indeede the price of our
redemption. To leaue the barbarous nations, and to
draw neerer home, it is not long since the tenure of
villenage was here abolisht amongst vs (thankes to the
Clergie, for it was by their intercession); and at this day
wee haue prentises for yeeres, seruants in couenant,
which are in the nature of slaues, poore tenants must
drudge for their Landlords. And whereas it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that thou shalt not
muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the
corne, the intent of the law was, that wee should bee
mercifull to the dumbe beast, that he should take some
profit by his owne labours: but I feare wee are more
mercilesse to men. The old shepheard lame and feeble,
who watcheth all night with his flocke, and indures all
the stormes and the tempests, yet I feare he neuer tastes
any part of his fat weathers: the poore old countrie
housewife neuer sees the spending of her own crambd
Capons: and thus how vnequally and vnfitly hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
disposed of vs? some liue in their wantonnesse
and superfluitie, others in their wants and their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and in both you may discerne the corruption.</p>
            <p>Suppose the creatures were in subiection to man,
and did require no mutuall seruice from man, then
might it be said vnto man, <hi>Adeóne es ferox, quia habes
imperium in belluas:</hi> Is this the greatest point of your
glorie,<note place="margin">The wrongs which man su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines from the creatures.</note> that you are a shepheard, a swineheard, or an
heardsman? But I pray' what subiection might this be,
when all of them seeme to conspire against man? All
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3385:68"/>
against one, here is no proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iustice. Who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
able to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all dangers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the creatures? Do not
the fowles of the ayre take the first fruites of his crop?
Doe not the vermine purloyne his substance at home?
the moth abates the pride of his garments, the flye
must taste of his best dish. Doe not those house-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the Bee, the Waspe, and the Spider, threaten his
person? and if hee comes foorth, then the Beare, the
Woolfe, and the Lion, stand readie prest to set vpon
him with open violence. We cannot vse any creature
with sufficient safetie and securitie of our liues: the
Horse, though hee wants hornes, yet hee hath hoofes;
though by him wee finde some ease in our trauell, yet
we must take heede of his tripping. Me thinkes I see
a number of tennants conspiring and laying their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
together, readie to be deposed against the iust priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and customs of their Lord, or the ancient rights
of the Church (if you please) for the case is alike, it is
general and concernes them all; they are to intend their
owne publike and common good, before the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
benefit of their Parson or Lord: and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all the bruit beasts in respect of man.</p>
            <p>But lies it not in the power of the Starre chamber, to
preuent all such conspiracies and combinations of the
creatures?<note place="margin">The creatures may iustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire against man.</note> Cannot the heauens keepe all things in a
more vniforme and strict order and gouernment? No
certainly, for it stands with the course of iustice, that
since man hath forsaken his owne ranke, cast off his
maiestie, and feeding on the carcasses of creatures, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with their skinnes, and their garments, doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
put on their qualities and beastly conditions, in
so much that now in the time of darknesse, he walkes
disguised in a strange habit; no marueile if hee bee set
vpon and taken by the watch, euery one suspecting
him for some fugitiue: and as in particular he abuseth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3385:68"/>
them and himselfe in an immoderate vse of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
so in generall, all of them conspire against him,
and worke their owne malice.</p>
            <p>If any thing seemes to detract from the happinesse
of beasts, in respect of man, it is because they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
subiect to slaughter. But are men exempted from
this perill?<note place="margin">Man is subiect to slaughter as well as the beasts.</note> are there not as many snares to intrap vs,
through the malicious practice of our enemies, either
by the high way side, or in the secret and close night,
sometimes with an Italian figge, sometimes by a false
information in a legall proceeding, when our substance
drawes on our confusion, if all this faile? Yet I pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
me: were it not better in the course of our liues,
to be fed and pampered with the beast, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> others should
take care and charge over vs, and at length (before the
miseries of old age ouertake vs) to end our liues with
a thrust or a blow, when in an instant we are bereaued
of sense, of life, and of motion, then to stay and expect
natures best time and leisure, when with long lingring
and tedious diseases, we should be first wrackt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with most exquisite torments, (for assuredly
the torments of tyrants, are not so cruell, as are the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of nature, being indeede in the more sensitiue
parts) and yet after these torments, at length wee shall
not faile to receiue the sentence of execution?</p>
            <p>In regard of my profession, I would not willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in causes of bloud, rather let all penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and offenders against law, freely escape by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

to be ascribed vnto the Clergie. Yet here I can doe no

            <p>From the death of man and beast, which seemes to
be incident and common both to man and to beast,
giue me leaue to speake one word of their funerals.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3385:69"/>
When I remember how the young chickins,<note place="margin">The funerals of both.</note> though
continually fed in the chanell, without respect, should
now at length be serued vp in a siluer dish, vpon a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske
tablecloth, with much pompe and solemnitie, to
be foode for their masters; neatly handled, curiously
carued, and safely laid vp in their bowels; certainly I
commend their funerals before mans, who is wrapt in
a sheete, buried in a pit, where his carcasse corrupts, and
is made meate for the wormes. Thus behold the glorie
of the world, the mirrour of nature, man for whom the
whole fabricke was created, to whose vse and seruice
all creatures were directed, who is a little world epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized,
an abridgement of nature; man (I say) so farre
exceeding all other creatures in that high prerogatiue
of a reasonable and immortall soule, yet in regard of
the corruption of his flesh, his condition is equall, if
not inferiour to the beasts of the field. It should much
detract from the wisedome of nature, and almost imply
a contradiction in the workes of nature, if it were not a
punishment iustly inflicted on man for his sinne, that
man so farre exceeding all other creatures, should not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
in his end bee accounted and numbred
with the basest: for so saith the Wise man, <hi>I haue said to
the graue, thou art my mother, and to the worme thou
art my brother, my sister, my kinsman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, strange it is, that in the dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there should be no miserie proper and peculiar to
them, wherein we doe not share with them alike, and
partake in their misfortunes: but many ill accidents do
daily befall vs, not onely in regard of our reasonable
soule,<note place="margin">Mans miseries are either of body or mind.</note> which is proper to our selues, but likewise for our
bodies, consisting of the same elements with theirs, and
yet therein they haue neither part nor portion with vs,
and in those miseries which both sustaine alike, mans
are much greater in the same kind. And hitherto I haue
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3385:70"/>
only spoken of such things, which concerne man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in respect of his bodie, and in comparison with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures: now I will single him seuerally by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and in regard of the difference of his parts the soule
and the flesh, I cannot fitter resemble him, then to the
Vniuersitie and towne of Cambridge; for in one and
the same person, as likewise in one and the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite
of place, you shall finde two seuerall Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
two distinct Charters, different statutes, &amp; lawes,
each opposing other, each accusing other, when both
may want reformation.</p>
            <p>Now let me come to the more noble part, to speake
of the diseases of the minde: Is it not a sufficient mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,<note place="margin">The miseries of the minde.</note>
to be thus molested aboue measure, by the weaknes
and infirmities of the flesh, not any one creature being
subiect to the like afflictions, but that there should bee
sorrowes and grieuances which are proper and peculiar
to the minde, first begun in the minde, and therefore
only competent to man, and from the minde at length
bursting foorth in the bodie, either by melancholy fits,
forbearance of meate, neglect of his naturall rest, as
poysons inwardly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> break out into sores. And these
are much more dangerous then the diseases of the flesh;
insomuch that sometimes man turnes desperate, and
commits the most cruell, bloudie, and vnnatural action,
that possibly heart can imagine; his owne hands shed
his owne blood, all his parts conspire against nature, he
is the offender, and the partie offended, the Iudge, the
witnesse, the Iurie, the executioner, and the sole behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to arraigne and condemne himselfe,<note place="margin">Selfe-homicide the most vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sinne.</note> and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
bereaued both of life and of sense, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
wholly vncapable of repentance: Contrarie to all
forme of iustice, and most contrarie to all right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which abhorring and detesting blood, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
so most especially in it selfe, as hauing this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3385:70"/>
rooted and grounded in the heart, that charitie
should begin with it selfe: and as man doth not giue
himselfe life, nor cannot continue his life, so is hee not
Lord of his life, or his death, but must patiently expect a
time for his dissolution, as there was a iust time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his birth and natiuitie.</p>
            <p>The only comfort in all bodily afflictions, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the soule to the members, the patient forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and hope of amendment: but if the soule her selfe
be once distressed or distracted,<note place="margin">The flesh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the miseries of the minde.</note> it lies not in the power
of the dull and heauie flesh, to asswage her, but she will
rather increase her paine, vpbraid her, moue her to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
as the righteous <hi>Iob</hi> was strongly tempted by
his wife to curse and forsake God.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the diseases of the minde, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
that I haue alreadie proued the eternitie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
of the soule, and therfore am tied (as it were)
by promise to iustifie my former assertions, to excuse
the same soule from all sicknesses inclining to death.
See here the wonderfull prouidence of God,<note place="margin">The diseases of the minde may consist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the soule.</note> the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man by force of his owne reason, acknowledgeth
the immortalitie of the soule, as touching the life and
continuance; and by the same reason, hee likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
the sicknesses and diseases of the soule,
<hi>morbi animi, languores animi,</hi> nothing is so commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
triuiall among the heathen Philosopher; as if I should
say in effect, that nature discernes a second death, a
death of sinne, though not a second birth, a generation
to righteousnesse; to the one, nature is inclined, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fitly disposed, and therefore sets it before her owne
eyes; in the other, nature is defectiue, and no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
man, and therefore as blindfold, she cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it; our inward corruption leades vs to sinne, only
sanctifying grace recalles vs from sinne: man here rests
vpon the face of the earth, heauen is aboue, hell is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3385:71"/>
set vp a ladder, and he shall hardly climbe; giue
him wings, it will not auaile him; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> but open a pit,
and he shall fall with great ease, though hee finde little
ease in his fall.</p>
            <p>In discouering the diseases of the minde, I will tell
you a greater miserie: Suppose that any one man should
turne franticke in a hot burning feauer, and should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
himselfe,<note place="margin">The diseases of the minde are not easily discouered.</note> that his violent and vnnaturall heate,
did only proceed from his own strength of nature; then
he begins to buffet his keepers, and will not lie still in
his bed; here is a double cause of griefe, not so much
for his sicknes, as for his error and impatiencie. Thus it
befals many, that are sicke in their minde, who glorie
and boast in their vices, making their own shame, their
commendation, either supposing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>others to bee like
vnto them, and sanctitie to consist only in the outward
appearance; or else condemning all others, they will
maintaine their own practice, <hi>Populus me sibilet, at mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi
plaudo:</hi> I care not what the poore people say of me,
(quoth the Vsurer) my substance shall vphold me, when
they goe a begging. The adulterous man pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with vncleannesse, and begins to doubt, whether
a naturall act can be a sinne against nature. The glutton
will make strong arguments in defence of his riot:
Wherefore should nature supplie such plentifull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
if he might not take it in abundance. If he cannot
wholly excuse himselfe, yet he will lessen his sinne, <hi>nihil
non mentitur iniquitas sibi.</hi> Whereas vertue is placed
betweene the extreames, vices doe now cluster toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in such multitudes and throngs, that vertue is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prest to death, or wholly excluded; vertue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
appearing, vices sit in the throne, and vsurpe the
chaire of estate.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie, vertue is sometimes reputed for
vice, and so loseth a great part of her happinesse, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3385:71"/>
consists in due esteeme and reputation, besides her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue
power, to draw all others to the imitation of
her selfe.<note place="margin">Vertue is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reputed for vice.</note> The most reuerend Fathers of the Church
haue been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>axed with ambition, by the rude and base
multitude; the most strict, mortified and seuere men,
haue been charged with a deepe hypocrisie and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation;
the most magnificent and bountifull, with
popularitie and wastfulnes; the most vpright and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
in iustice, with vaine glorie and pride. Herein as I
doe excuse the innocencie of one, so I doe condemne
the corruption of many, they looking thorough pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
glasses, their own hearts being defiled, cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iudge of the colours.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we seeme to doubt of the diseases: now at
length if we conclude in generall that vertue is vertue,
that sinne is sinne, and vice is vice; then here is a second
miserie,<note place="margin">No man will confesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vicious.</note> that whereas all bodily diseases doe suddenly
discouer themselues by their symptomes, and signes,
and inforce the sick patient to confesse his owne griefe;
onely the diseases of the minde (as are the inward
thoughts of the heart) they are secret, they haue learned
the language of equiuocation, they walke disguised,
and will neuer acknowledge themselues to bee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
for that euill spirit, which hath taken away
shame in the sinne, hath put a shame in the confession of
sinne. The proud man feares nothing so much, as left he
should abase himselfe with too much humilitie; charge
him with pride, and hee will make bitter inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; then he begins to apologize for himselfe, how
curteous and kinde he is in his entertainment, how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable;
thus still he deceiueth himselfe, for therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
his pride. And so for al others the diseases of the
mind, they are not open assaults, but priuie conspiracies,
and therefore are secret, such as will endure the wrack,
before they will discouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, or their own ends.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3385:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If the diseases once appeare and are made manifest,
sometimes there falles out a pitifull and a lamentable
accident. I haue seene many vertues resident in one
heart,<note place="margin">Many vertues are spoyled with one vice.</note> like many Iewels, all contained in one casket, and
yet all of them tainted, deiected and cleane cast downe
with one vice. An excellent wit, accompanied with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and faire conditions, attended on with comelinesse
and beautie of members; yet through a tractable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is easily led away with ill companie, and all his
good parts are ouerwhelmed with a deluge of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse.
The braue courage and resolution, which
leaues nothing vnattempted that may tend to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and honour of his countrie; yet sometimes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
set on fire, and all his good qualities are burnt
and consumed with the furie of his own lust. The great
Clerke with his night-watchings and studies, pining
himselfe, not vnlike his owne taper, where the head wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
the whole body, in lightning others, he consumes
himselfe, who indeed doth best deserue both of Church
and of State; laying the foundations of truth and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the Church, and building vp the walles of ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and obedience in the State; yet sometimes with a
fond affectation of singularitie, he makes himselfe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
Not to speake of any single encounter of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to vice, many vertues knit and combined together,
may be foyled, deiected, and cleane cast downe with
one vice: sometimes they are choked vp with glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
incombred with couetousnesse, grow rustie and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
with sloth swolne and puft vp with pride, cancard
with enuie, stretched vpon the racke of ambition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared
with the hooke of blinde fancie, and selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
opinion; if but a sparke of choller or furie fall
on the stubble, it will inflame all: and thus one flye
serues to infect a whole pot of sweete oyntment.</p>
            <p>For the seuerall diseases of the minde, compare them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3385:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the sicknesses of the body: Pride seemes to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
swelling, like a dropsie, which with wind, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or ill humours, puffes vp the flesh; for good blood,
which serues for our strength, and our nourishment,
will containe it selfe within his owne bounds.<note place="margin">The diseases of the minde are compared to the diseases of the body.</note> Wrath
is like a plurisie, when the heart and the lites are all on a
fire, nothing can quench it, nothing can asswage it, but
the effusion of blood; then wee begin to be mercilesse
and cruell, and if the Sunne goe downe in our wrath,
then is our case desperate; the criticall houre is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
for if it will endure the light, it will neuer flie in
the darknesse. Lust is like a burning feuer, which with
shaking fits, puts man into diuers inordinate passions,
and giues him the shape of a beast; for beasts doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
desire the propagation of their owne kinde, and
in their kinde the eternising of themselues: but man
should looke to the immortality of his soule, the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of his flesh; which together with Gods law, his
owne conscience, and the vncleannesse of sinne, should
serue to bridle his lust. Enuie is as a corrosiue, or as a
worme bred in the spleene, which consumeth it selfe, in
maligning others; it feedeth not on the best, but on
the worst things in nature, and so at length bursteth it
selfe with his own poyson. Sloth seemes as a lethargie,
which brings man to a dead sleepe; it buries him vp
quicke and aliue, it consists onely of earth, stands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable,
without any sparke of fire; here is the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the flesh, without the agilitie of the spirit; here
is a carcasse of man, without any vse of his limbes or
his members.</p>
            <p>Suppose there were some innocent men not tainted
with these vices; then must you conceiue that I do not
speake of the persons, but of the nature in generall: for
I will not dispute how powerfull in the heart of man,<note place="margin">All men incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vice.</note> is
the working of Gods spirit; but sure it is, that such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3385:73"/>
there are, some in some persons, and al in the whole
kinde; for otherwise we could not haue knowne them,
wee could not haue discouered them: the suspicious
minde of man could not haue raised such slanderous
and false accusations against himselfe, without some
ground-worke of truth. These are no exotick or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
drugges, but weedes growing in our owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
issuing from the corrupted roote of our nature:
sometimes in one man you shall obserue them in full
number and plentie, the mysterie of iniquitie shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the vaile of our flesh; and in the most sanctified
man, you shall discerne an inclination to sinne.</p>
            <p>If there were no other punishment of vice, but vice
it selfe, this were sufficient; for nature hath imprinted
in euery man a hate and detestation of sinne: but God
in his iustice,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vice.</note> as he hath framed man of a soule and of a
bodie, and both of them doe mutually receiue together
their portion of ioy, or of sorrow; so by an especiall
ordinance God hath decreed, that the vices of the one,
should burst foorth to the miseries of the other. The
young drunkard shall in time lament, the dropsie and
palsie to preuent his age; surfeits shall follow riots, the
gowte shall ouertake idlenesse: the lustfull gallant shall
in time perceiue, that a French disease hath disfigured
his beautie, and weakened his bones. Euery disease of
the minde hath a proportionable disease of the bodie:
if thou regardest not the staines in the soule, yet thou
shalt finde the smart in thy flesh, and therefore in both
acknowledge the corruption of thy nature.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the punishment of sinne, and the
vncleannesse of sinne, yet I will spare my selfe this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
to speake of mans seuerall vices. For howsoeuer
they are generally acknowledged, as the diseases of the
minde, seeing that mans owne reason, and his naturall
instinct, will therein testifie against himselfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3385:73"/>
they should be the greatest torments to nature:<note place="margin">All wil not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the miseri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of sin.</note> for
corrupted nature cannot sleep securely, but for her own
punishment discernes her owne corruption. Yet some
there are, who delight in vncleannesse, like swine, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in the mire; and here is a miserie of all miseries
the greatest, that I should now at length be inforced, to
make a difference betweene the disease and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
I will therefore passe ouer all the diseases of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind,
the whole number and rable of vices, which are the
strongest, the most forcible and pregnant arguments to
proue our inbred corruption. For as it is in trees and in
plants, so likewise in man, if any one leafe doe miscarry,
assuredly the roote is vnsound; the least vice argues
nature corrupted, but I will generally tye my selfe to
those qualities which are common to all, wherein there
is no appearance of delight, and therein shall appeare
our wretched condition.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased God for the continuall memorie of
mans first offence, still to permit in man, an inordinate
desire of knowledge, notwithstanding his naturall ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.<note place="margin">The torture of ignorance in the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note>
The first thing which the states-man requires,
not without his great labour, his charge and his perill,
is to haue iust notice and true intelligence; the vulgar
people runne wandring after newes, they will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to speake; though they forfeit their long eares,
they will abuse their licentious tongues: the young
Student will make tapers of his owne m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrow, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his oyle spend his own flesh, and pine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his night-labours, to prie into the secrecies
and mysteries of nature. Thus is the vnderstanding
perplexed and tormented with his owne error; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
to a generous and braue minde, the bondage of
Aegypt is not so intollerable, as is the captiuitie of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
Who can patiently endure, that the soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quick sighted and piercing, for want of perspectiue
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3385:74"/>
glasses, should be imprisoned within the bounds of our
sense, mewed vp in a darke dungeon of blindnesse; here
is the torture of error: but if once we escape, if once we
approch to the light, then followes the curiositie of
knowledge, wee are dazled with too much light; and
being not able to behold the Sunne, still wee fasten our
eyes, till at length the spirits are dissolued, and wee fall
againe into darknesse.</p>
            <p>From the error in the vnderstanding, let vs come to
the will in the actions. Strange it is, that there should
be no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity in man,<note place="margin">The torture of expectation in the will.</note> the vnderstanding or thoughts
doe not alwaies accompanie the speech, or the gesture.
The will most commonly ouertakes the actions, and
then are we tortured with long lingring hope, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;
we know not how to proceed by degrees, as
nature prescribes vs a rule in all her actions: but wee
must haue our leaps and our skippings, and cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
an equalitie in our proceedings. The young heire
will not endure to stay the respite and leisure of others,
for his inheritance, but he will sell his state in reuersion.
The Student no sooner looks on the title, but presently
turnes to the Index: wee seeme like posts in our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and expect a like speedie passage for our sight
and our flight. Thus in attaining perfection, the minde
is stretched out vpon the rack of expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the heate of our desire is abated, before things
come to the ripenesse. As if in the spring wee should
long for the fruites of the haruest, when in the summer
season, either wee forget our owne longing, or hauing
tasted the fruites, the sweetnesse seemes to bee alreadie
past, and spent in the expectation.</p>
            <p>Suppose that the vnderstanding either not possest
with error, or not hastening to be resolued, should not
torment it selfe with expectation; nor the will should
be disquieted by prolonging her hopes, but that the

one were enlightened with true wisdome,<note place="margin">The preuision of euill.</note> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
setled with constant and quiet affections; then
behold the foresight and knowledge of such euils, as
may daily befall vs, strikes vs with terrour and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Haue I escaped one danger? I confesse mine own
merits, I acknowledge thy mercy sweet Iesu; what
hath thy wisedome reserued in the second place to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
me?</p>
            <p>Me thinkes, I see the state and condition of euery
man,<note place="margin">That we stand in danger of many euils.</note> liuely set forth in the first Chapter of <hi>Iob:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,

of the world, it still serues to bring vs some heauie

our kindred, our substance, our seruants: all are subiect
to shipwracke, euery thing falles to decay; and must be
repaired, not with restitution, but with patience and

The very thought and feare of many euils doe
perplexe the mind as much in effect, as doth the sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

immediately touch the reasonable soule, and both of
them are alike apprehended in the vnderstanding; and

where is thy substance? Suppose thy honour or wealth
should encrease, yet thy life (which is the foundation
to support all the rest, whereby thou art made capable

thou leesest a day of thine age; and in euery moment,
thou standest in feare of a sudden death: <hi>O mors, quàm

to him that reposeth trust in his owne wealth?</p>
            <p>If man were sufficiently prepared to die, and that he
did not respect the shortnesse of his owne daies, in
hope of a better world to succeed;<note place="margin">The Good of others depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon our life.</note> yet the very
thought and commiseration of others (whose standing
or falling, depends vpon his life or his death) would
greatly perplexe him. The poore husband sitting at
meate, accompanied with his louing and beautifull
wife, (who indeed is the ornament of his table, and like
a fruitfull vine vpon the walles of his house, together
with all his hopefull children, like Oliue branches
round about his table) in the middest of his mirth and
feasting, begins to consider, what if God should sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
take me away, as the least crumme heere is able
to choake me? what should become of my fatherlesse
children? who should take thought of my desolate
wife? Alas poore widow; alas poore orphants! I haue
heere brought you into a miserable world; and if I
should now forsake you, better it were that the same
earth should together intumbe vs. Men are deceitfull,
kindred are negligent, friends are forgetfull; I know
not to whose custodie and charge I might safely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you. My state is very vnsetled, my Testament not
made, for I know not how God may encrease my
charge, or daily alter my state; I know not whether a
posthumous child may succeed me: alas poore widow,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3385:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alas poore orphants! to God I commit my soule, to the
earth of his sanctuarie, I commit mine owne body; and
for the remainder of my flesh, part of my selfe, my
deare wife, together with the fruits of my loynes, my
sonnes and my daughters, as branches budding from a
decayed root, I leaue you to Gods safe custodie and
protection. Hee that brought vs together, coupled
vs in marriage, and shall then separate vs by my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
death, bee an husband to my desolate and
forsaken wife: he that gaue me my children, and then
shall take me from them, be a father to the fatherlesse.
Heere indeed is ioy to the Christian man, but a cold
comfort to the naturall man, whose heart is full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust

            <p>I know not how other men may stand affected to
death; but in truth this very thought doth more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe
me,<note place="margin">The feare of hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> then death it selfe (which thought I should
reserue as my daily meditation, vpon my first approch
into my naked bed) poore wretched man that I am!
when at length, without strength, without reason or
sense, hauing no power of my selfe, no vse of my limbs
or my members, when I shall lie in the pangs and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of death; when my friends and acquaintance shall
leaue me, my little substance forsake mee; when mine
owne flesh shall be spent and consumed, and nothing
shall remaine but skinne and the bones; when euery
part is tortured with griefe, the soft bed seemes hard to
my wearisome limbes; when mine eyes grow heauie,
my breath noysome, my heart faint; then behold I shall
enter a combate (an impotent souldier I confesse) and
yet not a single combate; but here shall stand the vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and multitude of my sinnes, together with an
exact remembrance, and the ripping vp of the whole
course of my life, there the palenesse of death, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of my future abode and habitation; then the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3385:76"/>
feare of Gods iudgements shall terrifie me; the thought

               </gap>amaze mee, to see my
selfe thus forsaken and destitute. And notwithstanding
my naturall inclination and desire of life, yet to be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
and carried away with the streame of the time; no
respite or leisure shall be allowed me; my houre-glasse
is runne, and of all my liues labour and trauell I shall
receiue no portion, onely my sinne shall accompanie
me, and shall attend mee to Iudgement; what shall it
profit me to win the whole world, if I lose mine owne
soule? or who shall deliuer me from this body of sin?
Of whom should I expect comfort and succour, but of
thee (O Lord) thou that died'st for my sinnes, and rose
againe for my iustification? Iesu thou sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi>
Iesu thou sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Iesu thou sonne of God;
thou Lambe of God that takest away the sinnes of the
world, haue mercy vpon me; for thou art my God, my
Sauiour, my Iudge in whom I doe trust; thou art my
Aduocate with the Father, not to pleade my right, but
in thy pleading to purchase my right; for thou art the
propitiation for my sinnes.</p>
            <p>If there were any ioy or contentment here in this life,
the dumbe creatures,<note place="margin">The creatures looke onely to the present.</note> who onely looke to the present,
should receiue a farre greater measure and portion
then man. Who hauing a presaging minde, and well
considering that sorrowes shall ouertake the greatest
mirth, <hi>extrema gaudij luctus occupat:</hi> setting before
his owne eyes the frailty, shortnesse, and vncertainty of
his life; and that in death his honour, his wealth, and
all his delights must forsake him, torments himselfe
with thought and expectation hereof, before the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be past, or the blow strucken: like poore priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who are more then halfe dead, before the Iudges
approch. And hitherto hath appeared our torments
consisting onely in the foresight, the fearfulnesse and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3385:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preuention of euill: now in the present sustaining ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I shall not need to speake of the torture.</p>
            <p>It may seeme to make for natures perfection,<note place="margin">Man reflects vpon his owne actions.</note> that a
man knowes not how to forget; the more hee striues
to forget, the faster it stickes in the braine; the more he
desires to blot out, it makes the greater impression;
like the bird which is insnared with the lime-twigges,
the more it struggles, the surer it is held. And this truly
I doe ascribe to the infinite mercy of God: for seeing
man is by condition sinfull; therefore according to the
condition of his nature, hee should suruay and view
his owne actions, both for his repentance, and for his
amendment. And being not able to forget, hee might
much better conceiue, that there is no forgetfulnesse
with God; and therefore still hee stands accountable,
he is not discharged, nor cannot procure his <hi>quietus est,</hi>
out of Gods Exchequer; and therefore must alwaies
be ready to giue an account of his stewardship.</p>
            <p>From this tenacitie of memorie,<note place="margin">The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of euil.</note> together with his
discoursiue reason, proceeds such a sorrow, that still he
thinkes hee is tortured; hee cannot endure to see the
place of his torment, hee hates the instruments, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their first occasion; and his memory serues
him much better for sorrow, then for any other subiect
of what nature soeuer. The scholler when he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
all his lessons, together with his play-daies, and
sports at schoole, yet still hee remembers the least cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
as the vessell longest retaines an ill sauour; so
you shall not easily release the mind of sorrow, though
the torture be past.</p>
            <p>It should seeme, that the soule being eternall in her
selfe,<note place="margin">The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> desires to make all things eternall, or at least to
prolong their continuance; and being naturally more
enclined vnto sorrow then vnto ioy, according to her
iust merits and deserts, being therein conuinced by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3385:77"/>
the euident proofe of her owne conscience, shee laies
vp heere for her selfe, a treasure of sorrow, as willingly
vndertaking a state of mortification and penance, that
seeing and feeling the heauie rod of Gods anger, she
might safely and securely escape the seething pot of
his wrath.</p>
            <p>Thus our daily calamities seeme to haue the nature
of serpents,<note place="margin">Calamities are like Serpents.</note> whose poyson consists in the fore parts, and
in the hinder parts they spit out poyson before they
can creepe; and this appeares by our fearfulnesse
and expectation of euill: they carrie poyson in their
taile and leaue it behind them; and this appeares by
the strong apprehension of the sorrow past, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
mans griefe, when the griefe is declining. In so
much that I haue knowne diuers suddenly to faint, and
to be much perplexed, calling to minde those dangers,
which they haue already safely and securely escaped,
and this is as proper and peculiar to man, as is his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soule.</p>
            <p>From the powers and faculties of mans minde,<note place="margin">His passions tend to his sorrow.</note> I will
come to his passions; doe not all these tend to his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
Loue is accompanied with ielousies, suspitions,
and hate; hope breeds enuie, feares and vexations; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
delight leaues griefe and remorse behinde it. If a
tragedie were made of all the seuerall passions of man,
which indeed are like so many factions or furies in the
State; all banding and trouping, hauing both their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites
and their opposites; assuredly it would proue
the most cruell and bloodie tragedie that euer past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
tyrants, especially considering, that they are the
houshold seruants of man: and in a priuat family (much
more in one person) there should bee the most perfect
and best Monarchicall gouernment.</p>
            <p>Not to speake, how easily man is moued to these
passions, or how these passions stand in opposition to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3385:77"/>
each other: how they doe degenerate betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
looke to the fruites and effects of each passion,<note place="margin">How the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</note>
and you shall easily discerne the torment. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
immoderate loue alwaies begets the greatest
neglect and contempt; and being once prouoked, it
turnes to the deadliest hate. As out of the most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
hearbs you may extract the worst poyson: so in
loue, if the spirits begin once to euaporate, and the fire
decline by degrees, there will follow such a coldnesse,
such a petrification, as that the immoderate loue will
turne to immoderate hate. And herein I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the wonderfull workes of Gods prouidence; for
seeing that this totall and excessiue loue, with all our
heart, with all our mind, with all our soule, is only due
vnto God, <hi>fecisticor nostrum (domine) propter te, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietum
est cor nostrum, donec veniat ad te:</hi> if therfore
man shall diuert the course, turne the streame of his
loue, and wholly surrender it vnto the creature; then
hath God ordained, that such loue being vniustly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
should be iustly recompensed with hate.</p>
            <p>I shall not heere need to insist in the variety of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
take any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seuerally by it selfe: Doth not
choller exceedingly disquiet man, shortens his dayes,<note place="margin">How euery passion tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it selfe.</note>
occasioneth many diseases, and sometimes prouokes
man to attempt such a rash and headie action, as that in
the whole course of his life following, he shall neuer
be able to make any due recompence or satisfaction?
Take the melancholie man, do not his owne thoughts,
dreames and fantasies exceedingly torment him? can
he containe his owne imaginations? but as if wee had
not sufficient outward cause of sorrow, he frames mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to himselfe, and these proue fearfull and horrid;
in so much, that his haire stands vpright, and a cold
sweat possesseth his limbes; when no outward danger
appeares, then he is frighted with his owne thoughts;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3385:78"/>
hee sees armies fighting together, and thinkes hee is
haunted with spirits, and then hee cries out for helpe;
we are willing &amp; ready to affoord it, but we know not
where to apply it, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> disease consists in the phantasie.
Good counsell is the best helpe, but alas he is vncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of counsell! he complaines that his head is all made
of glasse, that hee feeles his heart now melting away
like waxe, that mice are now eating and consuming his
bowels. Not much vnlike the simple pure sectaries of
our age, who in the point of the Eucharist, beleeue
things to be, because they beleeue them: <hi>Crede quod
est, &amp; est; crede quod habes, &amp; habes:</hi> the body is there
truly and really present, because they apprehend it so
by faith. O the wonderfull power of their faith! O the
excellent curiosity of their wits, which hath almost
brought them to a fit of a phrensie!.</p>
            <p>And it is the more to bee lamented, that the best
wits should bee most subiect to these fits; and in the
most noble and deepest vnderstandings, you shall most
easily discerne some tokens and signes of melancholie.
But you will say, that these are therefore the lesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they consist in the phansie: nay rather much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Melancholie fits.</note>
for it is not the flesh, but the mind which is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of griefe and of sorrow; the mind conceiuing them
as true, shee is alike affected therewith, as if they were
true indeed. For all contentment consists in the minde,
and according to the apprehension, thereafter followes
the contentment: but the iudgement, together with
the dignitie of the reasonable soule, seemes to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
disparaged; as boasting of light, and yet
afraid of her shadow. So that if with much labour, and
good persuasion, you shall recall this wandering
man; it is to be feared, that for euer he will bee ashamed
of himselfe to thinke of his errour; and will hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in sobriety, hauing laid himselfe open with his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3385:78"/>
madnesse and follie.</p>
            <p>Not in himselfe alone shall man finde the fruites of
these turbulent passions; but being a sociable creature,
you shal obserue how they daily burst forth in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and conuersation among men.<note place="margin">How passions are, in respect of others.</note> If two cholericke
men should conuerse together, you might thinke that
fire and brimstone consuming all others, would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
at length deuoure themselues. Suppose that the
cholericke and melancholie should enter a league, you
might as well conceiue that the two extreame ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the fire and the earth, should moue together in
one sphere. The melancholie with the sanguine can
haue no more affinity betweene themselues, then dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
with mourning, or feasting with fasting. If me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
bee coupled with melancholy, assuredly at
length there will follow a <hi>gangraena,</hi> they will putrifie
with sorrow and discontentment. From this variety
of temper and passions, you would wonder at the great
hate and enmity betweene men; sometimes betweene
Nations. The Spanish grauity and staiednesse, seemes to
neglect and contemne the French le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
the fine and wittie Italian, cannot endure the
dulnesse &amp; homelinesse of the Dutch Nation: somtimes
naturall affection cannot asswage these passions. From
hence ariseth the disagreement and iarres between the
old father, &amp; the young Gallant his sonne; for there are
different inclinations, proper to mens different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plections,
and ages.</p>
            <p>Youth strong in body,<note place="margin">The seuerall dispositions of men.</note> wanting true wisedome and
discretion to guide his owne strength; age ripe in
iudgement and true wisedome, but hauing neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
nor ability to put her owne proiects in execution.
From hence obserue the different inclination of both;
the young man (not considering the blessing and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of peace, or the necessarie prouision for warre, or the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3385:79"/>
danger and casualtie of battell), desires nothing more
then the noyse of the drumme, or the sound of the
trumpet; whereas the old counseller that intends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but safety, and values other mens labours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the weakenesse of his owne crasie body, will
accept of peace vpon any the basest conditions. Thus
hath God set a distance or difference, betweene the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of the body, and the faculties of the soule: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were to denie all men an absolute perfection in
both, so to abate the pride of our nature; or else to tie al
men together in a mutuall bond of loue, by a necessitie
of each others helpe, that the blind might carrie the
lame, and the lame might direct the blind in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
Well, howsoeuer, sure it doth argue, that there is
some antipathie and disproportion betweene the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh
and the spirit, which being coupled together in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and neither of them well able to subsist and liue of
himselfe, and both of them adding luster and beauty to
each other; assuredly this enmitie hath fallen, since the
first contract or solemnization of mariage.</p>
            <p>Man being a sociable creature, what is there in this
world, which he should esteeme more then his credit
and reputation among men. Pride was the first sinne of
man, and euery man is naturally enclined vnto pride, as
well knowing the dignitie of his condition, and his
height aboue other creatures;<note place="margin">Man must sustaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches.</note> and truly in right reason
a generous and noble minde, without spot of basenesse
is most commendable. For there are degrees of men,
and euery man in his owne place should bee most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue
of his same and report; then what a corrosiue
were it to a vertuous and noble minde, to sustaine
wrongs, iniuries, reproches, contumelies most vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly.
Notwithstanding many mens great deserts and
endeauours, yet shall they neuer attaine the loue and
good will of the people; for the multitude, <hi>bellua mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3385:79"/>
capitum,</hi> like one vnreasonable creature with
many heads, hath herein the condition of dogs, alwaies
to barke at those whom they know not; and where
one whelpe begins, all the rest will follow the crie: Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

and being like patient Asses, to those who scourge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
and delude them, and thus they are iustly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
for their malice and follie.</p>
            <p>Man being a sociable creature, hee carries a greater
reference and relation to others: and therefore not in
our selues alone, not in our selues, are the causes of our
griefe;<note place="margin">Mans sorrow and miserie for others.</note> but as if we were stubble, very apt for combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
euery outward sparke serues to inflame vs. See, how
the poore mother laments for her gracelesse and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
child! how the father bewailes the losse of his
daughter, which without his counsell or priuitie hath
matched her selfe (by the practice of his owne seruants)
to a knaue and an vnthrift! how the parents mourne
for the death of their eldest and most hopefull sonne!
how the vnkle is perplexed with thought of the poore
orphants committed to his trust! how the children
finde want of their parents, forsaken and desolate, left
to the wide world, and to Gods onely protection! the
comfortlesse widow teares her owne haire, when shee
thinkes of her deare husband! the whole kindred and
family groane to see the waste of woods, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of that ancient house, from whence they are all
descended; but now fallen into decay by wardship, or
ill husbandrie; if any one of the stocke doe miscarrie,
the shame shall be impured to all. Not vnlike the state
of the Citizens, if one breakes, others must crack; there
must be a fellow-feeling of the blow: how happy are
they whose state is whole, entire and absolute within
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3385:80"/>
themselues? and this is the condition of dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in respect of man.</p>
            <p>Suppose any man were freed from these annoyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as indeed few there are, whom neither kindred, nor
friends, nor followers did any way grieue or molest;
yet in the streetes or high way side,<note place="margin">The griefe of compassion.</note> (we shall not need
to visite the Spittles, or Hospitals) how many lame, how
many blinde, some vpon crutches, some vpon pallets?
what broken bones, maimed limbes, seared armes,

without chinnes, some without noses, some without
hands to receiue, or feete to follow, yet still begging
your almes: Will you not vouchsafe to behold them?
Behold they shall waite and attend vpon you, at your

            <p>You may thinke that I am driuen to some great exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
that now at length I should speake of the outcast
of men; as if I were to visite some Hospitals, or to make
a diligent search or inquisition for all those miserable
creatures,<note place="margin">A passage from the miseries of the creatures to the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> in whom the frailties and infirmities of our
flesh doe most eminently appeare. But in truth I haue
here onely spoken of them, as the present occasion did
offer it selfe; I met them in the streete, or by the high

I will hasten to ouertake whole mankind; whom I will
intangle in one common depth of our miseries, I will
acquit none from the highest to the lowest. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hitherto I might seeme to haue sunke to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
I will therefore now recall my selfe, and leauing
such miserable states of men, I will runne ouer all those
actions, and qualities, wherein our pleasure may seeme
to consist; or wherein there may seeme to be any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of happinesse, and therein shall appeare our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3385:80"/>
and wretched condition.</p>
            <p>The qualities I will thus diuide: They are such as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are in our selues: 1. as are the gifts of the bodie, the
beautie and comelinesse of parts: 2.<note place="margin">Wherein ioy may seeme to consist.</note> or the gifts of the
minde, as profound learning and true wisedome; or else
they are such as stand in relation to others, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

I will speake of our wealth and abundance, 4. or in
our esteeme and reputation among men, wherein I will
speake of our honour: 5. or in our actions, our pastimes
and sports, wherein I will speake of our pleasures.</p>
            <p>First for beautie, for it appeares first to the sight, and
carries the best glosse: the fairest beautie and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
though proudest of her selfe, yet she neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes
her selfe;<note place="margin">A looking glasse for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> and if in a glasse onely by way of refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet she presently forgets her selfe: it serues as a

the most wrinkled and withered. If a Feuer (but for a

iudge of her complection; a pale countenance, hollow

               </gap>es, fur'd mouth, panting breath, slow
speech, weake and trembling ioynts; all which could
hardly allure or entice her fond wooer. When beautie
is at the best, yet if it bee not adorned and set foorth
with Iewels, with silkes, with colours, which rich and
costly attires; if it were naked and desolate, clad in
homely weedes, it would hardly moue thy affection;
and when thou beholdest it at the best, thou seest but
onely the outside, for beautie is but skinne-deepe: if
thou couldest discerne the vncleane maw, the noysome
bowels, the vnsauourie parts, thou wouldest finde it a
painted sepulcher. But suppose the face were besmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with bloud, thou couldest not endure the sight:
suppose it lay rotten in the graue, as one day it shall,

Learning (I confesse) of it selfe is eleu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted aboue
the vulgar capacitie, otherwise it should not require
mens studies and labours; but being tempered with
discretion, and experience, may well bee accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and applied to many good vses, euen in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
capacitie. For certaine it is, that there is no true
learning, which is not grounded in nature; neither can
it receiue any iust rule and direction, but only from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(for Grammar is only a step or an entrance to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning):
he that shall doubt of the wisedome of nature,
must needs confesse himselfe an ignorant foole. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that the great Clerke may be ignorant of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and basest things; or happilie of their price, their
vse or valuation: doth this any way disparage his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
his learning, his iudgment? As if a priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller
should therefore be reputed an vnwise man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath no skill in husbandrie and tillage; when
his leisure will not serue him to intend such drudgerie.
But for this time, rather then I would any way hinder
my intent, I will willingly grant it; let there be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and such a difference as Scripture reports; a wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in their owne generation, a worldly wisdome, a
serpentine wisedome, differing from the wisedome of
schooles. Now for this wisedome, see how she is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
in her owne kinde, and there wanting, wherein
she desires to be most perfit.</p>
            <p>Great wits breed melancholy thoughts, and serue
rather to stirre vp ielousies and feares, then to giue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

cause, why men of the deepest vnderstanding, haue not
alwaies the best successe in the State; not only because
they are supprest by an higher power, which hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
attained to the top, desires by al possible meanes
to secure it selfe: but in their actions intending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring

they spend their whole time, in deliberation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation,
and chuse rather to manage their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
estates, then to commit themselues to the stage of
this world, to the fortune and varietie of times. And
hence it is, that seldome or neuer they performe or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any great and honourable worke; and the wits
themselues are so dangerous, as that they giue men oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
rather to feare and to distrust their practises,
then to relie vpon their counsels and directions. In so
much that sometimes it is a speciall point of wisedome
to conceale it selfe; as he that acts the foole in a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
is commonly the wisest fellow in the companie:
for you shall obserue, that the meane capacitie giues
greater hearts ease, more contentment, liues more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
and increaseth his meanes much better, then the
deep vnderstanding; who either will attempt nothing,
or not taking the ordinary course, most vsually failes in
his purposes. Where there is a little want of braine,
there you shall find the truest ioy; for it is a great point
of happinesse not to vnderstand his owne griefe. To
daunce about May-poles, to skip ouer bon-fires, heere
was the old countrie sport; and here is the truest mirth,
for there is no true mirth, without some mixture of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
Serious &amp; waightie thoughts are a great hindrance
to mirth; and great wits as they are alwaies ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3385:82"/>
so stand they alwaies in feare and in ieopardie,
the battaile and combat of wits being no lesse bloodie,

and to call it pedantisme, making a farre greater show
and ostentation of learning, then learning can doe of
her selfe; as things counterfeit, make alwaies the best
outward appearance; like bold and presumptuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who seeme to be most confident in their reports.
These gentle Clerks cannot be content to kindle and
enlighten their owne lampes, but now they desire to
put out the light, and to raise vp their buildings with
the ruines of learning, perswading the world that it is
not of that necessitie and vse in the State: whereas all
our religion seemes to adorne and support learning,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3385:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and together with it, is infused into the hearts of men,
all our ciuility, all our customes, our manner and forme
of speech, all our lawes, and whatsoeuer else makes
man sociable: all was first borrowed from the well-spring
and fountaine of learning; though now by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
practise, and continuance of time, we may seeme to
enioy them. When learning was once exiled, nations
turned barbarous, without the seruice of God, or the
feare of the Magistrate.</p>
            <p>I dare excuse nothing from vanitie, and therefore I
must truly confesse, that learning seemes to bee defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
in her selfe. For as the whole world is circular, and
as whole nature consists in alteration and change, the
night succeeding the day, and the day the night: so
learning seemes to runne in a circle or maze,<note place="margin">Learning is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue in her end, yet super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in her parts.</note> not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that height which it aimes at; where it ends, there
it begins, reading much, and forgetting much, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

are the excrements I confesse, not vnlike the wings or
skirts of a garment, or the warts or spots of the flesh,
which serue for lustre and ornament of the rest, and

in generall; for the nicities and trickes of law,
are as foolish in their owne kinde, as are the subtilties
of Schooles, were it not that a Writ, directed to the
Sheriffe for the execution of their lawes, doth mitigate
their follie. When the penne and the sword doe meete
together, then who dare stand in defiance, but make a
separation between both, and then strength will proue
brutish, and wit ridiculous; not vnlike him that should
dart a goose quill, (as learning is figured out by the
pen) of it selfe it will neither pierce, nor make any long
flight; but if the Archer shall cunningly take the least
part of it, and glew it to his shaft, then it will proue a
very fearefull and dangerous instrument in warre; but

they say with the tenants in the Gospell, Heere is the

ours. To let goe all other meaner professions, and to
insist in the wisedome of the law; it were a foule dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
to compare the learning of all ages, the
learning of the whole world, the knowledge of God
and nature, with any priuate or prouinciall lawes, but
I do heere generally insist in all the lawes of the world.
Assuredly all their wisedome is onely borrowed from
schoole-learning; they haue indeed proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

of their writs, the manner of their proceedings, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

their words, all which are framed as well as possibly
the wisedome of man could inuent; but the ground
and reason of their law, is onely taken from schoole-learning.
Whereas our temporall lawes are squared

law? to whose profession doth the knowledge
thereof most properly belong, but to the Philosopher?
who by the inspection of nature, viewing the course of
Gods prouidence, considering the soules actions, and
thereby iudging of her inclination, is able to make a
large volume, and treatise of that subiect. If question
be made, what circumstances doe alter the action? here

combined, and therefore must necessarily symbolize; if
any doubt be made in regard of a Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
here the Casuist Diuines take place, and must
giue his direction accordingly. To conclude, our
schoole-learning doth as farre exceed all the lawes in
the world, in the excellencie of their wisedome and
knowledge, as the lawes of God and nature, are much
wiser then the lawes of men.</p>
            <p>From the person and inward gifts of man, let vs come

contentment, but rather like the dropsie, prouokes the
appetite; for the mind still continueth empty, and
therefore still may desire, when the purse or the coffer
swallowes vp the treasure. If this wealth bee excessiue
in some, then is the pouerty of others as excessiue; for
the enriching of one, is the impouerishing of another:
there is no new creation of nothing, we doe but robbe

            <p>Many men haue laboured much,<note place="margin">What is wealth, or what it is to be rich.</note> and trauelled far,
to get wealth; suppose I should accompanie them, I

with vs, if a mans stocke of a few beasts bee his owne,
and that he liues out of debt and paies his rent duly and
quarterly, we hold him a very rich and a sufficient man;
one that is able to doe the King and the countrey good
seruice; wee make him a Constable, a Sides-man, a
Head-borough, and at length a Church-warden: thus
wee raise him by degrees, wee prolong his ambitious
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3385:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hopes, and at last wee heape all our honours vpon him.
Here is the great gouernour amongst vs, and we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that all others doe not respect him accordingly: but
it should seeme, that since the dissolution of Abbeys, all
wealth is flowne to the townes: the husbandman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

at a rackt rent, hee fights with distracted forces, and
knowes not how to raise the price of the market: only
the Trades-man hath his Corporation, hee can ioyne
his wits and his labours together, and professing the
one, he thriues by the other; and therefore they are not
vnfitly called Handi-crafts. Now in the next market

pounds a peece: this is wonderfull, for we cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
conceiue, how men, by honest and direct meanes,
should attaine to such summes. Indeed the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

found a pot of money in a garden, which did som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

to suspect and to feare his estate, lest this ouer-hastie
aspiring to honour, may breake his backe. If a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
haue great royalties, and may dispend ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds by the yeere, yet we hold him no bodie in
respect of the ancient rents of the Dutchie. The Dutchy
notwithstanding the augmentation, yet is farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

kingdomes come short of the Southerne; the Southern
Princes are starke beggers, in respect of the Indian:
Whether shall I flie, in the pursuite of wealth? I am
now farre from home, and it is not safe for me to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
among Infidels. I will rather thus conclude in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if there bee wealth in this world, it is either vpon
the face of the earth, or else in the bowels of the earth,
like treasure conceald and safely lockt vp in natures
coffers. I will therefore here stay my selfe, and fall flat
on the earth; and heere I will solemnely proclaime it,
that the whole earth is an indiuisible point, and carries
no sensible quantitie in respect of the heauens. Thus at
length I will returne home, not loaded with oare; but
being much pacified in minde, and fully resolued, that
all wealth consists onely in comparison. Now if it shall
please God, to supplie the necessities of my nature, as he
in his mercie already hath done, (God make me thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto him) neither doe I despaire of his prouidence;
I will not compare my selfe with others, but deeme my
selfe sufficiently rich; and if I should striue to be rich
in comparison, I should neuer be able to attaine mine
owne ends.</p>
            <p>Lay vp these money bagges; from wealth I wil come
vnto honour, as others by wealth come vnto honour:
The glittering and gingling of gold seems to resemble
honour; which is a pretie noise, a sound, a kind of fame
or report: if it want meanes to support it, it is like sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3385:87"/>
stuffe,<note place="margin">Honor hath a weake founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which at first seemes beautifull to the eye,
but hath no substance to continue: if any one be raised
without merit, hee shall bee sure to fall againe without
desert. As are the mindes of men (of a mutable and
changeable condition) so is the foundation of honour
weake and changeable; especially in the multitude,
who alwaies iudge according to shewes and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
and as they are soone gained with a cap, so are
they as easily lost with a frowne; their loues follow not

               </gap>tent, but the happie successe of the action.
Times and fit occasions giue the first beginning to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and as it hath a sudden rising, so it proceeds not
by degrees, but commonly men doe outliue their good
fortunes, and seldome or neuer doe extraordinarie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
mourne at their funerals.</p>
            <p>Especially in a subiect, liuing vnder a Monarchy, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
with his Prince, beloued of the people: this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reference to the Prince, to the people, makes his
state dangerous and almost desperate; the one fearing
and suspecting him, the other laying to his charge all
the distastfull actions of State: for this man long to
continue, to hold fast with both hands, taking his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from aboue, his loue &amp; reputation from beneath,
and thus to hang in the aire betweene heauen &amp; earth,
is a worke very difficult, almost impossible. When ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is at the best,<note place="margin">The vaine ceremonies of Honor.</note> yet it seemes to be nothing, vnlesse

Pages, Vshers and officers of honour appointed; such
chaires and cloathes of estate, cups of grace serued on
the knee, the seruants rankt in their order, such strict
and precise formes of salutation; and if all this will not
serue, then open and plaine flatterie, and all manner of
lying and grosse cos'ynage. But I pra'y looke to their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3385:87"/>
persons, and you shall finde them some old crasie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
troubled with gowtes and with palsies, who take
little ioy or contentment in al their honour, and would
very willingly exchange it for a little health. Heere
then I see, that a poore mans condition is farre better
then theirs, and much to bee preferred before theirs:
little would you thinke, that men of such account, so
much talked of, should be of such a stature and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.</p>
            <p>Thus it should seeme, that the Ceremoniall law is
no way abolisht, but onely translated from the Temple
of the Iewes to the palaces of our Nobles. All their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
consists in shewes, and in ceremonies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee may well feare, that they haue but onely the
shew of honour.<note place="margin">The true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Christ.</note> For there was true honour indeede,
which appeared in the basenesse of this world, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
honour to the most dishonourable creatures;
God and man, power and weakenesse, Maiestie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
together subsisting; the homely manger was a
fit subiect for the song of Angels; and the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
crosse must be the onely signe of victorie and
triumph: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee wanted no thrones to set foorth his
greatnesse, being all glorious in himselfe, though sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
in the vaile of our flesh; hee wanted not the
helpe of the creatures, though otherwise he might haue
commanded many legions of Angels to attend him;
his honour was in himselfe, and not in him that ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the honour. And therefore being not able to look
vp to his Throne, I will heere fall downe at his foote-stoole,
here I will worship: for I had rather be a doore-keeper
in the house of my God, then to dwell in the
Tents of vngodlinesse. Thus setting true honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mine owne eyes, I will yet a little further discouer
the vanities of our worldly and temporall honour.</p>
            <p>Suppose that a stranger, or one vnacquainted with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3385:88"/>
these honourable courses, should bee admitted in the
time of some great feast, (as the manner is) to see the
fashions and conditions of the place, I pra'y, obserue,<note place="margin">The feast of honor.</note>
with what state and formalitie their meate is serued vp,
what exquisite dishes, varietie of sauces, how many
courses, how well it is ordered, what banketting stuffe,
and plentie of sweete meates! The English fowle em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm'd
with the Indian spice, the delicious Carp swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in a sea of sweete broth, the red Deere harbour'd
in a nut-browne coffin, the Phesant onely commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
for her price; here are the creatures (I confesse) in
abundance. But now, where is the vse of these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
See how this honourable Lord sitting in all his
state, calles at length to his Caruer, for the legge of a
Larke, or the wing of a Partridge, and so rests satisfied;
complaines of his weake stomacke, vseth his hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
&amp;c. How much are wee bound vnto God, whose
condition though meane and inferiour, yet wee haue a
sufficient plentie of Gods creatures; in stead of their
sauces, wee haue our hunger and good appetite; and to
these creatures God hath giuen that hidden qualitie,
as that they are fit to nourish our bodies; a strange
wonder in nature, that dead creatures should preserue
life: and hauing thus both substance and qualitie, God
hath giuen vs the free vse of these creatures, that wee
may take them in full measure with moderation, while
he himselfe sanctifies both them and vs, and giues a
blessing to both.</p>
            <p>As it is in their feasts, so it is in their funerals; as it is
in their liues,<note place="margin">The funerals of honor.</note> so it is in their deaths: nothing but dumbe
shewes. I neuer see Sir <hi>Christopher Hattons</hi> tombe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I haue named the Gentleman, and that I desire
that all things may bee spoken without offence, I will
giue him his due praise and commendation; in his time
he was a very honourable minded man, no practising

statesman, first contriuing, and then very wisely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
his owne plots: but of faire and ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
highly fauoured of his Prince, and generally
beloued of the people; and one to whom the present
Church of England, is as much indebted in true loue
and thankfulnes, as to any lay subiect that euer liued in
this kingdome): when I see his tombe, me thinkes hee
should not bee like the ordinarie sort of our men, such
huge commendations, such titles, such pillars, such gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
such caruing, such a huge monument, to couer so
small a body as ours it cannot be. Send for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,
will them to bring hither their instruments and
tooles, their mattocks, spades, hammers, &amp;c. let vs pull
downe this tombe, see his excellencie and greatnesse,
let vs take his proportion: But stay your hands, I will
saue you all that labour, for I will tell you in briefe (if
my tale were worth the telling) what you shall finde, a
few rotten bones, and a handfull of dust; some crawling
wormes, which haue deuoured this great little man,
whom we supposed to haue bin as great vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth,
as wee see his monument statelie mounted aboue
ground. Is there deceit and cosonage among the dead?
or rather doe the liuing heires and suruiuors intend
their own glorie in the tombe of their ancestors? Well,
howsoeuer liuing or dead, man is altogether vanitie,
deluding the world with shewes; and making great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of things, which are small in themselues.</p>
            <p>Thus we deceiue, and wee are deceiued, the world is

minde, they did farre exceede vs; not descending to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3385:89"/>
those base offices, and pillages, which haue been since
practised; not so wholly intending their owne lucre, as
now wee doe. Our honour seemes to adde nothing to
our cariage, our port or expense; a Lord with his page,
a Knight with his lackie, here is sufficient attendance:
pitie it were that a house should stand emptie, when a
chamber will serue; a set table, and an ordinarie diet
were ouer troublesome, some Tauerne or common
Ordinarie shall make their prouision: to runne in debt
with the Mercers, and to vndoe the poore tradesmen,
it is now growne to bee the fashion of the times; to
carrie an high minde, and yet to stoope low, and to bite
at euery baite, these are the fruites of our honour, and
herein wee dishonour our selues, I reuerence true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
acknowledging it a thing onely proper to man,
the speciall and principall outward image of God; but

me leaue in the last place, to hunt after our sports, and
our pleasures. For the delights of men, I would gladly
know wherein they consist; if in the actions of sense, or

actions, and they do alwaies end with dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ste and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment:
the beasts are more sensuall then man,
and therefore should haue a greater measure of sensual
delights then man. Now in our pastimes and games,
you shall obserue as great labour in them, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it passe vnder the name of an honest recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or exercise, as you shall finde in the ordinarie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and vocations of men: and assoone you shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the learning and perfection of their trades, as

               </gap>ing and skilfull in these sports. To
set aside all other pleasures, I will onely insist in Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and Hunting.</p>
            <p>Consider (I pray') their great trouble and paines;
such violent labour, such dangerous riding; the high
waies cannot alwaies containe them, but ouer the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and ditches; here begins the crie and the curse of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3385:90"/>
the poore t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nant, who sits at a hard rent, and sees his
corne spoyled;<note place="margin">The supposed pleasure in Hunting.</note> then immediatly followes the renting
of garments, the tearing of flesh, the breaking of legs,
the cracking of bones, their liues are not alwaies secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and thus they continue the whole day; sometimes
thorough stormes and tempests, sometimes enforced
to wade thorough riuers and brooks, fasting sweating,
and wearied only with a conceit of their bootie (heere
is excellent sport indeede): if they were to be hired,
they would neuer vndertake such troublesome and
dangerous courses; then it would seeme to bee a meere
slauerie, as indeed it doth to their seruants and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who must attend their Lordships, and partake with
them in their whole sport, but not in any part of their
pleasure. In truth according to right reason, I should
preferre the life of a Carrier or a Poste, farre before
theirs; with what speed doe they gallop? I could wish
they would g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue me leaue to aske them one question,
wherein consists the sport and delight in hunting? some
say in the noise and crie of the Hounds; others in their
carefull curiositie and search in the pursuite; others in
the exercise of their owne bodies, and in their hope of
the bootie. I do not like this varietie of opinions; shall
I resolue you this one point? the pleasure which you
so hotly and eagerly pursue in the chase, consists in the
phansie and in your owne apprehension; what a vaine
thing is it to seeke for that in the woods, which indeed
consists in your braine? ye carrie it about you, and run
to ouertake your owne shadow. This is a pleasure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you conceiue it so; perswade your selues alike of
any labour or trauaile, and you shall finde a like ease
and contentment. If the world were so perswaded, if it
were the course and fashion of the times, to delight in
religious exercises, and in the actions of pietie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
to lift vp our hearts and our voyces to God in a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3385:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
melodious quier, to temper our passions according to
the sweete harmonie of the organ-pipe, to practise the
works of charity; and in stead of the cry of the hounds,
to hearken to the cries, to the blessings and prayers of
poore people: assuredly wee should finde farre greater
ioy and contentment, (I speake according to the carnall
and naturall man, without reference to the inward
comfort of Gods spirit, which is a benefit vnualuable)
then now wee reape in these outragious, troublesome,
dangerous and bloodie sports, which wholly sauour of
crueltie.</p>
            <p>As we are deluded in their sports, so likewise in their
persons: I had thought that Huntsmen and Faulconers
had been in the nature of our Heardsmen; but in truth,
they are well mounted and horst,<note place="margin">Of Huntsmen.</note> as if they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for some seruice of warre, all apparelled in
greene, like the sonnes of May; they can talke and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of their forrest lawes, of state matters, and newes
at Court; they haue their words of Art, their rules, and
certaine notions belonging to their profession: and
were it not for such formalitie and ceremonies, the
sport would be little respected.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly in effect, Beautie is as a fading flower,
and serues to incense lust: Honour increaseth pride, the
height makes greater the downfall: Wealth breedes
carefulnes, deiects the minde, and makes man a slaue:
Learning tends to confusion, great wisedome rather
breedes a distaste, and a dislike in nature, then giues any
contentment: All pleasures consist in the fansie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to mans owne apprehension. Now proportion
these fiue seuerall qualities, to the fiue seuerall senses of
mans bodie; wisdome to the sent, beautie to the sight,
honour to the eare, wealth to the touch, pleasures to the
taste. Suppose a man to consist of fiue senses, and to
haue the full measure of these fiue seuerall obiects; yet
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3385:91"/>
certaine it is, that all the ioyes in the world can giue his
heart no true contentment; but the least sorrow and
griefe deiects the high minde, and brings downe his
courage. If thou haddest wealth, more wealth thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirest,
and in euery action an excesse is distastfull; but
if in the middest of all thy ioyes, the least griefe should
assault thee;<note place="margin">The least sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row spoyles all our ioy.</note> suppose thou wert an absolute Monarch,
and haddest the gouernment of the whole world; that
thou diddest ride vpon the shoulders of men, carried in

thou haddest all carnall and al possible pleasures, which
nature could affoord thee: yet if thy tooth did but ake,
if thy naile were but sore, if thy little finger were
scorcht with the fire, (for I will not speake of those
more noble parts, the eye, the heart, the braine, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

            <p>Suppose thou couldest distill all thy pleasures, and

to preuent, ouertake, and to extinguish the other. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou sittest at table to meate, then farewell the delight,
which thou tookest in thy morning exercises &amp; sports;
now thou must intend to please thy daintie and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
palate: at length, for feare of a surfet, farewell the
sweete sinne of gluttonie; the afternoone will serue to
visit to thy friends, but as thou commest, so there must
be a time of departure; as was thy ioy, so must be thy
sorrow, the one will easily recompence the other. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy returne thou callest to thy stewards and clerkes,

thy heart, and thus thou passest from ioy vnto ioy, the

whole time of thy pilgrimage. Suppose thou wert con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finde
to any one of these delights, thou wouldest think
thy life but a slauerie; so then thy delight consists onely
in the varietie. Suppose any mans minde were not so
stragling, and extrauagant as thine, but that hee could
tie himselfe and limit his owne thoughts; certainly he
should receiue as much contentment in one, as thou
dost in many. What doth this argue, but only that man
(forsaking the fountain of all true goodnesse, in whom
all ioyes are together knit and vnited, that enioying
him alone, wee might haue all fulnesse of ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
not by degrees, not in varietie, not in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but altogether in euery moment of eternitie) Man
hauing lost this onely one good, seekes againe for the
same good, in the shadow thereof, thorough many
chaunges and alterations, and not finding the same
good, desires to please himselfe with varietie?</p>
            <p>Suppose the whole day were spent in iolitie and
mirth,<note place="margin">All ioyes are nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the nights rest.</note> yet if thou diddest but want thy nights rest, al
were nothing. Lord, how thine owne thoughts would
torment thee! how long and tedious would the time
seeme! how often wouldest thou wish and expect the
light of the morning! then thou beginnest to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that of all the ioyes in the world, there is none
comparable to a sweete sleepe; sleepe, which refresheth
the wearisome limmes, renewes and quickens the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the minde, restores the bodie to her wonted
strength, (it seemes as an excellent embleame of the
last resurrection), for in the day time our sports do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with consuming of our spirits, the decay of our
strength, the weakning of our parts; but sleepe must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
all. Haue I wrung out a confession? Now
giue me leaue to worke vpon it. What is sleepe, but the
image of death? a want of sense and of motion, not
capable either of ioy or of sorrow. If our greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3385:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rest in our rest, and sleepe bee our greatest
blisse; then our greatest ioy consists in the priuation of
all ioy, and in the want and absence of delights, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the perfection of delights. As-much in effect, as if I
should say, it were better to haue no ioyes at all, then to
be fraught and filled with ioyes; for our ioyes are but
toyes, and the delights of this life are as the dreames of
a shadow without stayednesse, foundation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencie.</p>
            <p>If there be any ioyes in the creature, O the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ioyes of him that created!<note place="margin">The ascent of the mind vnto God, by the ladder of the creatures.</note> hee is the fountaine of
ioy, and these are but drops: he is the sunne of ioy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
these are the rayes, or the beames which he imparts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nature. If I loue beauty, I will first loue him, and
fasten mine eyes vpon him, that is the fountaine of
beauty, and beauty it selfe: if I loue honor or wealth,
I will looke vpon him, who sits aboue in maiesty,
heauen is his throne, the earth is his footstoole, whose
treasures are infinit, who makes all things of nothing,
he can enlarge his owne Empire, create many infinite
worlds for his owne gouernment. Hee that is proud of
his owne wealth or his honor, is indeed base minded, to
content himselfe with so base an element as the earth;
our pride and ambition lookes much higher, aboue the
starres, where God sits in perfect glory; where all the
hallowes of heauen are clothed with happines and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
here is the marke and scope of our desires, here we
may claime our right by inheritance: for here we haue
our part and portion with them; there is but little ioy in
the creature, all an infinitie to that little ioy: and so thou
shalt worship God in the creature, let it not hinder our
search or our hope, for it is but an earnest or forerunner
of that future ioy to secure vs of happines; <hi>non ancillam
ament, qui dominam ambiunt,</hi> if we come as suters to the
Mistris, let vs scorne to fall in loue with the handmaide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:3385:92"/>This I speake, supposing there were some ioy in the
creature, which if there were any, thy minde might be
transported and carried, by the ladder or bridge of the
creatures, to the loue of thy creator. For as it pleased
God to ordaine a ceremoniall law, differing from the
naturall law, according to the wisdome of his owne
institution: so assuredly the minde of man, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in nothing so much as in mysteries, may make
whole nature a ceremony, and all the creatures tipes
and resemblances of spirituall things; for thus the land
of promise did figure out the heauenly Ierusalem, and
this I cannot dislike in the practise of any mans priuat
deuotion.</p>
            <p>But I must call to mind my first intention, which
was to proue that the ioy of the creature was only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and this shal appeare by these three circumstances.
1. The variety of mens iudgements in the choice of
their owne happines, which certainly proceeds from
the fansie; for right reason hath but one only foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and God will not admit any difference. 2. This
their conceited or supposed happines neuer consists in
the present; insomuch that man can neuer say vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
now I am happy: but his happines is alwayes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
past, gon and already spent, or els comming in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;

are verily perswaded, that there is some happines,

boast of their bloud and their parentage; while others
flatter themselues with this conceit, that although they
carry no great outward shew in the world, nor are not

to seaze vpon that glory, which belongs to another:
for the worme should brag of his silke as of his owne
excrement; and the taylor should boast of his fashions.
And some there are, who wanting all these, yet suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselues to haue a good naturall wit, begin to
condemne nature, that hath not proportioned all her

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3385:93"/>
vanitie, but Poets and Players daily discouer it; and
therefore I will ease my selfe of that labour.</p>
            <p>Suppose we did agree for the qualitie, what it were
to be happie, then let vs search for the person;<note place="margin">2. No man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe happy for the present.</note> where
is this happie man, who might bee said for the present
to enioy this happinesse? It is a common prouerbe, that
young men liue in their hopes, old men in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
it should seeme that young men haue not (as yet)
strength to shoot so farre as the marke; (for all aime at
happinesse): and it should seeme that old men shoot
beyond the marke; for they can discourse what they
haue been with their bowes and their arrowes, at the
siege of Bullen. Thus young men, and old men, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
excluded from happinesse: and speaking of
young and old, I must needs include the middle age,
or the middle sort of men, as according to our naturall
course, so according to the course of our misery. For
happinesse is the end of man; now if any should attaine
his owne end, or his owne proper place, assuredly hee
would rest satisfied, and contented therein. But it is as
proper to man, as is the nature of man, to bee full of
change and variety; hee neuer rest, but is altering his
buildings, changing his garments, intending new
courses; as if hee were to find out some new passage, a
shorter cut vnto happinesse, wherof the ancients were
ignorant. Lord, how hee flatters himselfe with vaine
hopes! sometimes of himselfe, sometimes of the
young child in the cradle; if his debts were but payed,
he would liue very happily and well; if his mother in
law were gone, his estate would bee great; though
now he liues in some pouerty and want, yet he hath an
old kinsman that intends to make him his heire: <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
vult decipi,</hi> men desire to be flattered, and for want
of parasites, they will flatter themselues. I haue seene
the gray beard, gape after the death of his young ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nephew,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3385:94"/>
and to expect the inheritance for want of issue
male to succeed: thus waking we dreame, and can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the shortnes of mans life, expect the departure
of others, but for our selues we finde little change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in our bodies: we deceiue our selues with our
owne yeares, our constitution, or calling to minde the
long liues of some of our parents: others sickned indeed
and died by accident, casualty, and chance, but we will
preuent that in our selues.</p>
            <p>Thus is the world deluded with hopes, and men goe
a whoring after their owne inuentions; the person is as
vncertaine as is the qualitie, for wee cannot resolue
what happines is, nor doe we know where to finde out
that happy man (I speake onely of such a happines as
may be competent and agreeable to our present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion):<note place="margin">3. Denying happinesse in our selues, do suppose it in others.</note>
for as yet I neuer hard any man account himselfe
happy, but still something was wanting, and yet we are
well perswaded, that there is some happines in nature,
and therefore we would charge others to be happy in
respect of our selues; <hi>vberior seges est alienis semper in
agris,</hi> alwayes thy neighbours ground is better then
thine, he is the hapyy man, and thou art the wretch.
Sometimes this preiudicat opinion is not sufficient, and
therefore the world is full of complaints: Princes must
erect Courts of request, as if therein men did seeme to
accuse their owne condition, to lay the whole burthen
of their griefe vpon others, and therefore did flie vnto
mercy, for succour and reliefe. If neither opinions nor
complaints will suffice, then in others you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
a more malitious and treacherous nature; for
they are apt to enuie and maligne other mens good
fortunes, and enuy doth alwayes accompany greatnes:
our corrupted nature seemes to stir vp a kind of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for all things here stand in reference to others, the
height and greatnes of the one, makes for the basenesse
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3385:94"/>
and pouerty of the other; no prince can subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
subiects, no Lord without slaues, no master with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seruants; the one is apt to wrong and oppresse, the
other to enuie and reuolt, and in both you shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
natures corruption.</p>
            <p>Still we desire to comfort our selues that there is
some happines, that so we might receiue ioy though
not in the present possession, yet in the hope or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.

procrastination of happines, I suppose to be an absolute
deniall of happines, for indeed nature cannot supply it.

to euery state in particular.<note place="margin">Miseries in all the states of men.</note> As I hope I shal not prouok
whole mankind against me, when I discouer their fall
and corruption; so (without exception) I may speake of
the vices and miseries of each state in particular. For it
is proper to misery, to groane; proper to sinne, for to cry
for vengeance; neither misery nor sin can long be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed:
and it is our greatest misery, that we thinke it a

            <p>Heauen and earth standing in opposition to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the deeper you sinke in the one, the more remote
you are from the other. Suppose these worldly ioyes to

and the Moone very fitly resembles the state of man, as
being the lowest of the celestiall Orbes, and in regard
of her mutable and changeable condition. If I desire to

weane him from the moderate loue of his owne fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

laying open the miseries which are incident to whole
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3385:95"/>
mankind, from which no state is exempted; herein I
shall follow the example of God himselfe, who mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all our ioyes with the spice of sorrow: and in the
last clause of our liues before our death, (desiring then
especially to draw vs to himselfe), his prouidence hath
so appointed, that long diseases should better instruct
vs of the true state of this world, then all our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

weakenes, our miseries, and what we are in our selues;
then we see the vanity of all our worldly ioyes, that so
detesting and abhorring them, (esteeming them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

more helpes, then the rest of the creatures, as clothes
for his nakednesse, physicke for his health, a house for

man full of sores, and inward griefe; hungry, naked,
cold, comfortlesse &amp; harbourlesse, without patience to
sustaine his griefe, without any helpe to releiue him,
without any counsell to comfort him, without feare of
Gods iustice, without hope of Gods mercy, which as at
all times, so most especially in such distresse should be
the sole comfort of a christian man. I protest before
God that were it not, for the hope of my happines, and
that I did truly beleeue the miseries of this life, to be
the iust punishments of sinne, I should much prefer
the condition of dumbe creatures, before the state of

their luxury and riot, insomuch that they doe not num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
halfe their dayes, but in the middle course of their

gouts, with dropsies and stones; and that which I haue
obserued in some of them, the greatnesse of their estate
entaild and descending vpon them, cannot counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
some hereditary disease, which they likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

though we are incompassed with thornes, yet we can so
winde and twist these thornes, as that wee can make

gladnes and ioy, out of the middest of affliction and
sorrow: if thornes tend to our paine, yet our glory
shall consist in a crowne, in a crowne of thornes: I will
now come to the gentrie, which is generally reputed,
as one of the happie states in the kingdome.</p>
            <p>A strange iudgement hath lately befallen them;
while they continued in their owne countries, kept
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3385:98"/>
great houses,<note place="margin">The Gentrie.</note> much hospitalitie, attended on with
troupes and numbers of seruants, their tenants liuing
happily vnder their shadow, certainly they liued in
great honor and plenty. But now, since they haue so
much improued their estates, ra'ckt their poore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
giuen ouer house-keeping, and liue retiredlie,
scarce any of them, that liue within the compasse of their
owne meanes; but euery man outstrips his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
carrying a saile too great for the burthen of his
vessel; in so much that forraine nations do iustly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the dissolute gentry of England.</p>
            <p>The trueth is, that this retired life of the gentry;
drawes with it far greater charge and expense, then
was formerly spent in hospitallity: not only because it
giues occasion,<note place="margin">Their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> to their dissolute gaming, and riot: but
many houses being kept, for the seuerall seasons of the
yeere, proue very chargeable; the furniture belonging
to the house, neuer so curious and exquisit; such cub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bords
of plate, such hangings, cushions, and needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke;
the apparell so costly and chargeable, the diet
so delicat, as reiecting meate of the shambles, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on out-landish fruites, spices, and wines: all their
other attempts seasoned with vaine glory, and a fond
opinion of their owne reputation and honor; together
with an affectation of titles, proue the more chargeable:
in so much, that the fourth part of that charge, being
spent in home-bread and country prouision, would in
a far more ample manner suffice. And surely it would be
more agreeable to our nature, for if these outlandish
commodities had bin so befitting our bodies, certainly
God in his wisdome and prouidence, would haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
our climat accordingly; what a madnesse or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were it in vs, to seeke to equall other nations in their
owne wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es? We must conforme our selues to the soyle,
and not thinke to reduce nature to our wils and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3385:98"/>
or if in the times of warre, when force, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and bloud-shed seru'd for the payment, some
might haue their commodities in a more plentifull
manner; yet in peaceable times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things are bought
at a valuable price, and wares exchanged for wares,
there being such a difference in the valuation of both,
it seemes to be intollerable. The ancient glory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
did consist in the strength of our Countrie, in the
multitudes of our seruants, and in the most abounding
and plentifull prouision; and herein wee doe as farre
exceed them, as they doe vs, in their silkes, their spices,
their oyles, or their wines.</p>
            <p>A second vanitie in our Gentrie, is, their needlesse
and vnprofitable buildings, especially when Citizens
turne Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse buildings.</note> they will not endure any longer to
be incaged within their owne shops; they must haue
full elbow-roome, and their buildings must raise their
names, &amp; continue their memories, being (as it should
seeme) otherwise somewhat meane and obscure in
themselues. Thus they build great houses, and keepe
small houses; which seemes to imply a contradiction,
were there not an inside, and an out-side; for an house
doth not onely consist of walles and foundations. And
sometimes they build, when they cannot keepe, and
commonly they are ouertaken with their owne buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
the imperfect worke standing at a stay, for want
of money to pay the workemen; while the neighbours,
and passengers smile at their indiscretion and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.
But suppose these buildings were finished,
whereas the delight should consist in the vse, it falles
out farre otherwise; and argues rather a giddie minde,
desiring imployment, together with a dreame of ioy,
conceiued in the imagination, then any sufficient
meanes to giue them contentment: for seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doe they enioy their owne labours, but either te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3385:99"/>
suffer them forthwith to decay, or else their
charge is continued (being absent) in maintaining their
buildings. The vnthriftie and prodigall heire is sooner
allured to the sale; and in his sale, hath seldome rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their charge in the building.</p>
            <p>In their estate of land, how exceedingly doe they
perplexe themselues with their continuall purchases?
if they could but procure a more competent demaine,
they would rest satisfied: when they haue gotten this
demaine, yet still there will remaine a desire to purchase
all that lies in one leauell, all that holds by one tenure,<note place="margin">Their fond purchases.</note>
they must enlarge their parkes. And being by these
meanes alwaies bare and needie, wanting for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
(though otherwise they may inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the plentie and
good of their posterity), they must straine themselues
to take vp money vpon hard termes, to purchase their
neighbours ground, for there is but a hedge that parts
it. Assuredly, vnlesse wee shall first inclose our owne
thoughts, and hedge vp our willes, and our appetites,
the whole earth can giue vs little contentment; the
triangle heart cannot bee filled vp and replenished
with the circular earth.</p>
            <p>Not onely in their continuall purchases, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in their present possessions, how are they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and disquieted in thoughts? For as the mind of
man is griple and needie,<note place="margin">Their many writings.</note> and therefore desires to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
his owne substance: so is the same mind doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
suspitious, and fearefull of any ill accident; and
therefore desires by all possible meanes, to secure her
selfe of her owne. And hence it is, that they so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
entangle and inueagle themselues, with many
writings, and conueyances, the Scriueners &amp; Clerks are
alwaies imployed; and yet the truth is, that in stead of
securing themselues, through the multiplicity of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
they cause starting holes, and giue occasion of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3385:99"/>
strife. O happie was the old world! when all things
past by word of mouth, or else a few lines subscribed
with the marke of a crosse, and the seale of a tooth did
suffice: when in these daies (I am verily perswaded)
that, what with writings, conueyances, bils of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
proceedings of Court, the whole land (which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite)
might bee spread ouer and couered, as with a
garment; yet all will not serue for our securitie.</p>
            <p>In their conueyances obserue how curious they are,
the possession is giuen to one, to the vse of another; the
reuersion to a third, in the behalfe of a fourth; with such
nice clauses and conditions,<note place="margin">Their nice conueiances.</note> so many prouisoes, such
feoffees of trust; that if a boy, or a Sophister in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
should propose such notions and ends to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
we should presently condemne them, as being the
fruits of an idle braine: for speculations must not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
bee reduced to practice; things cannot so well
square outwardly in the actions, as they doe inwardly
in the thoughts. Strange it is to separate the vse from
the thing; as if you would suppose a fruite without a
root: the creatures are ordained onely for our vse, and
more we cannot partake of them then the vse; so that
it is a fallacie in nature, to distinguish one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Againe, whole nature is corrupted; the more you
intangle your selfe, the more you shal finde the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the more feoffees of trust, alwaies the worser dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
the more executors, the slower execution. Let
your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay; nature contents her
selfe with the fewest instruments, and workes by the
easiest and plainest manner; and this should be a presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for their practice.</p>
            <p>Lastly, how doe they trouble and busie themselues
with entailes? as if they would alter the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this world; which being a world of change
and alteration, <hi>ex generatione vnius, fit corruptio alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:3385:100"/>
They lay deepe foundations, and desire a setled
state of continuance and perpetuitie here vpon earth;
but it is already resolued, that it is easier to dissolue,
then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pose.<note place="margin">Their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse entailes.</note> Nothing can be done by law, which by
the same law cannot be dissolued: &amp; thus their intailes
are either needlesse, or indeed doe cause and stirre vp
such feares and ielousies betweene kinsmen and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as that they proue to be the only causes, both of
the breach of their loue, and of the sale of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
As for example, the least action of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brother, sometimes his absence, or supposed neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
is taken so vnkindly, as it is thought to bee done
in regard of the intaile; but (saith the eldest brother)
it lies in my power to cut that short. These words are
carried to the younger; heere begins the practice of
seruants, and other kinsmen, who hope to gaine by his
losse. Words multiplying, giue way to distastfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
first, the wasting of woods, the impouerishing of
the grounds, decay of the buildings; at length it breaks
forth to the cutting off of the intaile: though it bee
chargeable in the doing, yet hee will not forbeare it.
Thus the intaile cannot secure it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selling, but makes
the sale the more chargeable. And thus God laughs at
the counsels of men, who desiring to erect a tower of
Babel heere vpon earth, God confoundeth their
tongues, and brings their worke to confusion.</p>
            <p>The best kind of intaile is, to haue his goods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
gotten; to bring vp his children in Gods feare;<note place="margin">The best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</note>
not to acquaint them with any wastfull course of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense;
to leaue a good report behind him, the good
wishes, and furtherance of all his bordering neighbors,
and kinsmen; to leaue his estate not intangled, nor to
ouer-trouble himselfe with these new &amp; strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiances;
to leaue it to the sole protection &amp; prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of God; <hi>Domini est terra &amp; plenitudo eius: Lord I giue
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3385:100"/>
thee humble thankes for mine owne vse and employment;
and if my sonnes, according to the flesh, shall not succeede
me; then let thy sonnes, according to the spirit, be heires of
thy promised land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes I see our Lawyers hold fast to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
and therefore I must speake of them in the next
place. If the earth it selfe were stable &amp; constant,<note place="margin">The Lawyers.</note> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
they haue laid a very strong and sure foundation.
For as long as hedges and Cottages endure; so long
seis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es, tenures, and trespasses shall continue. But here
is the misery, <hi>lex terrae simul cum terra ruet:</hi> at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
earth-quake and dissolution of this world, when
all hedges and Cottages shall fall, then where shall we
sue for a trespasse?</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that I am verily perswaded, that
they are as iust, as vpright, as free from briberie and
extortion,<note place="margin">Their slanders.</note> and euery way as sufficient and painfull in
their owne profession, as any other state in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For generally I can excuse none, (we must not
expect a state of innocency in a world of corruption)
yet assuredly, no state is more enuied, or maligned, then
theirs: which I cannot altogether ascribe to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and ill disposition of others, but euen their
profession it selfe seemes (in some sort) to produce it.
As God speakes, <hi>Vae Assur virgae furocis mei:</hi> the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of iustice, are alwaies fearfull, but seldome doe
stirre vp true loue, and affection. This enuie and hate
to their persons, hath raised vp many malitious slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and hath laid many false imputations vpon the
profession. For thus it hath been the complaint of all
ages, <hi>leges esse telas aranearum, vel quia iuridici sunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneae,
vel quia muscas capiunt, &amp; vespas dimittunt.</hi> But
I am not of their mind; for I thinke, that God in his
prouidence hath so fitly ordained it, as prophecying, or
prescribing a lesson; that the timber in Westminster
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3385:101"/>
Hall, should neither admit cobweb, nor spider: and
God make vs thankfull for the free course of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
            <p>God forbid that other mens reproches and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
should make them miserable. Enuie may follow,
but shall neuer be able to suppresse, or to ouertake the
vertuous and innocent. Then let vs consider them in
themselues,<note place="margin">Their harsh studie.</note> in their persons, and in their profession. The
nicities and subtilties of Law, as they doe infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
for number; so they come neare, euen for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
of knowledge, to the highest and profoundest
mysteries of our Christian faith, and religion. The study
it selfe is very difficult and harsh; for the actions of
men, together with the circumstances, being both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
needs the course of their studies must likewise be
infinite. And as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ions of men are voluntarie, casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

order or method, which in all our naturall knowledge,
giues vs the greatest ease and contentment: but heere,
onely the method of time, according to the variety of
accidents, as things haue fallen out, as cases haue been
adiudged, so their bookes of reports must serue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them. Somtimes again, the iudgements of those
great Sages doe much differ; and the Law doth altar
and varie, as it were ebbing and flowing, according to
the condition of the times and the seasons: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the root and foundation still continue the

variety, but is the same from her first infancie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;

there were such trouble in purchasing heauen, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
my eternall happinesse, as there is sometimes in
the recouering but of a rood of ground, I should halfe
despaire to attaine it. What throngs and multitudes of
Clients daily attend them? I commend the wisedome
of our forefathers, who close by the hall, erected a
Church, where they might take the open aire, and find
it as emptie, as they left the other peopled, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
How are they continually busied? I could hartily
wish that there were more minutes in the houre, more
houres in the day, more daies in the weeke, more weeks
in the yeere, more yeeres in their age, that at length
they might find out some spare time to serue God, to
intend the actions of nature, to take their owne ease
and recreation. For now they are ouer busied in their
brickes, and their straw, to lay the foundation of their
owne names and gentility; that teaching other men
their land-markes and bounds, they may likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their owne priuate inclosures. Welfare the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who if he enioy nothing else, yet sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he doth enioy himselfe; valuing himselfe aboue the
price of the whole world: and therin consists the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his wealth, vsing the turbulent waues of his
owne passions, and the sweet calme of his intellectuall
faculties, not distracted with any wandring imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
besides himselfe.</p>
            <p>Before I can be dismissed the Court, I pra'y giue me
leaue to make one motion to the Iudges. When they
ride to their Assises, all the whole countrey attends
them, (for they beare the Kings person): the Sheriffes,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3385:102"/>
the vnder-Sheriffes,<note place="margin">The Iudges.</note> Bayliffes, Constables, Headbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs;
all must waite vpon them, with Halbards,
Pikes, Billes, while all the people stand gazing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
them. Assoone as the great Assises are ended,
and their Lordships gone and departed, then all this
goodly retinue doth presently attend the condemned
prisoners, to guard them, and to see the execution.
When I viewed and considered this, me thought, the
Iudges were either like the condemned prisoners, or
the prisoners like them; for both are attended alike, we
gaze and looke vpon both, and both are alike carried
to the place of execution. The Iudges (I confesse) haue
somewhat the greater distance, and this distance is the
sole difference; for certainly they are carried, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they goe, the neerer they approch to the place of
execution: notwithstanding they ride in their circuits,
yet they shall come to a period. In euery great vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
some of them drop, and here the Iudges like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
men, are now brought to the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
they that can giue life to others, in sparing their
liues, cannot adde a daies respite to their owne: Iudges
they are, and yet like poore delinquents, they shall
stand at Gods barre, where no appeale shall be allowed
them, and therein their condition is no more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to ours.</p>
            <p>From the suburbes, where I will leaue the Lawyers,
let vs come to the rich Citizens: If now they liue in
plentie and wealth, it is well knowne that (in their
younger yeeres) their wealth hath been gotten by spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
thriftinesse and wants;<note place="margin">The Citizens.</note> if they please to cast vp ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
they shall finde themselues so much indebted
to themselues, as that besides the interest, they shall
hardly bee able to make restitution for the principall.
Now that their stomackes begin to faile them, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile
if they bee serued vp with full dishes, and a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3385:102"/>
table; for if they would suppose the meate to bee
painted, it would as well suffice their appetites. Now
that they are troubled with gowtes, with palsies, and
the weaknesse of old age, they begin to keepe a stable
well furnisht with horses, as if they were to grow
young againe, and did intend to become horsemen or
ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ters; they conceiue as much ioy to see their seruants
vse them, as if their owne crasie bodies were thereby
exercised.</p>
            <p>In telling ouer great summes of money our fingers
grow black: as yet I neuer knew any man, that by his
husbandrie and honest manuall labour could euer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to an Aldermans wealth. The Citizens know how
to estimate the laying out of their money, their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and trade, their skill in buying and selling, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon aduantage with other mens ignorance, and
to vnderualue poore mens labours: yet they must not
take it vnkindly, if sometimes their Charters be called
in question; for the Church hath lost al her priuiledges,<note place="margin">Their wealth.</note> which certainly were grounded vpon a farre greater
right. Neither will I examine, whether Companies and
Corporations bee preiudiciall to a publike state; sure I
am, that such societies of men neuer made lawes or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
amongst themselues, preiudiciall to themselues.
God send that the secrets and mysteries of trades,
(whereof I am wholly ignorant, and which are best
knowne to themselues), may well stand with vpright
and iust dealing. Indeed being once made Magistrates,
then they begin to looke vnto measures, and weights;
and therein wee commend their iustice, and doe well
hope, and doe heartily wish, that their own wealth had
been gotten with like measure. But if by ingrossing of
wares, and monopolizing of commodities, they haue
exceedingly enriched themselues, let them not thinke
with a small summe of money, bestowed upon Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3385:103"/>
to make restitution; for the punishment must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
be answerable to the offence.</p>
            <p>Their daintie liuing makes them the more tender;
being well fed, and warmely clothed, yet they cannot
preuent all vnseasonable weather; and therefore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are ouertaken,<note place="margin">Their miseries.</note> they sicken and dye, with a
little wet, or a small cold: according to the fashion of
the old world, euery man ought to accustome himselfe
to endure some hardnesse. The greatnes of their wealth
is not alwaies for the safetie of their persons; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it serues to stirre vp ielousies and feares; full often
haue I seene it scattered by heires and executors. I
commend their wisedome in getting of wealth, if it be
by honest and iust meanes; but I doe not commend
many of their iudgements, who know not, that the
happinesse of wealth consists in the vse. Or rather I will
proue charitable, to thinke them very iust in all their
dealings; iust (I say) if not to all others, yet to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
for knowing that they deserue little, they desire
to bestow little vpon themselues, but to leaue it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who happily may better deserue it. And as it is
gotten, so it is spent; we must passe our inheritance with
the same right and title, wherewith it was purchased:
if it were gotten with dishonestie, assuredly it will bee
spent with dishonestie, <hi>res transit cum suo onere.</hi> When
all their whole life is past, me thinkes it is like one of
their shewes, wherein Pageants are gazed vpon in the
day time, and in the night are dissolued; the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some little remnant is hung vp in their Halles, and
the rest passeth away like a shadow, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mention or memorie.</p>
            <p>Suppose me to be a wandring pilgrime now in the
state of the way, directing my course vnto happinesse. I
should lose my selfe in these thickers and groues, and
should proue very tedious to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader,<note place="margin">He recals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> vnlesse I should
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3385:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue often recourse to my Carde, consider my first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
scope, and giue an account of my trauell. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
I haue made a diligent search, where in this
world I might finde out contentment, and happinesse;
or where any true ioy might seeme to inhabite. First I
began with the Church, where I found nothing but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
all in decay, spoyled of her substance. From thence
I went to the fruitful and pleasant soiles, where I found
that the Gentrie were likewise very miserable in their
owne kinde. At length I made bold to speake of the
Law, as if I had been serued vp with a Processe, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
at the barre, where I found no rest, no peace, no
contentment. Then I went to the Citie walles, where
in euery streete, I made inquirie for happinesse, at what
signe this happinesse might dwell, in what trade, course
and condition of life. And receiuing no manner of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
yet hearing much talke and newes of the
Court, and of the greatnes of our Nobles, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to goe, and knocke at the Court gates, there to
enquire, whether true ioy and happinesse be a follower
and attendant of theirs; to what stocke or familie, to
what state or faction, she is chained and vnited; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she keepes her certaine lodging, or sometimes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
a progresse; yet still resides, and is conuersant
with them, or at least with some of them, as the fauour
and fortune of the times shall best serue for their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>When I looke vp to the Nobles, they seeme at first
sight, to bee like starres in the firmament, all clothed
with happinesse and honour; but when I come neerer,<note place="margin">The Nobles.</note>
I see that no state of men is so dangerous. Some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in their owne proud and ambitiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> desires, preuenting
and supplanting each other; in so much that in stead of
noble bloud, they seeme to consist of quicke-siluer, or
some spirit of bloud: either they must build castles in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3385:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ayre, or else they will pull downe vpon their owne
heads the tower of confusion: they know not the state
of consistencie, that things may exceed as well in their
greatnes and growth, as in their smalnes and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Looke to the framing and constitution of mans
bodie, all other parts, excepting the head, must haue
their fellowes &amp; their associates in like proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
themselues; feete, legges, thighes, armes, ribs, al of them
haue others equall to themselues: to exceede and to
swell vp, were as great a deformitie and as dangerous,
as to pine and to bee diminished; they must all of them
keep the same proportion, and all come vnder the head,
by the length of a whole necke.</p>
            <p>Be their estate neuer so great, their reuenewes neuer
so large, yet still their charge and expense seemes to
ballance them, if not to exceed them: and all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
little remaines; which in effect is as much, as if
I had little substance,<note place="margin">Their miseries.</note> and lesse vse and employment for
my little substance. The last age hath much eclipsed
their greatnes, reducing as all waters to one fountaine,
all light to one Sunne, so all power and obedience to
one stocke, obseruing an equalitie of iustice to all the
seuerall members vnder one head: for you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
that the great offices of the kingdome haue fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
whose power did seeme to exceede the fit and due
bounds of subiection. The highest titles of dignitie and
honour haue failed: for as in the naturall bodie, so in
the politicall bodie, there should be a certaine distance
between the head and the members; yet still they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the spectacles of the world, and sometimes (to
their great charge) they purchase the loue of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they shall finde, if not dangerous, yet fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and wholly vnprofitable. But most commonly
they are subiect to hate, and therefore seruants must be
appointed, as to carrie vp their traines behinde them, so
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3385:104"/>
to support their hate, that they themselues might be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from feare, and that the least aspersion of words
might not touch their honors. And sometimes these
seruants though innocent in themselues, and very well
deseruing, (but Lords must not be ouer much indebted
for great seruices) they must be made a publicke exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of iustice; for thus it fals out with nobles, euen from
the time of their infancie, being taught and instructed
by their schoolemasters; others whom they loue, shall
smart and be corrected for their negligence.</p>
            <p>From nobles, I must ascend by degrees vnto Princes,
and if there were any true ioy in the creature, I do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it would be found in their persons: for so the world
esteemes them happy and great. And no maruell, for
they beare the person of vs all, and therefore great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that as we receiue from them our plenty, our peace,
and our happinesse; so we should againe returne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
vnto them with due thankfulnes,<note place="margin">Princes.</note> as part of our
plenty in our subsidies, our labours and seruices in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
our homage, to recompence their care and
watchfulnes: so likewise part of our happinesse (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be excluded from the royall prerogatiue).
And thus wee should conceiue, that as the princely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
containes all other states of men within the
Spheare of his gouernment; so it should pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ake in a
large measure all their happinesse. And as it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
estate heere vpon earth, so it should most freely es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
from these earthly contagions; while the whole
burthen and weight of the miseries doe fall and light
vpon others. And thus in their persons, I might consider
all the happinesse, which is incident to whole mankind:
not presuming to speake of Gods annoynted, without
due reuerence, I will briefly touch their miseries.</p>
            <p>First for their persons, notwithstanding their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
intelligence, their watchfulnes and care for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3385:105"/>
of their owne persons and states:<note place="margin">Their danger.</note> yet certainly
the poore man in his homely cottage liues with far
greater safety, and sometimes with much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
then they doe in their royall pallaces. They
haue a guard I confesse, many seruants and officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for defence of themselues: but here is the
mischiefe, <hi>quis custodiet ipsos custodes,</hi> who shall guard
them from their owne guard? or who knowes, whether
their seruants receiue any pensions from their enemies?
As they sit highest, and in the greatest view and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
so they serue as the fairest markes to be aimed at.
And therfore in regard of the eminencie of their estate,
and the greatnesse of their personage, amiddest the
throng and multitudes of dangers and perils, many
things may be allowed and tolerated in them, for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themselues, which to a man of a priuat condition
were meere iniustice, wrong and oppression. Suppose
the imprisonment or punishment of any one of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
by way of preuention or caution to an ensuing
mischiefe: this is tolerable I confesse, but herein I feare,
least many Princes haue exceeded the boundes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
and iustice. Yet I may speake it to Gods glory
and to our owne comfort, the dayes heere in England
were neuer so free from feare and suspition, as they are
at this present, vnder the happy gouernment of our
most gratious King <hi>Iames:</hi> who herein seemes to excell
all other princes, that so great learning and such a deepe
vnderstanding, should bee accompanied with such a
harmeles and innocent disposition. And this serues for
his best sheild of defence, against all forraine inuasions,
or home-bred conspiracies: <hi>God make vs thankefull for
these blessings, and long preserue his raigne ouer vs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the times of their wars, the common practise and
desire of Princes is, to ad kingdomes to kingdomes;
which if they should effect,<note place="margin">In their wars.</note> with much bloudshed and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3385:105"/>
slaughter of their people, yet therein they should not
any way increase their owne wealth; they should not
strengthen their power, but should fight with distracted
forces, and make themselues lesse secure of their owne:
<hi>imperia mole ruunt sua,</hi> kingdomes must haue their
boundes, and I hope (by Gods grace) I shall see the
Turkish Empire fall with his owne weight. Againe in
peaceable times,<note place="margin">In peace.</note> and at their owne homes, as all men
desire to obserue and to please them; so sometimes they
desire as much, and shall finde it a worke of far greater
difficulty, to giue contentment to the whole commons
in generall, as their subiects do to them in particular:
and heere is some part of requital, some kinde of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
as all to one, so one to all.</p>
            <p>If their happines consists in their gouernment and
rule, for in all other things their seruants do share with
them, in their diet, their garments, their gardens, their
pallaces, their pleasures: yet all men haue not the like
practicall disposition to delight in gouernment;<note place="margin">Wherein their happinesse consists.</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is committed to others; and there may be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
contemplation, full of sweet comfort, without
this worldly and troublesome imployment: The last
Roman Emperour was more addicted to his priuat stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
then to the managing of his owne publicke state.
But suppose, that as Princes are the fountaines of power,
and cannot bereaue themselues of their power, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
impart an independent power vnto others, they
should therefore take the sole gouernment into their
owne hands; yet sometimes (through a tractable and
good nature) they are easily entreated, I will not say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ruled,
(which is the same in effect) by others; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering, that it cannot stand with their owne
greatnesse, to search all things themselues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must of necessity borrow their information
from others: now here is an excellent point of wisdome,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3385:106"/>
when vnder colour of aduise and good counsell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they shall haue thankes for their labour, and rewards
for their good seruice; their seruants shall so cunningly
ouer-rule an action, as that they may worke their owne
ends.</p>
            <p>No maruell, if Princes be very tender in the point of
their prerogatiue; which indeed is so necessary, and so
essentiall to gouernment, as that without it, gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot subsist: and therefore it were high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to examine this prerogatiue;<note place="margin">Their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue.</note> for as it is in the
gouernment of nature, so should it be in mans gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
God indeed hath prescribed certaine bounds to
the creatures, <hi>datur maximu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; minimum in vnoquoque
genere;</hi> but what these bounds should bee, for the iust
measure and limitation, we are wholy ignorant: there
are giants, there are dwarffs, the Ocean sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croacheth
vpon the land, and sometimes the land wins
ground of the Ocean. And thus it is in mans gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there are <hi>arcana imperij,</hi> certaine hidden secrets
of state, which ought not to bee discussed or expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
to prescribe a limitation of power, would argue a
kinde of subiection in a free Monarch. If euer question
be made of their power, I will fall downe on my knees,
and desire God to preuent the first occasion; that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their gouernment, may intend Gods glory, the
good of his Church, the comfort of his people; and
that subiects knowing whose power and authority they
haue, may worship God in the Magistrate, with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and obedience. For if the parts should oppose
themselues to the head, if the hand or the foote should
contend with the eye, what a miserable distraction
should you finde in the whole man? Gouernment
should rather tend to vnity, then be an occasion of strife
and disagreement: let all parts rather striue to gaine
each other, and to preuent each other with mutuall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3385:106"/>
kinde offices of loue, then contending with needlesse
questions, to disquiet themselues before any iust cause
be offered.</p>
            <p>I say, not to examine the prerogatiue of Princes, or to
what lawes they are subiect; for I will easily yeeld, that
where they are not expresly mentioned, and doe binde
themselues by their owne royall assent, there they are
to be excluded:<note place="margin">Their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly death.</note> according to the president and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
of nature, <hi>semper excipiendum est primum in vno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoque
genere.</hi> Yet sure I am, that they are not exempted
from the miseries and sorrowes of our nature, which
seeme to be incident and common to flesh and bloud;
for nature in making her lawes requires no royal assent,
and this shall appeare by this one instance. I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
this in my reading, that most of the Princes, and
especially the greatest, if they escaped the cursed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of cruell murtherers and traytors; I say, in most
of them you shall finde, that their death hath bin sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
or rather hastened with a griefe of minde, a deepe
melancholy, and a great discontentment. That God
might make it appeare, that there is no true ioy in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that God might let them vnderstand their owne
pride, who being flattered by their seruants and slaues,
did expect that the winde and the sea should obay
them. Hauing neuer learned true christian patience and
humility, though they conquered their enemies, yet
the least griefe did vanquish them; though they subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great nations, and ruled great kingdomes yet could
they not rule their owne passions. It is impossible that
a mortall man should be freed from all cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of griefe,
though hee were an absolute Monarch of the whole
world; Princes must learne patience, for amongst all
their prerogatiues, they shall finde none, whereby they
are exempted and excluded from sorrow, which indeed
is incident to the whole nature of man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:3385:107"/>Thus heere I haue briefly runne thorough all the
happy states of men, that so I might say with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>omnia factus sum omnibus, vt aliquos lucrarer;</hi> and
truly I do finde, that God hath inclosed all men in one
common depth of misery. For if ioy (and true ioy) could
bee competent to this our corrupted nature, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
God would neuer haue expelled man paradise:
for heere was the wisdome of God,<note place="margin">Wherefore serue our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</note> that whereas bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and happinesse could not containe man within
the bounds of obedience, therefore man being thrust
into a vaile of misery, his owne sorrow might inforce
him to crie for succour and releife. That so the iustice
of God might appeare in the iust punishment of sinne,
that so it might serue as a more forcible meanes for
mans repentance and conuersion; for in this sinfull
state, man is more moued with feare and sorrow, then
with thankfulnesse or hope. Though I cannot peirce
the clouds, and open the heauens to shew the maiesty
and glory of God, for no man could euer see God and
liue: though I cannot allure and entice man with a true
relation and discouerie of those heauenly ioyes; though
I cannot oblige and binde man vnto God, in the
chaines and linkes of true loue and thankfulne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from God, which might concerne either body

redemption, sanctification, &amp;c. Yet am I able
in some sort to anatomize the state of man, to lay open
his miseries and griefe, that being once out of the arke,
and seeing these turbulent waues, hee might finde no
resting place, but againe returne to the arke; taking a
dislike and a distaste in nature, he might be thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of his flight, and so finde safe refuge and shelter in
Gods onely protection, and comfort himselfe in the
hope and expectation of a better world to succeed; as all

            <p>From the seuerall states of men, let vs come to the
seuerall dispositions of man in himselfe; obserue the
changes and reuolutions of our mindes,<note place="margin">The seuerall delights of our age.</note> for (if you
please) we will trace them by degrees, from the time of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ancy, how they alter with the course of our age.
First wee begin to delight in crackers and toyes, some
little bable hung about the necke, some corall with sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bels, or a little Christall: but these seeme to be the
proper implements belonging to the cradle; they are
indeed the Nurses ornaments, and together with the
cradle they must be left for succession.</p>
            <p>We are no sooner hatched, but presently wee must
haue a feather in the cap, a dagger at the backe; then
in stead of a true paradise,<note place="margin">The delights of our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> we are brought into a fooles
paradise; wee are made to beleeue, that all is ours; the
land is ours, the house is ours, the goods, possessions, all
are ours: seeme to take away any thing, and the whole
house shall not bee able to containe vs; exclude but
any one fruite, it shal grieue vs more, then the enioying
of all the fruites of the garden can asswage vs. Now at
length begins our sports; for our recreation we runne
puffing, blowing, sweating, and wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied in hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
butterflyes, (here is excellent sport indeed); for our
callings and courses of life, we purchase pinnes, poynts,
and cherie-stones; these we adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture at seuerall games,
that so very profitably we might increase our stock, our
wealth and our treasure: this is our trade and course of
life, and heere is thrift and frugalitie from the cradle.
But in the meane time giue me leaue to complaine of a
point of iniustice, I protest it is meere iniustice; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and schoolemasters whip them for idlenesse; idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
what idlenesse? I would they were no more idle
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3385:108"/>
themselues: in truth they doe them great wrong, for
they are as painfull, as earnest, as attentiue to their own
gaine, as possibly any man can be in his ordinarie voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
there is as great sorrow in the losse of a poynt,
and as true ioy in the winning of a few pinnes, as if they
were farre better merchandize. If you tell me of the
basenesse of the commoditie; my answere is, that the
whole world is but a point, all is but vanitie, and all
consists in the fansie.</p>
            <p>When our stock after a few yeeres is increased, then
we desire to trade with the merchant-pedler; his packe
is opened, we come to the mart, here wee buy lases and
glasses,<note place="margin">The delights of our elder yeeres.</note> bugles and bracelets, ribons and roses; O the
most profitablest member of the Common-wealth!
nothing grieues vs so much, as that we haue not credit,
to take vp money at interest, to buy these rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
commodities: as for the Schooles, wee cannot
yet be resolued, nor cannot possibly conceiue, why there
should be such places of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts appointed for so little
purpose. At length wee are conducted to the Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
where wee begin to admire, the rare and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
learning of a Sophister, who can so punctually
discourse of the elements; though hee wants money to
buy bookes, yet he can dispute of the tincture of gold.
And thus, if I shall runne thorough all the seuerall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Schooles, from the Lamb-skinne to the Skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;
or if I should diuert my course, and consider any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state and condition of life, the profession of Law,
their Magistrates and officers; the Citizens with their
Companies and Corporations; the Courtiers with their
honours and dignities; I might conclude all with this
one axiome in policie, that things, which consist in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
are greater furthest off, then neerest at hand.</p>
            <p>But I cannot content my selfe, thus to runne through
the courses of our liues, you shall then obserue, the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3385:108"/>
strange different iudgements in one and the same man,
according to the periods of his age, as concerning the
delights of his age: for as we grow elder and elder, so
we dislike our former condition,<note place="margin">The degrees of our age ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to decads.</note> and therein seeme to
accuse it of follie. Before wee come to tenne yeeres of
age, we haue no iudgement at al, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
passe our iudgement; but being come to those
yeeres, wee will not bee handled and dallied like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
wee will not be so easily led with faire promises,
but we grow head-strong, and thinke our selues wiser
then our teachers. If once wee attaine vnto twentie,
then we make choice of the course of our liues; if any
one shal tell vs of our childishnes, or call vs by the most
opprobrious name of boyes, wee hold it a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
a foule shame and disparagement to our selues;
for wee seeme so farre to dislike their sports, that wee
scorne to conuerse with them. Comming once vnto
thirtie, then wee bethinke our selues, that the time is
come, when we might doe the King and the countrey
some seruice, that the world might take notice of our
sufficiencie; we doe likewise thinke of our mariage, to
what stock and familie we might ioyne our selues; and
we affect nothing so much as wisdome and discretion,
that leauing the riotous and dissolute courses of young
men, we might be reputed Sages. When once wee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
vnto fortie, then wee begin to feare and distrust,
lest all our former vaine hopes will faile vs; wee will
not so much relie vpon others, but looke to our selues,
be carefull to prouide for our wiues and our children;
enquire after purchases, and desire to enlarge our owne
meanes. When fiftie yeeres are expired, then wee take
thought of placing our daughters in mariage, taking
order to prouide for our youngest sonnes, and here we
begin to affect gouernment; experience hath made vs
wise, we finde the losse of our former errors, and if we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3385:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were to begin the world againe, wee would alter our
course, &amp;c. At length six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e drawes on, when all our

               </gap>mactericall yeere, and begin to distrust
our owne liues. If seuentie yeeres doe passe ouer, then
we expect the reuerence of fathers, we are froward and
testie and hard to bee pleased; the inward griefe makes
euery outward obiect, seeme to bee a iust occasion of
griefe; we condemne of follie and vanitie, all the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of life, all the states in the world, all the actions of
men, accusing the times, when as indeed the alteration
consists in our selues; vntill a length we bid adiew to
all worldly ioyes, and betake our selues to our ease, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
our dissolution.</p>
            <p>Suppose a rich man of this world, were now vpon
the point of death, how often should this man bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to make his last Will and Testament,<note place="margin">The censure of a dead man.</note> to leaue all
things in quiet and peaceable possession? what wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
what sealings, what witnesses, how many Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
how many Lawyers should bee imployed? when
all this time they seeme to neglect that <hi>vnum necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
the preparation of his soule for God; that in his
death he might be a true Christian sacrifice, an oblation
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eely offered vp vnto God. Suppose (I pray') that a
few houres were past, and this rich man dead; and that
I could by some strange inchantment raise vp his spirit,
or make this dead man speake: then I would demaund
of him, what hee thought of the greatnes and glorie of
this world. Assuredly he would lesse esteeme of all the
kingdomes, empires, wealth, and worldly honour, then
we doe at this time of the toyes and trifles of children:
and certainly as it is with the dead, in respect of vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
shall it be with vs in respect of our posteritie; wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
them, and our posteritie shall forget vs; wee looke
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3385:109"/>
onely to the present, and therein losing the dignitie of
the reasonable soule, which consists in the foresight, we
are carried like beasts in the strength of our owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue laboured, to shew the greatnesse of mans
miserie in the truth of his sorrow, while all his suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
ioyes and delights,<note place="margin">Wherein mans greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> seeme to be meere vanities, and
to consist in the fansie, and in his owne apprehension;
if you doubt of this, I will alleage certaine instances,
that so it may appeare by experience I would heere
gladly aske, wherein man receiues his greatest content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
I suppose either 1. in his sweete conuenient
dwelling and habitation, 2. or in his apparell and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
3. or in his diet and foode, 4. or in his goods and
his substance, 5. or lastly, in the comelinesse of his own
person. These are the things, wherein the mind of man
seemes to delight; which if you please to obserue, you
shall finde that the fansie doth ouerrule all: and as men
doe perswade themselues, according to those ends
which men doe propose vnto themselues; thereafter
they frame and fashion to themselues some kinde of
contentment, supposing that in the creature, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is bred in their fansie.</p>
            <p>Certainly of al worldly contentments, there is none
like to the home-contentment, wherein the Master dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
all things to his best liking;<note place="margin">The home-contentment.</note> nothing can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
him, all his seruants are bound to obey him; he is
as a Prince in his familie, it were pettie treason to offer
violence to his person, his house is his castle; if he takes
the refuge of his house, and his enemie pursues him, he
may lawfully kill him in his owne defence, for heere is
his last refuge. This not only our law allowes, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
seemes to imprint it; the least bird in his own nest;
the weakest creature at his own denne, and in his own
home, will set vpon the greatest and strongest, and put
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3385:110"/>
him to flight. There is no contentment to the home-contentment;
and therefore those creatures which
carrie their tents or houses about them, these are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be the happie creatures, as Snailes, Tortoyes,
Oysters, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But suppose, that the Magistrate should inforce me
to keepe mine own home, that mine own house should
proue mine owne prison; Lord how I should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
to lose mine own liberty! all my places of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
should giue me no contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">Our houses are sometimes our prisons.</note> my seruants would
seeme to be my keepers and iaylors, and mine owne
doores would seeme to bee the prison gates: then I
should want elbow-roome, complaine for want of
fresh ayre: what a torment it is to be incaged, &amp; what a
happinesse it is to conuerse and to liue in the societies
of men! See here, there is no change or alteration in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the house is the same, the furniture the same, the
lodging and dwelling the same; only the difference is
in the minde, and the fansie: before we conceiued our
state to be a libertie, and now we thinke it a thraldome
and slauerie; here is the difference, and all consists in
the fansie. Againe, if I were a mercilesse Vsurer, and
that any one of my debtors (for feare of an arrest)
should keepe his owne house, I would gladly aske,
what difference there is betweene his condition and
his imprisonment? and truly this very thought should
moue my hard heart to compassion. Why should the
laitie so much oppose themselues to Church-Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
which might still haue continued in a tolerable
sort: for what were the Sanctuaries but religious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?
where true penitentiaries in the thraldome of
their bodies, with mortification and sorrow, might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
the actions of pietie and deuotion.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie side, leauing the thraldome of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
let vs come to the sumptuous and magnificent
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3385:110"/>
buildings.<note place="margin">The pleasure of the house is according to mans owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</note> If a King or a Nobleman shall commit the
keeping of one of his best and fairest houses, to the trust
of his seruant; the house cost many thousands in the
building, the seruant makes choice of his own roomes,
and takes al the delight that the house can affoord him;
the gardens well dressed, the houses repaired, all at his
Masters charge, and himselfe well paied for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
yet all this will not serue, his life is a slauerie, hee
holds himselfe a drudge for another mans seruice, and
lookes vpon this beautifull building, as his charge or
his trouble, but not as his pleasure. Whereas the good
old Master, that liues in the Citie, fansies to himselfe a
pleasure in his countrie-dwelling: and being merily
disposed, loues to discourse of the conuenient walkes,
and of the neate-contriued buildings; it should seeme
hee sees it with some strange opticke glasses, for his
gowte will not permit him to trauell, and to enioy
these pleasures; or rather he conceiues the platforme,
and builds in his own fansie and imagination. It were
to be wished, that rather he would looke vp to heauen,
and there conceiue an earnest of that ioy, which by the
speciall mercie of God, shall be imparted vnto him, in a
full measure and consummation.</p>
            <p>For our apparell, see how the whole world runnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
wandring, and gadding, in the strength of their owne
imaginations; euery moneth brings foorth a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
which for a time seemes to be the best: I must not
stay long vpon fashions,<note place="margin">Our delight in our apparell.</note> which alwaies alter &amp; change,
lest I my selfe might proue out of fashion. Let vs search
out for some new stuffe; euery nation, though proud
of her selfe, and boasts of her selfe, and esteemes her self
aboue others, yet she scornes to weare her owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
and home-bred commodities. The English cloath,
which here we neglect at home, when it hath inriched
the Merchant, discharged the custome, and paied for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3385:111"/>
the carriage, then the Dutchman esteemes it at a high
price; while wee on the other side desire to clothe our
selues with the Naple silke, with farre fetcht and deare
bought outlandish wares. Thus other Countries like
ours, and we like theirs; it may be, we intend to deceiue
each other in the sale: sure I am, though wee differ in
iudgement, yet wee agree in the vanitie, and all of vs
grow wanton in our owne dispositions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As it is in our clothing, so it is in our food; for fooles
must haue their ladles, aswell as their partie-coloured
coates. When we liue in the Inland countries, then we
begin to long for sea-fish;<note place="margin">Our vanitie in our diet.</note> as is the scarsitie and price,
so is our longing and desire; where there is plentie,
there we neglect it. Me thinkes the Colchester Oysters
neuer taste so well, as when they are bought in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton:
fresh Salmon at Newcastle is meate for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
and colliers, for no man of worth will respect it;
the Phesant in Wales eates no better then a Pulle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; in
London wee desire to feede vpon poultrie, and in our
countrie houses we thirst for a cup of neate wine; wee
temper our sweete meates with sowre sauces: and thus
we are growne wanton. Sometimes when we haue not
whereof to complaine, we will long for fruites out of
season; a few cherries in May shall be sold for their
weight siluer, when in the latter end of Iune, they
shall not be worth the gathering. And thus we desire a
new course of nature, and will not conforme our selues
to Gods appointed good order.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For our goods or our substance; what great varietie
appeares in our choice and estimation?<note place="margin">Mans different valuation of his owne wealth.</note> Sometimes the
siluer is raised, sometimes the gold is inhaunced; and
both of them, though otherwise the principall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
yet they follow mans owne valuation: if money
were made of leather, it would be as currant, as if it
were made of the most refined gold. As in numbring,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3385:111"/>
we vse counters sometimes for digets, sometimes for
hundreds, sometimes for thousands; so is it in mans va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation
of his owne wealth. In some parts of India
copper is respected before gold; and sometimes steele
for their weapons and armour, cannot be bought with
the weight in siluer. What strange difference and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
haue I knowne in our estimation of Iewels and
gemmes? sometimes the Rubie, sometimes the Pearle,
aswell as the Diamond, growes in request; for these
must follow the course of the times. And therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
he is reputed the wise man, not who frames and
fashions himselfe according to right reason, but he that
can square himselfe according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condition of those
times wherein hee liues; for things are not accounted
according to the truth and goodnesse of their nature,
neither are all things as they appeare, but as they are
esteemed among men. And herein especially consists
the regall power of man, that as it is proper to Princes,
to make their own coynes, and to proclaime them; so,
as man himselfe accounts of the creatures, or stands in
want of the creatures, thereafter they carrie their due
valuation.</p>
            <p>It is no marueile, if we doe so much differ in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
goods, our substance and treasure;<note place="margin">The beautie of different complexions.</note> for I do much more
wonder, how it is possible, that man should so farre mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
himselfe in his owne person, I meane concerning
his comelinesse and beautie; for I will not extend my
speech at this time, but onely to the sensible and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
parts of man. As for example, with vs the sanguine
and cleere complection, the soft flaxen or browne
haire, the smooth skinne, the blacke and quick eye, are
most commendable, for the comelinesse of our parts:
but it should seeme, that the greatest part of the world
is not of our iudgement; for the Aethiopians or Moores
doe not esteeme him beautifull, that hath not a blacke
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3385:112"/>
and sooty skinne, a grislie hard-twisted and curld black
haire, great lips, and albugineous eye: from the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,
if wee should visite the Indians, there it should
seeme the tawnie colour is most in request; and the
hard skinne tand with the Sunnes heate, seemes to bee
the faire and beautifull complection. And thus we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
agree vpon our owne colours: the same fauour is
not alike pleasing to all nations; if wee should with a
generall consent borrow our beautie from one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
boxe, then happily there would be some kinde of
agreement: but now in our naturall constitution, see
the great difference, when euery man must fansie a set
forme of beautie to himselfe, and please himselfe with
that beautie.</p>
            <p>Thus (I hope) it hath appeared, that whatsoeuer is
best pleasing to man, it is therefore best pleasing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
man himselfe conceiues the greatest pleasure
therein: not because he is so naturally inclined, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is moued with the truth of things, according
to their goodnesse, for so all men should be alike affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
reason is the same in all, and euery other thing
doth naturally incline to the best; onely man hauing a
free will to make his owne choice,<note place="margin">We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne nature, if we iustifie our selues.</note> the libertie of his
choice is not guided by nature, or by reason, but by his
affection. Otherwise we should not disagree in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and comelinesse: for the Owle will not boast of
her beautie, but is ashamed of her selfe. We should not
differ or vary in our goods, or our substance, but should
iudge and esteeme all things, according to the in-bred
and naturall goodnesse: for there are degrees in the
creatures, both in themselues, and as they are fitted for
mans present vse and occasions. We should be all clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
alike, as flowers and fruits of the same kinde, haue
alwaies the same colours: our diet and food should be
alike, as it is to all other creatures, whose nature is the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3385:112"/>
same: neither should wee so much dissent in our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and habitations; for birds in building their nests,
and beasts in making their caues, seeme to obserue the
same rules of art and proportion. And therefore wee
must either accuse nature of follie, to iustifie our selues,
or else we must truly acknowledge, that wee our selues
are not carried, according to the truth of things, but in
the strong apprehension of our owne fansie.</p>
            <p>But heere is all the difficultie,<note place="margin">How hardly men are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from these fansies.</note> how I should weane
man from these fansies; I could wish that in all my
dealings with men, I might meet with reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for then I should know, vpon what grounds I
might deale; I might gesse how farre by all likelihood
and probabilitie I should preuaile; for wee are both
squared to one rule, the same reason would direct vs
both. But if I meete with vnreasonable men, I know
not what course to take; being once out of the rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
lost in the woods, I know not where to make
search for them: and if by great chance I should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them, yet I cannot accompanie them thorough
thickets and bushes; but must reduce them againe to a
great rode, make them first capable of reason, that so I
might softly and leisurely proceede vpon my owne
grounds. To disswade the whole world from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
of these vanities, were a worke impossible; for if
I should speake with the tongue of men and Angels, I
should neuer preuaile, they are so farre besotted, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured,
made drunken with the immoderate loue of
the creatures. As, if their stomackes were ouerlaid with
new wine; the fumes, vapours, and spirits ascending,
would choake vp the braine, and hinder the right vse of
their vnderstanding: so is it outwardly with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;

behold God, and truly to know him, being indeed the

withhould him from the loue of his maker; if the eye
could behold the sunne, we should neuer cast our eyes
from the sunne, as being the most beautifull obiect, but
this cannot stand with our weaknesse; for now God is
concealed as in the vaile of his manhood, so thou seest
not his hinder parts, but onely his shadow in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, should keepe vs from the loue of the creatures.</note> if for want of sufficient light, being left
to thy selfe, thou still continue in darkenes; and that the
meditation of God, together with all thy blessings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from God, in the whole course of thy life, with
all the promises of ioy to succeed, haue not such an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue
power, as that they can draw thee to God; then
consider thine owne proper misery, and all thy supposed
ioyes, and pleasures to be but meere vanities, and delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
such as can giue thee no true contentment or ioy.
For a Postiller brings forth this instance, (very fitly to
this purpose); A rawe bone, wherein there was neither
moysture nor sap, was cast to a hungry dog for his pray;
the dog very greedily bites and gnawes on it, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3385:113"/>
the hardnesse to be such, as that it would not easily
yeeld to his teeth, yet he forsakes it not, but at length
bites his owne lip, and finding the warmth and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his owne bloud, therein begins to delight, and
thinkes it comes from the bone: and thus it is with all
our worldly pleasures, we esteeme them for pleasures,
the world houldes them for pleasures, men doe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
repute them for pleasures; and I protest, heere is all
the pleasure I finde in them. <hi>Voluptates non venientes
sed abeuntes respice,</hi> bee rightly informed of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
doe not esteeme of them, as they come vnto thee,
in the greedines of thy minde, and thy passion: but as
they leaue and forsake thee, then remember thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and iudge of them accordingly; and let the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
heereof giue thee occasion to dislike and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste
nature, and to hasten thy approach vnto God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Neuer man found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the creatures.</note> if neither meditation of God, nor the view
of these vanities can sufficiently instruct thee; then I
could wish, that thou hadst a glut and surfeit of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and that triall were made, what contentment
nature could yeeld thee. Certaine it is, that if there
may be a surfeit, then the creatures are to bee taken in
moderation; and that they are not the scope of mans
happines. As (for example) suppose I were sicke, I would
desire health without limitation; health, health, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but health; but for my physicke be it neuer so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
and pretious, yet still I would take it in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
dozis and measure (as it were) to be fitted for the
recouery of my health. Now certaine it is, that there
may be a surfet, for otherwise why shouldest thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the variety and succession of thy pleasures and
sports? but suppose thou hadst all possible contentment,
which nature could assoord thee; yet grow wise by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
iudge of thy selfe by others, runne ouer all
former examples, consider all states, callings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3385:114"/>
of men, and as it is with them, so conceiue it
would bee with thy selfe. <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing gotten
the whole world, began to enquire, whether there were
any more worlds to bee conquered; for it is not this
world that can giue vs contentment: we must lay seige
to another world, heauen must suffer violence; and
therefore the spouse in the Canticles is compared to an
armie and hoste of fighting men, fighting for victory
and triumph.</p>
            <p>To giue thee some ease and recreation, in this my
longe tedious discourse; I will heere tell thee a tale, to
this purpose.<note place="margin">The tale of a religious man.</note> A certaine religious man, hauing often
disswaded some worldlings fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the immoderat loue of
the creatures, and being neuer able to preuaile; at length
bethought himselfe how he might satisfie their desires,
and resolued on this course; that if he could but giue
them a glut and surfeit of the creatures, then they
would the more easily forbeare. And calling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
making his complaint that hee could no more
moue them, with his earnest and continuall perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
in the end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould them, that now it had pleased
God, to deale so gratiously both with him and with
them, as that hee had sufficient plenty, whereby hee
might satisfie all their requests; and to this end, wished
them to ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ise, what one thing in this world might
giue them all contentment. Heere began a wise and a
serious consultation amongst them, what they should
aske; some desired all their portion in siluer and gould,
but others seemed to refuse that motion, for the same
coyne is not euery where current<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it only followes
mans valuation; they did likewise feare and suspect his
chimicall gould, which (as they had heard) was onely
counterfeit, and had not the naturall and true proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of gould, and was not physicall, and would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the touch: others therefore thought fit, to beg
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3385:114"/>
silkes, wares, and houshold stuffe: but heere was a great
doubt; for if they should haue them in such plentie,
they would beare no rate, neither could they long be
continued, for the moth would consume them: a third
sort thought fit to haue cattell and beasts, but then
heere grew the mischiefe, how they should keepe them
for want of fodder and stuble: many others had their
seueral plots and their proiects, but at length all agreed,
and the fore-man of the iury in the name of the rest,
gaue in this verdit; that aboue all, lands and groundes
were to be sought, for it was the mother earth which
was the foundation, and brings forth all other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
and therefore all of them did desire a competent
demaine, a large parke, sufficient medow, good arable
and pasture, and wood-land for timber and fuell; this
was the summe of their petition.</p>
            <p>The religious man replied,<note place="margin">He satisfies their request.</note> that although it were
much easier for him, to supply any other commoditie
then this, yet heerein hee would not bee wanting: but
promised vpon his honesty and credit, to giue them
their full contentment; and yet I will not (quoth hee)
remoue the land-markes of my neighbours, I will not
vniustly intrude vpon other mens possessions, I will not
tempt God to desire a new creation, or that God
would enlarge the earth, and giue it a greater circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
But heere is my intent, some two acres of
ground were left me by inheritance, these I purpose to
giue, and am content to part with amongst you: bring
hither your cartes, and your waynes; dig it, delue it,
carry it, all is yours, I will giue you the free and franke
possession of it. Do you answere me, that it is not worth
the digging and carriage? then assuredly you are much
mistake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in iudgement, that haue made so bad a choice,
as first to demand it. Doe you aske, me where you shall
lay it? euen where you please, in your harts, in youl
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3385:115"/>
mouthes, in your purses, in your coffers, the world is
spatious and wide, fill vp the huge Ocean, and make it
champion; if you make it a bottome, there you shall
haue the rich meadow: if you raise it and make it a leuel,
here is the fruitfull corne ground: if you giue it some

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igher ascent, then you shall haue it in wood-land and
pasture. O how happy are the rich men of this world!
but wherefore doe ye thus prolong the time? bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your spades, here is earth enough, heere is land e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
if my plenty failes, let me beare the blame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whatsoeuer is wanting in the latitude and extension,
you shall finde it in the depth and profunditie. I pray'
dig, I pray' dig, and when ye are once gone 3500. miles
hence, (for all is mine,) then you shall come to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the earth, heere you shall trie admirable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of nature, how after so great a descent, the earth
shall still be aboue you, (still be aboue you, for indeed
it is alwayes aboue you, and you are slaues to the earth)
where it shall fall of it owne accord, and so shall ease
you of a great part of your labours. Here if <hi>Archimedes</hi>
were liuing, he would apply his engines and tooles for
mouing the earth; but stay your hands, hould, hould,
let vs not vniustly incroach vpon the boundes of our
neighbours, the Antipodes; if we should contend in
suite, I feare it would proue a leading case, and I
would not willingly spend my selfe in their demurres.
But now I call to minde, we shall not need to trespasse
vpon them, when their owne bounds shall fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Heere thorough a hollownes of the earth, you
may with some labour creepe into another world, a
new sound and vnknowne world, happily vnpeopled
and vnhabited; but if otherwise furnisht and stockt
with people, yet like sons of the earth <hi>terrae filij,</hi> hauing
past thorough the wombe and bowels of the earth, you
may well claime your right of inheritance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:3385:115"/>Here one began to enquire of this religious man,
who should keepe them, and how they should liue in
the meane time?<note place="margin">Our worldly appetites are satisfied in death.</note> whereunto hee replied, that it was
prouidently spoken; and yet hee doubted not, but in
their digging they should finde out a myne of siluer or
gold, which might well pay for their labours. As yet he
neuer made triall, and therefore could say nothing to
the contrary, only in conscience he was bound to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and to beleeue the best: but it should seeme, that
the concourse of people was great, for euery man came
to the marte, expecting large possessions in this franke
distribution, the time was likewise prolonged, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meetings were appointed, for euery man hoped,
that this man generally reputed religious, should be as
good as his word, and performe his promise. Now in
the meane time, one of them died; heere this religious
man tooke iust occasion, to shew them the vanity of
their desires: and first hee points at the breathlesse car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse,
vncouers it; how pale and horrid it lookes! can
you behold it without fearfulnes? Where is the blood?
where is the fresh colour? the curl'd lockes, the proud
lookes, the aspiring thoughts, the soft cheeks, the cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
lips, the gripple hands, the greedie heart? What shal
you neede to desire such large possessions, when the
length of a few feet shall serue to containe and inclose
you? Here I will stop his mouth with earth, that he shal
not be able once to aske or to crie for more earth. Here
let vs open a pit; see how the creeping and the craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
wormes come forth to expect their bootie: his
mouth shall be filled with earth, his bellie with earth;
all is earth, and nothing but earth. For it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of true loue, to vnite and couple together: His loue
to the earth, shall conuert his whole body to earth.
Heere let vs burie him, and heere is the end of all your
vaine hopes; onely our comfort is, that hee is gone to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3385:116"/>
another world. where wee shall follow him; there hee
doth now rest from his labours; and here we must only
labour for that rest; and so my tale is ended.</p>
            <p>Now recalling my selfe,<note place="margin">The Authors intent in this second part.</note> I will draw to a conclusion:
my intent in this second part of my Treatise was; first,
to open mans miseries to himselfe, that seeing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he might flie to his maker, to change or relieue
his condition. For certainly, as the state now stands,
creatures are onely subiect to sorrow; no creature so
wretched as man; no man so miserable, as is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man with his fastings, repentance, and passions,
were it not for the hope of his happinesse. Secondly, lest
man might flatter himselfe and be deluded, with a fond
conceited opinion of his owne ioyes, I discouered all
our worldly pleasures to be but fansies; that hauing no
true ground of happinesse in our selues, wee might cast
vp our anchor of hope vnto heauen, and so stay our
selues from falling; expecting <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
descending and ascending, that Christ being once
exalted in power, might draw all vnto himselfe. Heere
was the scope of my intent; for I did obserue the
strange actiuity of mans soule, which could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within it selfe, but must bee necessarily diffused;
if not to the Creator, then to the creature. And I did
perswade my selfe, that if I could but sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the bankes, and hinder the violent intrusion of
waters; that then the riuer would keepe it owne chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
and runne to the Ocean: for thus man is onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to God. And therefore (as at all times) we ought
to detest the immoderate and excessiue loue, or abuse
of the creatures; so somtimes wee should forbeare the
tolerable and lawfull vse. Though God may bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in them; yet lest they should steale our selues
from our selues, and cast a mist vpon our sacrifice (the
frailty of our nature being so easily led and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3385:116"/>
with the outward allurements of the world, and
with the inward strong temptations of the flesh); lest
being associates, they might bereaue God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and though in themselues they are meanes to
stirre vp loue and thankfulnesse to God; yet through
our abuse, they might bee an occasion of our fall: and
therefore it were to bee wished, that they might not
come nearer within the compasse of our sacrifice, then
is befitting the naturall ceremonies, to set forth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignitie of the seruice.</p>
            <p>This shall appeare by the counsell of God himselfe,
though otherwise he allowes, and approues the honest
callings and professions of men;<note place="margin">How apt the creatures are to obscure Gods glory.</note> yet he appointed a day,
free from all worldly labours, to the memorie and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of himselfe. So for the place of his worship, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Temple, separated from all worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
to make it a house of Merchandize (though
Merchandize be an honest calling) were to make it a
denne of theeues; to exchange money there, though
otherwise it be for the vse of the Temple, were to rob
God of his honour. Yet this was not in <hi>sancto sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi>
in the holiest of holies, where no man had accesse
but onely the high Priest, and that but once in the yere:
this was not in the Temple, but in <hi>atrio templi,</hi> in the
court of the Temple. As much in effect, as if I should
say; to sell things in the Church-yard, which are for
the vse of the Temple, were a great prophanation of
the Temple. So God requires the whole and entire
heart, and no part thereof must be left for the creature:
<hi>primogenitum,</hi> the first begotten must be consecrated
to God; and the heart of man is the first begotten in
man. The practice of the Church, doth follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of God: in our prayers we are called vpon, <hi>sursum
corda,</hi> to lift vp our hearts. Notwithstanding that God
is euery where, yet for feare of annoyance, which might
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3385:117"/>
redound vnto vs from the creatures, wee are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
to worship God aboue the sphere of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
our Church men and Priests, as being a whole
burnt offering, consecrated to God, are separated from
the secular condition of men. And in confessing our
sinnes, lest there should be some kind of delight, in the
remembrance of some sinne, we are therefore enioyned
a silence; though otherwise confession seemes to bee
necessarie to repentance.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the truth of our misery shall speak and
discouer it selfe, with our cries,<note place="margin">How all our ioyes are counterfeit.</note> our grones, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
and the vanity of al our worldly pleasures here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
appeares; when wee purpose to bee most merrie and
iouiall, then must wee lay aside our owne persons, and
grauity; we must alter and change our owne shapes, to
make our selues capable of pleasures and delights. Wee
vse masking, mumming, enterludes, Playes, some
strange and anticke daunces; all which I commend, as
being honest, harmelesse, and lawfull sports; though
otherwise it may appeare, that vsing these shewes, wee
haue but the shewe of true ioy, and are very miserable
and wretched in our selues; that are inforced thus to
transforme our selues, to find out some pleasures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
suppose that a mans whole life were spent in a
continued shewe: suppose, that man wanted neither
foode, nor raiment, and perswaded himselfe, that hee
were none of the ordinary sort of men, none of the
common ranke and condition; but some great honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peere; some grand-child, descended from the
great Oneale; that Princes, and Ladies haue died with
their modesty for loue of him; that all men doe either
admire, or enuie his vertues; that with his wisedome
he is able to settle and establish the gouernment of
kingdomes. I would gladly know, what difference
there were betweene this counterfeit, and a true Peere?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3385:117"/>
All honour consists onely in reputation and esteeme,
and hath little ground-worke in nature; the one is as
confident of his honour, as the other, and both alike
are perswaded: <hi>animus cuiusque est quisque,</hi> it is the
mind, which (according to her owne apprehension)
giues al the contentment. Now where is the difference?
There is as much (I confesse) as there is betweene er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and truth; but all consists in the imagination; and
were there not some difficultie in a man, thus to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
and to flatter himselfe, it were an excellent kind
of delusion.</p>
            <p>Thus truly acknowledging our miseries, we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
enforced to confesse the rewards of our sinne,<note place="margin">Why all our delights should consist in the fansie.</note> and
the fruits of Gods iustice: yet calling to mind the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, which ouerflow all his workes: <hi>miseratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
domini super omnia opera eius:</hi> in this our wauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and slipperie state, being fallen into the depth of
sinne, wee erect and lift vp a pillar of faith and hope,
which laying hold and apprehending the mercies of
God, doth assure our owne soules, that there is a better
world to succeed: where true happinesse, and a crowne
of glory is reserued for Gods Saints. And therefore these
worldly pleasures being but shadowes, and all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
consisting onely in the fansie, should not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
vs in the pursuite of that true happinesse. Herein I
doe magnifie and acknowledge the goodnes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God; that as man in his condition is rather
spirituall, then carnall; for his minde (according to
right reason) should gouerne his flesh: and as the last
end of man, the happinesse whereunto man is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and directed, is wholly spirituall; as is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the loue, and the vniting with the Godhead: so,
lest man should proue too much a slaue to his sense, and
his carcasse; it hath pleased God still to permit, that all
mans delights and pleasures should reside in the fansie,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3385:118"/>
which is but onely a shadow of our true vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
rather then any earthly ioy or contentment
should truly and really possesse vs.</p>
            <p>And that you might not conceiue, that this is my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
opinion; I will therfore (in one word) take a view,
what the Gentiles, the Iewes, and the Christians, haue
thought of this truth; and what effects the meditation
here of hath wrought vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. You shall then obserue,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the consideration of mans present state &amp; condition,
moued the ancient Heathen Philosophers to take
whole nature, and to set it in a limbecke, so to distill it;
wherein they found by the force of fire, the vnresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power of reason; that all nature did either euapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to a fume, or a smoake, which indeed is the vanity
of the creatures; or else did settle downe, as the grosse
and earthly part in the bottome; and this is the misery
of the creatures: &amp; from hence proceeded two seuerall
sects of Philosophers, of different and contrary dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions;
the one laughing at the vanity,<note place="margin">Democritus, <hi>and</hi> Heraclitus.</note> the other wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at the miserie; and both of them esteemed very
wise in their owne generation.</p>
            <p>But when the naturall light of reason is left to it
selfe, it is but a kinde of darkenesse; for nature is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to her selfe, and out of her owne loue, to her selfe,
cannot wholly condemne herselfe. I will therefore
come to the Iewes, whose eyes were better enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Gods Law, though they had but shadowes of
mysteries, and only types and figures of a true sacrifice,
yet were they sufficiently instructed how to condemne
nature: and they proceeded further then the Heathen
Philosophers; drawing nature to a greater height, and
making some better extraction; and therefore they
doe not content themselues with vanities; but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that there is a vanity of vanities,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Salomons</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this world.</note> when
man doth please himselfe with his owne vanities. So
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3385:118"/>
likewise there is not only misery, &amp; vexation, but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of spirit, when man considers that these miseries
heere vpon earth, are the fore-runners of Gods heauie
iudgements to come; and therfore <hi>Salomon,</hi> their great,
wise, and potent King concludes; <hi>I viewed mine owne
workes, to take some contentment in mine owne actions,
yet I found none, but all was vanity of vanities, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am a Christian man, and therein I doe humbly, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and daily thanke God, who (of his mercy) hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to this state of saluation. And heere I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirme,<note place="margin">The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man.</note> that there is no ioy or comfort to man,
vnlesse it be to the Christian man; whose God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in basenesse and misery. And therefore for example
and imitatton of that miserable God, (being all parts
and members vnder such a mysticall head,) that there
might be a conformity between the head, &amp; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(<hi>ne sit membrum delicatum sub capite spinoso</hi>) hee
desires the like miseries, and would willingly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
imbrace the same passions; as being the holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of his God; and in the course of his miserie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
a diuine prouidence, Gods holy hand,
correction and permission. He is well assured, that hee
is the miserable man, who offers wrong and iniustice
to his innocent brother; who hath iust cause to reioyce,
if he suffers the greatest misery vndeseruedly: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that all miseries are tending, and ending in
death; desiring death as a passage or gate to a better
life, <hi>cupio dissolui &amp; esse cum Christo,</hi> hee will bee thus
faithfully resolued; <hi>non sunt passiones huius vitae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignae

passions of this life are not to bee respected, in
regard of that crown of glory, which God

            <p>If there were no other argument, to perswade me of
the naturall corruption of man, but onely the implicite
and secret confession of man himselfe, concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3385:119"/>
together with the daily practice of his actions,<note place="margin">Man is vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

this were sufficient. For in what course or condition of
life would you suppose man, wherein you should not
finde an euident proofe of his corruption? If man be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
and alone; then you shall finde him melancholy,
discontented, and in some dislike with himselfe, as it
were (for want of others) picking quarrels, and fighting
with himselfe? now place him in the company and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of others, and presently hee falles to banding and
factions. Wherefore serues such a number of fencing-schooles,
or the nature of combates and duels, now at
length reduced to the rules and forme of an Art? and
such as will not aduenture their bloud in a quarrell,
they must contend in suites of law, to the impairlng of
their substance. Histories are daily written, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the subtilties and trickes of state; but sure it is,
that there is as much false dealing, close practises, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
suggestions, dissimulation, breach of promises,
and euery way as much dishonesty in a petty, poore,
base, paultry Corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the choice of their towne-Clearke,
their Bailiffe, or some such officer, as you
shall finde among the great Bashawes for the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and supporting of the Turkish Empire. The whole
world is distracted with factions, and therefore surely
the ould time was much to be commended, in tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or rather giuing occasion to some countrey may-games
and sportes, as dancing, piping, pageants, all
which did serue to asswage the cruelty of mans nature;
that giuing him some little ease and recreation, they
might with-hould him from worser attempts, and so
preserue amitie betweene men. Vpon the abolishing of
these, you could not conceiue in reason, were it not that
we finde it true by experience, (for sometimes things
which are small in the consideration, are great in the
practise) what dissolute and riotous courses? what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3385:120"/>
games? what drunkennes? what enuy, hatred,
malice, and quarelling haue succeeded in lieue of these
harmlesse sports? and these are the fruits, which our
strict professors haue brought into the world; I know
not how they may boast of their faith (for indeed they
are pure professors) but sure I am, they haue banisht all
charity.</p>
            <p>In our dealings and contracts with men, sometimes
we blame the complections and lookes of others, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
protesting that we dislike their visage, and will
admit no dealings with them;<note place="margin">Hovv vve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse each other.</note> sometimes wee dislike
their names, sometimes the whole kindred, the stocke,
and the familie; sometimes the whole nation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Whereas all this time we are much mistaken
and deceiued, for either the hate and dislike should be
extended, and generally comprehend whole nature,
whole mankinde, for God sawe all the counsels of men,
that they were full of impietie and wickednesse; or else
we should contract our hate, and begin first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to hate our selues, as consisting equally with them
of the same corruption. But behold, for our selues wee
haue found out some lurking holes, some retiring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
some speciall priuiledge and indulgence proper to
vs: if all other goodly and godly pretenses doe faile,
then we can boast of our ancestors, that we are descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from honest &amp; noble parents. Which (certainly) we
would neuer doe, were it not, (that implicitly) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the basenesse and vilenesse of our owne nature in
generall, and therefore we seeke to couer and conceale
our owne shame in particular. Heere we vse scutchions
and armes, beasts forsooth must discouer our conditions
and qualities, they must shew our parentage; whereas
indeed the Prophet hath better described it, <hi>radix tua,

euill, we must needs repay euill, according to the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and likenesse of our nature, when both action and
passion are performed by one and the same qualitie: for
heate working vpon heate, the greater will allure and
draw forth the lesse; and it is onely christian religion,
which takes away the corruption of our nature, and
giues vs this precept, to ouercome an other mans euill
with our own good. But you will say, that common iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
requires (as much in effect) to returne euil for euil,

the best courage is tainted with rashnesse; but in
our actions betweene men, suppose wee receiue great
benefits from our benefactors, such as cannot easily be
recompensed, certainly nothing is so proper to man,
nothing so commendable in man as thankfulnes: for
nature prescribes it in euery creature, the earth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy labour shall yeeld thee a crop, heere is her
thankfulnes; the beasts according to thy keeping shall
bring thee a profit, heere is their thankfulnes. God
likewise commands it, and seemes to be principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in our thankfulnes, for it is God that hath giuen
vs all ours, our selues, and more then our selues, the
meanes of our redemption (the sonne of God incarnat)
is more then our selues, our expected happines is more
then our present possession. Thus man though finite in
himselfe, yet is infinitly indebted to God, &amp; is to be tied
to his thankfulnes accordingly; but God as by himself,
so likewise by others imparts these his blessings. Now
for our thankfulnes and recompence, will ye heare the
course of the world? O the cursed and corrupted course
of this world! we must not be indebted for such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which cannot easily bee recompensed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our manner is, not onely to suppresse them, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
or deny them, but to reward them with all reproch
and dishonor, as desiring to free our selues, from the
bondage and captiuity of thankfulnes, whereby wee
stand obliged to others.</p>

proceeds not from our loue towards him, but in the
course of our faction, out of the hate and enmity which
we beare to our aduersaries, well hoping that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
may serue to abate their pride. Thus the
condition of man being wholly sinfull and corrupted,
we seeke to preuent sinne with sinne; we can be content
to doe ill offices to our superiours, to set them at iar and
contention, thereby to secure our selues and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase

and where there is the least spice of euill,

            <p>It is a maine difference betweene the sensitiue, and
the vegetatiue creatures, that trees haue their mouthes
or their stomach fastened in the earth,<note place="margin">The Serpent creepes on the earth.</note> but sensitiue
creatures, if they haue sight, fit it is, that their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower
should be erected aloft, to view and behould
their owne wayes, to order their steps, then why is it
not thus in the serpent; shall I tell you the reason? It
stood with the iustice of God, in the forme, figure, and
shape of this serpent, to intimate first the enmity to
man; that as man alone aboue all other creatures hath
an vpright figure, and lookes vp to heauen: so the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
alone of all other creatures, lies creeping and
groueling on the earth. 2. This serpent hath bin the
instrument of Satan, and therefore obserue still the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;
hell is supposed to be in the heart of the earth,
and the serpent lies with her heart to the earth. 3. The
state of the earth procured by the serpent; the earth is
round, somewhat in the forme of an egg: if it produce
euill, assure your selfe that the serpent hath hatched it,
&amp; is the sole nurse of the brood. Higher then the earth,
to the state of Angels and Saints, the poyson of this
serpent cannot ascend, for it lies and incompasseth the
earth; the serpent is already cast downe, downe to the
earth, heere she is permitted to inhabit, and to bite at
the heele, but her principall strength is abated; and at
length, as she hath no feete to support her, so she may
be easily vanquisht and cast into darknesse, where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
her gliding and slippery condition, she
shall be tied vp in chaines, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From the basenesse of her person, let vs come to the
basenesse of her food: is it possible that any creature of

noble things to hurt and annoy them, and yet should
make choice of the meanest and basest, for her owne
foode and sustenance? This is an excellent embleme of
enuie, and worthily describes the malicious accuser of
his brethren: but what a league of friendship and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath past betweene the earth and the serpent; how
deerely and tenderly doth the serpent loue and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the earth, she layes her breast to the earth, feedes
on the earth, layes vp the earth in her bowels, inhabits
the earth, that so she might binde her selfe to the earth,
and the earth might wholy possesse her. And thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
men of the serpentine kinde, or rather seduced by
the serpent, their mouth is full of earth, they talke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but lands, goods, purchases, demeanes, possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
inheritances, leases; of bonds, contracts, bargaines,
sales, commodities, marchandises, wares, &amp;c. now the
mouth speaketh out of the abundance of the heart, their
heart is full of earth and earthly cogitations, their
nayles and their hands are full of earth, their hands are
griple and holde fast, and are not so easilie, either ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in charitie, or lifted vp in pietie, and thus is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
euery way accomplished.</p>
            <p>Here I would desire you to obserue, that as the
dumbe creatures, are only (in the nature of instruments)
ordained and directed for the vse and seruice of man:<note place="margin">How the dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> so
vndoubtedly, it might well stand with the iustice of
God to punish them in the nature of instruments. For
alas, what is the whole world, or the perfection of all
the creatures in respect of Gods glory, and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of his iustice? neither was this world intended
for dumbe beasts, but onely for man; and therefore as
their slaughter is ordained for man, so if their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might serue for mans admonition, and bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer
of his sinne, this were sufficient for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3385:125"/>
of Gods iustice, and to excuse his works of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.
The punishment of the serpent, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
serue to instruct vs, that as the glory and beautie
of the creatures sets forth the absolute happinesse, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the commendation and praise of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
so the basenesse and vilenesse of the creature might
betoken his wretched state and condition, who was
the first cause and occasion of sinne; assuring vs of Gods
iustice, that if he did not spare the dumbe instruments,
much lesse would hee pardon the first agents. Now to
square and to proportion these one to another, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the serpent, to the punishment of the euill
spirit, I will forbeare to doe it at this time, in regard
that it exceeds the bounds of our naturall reason; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
I may take some fitter occasion to discouer it, and
in the meane time I leaue it to euery mans priuate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Least man should thinke, that the condition of the
serpent did not any way concerne him (as indeede it
doth,<note place="margin">The enmitie betweene Man and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> being that the whole world is onely ordained for
man) I will therefore come to the second punishment,
which more immediatly concernes him, and may serue
for a caution: <hi>Insidiabitur calcaneo,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. <hi>I will
also put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thy seede and her seede, he shall breake thine head,
and thou shalt bruse his heel.</hi> The principall enmitie
consists betweene man and the diuell, who is therefore
fitly said to bite at his heele; as chiefely assaulting man
in the last clause of his age, in the agonie of death, and
principally intending to detaine him from the finall
vpshot and conclusion of his happinesse. In permitting
this enmitie, did appeare the fruite of Gods iustice,
as setting his owne enemies at enmitie among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
and likewise the fruite of Gods mercy, that
man being thus molested and maligned by Sathan,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3385:125"/>
and the rather for Gods cause, man bearing the image
of God, and Sathan Gods pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est enimie, being not
able to obscure or eclipse Gods glorie, seekes to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and supplant Gods image. Hereby it falls out, that
man is now become an associate, of the same league
and amitie with God, and therefore God is now tied
for mans protection, and may at length without any
breach of law or iustice, fight in mans quarrell, against
the powers of darkenesse, the gates of hell, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of sinne, Sathan, and damnation.</p>
            <p>As was the conspiracie betweene man and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

betweene the flesh and the spirit, both guiltie of

of iustice, to set an enmitie betweene reason and sense,
and betweene the reasonable and the sensitiue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
First in man himselfe, in the very parts of man, a
rebellion of his members, here is an ill example and
president for all the rest of the creatures to follow; for
behold, the dumbe creatures, who were made onely for
mans vse and seruice, cast off their yoake, and are now
become dangerous and obnoxious to man, from the
greatest to the least. Wee stand not onely in feare of
fierce Lions, cruell Tigers, rauening Wolues, deuouring
Beares, but G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ats, Flies, and the least wormes doe serue
to molest vs: let not the plagues of Aegypt seeme so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
when as within our memorie, in the yeere
1580. at Southminster in Essex, the Mice so swarmed
and abounded, that their corne was spoyled, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
annoyed their grasse taynted, and the place made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
inhabitable; vntill God in his mercy sent thither
great numbers and multitudes of Owles, which were
neuer seene there either before or since, and these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
and did eate vp their Mice, and the Mice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
they tooke againe their flight, and so the plague
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3385:126"/>
ceased. Now it cannot be, that the gouernment of man
ouer the creatures should so farre bee impeached, were
it not, that there is some conniuencie and toleration
from aboue, contrarie to the first institution of nature:
neither could equitie tolerate in them so foule an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
if man still retayned in them the same right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and might pleade his title thereunto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
forfeiture, impeachment or waste.</p>
            <p>It is not sufficient, that man should be subiect to the
danger of creatures in generall, for his life, his limmes,
and his substance; but some there are which seeme to
mocke and to scoffe man, the Parat for his speech, the
Ape for his actions, and others for his gesture. Some
though they are impotent and cannot hurt, yet seeme
to threaten man; for there are certaine ominous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in their owne kinde, which without any spice of
superstition or vaine feare,<note place="margin">Ominous creatures.</note> doe prognosticate euill: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
though familiar to man, yet with some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
and vnnaturall act, seeme to portend euill. Many
will condemne me of sollie in this kinde, but I am very
confident herein: for whereas in nature wee confesse a
pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uidence in euery the least naturall action, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would disparage the gouernment of this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse:
and Christian religion affirmes, that the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of the ayre fall downe by Gods appoyntment
and ordinance; so sometimes, for a further terrifying
and certifying of the sense, as likewise for the assuring
and example of others, God vseth outward and more
manifest signes and tokens. And as the dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the instruments of Gods iustice, which did
well appeare in the plagues of Aegypt: so sometimes
they are the Prophets and denouncers of iudgements,
as in Balams asse, &amp;c. thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it cannot bee denied, but
many such accidents doe arise from naturall causes; the
Rauens feeding on carcasses, no maruell if their sent doe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3385:126"/>
direct them, and that a smell inclining to death doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
them, and prouoke them to crie.</p>
            <p>But I will onely insist in the Serpent; for the enmitie
seemes greatest betweene the most noble and basest
creatures, Man and the Serpent,<note place="margin">The Serpent assaulting Man.</note> and that for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
remembrance of the first tentation. Howsoeuer
I doubt not, but that it better appeares in those easterne
countries, wherein Paradise was first planted, and
wherein the kindes of Serpents doe much differ from
ours, yet I will now speake according to our Climate
and Meridian. Behold, when in the pleasant moneth of
May, thou desirest to take the fresh ayre, and to delight
thy senses with the odoriferous breath of sweete flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
when the beautie of the Lilies, and the pleasant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of colours shall allure thy sight, as thou walkest
securely by the way side; or when thou dost solace thy
selfe in the groue or the shade, and there crownest thy
selfe with the garlands of nature; see see a stratagem,
a stratagem! treason, treason against thine owne person,
the base Serpent, which neuer durst once appeare in thy
sight to encounter thee, now begins to trace out thy
pathes, and to bite at thy heeles, (a part which thou
least suspectedst), where thy hands cannot stoope down
to helpe thee, yet therein the strength and poyse of thy
whole body consists; if thou touchest or treadest, thou
defilest thine owne flesh. And thus is euery man now
become <hi>Iacob,</hi> before hee can be <hi>Israel,</hi> first his thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone

of his body: or do these thornes serue in defence of the
earth? that man should not presume to touch the earth,
as being without the compasse of his ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
first placed in the garden, he hath no right to the
chase or the wildernesse; being first made Lord of the
creatures, he should not now descend to be a hedger or

serue only for defense of themselues, seeing thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

boare out of the wood may roote them vp, &amp; the wilde
beasts of the field may deuour them. Hath nature taken
the charge of the least, and seemes she to be so negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in the greatest and best? where is the indulgencie
and goodnes of nature, especially considering that with
so great ease, she is able to preserue her selfe, making
her selfe a hedge to her selfe? but leauing the rest, that is
the best of the fruites, and therefore best worthy of the
keeping to mans prouidence, Lord! what labour and
watchfulnes is required, not only in the planting, but
likewise the same labour is continued in the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <p>Shall I tell you the reason? As the minde of man is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne
with bryers and brambles, prickt with her
thoughts,<note place="margin">The weeds of the earth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the weeds of mans mind.</note> and stung with a sting of conscience: so the
body by a rule of iustice and equalitie, must likewise be
outwardly tormented. And as man in the pride of his
heart, presumed to eate the forbidden fruit: so on the
contrary, that it might appeare, that he had no right to
the least fruite of the garden, to the meanest thing in
nature, but onely by the diuine permission, therefore the
meanest thing in nature shal reuenge that high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and violent intrusion of man. But now that
I am prickt with the thornes, or bitten with the serpent,
me thinkes my wound cancars; alasse alasse I am poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I am poysoned, and therefore no maruaile, if at
length I burst forth and lay open my poyson, and
speake a little of the nature of poyson. I speake not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
for nature hath hatched this poyson, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a nature of poyson: I will onely speake of
plants and of beasts, and I wil not heere dig vp the earth
to search for the minerals, I will reserue them for some
better occasion.</p>
            <p>The Philosophers, who were the best spokes-men in
natures defense, doe assigne this reason, that necessary
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3385:129"/>
it was,<note place="margin">Of poysons.</note> that of the poyson of the earth, serp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

plants (both poysonous) should be produced; and being

the remainder of that poyson, that so the hearbes
and the plants, the ayre, earth, and the water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be
the more wholesome and sauoury. But heere I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the lists with Philosophy; I confesse indeed, that if
you will necessarily suppose a poysonous matter, then
God hath ordained them for the best, who being all
good in himselfe, can change and alter the nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and turne it to good; but heere is the question, why
should nature admit any poysons? for poysons consists
in the extremitie of qualities, especially of the first qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:

               </gap> such an excesse in their
qualities? when the elements themselues are not poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
in their owne natiue and proper qualities: or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that this might, happen in regard of the mixture
and concoction, as it were drawing out a quintessence,
pressing and including much qualitie in a little quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
yet that it should be the end and scope of nature, in
effecting whereof, nature should rest contented, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
attained her owne end, and not rather a passage
or a degree of nature directed to some better purpose,
as (for example) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> or crudity may wel stand with
natures intent, as it is directed to ripenesse and some
further concoction; but to giue poysons that consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
as if they were essentiall parts belonging to natures
perfection, it must needes argue that nature her selfe is
poysoned, and iustly punished for mans contempt, in

that the seasons of the yeere mutually succeeding

and bordering, stand in the same climate? I will
therefore make a second instance heere in England, the
Roodings of Essex (a very handfull of ground) are freed
from all poysonous matter, heere are no bogs nor no
vermine; or how will you suppose any difference of
climate? not any part of this kingdome is generally
more annoyed with venemous creatures, then is the

I confesse indeed, that any forged or supposed reason
framed and fashioned vpon all occasions, within the

<hi>mundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tradidit disputationi eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> My opinion
is, that as poysons do argue the corruption of nature in
generall: so nature in particular, is sometimes priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by an especiall warrant and protection vnder Gods
owne signet, (though otherwise I doubt not, but it is by
naturall meanes, for God doth not exclude nature, but
rather include her, as being his owne appointed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
the course, rule and lawe of the creatures). And
thus God permitteth nature both to shew her integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and to boast of her perfection, that although she be

and being thus corrupted, she seemes to make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence

that being taken, they shall not discouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
they shall not bewray their owne treacherie, but
as if they were confederate with the nature of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they shall lie hidden and secret, vntill they may

the foundation of life; so that poysons now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
after many moneths or many yeeres shall appeare
in effect and operation.</p>
            <p>Because this may seeme strange to diuers, therefore

which haue their antipathie to certaine parts of
mans bodie; Cantharides to the bladder, the Diamonds
to the Lungs, seuerall purgations (which are remissiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poysons) to the seuerall humors. Now considering
that there is a great difference in the parts of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
some are more ignoble and base than others, such as
we may best spare, and are of the least vse, and therefore
may daylie consume, and yet the decay not appeare in
the vitall faculties (suppose the lungs or the sple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and yet the poyson being once harboured in those
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3385:131"/>
parts, shall carrie in it selfe an vnresistable power, and
by degrees obtaine the victorie and conquest. Some
thing likewise may bee ascribed to the remotenesse of
the parts, in regard of the great distance and hard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of the poyson; thus is man subiect to the outward
and inward annoyance of the creatures, as was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
so is the punishment. <hi>Of whom shall we expect for
redresse, but of thee (O Lord)? thou that wert crowned
with a garland of thornes, and fedde with vineger and

take vpon thee the person of whole mankinde, take away
this cup of our poyson, feede vs with thine owne flesh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
vs with thine owne blood, and being made liuely
members of thy mysticall bodie, let this cup passe from vs,
this cuppe of bitternesse and sorrow; take away the poyson
of our nature, the poyson of sinne, and sow in our hearts
the seede of eternitie, that so we may rise againe with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
immortall, incorruptible freed as from the poyson of
sinne, so from the poyson of the creatures, the one being
the vndoubted token and punishment of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs come to man, and consider man in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
seeing the creatures doe thus combine against

his furniture. What Prince warring against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth not first consider his owne strength, and the
power of his aduersarie? Behold then, this great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
how he enters into the combate: <hi>Nudus egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
de vtero matris sue, &amp; nudus illuc reuertitur,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
he comes out of his mothers wombe, and naked he
shall returne againe; Here you see the whole course of
his passage, so that his nakednesse is his punishment:
Gen. 3. 10. &amp; 11. <hi>Because I was naked, therefore I hid
my selfe; and God said, who tolde thee that thou wast na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?
&amp;c.</hi> For in the time of his innocencie, though hee
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3385:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should haue been naked without clothing, yet shame
should not haue accompanied his nakednesse; as hee
should haue bin without vesture or garment, so there
should haue bin no vse either of vesture or garment. He
should not haue been subiect to the annoyance of the
creatures, for his innocencie should haue protected
him; there his nakednesse should haue bin his beauty
and perfection; as the child in the wombe, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
yet neither feeles the scorching heate, or the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
frost; but liues in a temperat zoane: but the state
and condition of those times being now altered and
changed, why should not nature make her prouision
accordingly? Why should she not worke her owne
proper effects, and be as beneficiall to man, as to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures in generall?</p>
            <p>For it is naturall to all creatures, that receiuing fit
nourishment, part of it should bee turned to the flesh,
and part to the fleece;<note place="margin">Mans clothing should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his food, as well as his nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> some should renew the decayed
spirits, some repaire the bones, some playster the flesh;
and for the remainder, it should serue for the outward
couering and beauty, as haire, feathers, wooll, &amp;c. Now
for mans food, assuredly it is much better then theirs,
why should it not euery way be alike beneficiall? shall
nature leese that in mans nourishment, which she can
so profitably imploy in all other creatures, to adorne the
proud peacock, to beautifie the phesant; shall this bee
vainely spent or cast away in mans concoction? Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in the sensitiue, but likewise in the vegetatiue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the same foode giues them both nourishment to
preserue them, beauty to adorne them, and strength to
inable them, and garments to shelter them against any
outward violence. The trees, which are of strongest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and longest continuance; yet hath it pleased
God to couer them with a stiffe hide, (the barke) which
from the roote, still followes the trunke vnto the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3385:132"/>
and fruite; the sap and iuyce whereof strengthens
and fastens our leather. Thus in all creatures nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to ingraft this opinion, that her perfection <hi>est ab
intra,</hi> appeares in her most hidden workes, and in her
secret pauilion; and therefore whatsoeuer appeares to
the outward shewe, is but the fruite of her excrements.</p>
            <p>Or why should nature be partiall in man, to adorne
the head, the browes, and the chin, with a couering of
soft haire,<note place="margin">Why some pars should be couered and not all.</note> and to leaue the rest of the members naked
and comfortlesse; as if there were not the like vse and
necessity in all? heere we see what she was able to doe
in the rest, that thou mightest ascribe this to the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie
of nature, and not to the earth, which should
decke and adorne all parts alike, and should begin with
the lowest: or rather God himselfe hath ordained it, that
one part should remaine couered, which man himsefe
might vncouer in the honour and seruice of his God;
and thereby acknowledge the nakednesse and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of the whole. For (doubtlesse) it stood with the
bounty and goodnesse of nature, either to make man
not wanting any such shelter of excrements, thorough
multitudes of hot and vitall spirits, suppose the eyes and
the face, which finde little annoyance by any vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
weather; or if mans feeblenesse shal require them,
then vpon the same conditions to supply them in man,
as well as in all the rest of the creatures.</p>
            <p>You will say, that nature hath left him destitute of
garments, as hauing prouided for him, a large and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
wardrop,<note place="margin">Nature is heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to other creatures then vnto man.</note> euen all the skins of the creaturs, &amp;c. It
should seeme then, that man is their seruant to weare
their cast-away garments; but I pray' hath not man a
strength of his owne, though otherwise he can vse the
strength of horses to performe his owne labour? It were
to be wisht, that for want of others (suppose a case of
necessity), man might haue some clothing &amp; garments
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3385:133"/>
of his owne, to couer his nakednesse. If the dissolute
riot of man were such, that he should make waste of all
and sell all to the bare skin; if his improuidence were
such, that he would neuer prepare for the could winter,
or ould age; yet shal nature seem to neglect man, which
clothes the Lilies of the field? In euery well ordered
state, besides the priuat possessions of euery man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
there should be something in common, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it should not lie in the power of the vnthrift to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
himselfe; and heereof no man should haue the
propriety, but it should bee the Lords waste foyle for
the vse of his tenants. Now suppose, that man had any
such proper garment, yet hee might exchange it, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orne
it at his pleasure; the head though couered with
haire, yet the barbour might trim it, it might be deckt
with the cap and the feather, with the hood, the iewels
and costly attire; to haue of thine owne, it doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
thy right and title to theirs.</p>
            <p>According to the diuersitie of mans parts, giue me
leaue to make a double nakednesse of man, inward and
outward;<note place="margin">The inward and outward nakednesse.</note> the soule is naked and emptie, she hath lost all
her ornaments of grace, of sanctitie and knowledge,
and seemes to be much defectiue in her natural powers:
for in the dead embers of mans fall, you shall finde very
fewe, and those very obscure sparkes of our reason. All
her knowledge is gotten by learning, and hauing once
attained knowledge she cannot easily retaine it; as if
learning (like a garment) did grow ould and did weare
out with vse. But obserue a greater difficulty, seldome
or neuer shall you finde, that the minde inwardly, and
the body outwardly are deckt and garnisht alike; it
should seeme, that there is an opposition betweene
both, or that God hath concluded by a law of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that there should be a nakednesse: the more nice, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and costly the Gallant seemes in his outward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3385:133"/>
and garments, the more his minde is neglected
with inward good qualities and vertues; for his time
and disposition can not suffice him, to intend both alike;
and therefore there must bee a nakednesse. Consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that in euery dumbe creature there is some
strange instinct of nature, both for defence and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of it selfe, as likewise for the vse and seruice of
man: whereat the poore sillie Philosopher stands won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and is astonisht, can say little to the purpose, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concludes, that it is a certaine notion, imprinted in
the fansie, &amp;c. Then why should nature be so destitute
in respect of grace, being onely directed to grace? yet
there is an emptinesse or a nakednesse in the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
heart of man, to the high mysteries of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
we are blinde, and by the weakenesse of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
light, wee cannot discerne the sunne-shine of
grace. And thus we striue and contend with the powers
of darkenesse and ignorance, and thus the life of man is
a warfare here vpon earth: <hi>Behold, O Lord God of hoasts,

            <p>For the outward nakednesse of his bodie, it should
seeme that man is dismissed of Gods seruice, hauing
now lost his liuerie, his badge, and his cognizance; or
naked he is,<note place="margin">The outward nakednesse of man.</note> that thou (O Lord) mightest entertaine him
to thy seruice; naked hee is, that hee might wholy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
in his owne strength, and hauing no shelter of

thy wings; naked hee is, to shew his condition, that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3385:134"/>
whatsoeuer he hath, he hath it by begging; and therfore
naked he is, to moue thy pity and compassion; hee is a
pilgrime heere vpon earth, and hath no permanent city,
and therefore naked he is, and must hasten to runne his
race, and in another world must expect the change and
variety of his garments; for heere naked he is, he is falne
among theefes, and is robd of his garments, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from Ierusalem to Ierico; naked he is, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot conceale the spots of his nature: naked he
is, and therefore fit to be washt, fit to be dipt in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of Baptisme; or if he shall offend thee (O Lord), na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
he is, and may easily be scourged with the rod of thy
vengeance; naked hee is, that being clad with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of dead creatures, feeding on the carkasses of
dead creatures, he might call to minde his owne death,
and run a course of mortification and sorrow. For naked
he is, and thus nature hath disposed him, and yet he is
ashamed of his owne nakednesse, and therfore he must
be ashamed of his owne nature, and so consequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the corruption of his nature.</p>
            <p>Will you yet heare some further corruption, which
appeares in our nakednesse? in stead of confessing our
crimes,<note place="margin">The abuse of apparell.</note> loe! heare our abuse: whereas apparell was only
ordained for the necessity of our bodies, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of our members, now it serues as an occasion of
our wantonnes &amp; pride. Nature her selfe makes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene creatures of diuers regions and places;
but our curiosity is such, that we must borrow from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
nations, the variety and forme of their attires. So
nature hath fitted euery nation with garments best for
their vse: The English cloth is the only good shelter,
against the could Northern blast; and the Camels haire
yeelds a better shade in Sowthern regions: but we
cannot thus content our selues with natures appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and whereas by the orderly course of nature,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3385:134"/>
there should appeare some difference of mens conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their outward habits, for so the horse appointed
for the seruice of war, is better shaped then the hackney
or cart-horse: yet the abuse of man is such, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
his clothing should only couer his shame, now it
must serue to discouer his pride, and bee a token of his
brauery and boasting; so that considering the ould
world, and their homely attyres, you would suppose in
these dayes, all men to be Princes, were it not, that if
there be Princes, then must there be slaues, by a necessity
of relation.</p>

how the one doth incroach vpon the other, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

to both: you shall finde <hi>viros molles &amp; effoeminatos,</hi> as

the wantonnesse of woemen; and woemen in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
and vestures seeme to exceede their owne sex, to
the strange confusion of nature. Againe the garments
should suppose a congruity to the foundation of mans
body, but I feare nature is somtimes inforced, (for heere
she is pend vp and encaged) to make the body seeme
fine and straight; and by and by with loose sailes, wee
seeme to make waste in the blessings of nature. I shall
not neede to spend much time in speaking of our abuse
in this kinde; it hath bin the common complaint of all
ages, but especially of ours, which exceedes all former
times, and shewes her owne vanity from the costly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
of the head, to the golden rose on the shooe: though
we can neither eate nor drinke gould with <hi>Midas,</hi> yet
we can wastfully spend it in wearing, and sometimes
our whole treasure appeares on the backe; and thus

man out of the poyson of his owne nature, turnes that

might be tied to vse his own labour for his sustenance

why should the earth bring forth naturally fruite, fit
for the nourishment of beasts, and yet mans body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

Why should not the earth as well bring forth of her
selfe, graine, corne, wheate, barlie, rie, without the

Apricocks, Pomegranates, Cherries, which seeme to be

onely the foundation, and this life must bee continued
and prolonged by such meanes, which he himselfe hath

without tooles, (the plough, the mattocke, the spade),

to worke in his vineyeard, as if he were to create a new

of this world.</p>
            <p>Let vs (with compassion) descend to the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

which indeed is the best and the most necessary, I will
instance in husbandry &amp; tillage; the sower goeth forth
to his labour, some fals vpon rockes, some vpon sands,
some vpon thornes, the least part fals on the good
ground, heere is the losse of his seede, the losse of
his labour: now this good ground, it was first made
good, it was mealowed and mended, and had many
tilths; heere is a continuall taske for man and for beast,
they run in a circle, according to the seasons of the
yeare, they haue their times for their different labours,
in sowing, and mowing, in keeping and reaping the
seed and the weed, the least drought in the sowing, the
least moysture in the reaping, any vnseasonable weather
spoyles their whole haruest; euery second or third yeere
the ground must lie fallow, and heere is nothing but
barennesse, nature seemes wholy vnprofitable; alas how
shall the poore tennant discharge his rent? for heere is
only hope and expectation of a future crop, which the
good husband some two yeeres hence, may take as the
fruites of his labour, and in the interim may bequeath
it to the vnborne, and vnbegotten child for a legacy.
But suppose him now at length, to haue the quiet and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3385:138"/>
peaceable possession of his owne crop, a fift part of his
corne shall be spent againe in his seed, an other part
shall be spent to hearten the poore beasts in their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
very little will remaine for the houshold prouision,
or the market commoditie; and being thus safely lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
yet he shall not bee excused of his labour, the
thresher, the miller, the baker, all of them very painefull
and laborious trades will testifie as much.</p>
            <p>I know not, how far I may presume vpon mans pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but truely I am very fearefull in speaking of those
things,<note place="margin">Gods mercy and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in our labours.</note> which might any way concerne our thankfulnes
to God; and therefore giue me heere leaue to make
some recompence, least mans labour might seeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from Gods goodnes and prouidence, the one
serues as a iust punishment of sinne, the other as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of Gods mercy and our redemption. It is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, that first gaue man his seed, and teacheth
him to know the times and the seasons, inables him to
worke, giues him the grace to follow his calling, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
nature in her own kinde, and concurr's with the
second causes in their effects and operations. It is the
prouidence of God, that the seed being once dissolued
should send downe a roote, should send vp a blade, that
it should be moystned with the first and the latter raine,
that by degrees according to the funnes heat, it should
gather strength; that the morning dew should preserue
it from withering, that the white snow like a warme
fleece should keep it from freesing, while with the hard
frost the ground should be mealowed, the wormes kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the weeds nipt and consumed. It is the mercy
of God, that the seed comming forth should returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
(with great thankfulnesse and vsury) straw and
chaffe for the vse of beasts, and corne for the food of
man; this corne to be inclosed in an eare, fortified with
pikes, least the foules of the ayre should seaze vpon it,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3385:139"/>
laid vp in a huske, least the winde should scatter it, or
the water should rot it; and that within the compasse of
one moneth, all the whole yeeres prouision might bee
brought into the barne; and whatsoeuer remaines in
the field should first serue, as gleanings for the poore, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
feed the foules of the ayre and the beasts of the field,
nothing is lost, the very stuble shall serue to enrich the
ground; and as the fruites of the earth do satten the
beasts, so the dung of beasts doth satten the earth. Thus
euery way you see the prouidence of God, which pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence
is most especially directed to man, and therfore
acknowledge, that mans labour and drudgerie is the
fruit of his sinne, the fruit of his fall, and not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the fruits of the garden. God that feedes

bearing this yoake, and obedience in vndertaking the

nothing so much as to frustrate the sentence of God,
and to auoid the punishment; especially in these last
dayes, which is the ould age of the world, we intend
nothing more then our idlenesse and sloth, sometimes
vnder the faire shew of sanctity. Whereas certaine it is,

enmity between man and man, when as all things were
distracted, when wisdome was separated from power,
and strength was seuered from charity, considering that
disorder is more perillous then bondage, and confusion
more detested then slauery: that order might keepe all
things within their owne bounds, there did appeare a
necessity of gouernment, and gouernment inforceth a
subiection and thraldome; thus the punishment is not
onely to be tyed to the sex, (for it is a rule in law, <hi>partus

there is a generation of men which feed vpon nothing
but mans flesh; therefore (with one ioynt and common
consent) we must submit our selues to a gouernment;
which gouernment, if it containe it selfe within his own
iust limits and boundes, it is the greatest and most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
blessing, which can happen to man heere in
this life. But for mans sinne, he must likewise be subiect
to the tyrannie of others: seeking protection hee fals
into the den of a Lyon, into the hands of a tyrant, who
delights in cruelty, and hath his rewards appointed for
all such as shall inuent new torments, with roaring
Buls, fierce Tygers, deuouring Beares, and whatsoeuer
else either fire or sword can execute; and yet we must
patiently endure this tyrannie, rather then admit a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

againe in the blindnes and sudden assault of their lust,

of dead carkasses or beasts, then an honorable

estate of marriage, eleuated to the hight of a mysterie in

            <p>There is nothing which breedes that distast in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,

should haue had in the state of our innocency; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no maruaile though marriage were first instituted
in paradise: and yet notwithstanding this community,
the offices of the house ought to bee diuided between
both, and neither of them should intermedle with the
others affaires (to the preiudice of either). Which if we
should admit, we should not haue a perfect vnion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to order, but the one should be swallowed vp,
and both be confounded: as the parts of a mans natural
body, they haue their peculiar offices and duties, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

both, that there being a necessity of each other, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
mutuall helpes from each other, it might serue as
a surer bond of their loue. Thus in nature, the man hath
strength of limbes for his labour, the woman hath
weaknes, yet cleanlines; wherby is signified the seueral
duties of both, whereunto nature hath disposed them,
which ought to be reserued whole and entire to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
thou (that art a husband) make thy selfe no Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite,
to busie thy selfe and to prie into euery

of iustice, his owne sinne should bee recompensed with
his owne shame in the same kinde; supposing his owne
vncleannes to bee a naturall in-undation, which hath
ouerwhelmed whole mankind: others though chast,
thorough the impotency and weaknes of their owne

feare that in others, which they do not finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Now for their punishment, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

iust iudgements of God, that according to their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery

so they should perplex and torment themselues with
their owne thoughts. There is yet a third sort of men,
who out of the immoderat loue of their owne wifes,
doting vpon their beauty, being totally carnall, <hi>vxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissimi,</hi>
neither regarding the brightnes and glory of

they begin to be fond and iealous of their wises; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of their loue, turnes vnto iealousie; their greatest

God laughes at the counsels of men, who being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

they are wiues; and therefore no maruaile, if in the

            <p>Thus assuredly the greatest cause of complaint is in
the husband, who hath the gouernment of his wife,
who might in wisdome preuent his owne shame, and
should teach her a modest and chaste carriage; but I

know not what ill spirit hath set them at enmity,<note place="margin">A bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue against marriage after diuorse.</note> whom
God hath coupled together: sometimes indeed the
streame of the husbands loue, being carried another
way, is apt to cast any aspersion vpon his wiues honesty;
and then he begins to practise with heretickes, and to
commend the law of liberty, that after a diuorse it
should be lawfull to marry againe, and againe. Heere
you shall see large expositions written in defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

Here are their wholsome and sound doctrines, their
manifold and good vses, their learned and excellent
applications: thus because God was incarnat, appearing
in the basenesse &amp; frailtie of our flesh, though free from
the sinfulnes and pollution of our nature, therefore do
these men desire to make religion not incarnat, that is,
fitted to mans capacity and apprehension; but a religion
carnall, professing a sanctitie of spirit, in the vncleannes
of the flesh, admitting the loosenesse and sensualitie of
Turkisme, into the strict and austere profession of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,
and here is pure, impure carnalitie. But O thou

that a could and chast bloud, which thou supposest to

religion, as in ancient times the sacrifice of beasts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

worshipping of beasts among the Gentiles. Alas, how
many are perplexed with the variety, and diuersity of
sects, not knowing how to resolue themselues? whereas
in truth and verity, there can be no greater certainty or
infallibility, then in the immoueable foundations and
grounds of religion; if we shall detract from the waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vncertainty of our own fancies, and relie vpon the
diuine testimonies; the exposition and true meaning
whereof, by the daily practise of the Church, consent

Let it suffice, that the faith of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which heere we professe, was not framed yeaster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to serue the present turne and occasion, by new
vpstart and heathenish innouators; when as Clearkes
did seeme very learnedly to dispute, yet a secret close
policy did ouer-rule the conclusion; but such a faith as
all the Fathers imbraced, all the councels approued, all
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3385:154"/>
the learned Diuines confirmed, in the Greeke Church,
in the Latin Church; which all the Martyrs haue sealed
with their bloud, al the Confessors witnessed with their
torments; a faith confirmed by so many miracles, taught
by the Apostles, first opened and reuealed by Christ,
<hi>qui erat splendor patris,</hi> who was a light to enlighten
the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel. This
faith was prefigured in the law, with sacrifices and types
fore-told by the Prophets, and shadowed forth in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by the vndoubted promises of God, <hi>semen mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
conteret serpentis caput:</hi> so that my faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherby I looke to be saued, was the faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Adam,</hi> which I can deriue by a lineall descent
from age vnto age, shewing the expresse foot-steps, and
where the Church hath alwayes resided; like a hungry
dog thirsting after my saluation. I can follow the sent
and pursue the chase, from the first day of the worlds
birth, (for together with the creation of man, was the
end of mans creation, and the meanes to obtaine this
end, Truth is most ancient, as being of the nature of
God, and God himselfe is the ancient of dayes; and in
all our doubts of religion, wee must still flie to the first
institution, <hi>an sic fuit ab initio</hi>), vnto this present day,

setled in a peaceable Church, without persecution, the
truth of religion sufficiently appearing without any
great opposition of Turkes, of Iewes, or of Heathen,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3385:154"/>
hauing now gotten respit and ease, we do not so much
intend the actions of zeale and deuotion, as the point
of our learning, and the sufficiency of our knowledge;
which notwithstanding is not so proper and peculiar
to Priest-hood, as is the practise of Pietie, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the height and perfection of a christian life; some
(I say) rather intending their studies then their prayers,
desiring to show the strength of their learning, they
must enter the combat of wits, and heere they must
seeme to dissent and to be irreconcileable; while closly
and vnder-hand, they send forth their agents, and
messengers to treate of a peace; and with a nice and
quaint distinction, can take vp the difference among
themselues, without shedding one drop of bloud; while
the world takes notice of their disagreement, and being
not able to iudge of their words of art, and the trickes
of their wit, still conceaues them to be at deadly enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
I know not what to say of their learning, but I doe
much condemne their dishonesty, to make shew of
difference, when indeed there is none; and the schoole
learning it selfe, which makes all things disputable,
howsoeuer I do highly commend it, for wisdome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and iudgement, yet I feare it hath not proued so
profitable and beneficiall to the Church; as hauing stird
vp those iars, which it could neuer asswage, like the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

for man is easily prouokt, but not so easily reconciled;
out of the frowardnes of our mindes, disputations doe
rather conceale, then open a truth; but it were to bee
wished rather, that the vulgar should neuer be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>And therfore I will conclude, that the Church at this

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his net brake, but as the Diuines doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
it was to let in fish, and not to let out fish, and
so the euent proued accordingly: make I beseech you

which keepes the gate of Paradise with a fiery
sword, (that is) with fire, and with sword: Secondly,
<hi>Peters</hi> reprehension was, that when many came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Christ, all of them were not his enemies, some
came to behold him, some to heare him, some to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionat
him, while others betrayed and apprehended
him; yet Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> I will not iudge of his intention,
in the heat of his zeale drawes out his sword, which he
could not lawfully do, and strikes off the eare of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:</hi>
the eare is the instrument of hearing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens
the sole meanes of mans conuersion; but Christ
heales vp the wound, restores his eare, rebukes <hi>Peter</hi>
and threatens him; hee that drawes out the sword shall
perish by the sword, he that abuseth the sword, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
prouokes the secular power, shall at length smart
by the sword, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the persecutions of the Church, it is no maruaile
though God doth permit them, seeing that Christian

should at length sit vpon thrones, iudging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

            <p>As man was corrupted, and all the creatures forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their first and naturall vse, did serue for mans pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and rebelled against him; so it stood with the
vniformitie of Gods iudgements,<note place="margin">The generall deluge.</note> that nothing should
remaine vntouched, no not the elements themselues,
being the first principles, seeds &amp; foundations of nature,
for as man was totally defaced, and had lost the image
of God, so this world though comming far short of
that most excellent state of Paradise, yet being Gods
owne immediat work-man-ship, and so still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
God at length in his wisdome for our sins, thought
fit to deface it; and behold the rule of his iustice, when
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3385:156"/>
as the children of God were mixt with the children of
men, God sends a deluge of waters to confound them
together. Death is the punishment of sin, that we might
heerein acknowledge Gods owne handy worke, the
iudgement fell from aboue, their graues were fashioned
in the clouds, and the elements did for a time change
their situation, and these were likewise confounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
and as in the creation the waters did flow vpon
the face of the earth; so now againe the whole world
did seeme to goe backward, and to returne to the first
nothing. Hence began a great alteration in nature, and
all things were changed to the worst; the earth did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in plenty and goodnes of fruits, for immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the deluge, God did enlarge <hi>Noahs</hi>-commission,
and gaue him free power to feed on the flesh of the
creatures;<note place="margin">Losses sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</note> the water likewise lost her naturall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of goodnesse, and therefore <hi>Noah</hi> immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to plant a vine-yard; the ayre was more subiect to
vapours, foggy mists, and darke clouds; the fire with hot

meteors, was made more imperfect and impure; the
heauens themselues haue not freely escaped, though
these sublunary contagions could not infect the stars,
yet were they able much to hinder the goodnes of their
actions and operations, as likewise to eclipse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
their beauty; some of them neuer appearing vnto
vs, as are those stars <hi>in via lactea;</hi> others seeme twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

gloominesse of our ayre, not giuing passage to their
beames; and all of them appeare short in beauty, lesse
in quantitie then indeed they are, and assuredly are
much hindred in their operations.</p>
            <p>So that this generall deluge was indeed the generall
confusion of nature; and as it was the death of nature,
so nature her selfe could neither hinder nor hasten her

owne death; and being once fallen,<note place="margin">The naturall meanes were not sufficient to cause a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</note> she could not raise
her selfe by her own naturall power, for howsoeuer the
God of nature might well vse naturall meanes (the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
constellations) for the effecting of his good will
and purpose; yet surely these in themselues were not
sufficient, vnlesse you will thereunto adde Gods infinit
power, and his absolut authority; for certaine it is, that
there was the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the yeeres 1524. and 1588. If we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that God did herein vse naturall meanes, they
might be numberlesse, as the power of God is infinit,
and his wisdome vnsearchable; yet such as reason &amp; the
schoole of Philosophy do most approue, are these: First,
that before the deluge the earth was more leuell, and

there might follow a transmutation and change of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
among themselues, where the earth might bee
turned into water, and carrie according to the rule of
Philosophy, <hi>decuplam proportionem,</hi> that euery ounce of
earth might bee turned into ten ounces of water; the
water likewise might bee summoned to appeare out of
the deepe, to change her scituation, to possesse the face
of the earth, according to her naturall course; the whole

vp a larger compasse, and still retayning her nature
might serue for our punishment; the bordering region
of the ayre, might be condensed and thickned, that it
might serue in stead of choking waters, and these might
be raised and puft vp with hot fumes, proceeding from
the bowels of the earth, which might make the boyling
or scalding seas to swell aboue measure. Thus infinit are
the wayes and meanes, which God might vse in this

of the earth, is a speciall meanes to reduce all waters to
one proper place, yet I suppose, that the wonders of
God do manifestly appeare in euery element. First, in
the earth subsisting in a centre, like an immoueable
stocke, carrying the same distance to euery part of the
circumference; then the waters, notwithstanding their
roaring, their continuall and strange motion, wherein
they seeme to threaten the earth, yet are kept within
their owne bounds, not incompassed with a wall of iron

            <p>For the truth and certainty of this deluge, see how
God did dispose in his prouidence, that the Arke should
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3385:158"/>
rest vpon the mountaines of Ararat, amongst which (as I
finde it reported) there are the highest mountaines in
the world, and the most in number; which was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
argument,<note place="margin">Proofes of the deluge from the resting of the Arke.</note> that this floud did ouerwhelme the

and remember the great in-undation of
waters; for thus <hi>Nicholaus Damascenus,</hi> an heathen
man writeth, that in a generall deluge, one was carried
in an Arke, and rested vpon the top of these mountains,
whereon there continued a long time after, certaine
peeces and fragments of the Arke; and this might bee
the same, which <hi>Moses</hi> the Law-giuer of the Iewes
doth mention.</p>

so many fadomes vnder the earth, as that by al probable
coniecture they were there buried and couered in the
time of the deluge; God foreseeing the wastfulnes
which man would commit in the spoyle of his woods,

as the schooles speake, the bosome of the earth

of waterie sappe, God hath ordained it, as a
fit subiect for fuell, which in these last dayes, (our wood
fayling, especially in these colde Northerne countries)
God hath very plentifully discouered; and that which
giues credit to this truth, I haue obserued this in the
cole-pits, that where there hath been a moderate fall,
and descent of water, there the cole hath been much
weightier, brighter, and better; as for mettals there is
not the like reason in them, for assuredly they follow
the course of the heauens, as they are framed by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
influence of Starres; wherein appeares the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, that in so painefull and such a dangerous
worke, poore man might obserue a greater certaintie
in his labours.</p>
            <p>I suppose likewise, that the vn-euennes of the earth
(the hils and the vales) were much caused by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
deluge; for ye shall obserue, that the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
vpon earth, carrie some proportion to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

certaine it is, that all the terrible tokens, and signes of
Gods anger and wrath, did accompanie the deluge; and
as the waters did swell aboue measure, so the billowes
and waues of the Sea did arise in a wonderfull and
fearefull manner; and these (surely) might well cause a
great inequalitie in the earth; and therefore you shall

did serue as a speciall meanes (by Gods owne appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
to allay the raging of the waters; and againe to

able to trace the continued succession of times, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of tribes and families from <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sonnes,
as likewise the plantation of nations, the establishing
of kingdomes and gouernments; so that nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue
in this kinde, to him that hath made but a small
entrance in the studie of Chronologie; as likewise the
attempts of men soone after the deluge, for preuenting
the like in-undation, as namely the building of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
&amp;c. many things as yet appeare in their lawes and
their customes; especially places (reserued for keeping
of their auncient recordes) so built, as that they might

be free from the annoyance of waters.</p>
            <p>For the Gentiles, their Philosophers considering
that the world was vpheld by opposition and combate
of elements, and that the elements were not equally
matched, but doe fight vpon disaduantage; for two of
them are actiue and two passiue, the actiue qualities
farre exceeding the passiue in vertue, power and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
hereby they did conceiue that there might be an
ouerthrow and dissolution in nature, either by water or
fire, which were therefore not improperly called the
dreadfull and destroying elements; whereby the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning the generall deluge, was made the
more credible, which deluge was known vnto them by
the name of <hi>Ogiges</hi> or <hi>Deucalions</hi> floud: not, but that I
acknowledge there was a floud which happened in the
time of <hi>Ogiges,</hi> and another in the time of <hi>Deucalion;</hi>
but assuredly such things are reported of these two
flouds, which could not be competent or agreeable, but
onely to the vniuersall deluge; and therefore I suppose
that the deluge was called by the name of <hi>Ogiges</hi> or
<hi>Deucalions</hi> floud, because these gaue occasion, and did
rippe vp and renew the memorie thereof; this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,

who was the most auncient writer among the

no author, no monument is extant; and that you
may not thinke, that this truth was fastened vpon the
ancients, or that their workes should heerein admit a
fauourable construction; the Heathen and Pagans at
this day in Bresill, and other countries of the West-Indies,
lately discouered in our age, where neuer any
Christian professors were knowne to teach; yet they
talke of the drowning of the world, which happened in
times past; and they say, that this was left vnto them by

and a naked bow: Where is the shaft? it is alreadie

God hath so disposed it, that it might serue rather as a
memoriall for God, to put him in mind of his promise,
then as a terrour to man, to strike vs with feare of Gods
vengeance. And therefore this bow shall serue as a
bridge, as a bow-bridge, by which I will passe ouer this
great in-undation of waters, <hi>humbly praising and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
God, that as the old world was ouerwhelmed by
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3385:161"/>
waters; so God in his mercie hath appointed, that there
should be a regeneration by waters, that the old Adam
being washed and cleansed from sinne, we might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into the arke of Christs Church, through the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
waters of the holy stood of Iordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing spoken of the first ouerthrow of the world
by waters, I cannot but in a word, (for similitude of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
though otherwise the iudgements shall bee
wrought by different and contrary meanes), speake of
the second ouerthrow, which shall be by fire, in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
combustion. Behold then, the earnest of this last
iudgement, when as Sodom and Gomorrha were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
with fire from heauen, that it might serue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
as a remarkable token,<note place="margin">The burning of Sodom and Gomorrha is an earnest of the last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> or the first beginning of a
general combustion, which threatens the whole world.
Vnto this day the place is vnhabitable, fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
hauing left such a strong sent, as might well argue
the strange ebullition of their vnnaturall lust: and as it
was a lust, which did not intend generation; so was it
the most vnnaturall act, without any president or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the bruite beasts, for none of them are tainted
with such vncleannesse. And therfore (behold) their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
carries a proportion and correspondencie to
the offence: whereas they should haue intended by an
orderly course of nature, the preseruation of their seed,
in the fruites of their loynes; the propagation of their
kinde, and the continuance of their names and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
themselues taking a cleane contrarie course, &amp;c.
(the remembrance hereof is most hatefull, detestable,
and abominable to euery chaste and Christian minde).
Therefore by the iust iudgements of God, these Cities
were turned, by their destruction, into a strange lake;
which vnto this day, is knowne by the name of <hi>mare
mortuum,</hi> the dead Sea, wherein nothing can liue: for
proofe and certaintie whereof, as trauellers at this time

            <p>But you will say, that this iudgement is only proper

for your further satisfaction, in the darke and thicke

encompassed, as if wee could not separate these iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but that the one did carrie and portend the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and (as it were) giue place to the other. For when
the Sunne shall haue gathered out of the bowels of the
earth, a sulfureous matter, fit and apt for combustion; as
much in effect, as if I should say, when our iniquities are
come to a full height, and ripenesse, and that our sinnes
are climed vp to heauen, and there crie for vengeance,
<hi>cum calles obdurârint;</hi> then behold, he that sits vpon the

at large the testimonies both of <hi>Abydenus,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
about King <hi>Alexander</hi> time, and of <hi>Sibylla,</hi> as also
the words of <hi>Hestieus,</hi> concerning the land of Senaar,
where it was builded: and these Gentiles doe shew by
reason, that if there had not been some such miracle in
the diuision of tongues; no doubt but that all tongues
being deriued of one (as all men are descended of one
father) the same tongues would haue retained the same
rootes, and principles, as in all dialects or deriuation of
tongues, we see that it commeth to passe: but now (say
they) in many tongues, at this day, wee see that there is
no likelihood or affinity among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but are al different
the one from the other: and thereby it appeareth, that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3385:162"/>
they were made diuers and distinct by some speciall
miracle.</p>
            <p>Herein the iustice of God appeares, that seeing man
desired to continue his owne memorie, by the workes
of his owne hands, without any reference to the diuine
power; therefore God confoundeth their tongues,<note place="margin">How agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was to the offence.</note> that
their speech and their language might faile them, to
record their owne acts: and that they might neuer bee
able to conspire or take counsell together; when the
one calles vp for timber, the other breakes his backe in
carrying vp stones; one calles for his instruments and
tooles, but another brings morter to stop his mouth:
thus euery man either suspecteth himselfe to bee in a
dreame or else accuseth all others of madnesse and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;
and thus there is a dumbe silence of pratling crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there is a noyse or a sound without sense or signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
for want of one knowne and common tongue
to interpret. Thus the punishment was agreeable to the
diuine iustice, and very conformable to mans present
state and condition: for whereas our mindes are distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with varietie of opinions,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to mans condition.</note> and our hearts carried
headlong to diuers inordinate lusts; so the tongue
should likewise bee confounded with many base and
barbarous languages, some of them very harsh in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
that a man must wrong his owne visage,
and disfigure himselfe to speake them: others without
grauitie or wisdome in their first imposition, consisting
only of many bare, and simple tearmes, not reduced to
any certaine fountaines, or heads, which best resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth

expresse the quicknes of inuention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or liuelily
expresse an action: some giuing way to fallacies and

he is inwardly, and outwardly, totally confounded.</p>
            <p>For the large extent of this punishment, it may well
appeare by a due consideration, either of place, or time.
For all nations in the world seeme more to be diuided
with tongues,<note place="margin">The extent of this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> then with seas, with riuers, with bankes,
or with gouernments; and in the same tongue you shal
obserue a great diuersitie of dialects, the Grecians
speake diuersly their owne language, Attice, Ionice,

that Seuerne &amp; Trent do moysten the seuerall tongues

               </gap>eminency
of the one aboue the other, yet the meanest will not
conforme it selfe to the best: the Welsh suppose their
owne tongue to be as honourable, in regard of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie,
as the English doe daily seeme curious in filing
and refiling of theirs. Now in the succession of times it
appeares, that all the ancient languages, which indeede
were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fittest caskets to containe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewels of mysteries,
haue already failed, either in the vse and speech of men,
as the Hebrew, Greeke, Latin, Syriacke, Chaldaick, &amp;c.
or else are wholly extinct, and abolished. As heere in
England, the Saxon tongue; and the language of the
Picts in Italy; what tongues the Gothes and Vandols
did speake: and he that shall peruse our English <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
shall finde more difficultie in his words, then in his
sense. And thus the confusion of tongues serues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
vs of each others helpe; we cannot partake with
other nations in their counsell and experience. Our
owne forefathers committing their workes to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3385:164"/>
they seeme aliens and strangers vnto vs; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
vnderstand them, without the vse of Dictionaries,
and Commentaries.</p>
            <p>To let passe, how nations haue issued out of nations,
and all men descended from one, whereby they might
retaine the same speech and language,<note place="margin">The strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this iudgement.</note> for the learning
and perfection of the reasonable soule; as they doe the
like foode for preseruation of their bodies, and the same
seede for propagation of their kind. But for this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of tongues, I would gladly aske, Doe not all other
creatures of the same kinde, agree in one and the same
language of nature, wherby they testifie to each other,
either their ioy, or their sorrow? Haue not many birds
as much varietie in their notes and tunes, and yet all are
the same in the same kinde; as there are words and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables
which passe betweene men? I pray', doth it not
appeare, in all other workes of nature, that the inward
forme doth naturally of her selfe discouer her selfe, by
some outward propertie? and why should not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soule make her selfe knowne by a naturall
speech and language, that wee might see the inward
man as well as the outward feature? for speech is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the same, and alike in all men? Is not the ayre and
breath the same, which frames the sound of this voyce?
Take all instruments of musicke, and being fashioned
alike, you shal find a like sound, they consist of a meane,
a treble, a tenour, a base, &amp;c. they haue so many strings,
so many stops, they giue the same musicke; that is, the
same language in effect, though the lessons doe varie,
that is, the difference consists in the diuersitie of their
speech, or their conference. Are there not many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
notes, which are alike common to all languages?
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3385:165"/>
(our laughter, our sighing, our sobbing, our sneesing);

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet cannot the minde naturally disclose her
owne secrets? Is there any thing so proper and peculiar
to man, as societie and fellowship; and yet for want of
one common language, the kind cannot conuerse with
it selfe? and yet you may obserue in all languages, how
there is a necessitie of the same alphabet; for there are
but fiue vowels, and more or lesse there cannot bee,
which proceedes from the opening or contraction of
the mouth: will Nature lay the foundation, and yet
God in his wisedome forbid to finish this building?
then is it euident, that contrarie to the first intent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wee are changed and altered by sinne; God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
our tongues, brings our workes to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>But (I pray') consider the occasions which might serue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or the retaining of the same language: Are not all men
deriued from the loines of one,<note place="margin">Meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine the same language.</note> and the same man? haue
not nations issued foorth out of nations? and is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that they should retaine the same seede, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their beginnings, obserue the same rites, customes
and manners, and yet forget their owne language? In
Pembroke-shire certaine Dutch-men being anciently
permitted to inhabit, their posteritie vnto this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the luxurie and riot (proper to that nation), and
yet they haue forgotten their language. Thus the
tongue serues to be <hi>instrumentum gustus &amp; loquelae,</hi>
the instrument of taste, the instrument of speech; the
one she stil practiseth, the other she hath cleane forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and in both you may acknowledge the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mans nature, and the iust punishment of mans
sinne.</p>
            <p>If our beginning bee forgotten, and that wee haue
learned a strange language; yet (me thinkes) the noble
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3385:165"/>
and braue conquest of Princes,<note place="margin">The Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</note> especially the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of the world, should haue reduced all things; as
to the vniformitie of gouernment, so to the vniformitie
of tongues: that all being ruled and guided by one law,
hauing recourse to the Emperours court, doing their
homage and seruice to his person; this might be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
meanes to auoyd barbarisme, and to re-unite the
tongues of men in one speech, as the bodies of men are
knit together vnder one yoake of subiection. But all
will not serue against the diuine prouidence, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
their tongues, who hath likewise confounded
their Monarchies; sooner you may suppresse a state, and
put them all to the sword; then that you can bridle their
mouthes, bring them to schoole, and teach them a new
tongue.</p>
            <p>If the sword cannot preuaile, yet (me thinkes) the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of trading,<note place="margin">The necessity of trading and commerce.</note> and commerce should inforce a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the same language: especially considering that
there are certaine fruits proper to nations; and as their
soyle yeelds them, as their country affoords them, so
the inhabitants first impose the name, and this name
should accompany the fruits, and be together transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to those nations, to whom these fruits are imparted;
for (assuredly,) the name would no way increase the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
or price of the commodities: but it should seeme,
that together with the change of our windes, and our
sailes in the passage, we must alter these names; or els
we haue forgotten the ould names, and remembring
only the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and valuation, we do well hope, that a new
name may make a new price; supposing that it lies in
our power, being now masters of the commoditie, to
giue it a name at our pleasure, and thus you see the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of tongues.</p>
            <p>But of all other meanes to reduce the world to one
language, (me thinks) the greatest consists either in the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3385:166"/>
necessity of the same lawes,<note place="margin">The vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of lawes and of religion.</note> which in ancient times haue
gouerned the whole world; or els from the vniformity
and concent of religion, which vnites and knits toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the hearts of all men in one league of faith, the
tongues of all men in one confession of faith, the actions
of all men in one seruice of faith, and in the same bonds
of charity and deuotion. So that there is notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the separation of persons, time, and place, a perfect
communion of Gods Saints. If generall councells
should meete and assemble together, necessary it is, that
they should confer in one common language, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
such things as may generally tend to the good of
the whole Church; or if we should be inforced to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
it were to be wisht that we might not be destitute
of the meanes for our soules health, but that wee might
bee fit to ioyne with all congregations in prayer; yet
God forbid, that wee should pray in an vnknowne
tongue, which in effect were, to offer vp vnto God, the
calues of our lips (<hi>vitulos labioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>), without the burning
incense of the heart, which should set on fire the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and make it acceptable; and heere you may well
obserue the curse of God in the confusion of tongues.</p>
            <p>This punishment doth not only argue how tongues
are confounded among themselues, that from one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and instrumentall tongue,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appeares not only in the variety of tongues, but likewise in the distraction.</note> there should proceed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
notes and numberlesse tongues and languages; but
likewise how the tongues are distracted, from all other
mans faculties; how hard it is, to keepe the heart and
the tongue in an equal pace, that neither of them should
run before, and leaue the other behind it: in our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
prayers, doth not the mouth run ouer the seruice,
when the heart is wandring in the fields about our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vocation, and sometimes is stained with vncleane
thoughts? hath not the tongue learned her lesson with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
booke, speakes like a Parrat, and seemes to excuse
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3385:166"/>
mans negligence, and to conspire with the world and
the flesh, for the couering and concealing of sinne; that
without a first mouer, without the hearts direction or
consent, she is able to play her owne part, and to set a
difference between the outward and the inward man in
one and the same person.</p>
            <p>Suppose the heart and the tongue should ioyne their
forces together, and both labour and ioyne in one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet what a difficulty appeares in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,<note place="margin">A difficulty for a man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his own thoughts.</note>
as if they could not discouer their own inuentions
or notions? how hard is it to describe an action to the
full life? there must be as great wisdome and policie in
the relation, as there was in the first assault and attempt;
there must be the same spirit, life, courage and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
heere you shall finde words of defiance, as it were
spit out in bloud; anon nothing but mildenes and
tearmes of compassion: now to temper and square out
a speech for men of all sorts, of all degrees, vpon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
it is a very high point of wisdome; and therfore
the Historian deserues great commendation, almost as
much as the actors; and it were to be wished, that hee
which holds vp his speare, should at length take vp his
pen, and describe his own acts: <hi>Caesar</hi> hath written
Commentaries, <hi>Cominaeus</hi> the actions of his master, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
the gouernment of the Romans, and <hi>Machiauel</hi>
the state of the Florentins: if difficulty appeares in the
relation, if the most naturall action of man, his speech
be troublesome or defectiue; acknowledge the curse of
man, in the confusion of tongues.</p>
            <p>Especially I conceaue, that it is a great difficulty for a
wiseman to expresse his own meaning,<note place="margin">A wise man can hardly be a good speaker.</note> conceiuing all in
an instant, after an angelical manner; for him to descend
lower then himselfe, and cutting out his meaning by
peeces, to square it by the rules of a method, to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
capacity; neither his patience will permit him, nor
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3385:167"/>
the height of his vnderstanding eleuated aboue the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
reach, can admit such a down-fall: in so much that
you shall find few of the wisest men, to haue the best vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
and deliuery. Againe, multitudes of words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens
a great want of substance, and therfore desires to
make recompence with leaues, for want of the fruit and
kernell of vnderstanding; for assuredly the greatest
number and multiplying of words, argues the least
weight and poyse in the substance. But dumbe beasts
are not therfore dumbe beasts, because they are not
heard, for their sound and noyse is far greater then ours;
but they are therfore dumbe beasts, because they spake
not distinctly to our vnderstanding: and so many men
and many woemen may bee called dumbe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their verbositie and multitudes of words. The
sweetnes of musicke appeares as well in the pause, the
respit and keeping of time; as in the notes, the tune, or
the voyce: sometimes a silence is as fit, and as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in man, as at other times his speech, or his vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>How great a part of our age is taken vp in learning
of languages, from ten to twenty, from twenty to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">The difficulty in learning tongues.</note>
scarce the whole life of man will suffice? In all our
Vniuersities, you shall finde the Greeke and Hebrew
professors, to be the most ancient and the most painefull
students; and yet they teach nothing in effect, but only
the bare language: how many Grammars, what infinit
rules, what dictionaries, and phrases of speech are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the helpe of our studies? Grammar is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
which leades to the mart of all sciences; if thou
mistakest thy selfe in the entrance, thou shalt greatly
wander in the whole course of thy trauell: suppose thou
hast laid a good foundation, and hast proued an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Grammarian; yet their seems to be a kind of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
between the studie of nature, and the knowledge
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3385:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of tongues: the one grounding it selfe, vpon the setled
foundation of a good memory, the other quickned by
the speedy discourse and apprehension of a ripe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wit:<note place="margin">Defects in Grammar.</note> neither do tongues follow the order and
course of nature, for in many things which nature hath
rankt in one kinde, and giuen them the same properties,
yet in grammar you shall find them infinitly to differ in
their genders, their numbers, declensions; wheras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there should bee some kind of affinity between
Logick and Grammar, the one directing his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the other framing his speech, and both of them
should ranke things <hi>in serie praedicamentali:</hi> as things
are ioyned or differ in nature, so they should obserue
the like agreement or distance in mans conceit or vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and yet the art it selfe is to be excused, <hi>loquendum
vt vulgus,</hi> such was the necessity of Grammar, that it
proceeded not by degrees like other arts, not cannot
admit a reformation, as being promiscuously dispersed
through the mouths of the multitude; yet such hath bin
the painfull attempts of the learned, that heerein they
haue left nothing vndone, which might make for the
perfection of the art.</p>
            <p>The greatest confusion (in my iudgement) doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
especially appeare, when the parts do wilfully and
maliciously oppose each other: that notwithstanding
the hearts priuitie and knowledge,<note place="margin">Periury and lying proceed from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</note> together with the
inward and vndoubted testimony of his own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
yet the tongue and the outward man shall sweare
and depose the contrary: and therein shall take God to
be the witnesse of falshood, as if they did desire God to
alter and change his owne nature, rather then these
miscreants will conforme themselues to the truth of his
nature. Here you see the corruption of man in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of tongues, heere is the height and top of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
now as steps and degrees hereunto, are lying, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3385:168"/>
mentall reseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ambiguous, doubtful and
darke speeches; all which haue their degrees of accesse
vnto periurie, according to substance or circumstance.
And hence it is, that the casuist Diuine desiring truth,
and nothing but truth, obligeth the conscience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth
the speaker, to speake according to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of another, and not of himselfe; so that he must
be inwardly perswaded in his owne conscience, that
the other did conceiue him, in the same manner, as hee
himselfe vnderstood his owne words; otherwise at the
barre of his conscience hee shall be iustly condemned
for falsehood and lying.</p>
            <p>To leaue the great and crying sinne of periurie, it
stood with the iustice of God (the heart and the tongue
being thus diuided) to set a difference betweene the
eare and the vnderstanding:<note place="margin">The very tongues doe sometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> that as man deales with
God, and deales with man deceitfully; so God frames
out his iustice according to measure and rule, that man
might bewaile his owne punishment, for committing
the like offence; for assuredly many tongues doe much
hinder the diligent search of the truth. It were to bee
wished, that we might speake the language of <hi>Adam,</hi>
where names were imposed according to the nature of
things; but now it should seeme, there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
for the most pleasing speech adorned with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,
and Figures, is not the fittest for the discouerie
of a truth: and on the contrarie, all the schoole lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which indeed is the very touch-stone of all truth,
and in it selfe is most wise, and farre transcending the
ordinarie capacitie, yet suffers the shamelesse and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
reproch of barbarisme, for want of the elegancie
of stile; and all the first parents and authors thereof,
who indeed were the lights and lampes of all true lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as <hi>Lumbard, Sanctus Thomas, Scotus, Occam, yet</hi>
are contemned and neglected by this poeticall and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3385:168"/>
phantasticall age, which delights more in words then
in substance.</p>
            <p>To giue an euident proofe of this confusion of
tongues, how plentifull are the schooles, and how doe
they abound with multitudes of distinctions? all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
must end with distinctions, which assuredly wel
argueth, that if the branches must necessarily be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to serue the present turne and occasion, yet still the
roote is confounded: a great iudgement of God, that
man hauing forsaken the first fruite, and hauing associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe to the beasts of the field; therfore he proues
a stranger to himselfe, to his brethren, and forgets his
owne mother tongue.<note place="margin">Whether man should speake naturally He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</note> Indeede I haue heard it repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by authors, that if a man were taught no other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
then hee should speake Hebrew, the same lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which <hi>Adam</hi> spake in the beginning: but I
should as easily beleeue, that if a man wanted all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
meanes to sustaine life, that then hee should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
recouer Ierusalem, from the hands of the Turks,
and that God should there call all the tribes together,
or raise vp <hi>Adam,</hi> there to conuerse and talke with him
in the Hebrew tongue; as that he should speake natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Hebrew, for the curse was generall in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of tongues: though speech be proper and naturall
to man, yet this, or that language, followes the franke
and free imposition of man, and hath no ground-work

            <p>That which gaue occasion to this opinion, was this,
what language men should speake in Paradise, or after

them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ and his Apostles were Hebrewes, first sent
to the Iewes, and then to the Gentiles. Vpon the Crosse
Christ vsed his owne tongue, <hi>Eloi eloi lamasabactha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
notwithstanding the tongue was vnknowne to the
souldiers. And in the Apocalyps, although the booke
was first written in Greeke, yet the Angels song in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is there recorded in Hebrew: but when I consider,
that man shall haue a higher state, then was the state of
Paradise, and that his bodie shall be much more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and his vnderstanding more illuminated, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
before; for we shall then be like the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
who speake to each other, by directing the edge of
their vnderstanding to each other, as it were opening
the glasses, and casting foorth a light to each other:
Considering (I say) the different condition of renewing
to a better state, and continuance in the same state, they
must pardon me, if I doe not affirme this, as an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
truth in mine owne priuate opinion.</p>
            <p>From this diuersitie and varietie of tongues, you
shall obserue a great disorder both in the State and in
the Church; whence proceedes the enmitie betweene
nations,<note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from this confusion of tongues.</note> and the first occasion of reproch? where doe
they first begin to discouer themselues, but onely from
the diuersitie of the garbe and the language? To see a
poore Northerne man, with his gaping &amp; wide mouth
vsing his broad and flat speech, brought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the stage,
heere is a subiect of laughter for the multitude: but I
feare, that this hate and enmitie betweene nations, doth
nourish and adde fuell to the hot strife and contention
of the Church, in the point of her controuersies; or at
least I may truly say, that infinite are the contentions of
the Church about words; all which proceed from that
curse of man, the confusion of tongues; which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
auoide, but seeme rather daily to increase our own
shame: we fight about shadowes, wee contend about
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:3385:169"/>
words; many doubts in Christian religion seeme to be
grounded vpon the signification of words, and tearmes
of art; how many Sacraments hath Christ ordained in
his Church? a question of words: doe Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
grace, <hi>ex opere operato?</hi> a question of words; is
honour due to the Saints? a question of words, and such
like infinite questions.</p>
            <p>Sometimes in the very exposition, or interpretation
of words, being simple and first notions, (as the schoole
speakes) and no tearmes of art: there are many &amp; great
controuersies in Christian religion, whether Christ in
his sole and humane nature did really and truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
into hell;<note place="margin">Great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies about words.</note> if wee could agree vpon the exposition
of the word, it would sufficiently resolue the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie:
or will you see an infernal state here vpon earth,
whether <hi>presbyteri</hi> should signifie lay elders, or not; it
hath been much disputed by some men, whose zeale is
not according to knowledge. Thus the holy Ghost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scripture, giuing the stile, the words,
the method, as well as the sense: if any one of these be
altered or changed, it loseth the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the Canon;
and therefore he that shall take vpon him to interpret
Scripture, doth only giue his owne exposition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which exposition being priuate and proper to
himselfe, I will regard it no more, then the opinion of
one priuate man; so that, if in my reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
I shall obserue some generall agreement, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their learned iudgements, though Scripture
be not instantly quoted to that purpose, yet I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it as much, as I will the Geneua translation. Lest
other professions should thinke much of our iarres, I
will therefore in the second place instance in the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

when as the whole doubt ariseth from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and signification of words? A Lordship hauing

               </gap>t vpon the heire at common law for
want of sufficient words to conuay it.</p>
            <p>As I haue remembred the iust punishment for our
sinnes, so giue me leaue in thankefulnesse of minde to
consider Gods prouidence, in this our confusion of
tongues.<note place="margin">Gods mercie in the vnion of these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> And that especially to vs, for God in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
intending to vnite and knit together these 2. king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> Hee so ordained it
from the beginning of the world, that (like twins) they
should both speake one tongue, and one language; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
in his due time hee should giue the promised Land
to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to his posterity for euer. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the truth of their beginning doth not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
appeare in Histories, notwithstanding some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
enmity which passed betweene both (for neighbour
kingdoms are not alwaies the greatest friends), and that
little meanes of trading or commerce passed betweene
both; yet God preserued their tongues, intending to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
their hearts vnder the happie gouernment, of one
entire and absolute Monarch. So that now the seas are
our wals on the right hand, and on the left hand, wee
neede not feare the Aegyptians, wee are built as a City,
<hi>Pacem habens ad inuicem,</hi> which is at vnitie within it
selfe: <hi>Deus nobis haec otia fecit; fecit nos in gentem v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,
&amp; quos Deus coniunxit, homo ne separet;</hi> God
hath made vs one Nation, and one people, and whome
God hath ioyned, let no man set a sunder.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the confusion of tongues seemes
to make for the difficulty and obscurity of knowledge;
behold the great prouidence of God,<note place="margin">Ancient and stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge tongues adde lustre to Sciences.</note> for supposing the
state of man to be (such as it is) wholly corrupted; such
is the neglect of man, that if Arts and Sciences were not
kept secret, as Mysteries concealed in the habite of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3385:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tongues, assuredly they would neuer be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in that high account and reputation. If gold were
not digged out of Mynes, with great labor, the losse of
mens liues, and farre transported; if it lay naked and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
as common as stones, assuredly wee should neuer
regard it. Nouelty and strangenesse moues the minde
of man, more then the true worth and perfection of
things; the ancient tongues are fittest to discouer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they are like rich garments, or olde roabes, kept
for the honour and memory of our Ancestours, to shew
our descent and first originall. They are like chaires of
estate, to giue honour and maiesty to Sciences, that thou
shouldest not sodainely approach vnto them, without
some ripenesse and stayednesse in iudgement; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
once attained them, thou shouldest retaine them
in a more magnificent manner.<note place="margin">Against tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations.</note> Now he that discouers
them, layes open their nakednesse, makes them knowne
to the vulgar eye, and clothes them with a homely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
of a common and barbarous tongue; as hee offers
great wrong and iniury to all students in generall, so he
doth much abase that Art whereof hee writes, which is
his principall subiect, and whereof he should principally
intend the praise and commendation; and likewise hee
looseth the fruite and end of his labour, for it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to teach any man perfectly an Art, whereof he shal
not make the profession.</p>
            <p>In this confusion of tongues, the same prouidence of
God doth likewise appeare, as concerning the poynt of
our religion,<note place="margin">That the title of Christ and Scripture should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue vnchangeable.</note> and the manifestation of his owne glory;
(not to speake of the wisdome and power of God, who
vnderstandeth all tongues, and searcheth the hidden se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the heart); it shall appeare by these two instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
first in the humiliation and passion of Christ, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that all the powers of man, together with
the malice of the deuill, did conspire against Christ;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3385:171"/>
though they put him to a shamefull death, yet could
they neuer alter his superscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Iesus Nazarenus Rex
Iudaeorum:</hi> which was written in three seuerall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
as it were proclayming him to the whole world
the king of the Iewes; though <hi>Pylate</hi> might bee enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to crucifie him, yet he could neuer bee enforced to
alter or change the title, which was lesse in effect, <hi>Quod
scripsi, scripsi,</hi> for so the wisedome of God hath decreed;
and impossible it was, that one iot or tittle of the lawe
should miscarry, which law whole and entire, together
with the superscription and kingdome of Christ, hath
still beene continued, maugre the attempts of men, the
slanders and reproches of the Iewes, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
were scattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the malicious practises of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
when they themselues are confounded; the manie
persecutions, and great effusion of blood in the Church,
which indeed did serue as seed to ingender, that so the
blessing of God might appeare in this our confusion of
tongues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, after his exaltation, he tooke occasion by
this diuersity of tongues, to send into the world his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and blessed Spirit; which came to the Apostles in the
forme of fiery and clouen tongues,<note place="margin">The gift of tongues.</note> 
               <hi>Linguas attulit, qui
pro verbo venit,</hi> he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came to beare record to the word,
brought with him multitudes of tongues: by vertue of
these tongues y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles receiued in an instant (without
further teaching, onely by the infusion of Gods spirit,
all manner of languages); wherby it should seeme, that
God intended to restore the ruines of <hi>Babell;</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them for their message to all Nations, for euery
mans conuersion; which sodaine gift of tongues, was a
seale of their embassage, and did serue as a miracle to
confirme the truth of their doctrine. See how God
laughes at the counsails of men; men intending to build
vp a tower vnto Heauen, for the continuance of their
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3385:171"/>
memory, God confoundeth their tongues, and brings
their works to confusion. Now God on the other side,
(as it were to make some recompence and satisfaction,
desiring to build Heauen vpon earth, to erect a state of
happinesse, and saluation in the middest of misery and
sinne), layes a better foundation, and giues his Apostles
the gift of all tongues; hee sends downe fiery tongues,
that being like burning Lampes, they might serue to
enlighten and enflame others: these fiery tongues were
clouen, that the benefit might be imparted and redound
vnto others, and not bee reserued whole and entire to
themselues; <hi>Habuerunt dissectas linguas, bilingues non
erant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The holie Ghost came in fierie tongues.</note> they knew not (though they knew all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
the language of Equiuocation; they knew not how
to propose words consisting onely of dead letters, and
bare syllables, hauing stolne away the sense and true
meaning, by (a trick of cousonage) some secret mentall
reseruation. Nay rather their great Lord and Master,
whose seruants and vessels they were, to carry his name
&amp; his title to all Nations; he was <hi>verbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in intellectu,</hi> a
word first begotten in the vnderstanding of God, borne
againe (as I may so say) in the heart of euery beleeuing
man by faith, and from the heart issuing forth at the
tongue; where he seems to be again incarnate, clothed
with the basenes of our words, as he was formerly clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vildnesse of our flesh. Thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
nothing but <hi>Iesus,</hi> their workes were all wrought
by the power &amp; name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> all their thoughts were

such was their inward substance, (<hi>Holocaustu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>)
a whole burnt sacrifice, set on fire with these fiery tongs,
kindling and enlightening the whole world, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
sparkes of this fire to their successours, (for the
lampes must alwaies burne in the Temple, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.

may know where to repaire for their soules health) by
vertue of the most holy imposition of hands.</p>
            <p>I will not stay my time,<note place="margin">The Author here humbly craues pardon for all his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> and in the latter end of my
speech craue pardon for all my offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, here rather I wil
now snatch at the present occasion, so fitly offered: if I
haue spoken any thing, or shall hereafter speake in this
Pamphlet, vnaduisedly, illiterately, without good order
or methode; acknowledge (I beseech thee) the generall
punishment of whole mankinde, which more especially
discouers it selfe in my weakenesse, the confusion of
tongues. I am confounded, I am confounded, poore
silly wretch that I am, I am confounded, my minde is
distracted, my tongue is confounded, and my whole
nature corrupted; in me, in mee alone, see the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whole mankinde, learne now to be compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate,
and pitifull, for I cannot altogether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

my weakenesse appeares, the presse hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

vndiscouered.</p>
            <p>Now in this generall confusion,<note place="margin">He recals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> I know not where to
betake my selfe, or what to speake in the next place, for
my tongue is confounded: I will therefore suppose my
selfe to be lost in the woods, and that at length after
much wandering I should recall my selfe; and finding
no way for my passage, I should haue recourse to my
Carde, and consider the intended scope of my iourney,
from whence I came, <hi>Natus ex muliere;</hi> my present state
and condition, I am a soiourner and stranger, as all my
forefathers were; the scope and end of my trauell, <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis
in puluerem,</hi> from dust to dust, that so (at length) I
might safely arriue to mine own natiue Country, <hi>à sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu

would thus informe and instruct mee, <hi>Vt secundum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3385:172"/>
to the dust, I should keep my straight way, neither
puft vp with pride aboue my naturall state, nor sinking
downe with despaire beneath my condition; that I
should not vpon any occasion start out of the way, but
remembring my beginning, remembring my end, I
should square out my course and trauaile accordingly.
Intending therfore to speak of the Fall of Man, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature, &amp; the punishment of the first sinne, I
will lay aside all other slighter punishments, all chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and corrections of sinne, which were infinite to
repeate; and I will onely insist in those two generall
iudgements, being indeed the extreames, the first and
the last, including all other punishments within their
bounds, 1. <hi>In dolore paries,</hi> thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bring forth with
paine and sorrow, being spoken to the woman; 2.
<hi>Morte morieris,</hi> thou shalt dye the death, pronounced
indifferently against both: and thus his corruption shal
appeare by his first welcome and salutation into this
world, and by his last adue and farewell out of his
world; you shall better iudge of the whole course of
his entertainement in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In dolore paries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</note> Gen. 3. vers. 16. <hi>Vnto the woman God
said, I will greatly increase thy sorrowes and thy concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
in sorrow shalt thou bring foorth children, &amp;c.</hi> As
the woman first sinned in tasting the forbidden fruite,
so she is punished in the fruite of her owne wombe;
here is the fruite of Gods iustice. But is it possible, that
the most naturall action, which indeede intends the
highest perfection of nature, <hi>generare sibi simile,</hi> should
notwithstanding proceede with such difficultie, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and torment? In all other actions and workes of
nature, you shall easily obserue, how they flow with the
greatest ease and delight of the subiect. O how sweete
and acceptable is sleepe to the wearisome body, meate
to the hungrie, drinke to the thirstie! and so for al other
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3385:173"/>
naturall workes! I will not insist in them; take death
it selfe, as it is natural to man, so vndoubtedly it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sorrow or griefe: for the punishment was, <hi>morte
morieris,</hi> but not, <hi>in dolore morieris:</hi> if you will suppose
man to rise by steps and degrees, and to fall againe by
the same steps and degrees; suppose him (I say) grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto 25. yeers, when the moysture seemes to bridle
his heate; then increasing in strength vnto 33. yeeres,
there to come to a state of consistencie, vntill 50. yeeres
be expired; then by the same degrees declining and
decaying, so that his moysture and heate giues place to
his coldnesse and drinesse; comming at length to the
disease of old age, without any vnnaturall distemper,
assuredly his life shall end as doth a lampe for want of
oyle, fire for want of fuell, without any paine or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but as the breath proceedes from his nostrels, so
shall the soule take her flight, and leaue the carkase be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
her; for heerein consists the difference betweene
naturall and vnnatural actions, the one performed with
the greatest ease and facilitie, the other being wrung
out with violence, carrie in themselues torture and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Thus all diseases proue therefore our torments,
because they are vnnaturall; then why should nature
be defectiue in her highest worke, that conception and
deliuerie should bee with such sorrow? whereas the
principall intent of nature is to preserue her selfe, and
to propagate her seed: behold the punishment and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature, when she cannot performe the one,
without the great hazard and danger of the other; this
certainly cannot consist with the first institution, and
integritie of nature, but is a subsequent punishment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
our sinne.</p>
            <p>Consider all other creatures, and you shall finde that

then in the generation of man: And yet you shall
finde it farre otherwise, notwithstanding the numbers
which many creatures bring foorth at once, and euery
one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carrying the like proportion to the damme,
as the childe doth to the mother; yet are they able to
worke, and continue in their full strength, vntill the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
time of their deliuerie, they know the iust time of
their bearing, and doe prepare themselues according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they can hasten or prolong the time of their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foorth; which well argues their strength of nature,
and the action without paine; they are neuer so perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
sound, vnlesse they are bearing, some of them
bringing foorth by great numbers at once; others
bring foorth euery day, as our common hens; and all of
them seeme to promise a kinde of certaintie in their
bearing, and yet in all of them the proportion, whether
for weight, quantitie, or figure appeares to be the same
with vs; and therefore should inforce the like sorrow,
and difficultie in them as in the woman. Yet they crie
for no helpe of midwiues, they want no keepers, or nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
they are deliuered without paine, or sorrow, they
haue foorthwith strength to make their owne proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for themselues, for their brood; yea their courage
seems much to be increased, that vpon any slight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the losse; or to be a president and example to vs,
to teach women their manner in Churching, which
ought to be with a song of ioy and thankfulnes to God,
for the fruits of their wombe, and for their happy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</p>
            <p>If some other creatures seeme to labour in the birth,
then acknowledge, that for mans sinne the whole earth
was accursed,<note place="margin">How this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is to be vnderstood.</note> and the dumbe creatures groane vnder
the burthen of our sinne; and therfore no maruaile, if
sometimes they share with vs in the punishment: for
thence we conclude the great offence, the malignitie
and infection of sinne, but I speake <hi>vt plurimum,</hi> for the

but in mans kinde it doth most eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and therefore acknowledge vs to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,
and them only as the accessaries in sinne. Againe,
if some women be of that strong constitution, so made
and fashioned by nature, so helpt and furthered by art,
that they are easily deliuered; yet still are they deliuered
with some paine, and I speake <hi>vt plurimum,</hi> for the most
part; generally in the whole kind, you shall obserue it a
punishment, if some do better escape then others, it is
Gods mercy to them, not one of a hundred but suffers
a great torment: more or lesse griefe alters not the truth
of Gods iudgements, when sorrow it selfe was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
As likewise in that other punishment of death,
some die without paine; as many in their ould age,
when their body is not so sensible, the least stopping of
their breath puts out their candle; whereas the yong
man sicke of the stone or the pluri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie, dies in great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for heere the paines and torments of death were
not the punishment, but death it selfe: so likewise in
child-bearing, more or lesse sorrow was not appointed,
the measure of sorrow was not prescribed, but sorrow
in generall here was the punishment; though Scripture
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3385:174"/>
and all ancient writers, do number it amongst the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
torments: sometimes indeed Gods iustice is allayed
with his mercy, and his wisdome permits the workes of
nature to passe vncontrolable; that so it might appeare,
that our sorrowes and infirmities proceed not from the
necessity of our nature, but from the incident malignity
of our sinne.</p>
            <p>Reasons (I know) there are alleaged in Physicke and
Philosophy, for this great paine in the birth and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of man: suppose it did proceed from natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">Naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the paine.</note>
yet would it then argue a great corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that should thus ordaine the beginning of man
with the great sorrow and griefe of his mother; as if
man were of a viperous kinde and brood, gnawing the
bowels that first hatched and conceaued him: but I do
assure you, that if you shall well weigh all those causes,
which seeme to produce the torments, you shall find
them very much defectiue, and such as cannot giue you
any satisfaction; but herein I must be sparing in regard
of my profession, and speaking in a common and vulgar
tongue; these are secrecies proper to woman, yet I may
boldly say it, that nature heerein seemes to outstrip her
selfe, and to torment the poore woman beyond all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
causes. For the trees in producing their fruit, seeme
then to be most beautifull, and do yeerely afford it; all
the beasts of the field do the like in the time of their
greatest growth, and best perfection: only the the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
notwithstanding her strength and ablenesse of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it will not excuse her; notwithstanding her good
complection, and sound constitution, it will not auaile
her, for she is only subiect to sorrow.</p>
            <p>Sorrow I say, for there is no sorrow comparable to
the sorrow of a woman in the time of her trauaile; from
their first quickning or conception you shall obserue
them, with pale lookes, heauy eyes, apt to faint vpon

euery occasion,<note place="margin">The continuall danger and paine in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> they are a burthen to themselues, their
stomackes faile them, and the night giues them no rest;
all the deuouring and rauenous wilde beasts are aptest
to seaze vpon them; the least knocke or blowe, the least
ill sauour or bad sight, the least sorrow conceiued in the
fansie, is able to indanger all; to hazard the life both of
the mother, and of the childe in her wombe. Not to
speake of the naturall greife arising from natural causes,
sometimes nature seemes with too much expedition to
hasten her woe, and then ye haue an vntimely brood, as
if Autum should fall out in the spring; sometimes the
wombe proues likewise the tombe, and the place of
conception, serues for his buriall; after seauen or nine
moneths expectation, behold hee comes, carrying
the forme of a slaine and a murthred man, and so he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
himselfe to his sad mother, to comfort her heauie
heart; being once thus deliuered, the danger is not past,
but she must be attended on with safe keeping and
good diet; and thousands daylie miscarry, when in
mans expectation they seeme to haue ouerpassed al dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of child-birth.</p>
            <p>But heere I will acquaint you with a strange point of

this world through the bowels of his dead mother, and

you may see the poore innocent childe mangled,

I will bring forth a subiect of laughter; I will set him v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

heare of fathers, which breed and beare their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
their wiues conceiue, and the husbands, who
shuld be the only comfort in the time of their weaknes,
first begin to complaine of the sorrow; <hi>Iuno Lucina fer

this great mountaine will bring forth: forsooth his teeth
ake, his bones are crasie, his eye-sight fayles him, hee is
troubled with rheumes, sometimes with the megrime;
Physicke will not helpe him, the times of the yeere will
not auaile him, but the poore man must expect his wiues
deliuerie. Hath God ordained this to shew the entire
league, and compassionat heart, that should passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and wife, and how they are both equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the issue? hath God appointed this to teach
man and wife, that the end of their loue should tend to
procreation? strange it were and wonderfull in nature,
were it not, that the husband is the sonne of a woman,
and therfore partakes of her weaknes and imperfection,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:3385:176"/>
               <hi>partus sequitur ventrem,</hi> and is in some sort lyable to

            <p>Heere you would expect of me, that I should assigne
and point out the causes of this fellow-feeling,<note place="margin">Why God so punisheth the husband.</note> and
strange affection between man &amp; wife; happily I could
guesse at some of them, but for certainty I know none:
rather I would flie to the diuine prouidence, beyond the
reach and compasse of nature; who for assuring man,
that he himselfe hath coupled them together, and that
both persons are but one flesh, therefore he hath giuen
them but one sense &amp; feeling of the same sorrow. That
as in their estate one and the same calamity doth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
befall them; so in their persons, one and the same mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
doth equally attach them, which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by secret, and hidden causes best known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
that, as many diseases are infectious, and spred
themselues by the company and society of others; so
here the same handie worke of God appeares, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment
of naturall Philosophy.</p>
            <p>Will you yet presse me further, to lay open the secret
causes,<note place="margin">Why there are secret qualities which cannot be knowne.</note> and hidden qualities of things: suppose the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie
and antipathie of creatures; my answere is, that
these arise from the great conformity, or contrariety of
temper in the inbred qualities, and naturall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
in so much that you shall obserue, that in such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
creatures, in whom there is an antipathie (suppose
them to be dead), yet in their very carkases, in the bones
and the flesh, as long as any spice of their temper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
the contrariety will appeare in the different and
contrary operations. Now this contrariety appeares,
not in the contrary qualities alone, but in the degrees of
these qualities, and in such degrees, as they are best fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and proportioned to each other: nature it should
seeme hath ballanced them, and squared them out fit
for the combat. Now the degrees of things are infinit,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:3385:176"/>
as time is diuided into infinite moments, quantitie into
infinit points; so qualitie into infinit degrees, and things
infinit do not fall within the reach of mans comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
neither are the formes of things subiect to our
knowledge, <hi>propter nimiam actiuitatem,</hi> for as things
are in nature compounded, so in the vnderstanding of
man they cannot be found simple: the influence of the
heauens is wholly vnknowne, <hi>propter spiritualitatem,</hi>
as being no way materiall or sensible; whereas all mans
knowledge must presuppose the foundation &amp; informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sense. And thus it is no maruaile, if many things
in nature be wholly vnknowne; when as the forme is
vnknowne, the influence vnknowne, the degrees of
qualities vnknowne: that so the first curiosity of mans
knowledge, might be iustly recompensed with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and ignorance.</p>
            <p>Philosophy (as likewise all other arts and sciences),
treates onely of things generall, and cannot descend to
things in particular,<note place="margin">The extent of Philosophy concerning her subiects.</note> with their par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ular degrees: as for
example, we diuide this sublunary world, into foure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
euery element into three regions; here we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
two qualities, one in extremitie, the other remisse;
these qualities we diuide into foure seuerall degrees:
the Physitian he descends somewhat lower, &amp; doubles
his fyles, deuides them into eight, as may bee best fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for his purpose, and here hee stands and cannot
march any further. For compound bodies, we consider
their kindes, their formes, their constitution, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
their differences, and common accidents: we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
nature (which appeares confused to mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
into a certaine method, appointing the
bounds of sciences, to bee the meares for our gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and direction in the course of our studies; and in
euery science we consider the principles, the subiect, and
the affections; as far as God hath inabled man, so far
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3385:177"/>
hath the industrie of man transported his knowledge;
yet we cannot descend to particulars, God hath denied
this perfection, as it appeares; for the obiects of the
sense are singulars, the obiects of the vnderstanding are
vniuersals: as the sense cannot exceed his own bounds,
and eleuate it selfe to the height of the vnderstanding;
so neither can the vnderstanding stoope downe to the
sense: God hath giuen vs an inspection of nature, but
no absolute and perfect knowledge of nature, hauing
reserued that for himselfe.</p>
            <p>Hee that shall desire to bee better informed in these
hidden and secret qualities, I would referre him to
those learned authors, from whom (I suppose) he should
receiue good contentment, and satisfaction: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Aristotle, Albertus Magnus, Zimara, Fracastorius</hi>
and others. Now for this present instance,<note place="margin">Why the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band partakes in the wifes passions.</note> why the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
should be thus affected in his wiues conception; it
is not vnknowne to al skilfull Musitians, the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
which is betweene the eights; not onely for the
sweete harmonie of musicke, but if the Instrument shall
be thus set, and disposed for the purpose, the one string
being easily touched, the other will likewise moue for

and their affections concurring together, there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a greater sympathie, and agreement in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
temper and constitution, and therefore are fitter
disposed to worke vpon each others body; as kindred
descending from one stocke, are apter to infect and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
each other in a pestilent disease. Besides their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
man and wife liuing together, feeding on the

as at all times, so sometimes, when their bodies are
more apt to be tainted; no marueile if some husbands,
(and yet but a few, for God gaue man his wife for his

Learning it is, which opens mans eies to all humane
knowledge; though it cannot, or will not vouchsafe to
looke vpon the basest things of this life, yet it containes
the grounds, the roots, the causes of euery the meanest
profession, and is able to direct euery man in his owne
Trade, course, and vocation: and I may boldly speake
it (<hi>absit inuidia verbo</hi>) all other professions whatsoeuer,

his strength shall be like a broken staffe; he shall goe

like a criple, shame and reproch shall attend him. Fully
to describe this disease, I will leaue it to the skilfull
Physitian; let it suffice for me to obserue, that although
some other creatures seeme to be as much inclining to
their lust, as is man; yet none are tainted with such a
noysome disease, saue only man: as likewise in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, among the Heathen and Pagans, there is no
mention of any such disease, much lesse of the cure; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amongst vs Christians, who professe a more strict, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere

That seeing God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs a greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his truth, of the foulnesse of sinne, together
with a larger measure of his grace; therefore God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
the vncleannes &amp; incontinencie of these times,
with a greater iudgement, and vengeance: and as the
woman partakes in the mans punishment, both of them
sweating in their labours, both of them made subiect to
death; so man (as farre foorth as it will stand with the
condition of his sexe) partakes in her sorrow.</p>
            <p>These things being duly considered, (if I were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy)
I would giue this aduice to Ladies, and Gentle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

themselues of the occasion; that their danger and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is the iust punishment of sinne, for the first offence
of the woman: and that they would giue God most
humble and heartie thankes, for that greatest blessing
of all other temporall blessings, the fruitfulnes of the
wombe; whereby it pleaseth God, to inlarge his owne
kingdome, to accomplish the whole number of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
whereby they might continue their names, and
their memories, and finde some comfort in their olde
age; leaue their posteritie behinde them, to giue them
a Christian buriall, and to performe all other duties of
children to parents. This I could heartily wish, but see

in such state, with such pompe, so excessiuely, cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and chargeable; that I feare they haue little thought
either of thankfulnes to God, or of the punishment of
sinne.</p>
            <p>Now giue me leaue to relate some few accidencies,
which doe accompanie our conception, whereof I may
speake without offence: Consider (I pray') how du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ng
the time of their conception,<note place="margin">Womens longing.</note> while our parents are yet
great, what a longing and hungrie appetite possesseth
them of things hard to be gotten, most commonly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
and vnseasonable fruites, sometimes of things
vncleane and impure. Is not this an vndoubted token
and testimonie of that insolent, and vnbridled appetite
of the woman, which first contrarie to Gods owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
and ordinance, seazed vpon the forbidden fruite?
But obserue (I beseech you) how this appetite and
longing, consisting onely in the fansie and imagination
of the mother,<note place="margin">An impression vpon the child in the wombe.</note> yet sometimes, to the great wonder, and
astonishment of reason, workes vpon the childe in the
wombe, and makes an impression answerable to the
thing conceiued in the fansie: the fansie can neither
giue sexe, nor beautie, nor strength to the members, yet
doth it imprint a character answerable to the strong
apprehension. See heere a liuely patterne of the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of sinne; there are hereditarie diseases of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
there are wants and defects proper to the minde,
there are infirmities and sins of both: sin is intailed to
our nature, though it proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the free-will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of man, yet is it grounded in nature, and therfore al
the naturall actions of man, are branded with sinne.</p>
            <p>In the time of their deliuerie, I haue heard it credibly
reported, and so I may affirme it vpon tradition, that

nothing so much asswageth their paine, and giues them
that ease,<note place="margin">The skinne of a Serpent.</note> as the cast-away skinne of a Serpent, being
fitly applied for that purpose: I will not dispute of the
naturall reason, which assuredly consists in the strange
antipathie betweene both; only I do here blesse God,
that hath so ordained nature, as it might best serue for a
supernaturall end; when all naturall meanes shall faile,
and cannot preuent a naturall griefe, yet the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
and thought of the Serpent, which was the first
occasion of this griefe, should mitigate this paine. Here
is a kinde of magicall inchauntment, to heale wounds
by the application of that sword which first gaue the
blow; like the Israelites in the wildernesse wounded by
the Serpent, they are likewise cured by the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
It serues also as a memoriall of Gods great boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and goodnesse, that if God in this miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by changing the skinne, renewes the age of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
then certainly man in his issue, hath some kinde of
eternitie, for the young childe seemes to renew the age
of his parents. And the poore mother calling to minde
Gods mercie to the Serpent, who was the first seducer
and greatest offender, may well hope for a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that mercie; and in her greatest torments and
griefe, acknowledging the iust punishment of sin, may
expect a better state and condition, when God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
al things, change their old habits, and restore them
to their first perfection. Thus are the present miseries of
this life, seasoned with the assured hope, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a better world to succeed.</p>
            <p>I cannot thus leaue the punishment in the mother,
but I must likewise trace it in the infant. Comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world,<note place="margin">Obseruations in the birth of man.</note> wee come with our heads forwards, as it
were stumbling into life, which vndoubtedly argues
our fall, for our birth is <hi>praecipitium,</hi> a break-necke, as if

stand with the integritie of our first nature, as if
wee were borne vnder that law &amp; condition, that needs
we must dye, and therefore wee came into the world
that indeede we might goe out of the world. Many are
borne with caules on their faces, which betokens their
modestie and shame, as if <hi>Adam</hi> should couer his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse

swadling-cloutes, for wee are captiues and prisoners,
borne vnder the slauerie and bondage of Egypt, and for

            <p>At length wee begin to open our eyes, and to looke

being strangers arriued in a new-found world; we are
apt to place our loue on euery obiect,<note place="margin">Obseruations in the infancie of man.</note> and cannot direct
our selues aright; there is nothing which seemes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

she would buy a booke for her sects; in liew of a mate,
she must illuminate; if once she proues gossip, then she

weare their hoods and their habits: they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to follow their seuerall callings and professions,

ordained them; not content with our ordinary Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,

were ordained to bee an eye, and that women should
proue teachers in the Church, they begin to enquire of
predestination, reprobation, prelection, free-will, the
state of innocency, the time of the generall iudgement,
&amp;c. Here are excellent wits indeed, that cannot admit
any bounds of their knowledge; if there were a tree of
knowledge in the middest of Paradise, for the triall of
their obedience, you should easily discouer in them the

nature still continues in those little impes, which vnder
colour of bouldnes and courage, proues indeed to bee
rashe and desperat: suppose them to be weake and faint,
not able to vndertake such great exployts; see then (of

sinke, the chanell, the chymnie, wallowing in the mire,
all daubde on with durt; that were it not to signifie the
vncleannesse of mans conception and birth, I should
much maruaile at natures intent herein.</p>
            <p>See, see these little children, how apt they are to

how these children do naturally symbolize with their

of the first sinne; <hi>morte morieris,</hi> thou shalt die the

if you consider the course and order of nature, for
nature passeth by degrees, <hi>natura non facit saltum,</hi> she

other accidents which may befall man (<hi>statutum est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus

I shall die; thus there being a necessity of death,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3385:183"/>
together with a great vncertaintie of the time) I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to the strictnesse and rigour of lawe,<note place="margin">The author iustifieth his method by lawe.</note> that if a debt
must be discharged and no due time be appointed, then
we must prepare for a present payment; so that it cannot
seeme much against method, though I speake of death,
immediatlie vpon our first receiuing of breath.</p>
            <p>If all other creatures were subiect to death, yet (me
thinks) obseruing the course and prouidence of nature,<note place="margin">Mans death is compared with the death of dumbe beasts.</note>
man should be exempted from death: consider the high
prerogatiue of man; in all restringent and penall lawes,
the Prince is excluded, to shew his high estate aboue
the ranke and condition of subiects: now man is the
king of the creatures, let other creatures bee lyable to

               </gap>laughter, for they were ordained and directed to man;
let other creatures die of themselues, for in them there
is nothing but nature, nature which hath a certaine
course and period, a time of rising and a time of setting:
but the first fountaine of life in man, is the inuisible and
immortall soule free from corruption, free from all
change and alteration, as in her owne substance, so in
her actions; she cannot bee inforced or determinated,
but is beyond the Precincts of nature, and therefore no
way tyed to follow the ordinary course of nature. Yet
some beasts do far exceed man in life and continuance
of being, which is the foundation and ground worke of
nature, to support all other blessings; and therfore seems
to be the highest prerogatiue of nature, wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
man is defectiue: other creatures (indeed)
seeme to attaine their perfection in their ends, or their
death; the hearbes serue for the food of beasts, and in
their bodies and carkases they haue a more excellent
being, then they had in their greene blades; the flesh
of beasts becomes the nourishment of man, and being
made part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mans own flesh, heere is the height of all
their preferment; now in man, you shall obserue it far
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3385:184"/>
otherwise, who (of the mirror and miracle of nature) by
his own death, is suffered to putrifie and to be deuoured
of the basest wormes; as if his body were ordained to
be the compost of the earth, and did only serue to make
the Church-yard fat with the oyle of his flesh, and to
paue the high wayes with the sculs and bones of dead
men.</p>
            <p>Consider this inferior world, consisting of the same
different and contrary elements, yet still continuing in
the same state; assuredly it is no greater difficulty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
man from death,<note place="margin">Mans death in respect of the elements.</note> then to preserue the whole
world from corruption: for the same causes appeare in
both, the elements and the elementarie qualities, and
once in euery mans age they are equally tempered, as it
were the Equinoctial of his age. Then why should there
not be a state of consistencie in man, as well as in the
whole world? or at least, why should not the periods
and times of his age, the spring of his infancie, the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of his youth, the haruest of his riper yeares, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his old age, goe and returne according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution
of times, seasons, and changes of the yeere;
which seeme to bee therefore onely allotted, for the
continuance and preseruation of mankind?</p>
            <p>Not to insist alone in this sublunarie world; strange
it is, that the heauens themselues which were onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for mans vse,<note place="margin">Mans death in respect of the heauens and the Angels.</note> should so long continue without
change or alteration, and man himselfe in the whole
course of his life, should not be able to see a reuolution:
that the superiour causes preseruing mans life, should
moue by a most certaine and vnchangeable rule, as the
diuine prouidence hath appointed them; and yet mans
life to which all is ordained, should be most subiect and
lyable to the greatest hazard, chance, and vnc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtainty.
But most strange it is, that the heauens bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g Gods

vp motion, yet with their malignant and dis-astrous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
should cause the ouerthrow of man, yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of whole nations and kingdomes: consider the
end of mans creation, which was the praise and glory
of his maker, which end is eternall, as God himselfe is
eternall; then why should not those things, which are
ordained only to this end, be of like eternitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance?
God is not like man, that he should be altered
and changed, that he should repent himselfe of his own
workes, and restore againe that vnto nothing, which he
himselfe hath once made according to his owne image:
neither is God the God of the dead but of the liuing,
being life in himselfe; shall the dust rise vp and praise
him, shall his iustice appeare in the graue? or rather
shall the prayers, the voyces and harmony of men, ioynd
with the quire and sweet melody of Angels, sing pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
vnto him and magnifie his holy name, which indeed
was the scope and end of our creation? thus not onely
Christian religion, but euen reason it selfe, and mans
owne knowledge seeme to preach this lesson, that the
end of nature (man) to whom all nature is ordained and
directed, should not end in nature; and therefore death
it selfe especially to man, is a punishment of nature, and
in it selfe is most vnnaturall to man.</p>
            <p>Especially when I consider, how the better part of
man (the soule) is immortal and vnchangeable;<note place="margin">The soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues a kinde of perfection from the body.</note> as in her
selfe and in her owne substance, so in her qualities and
actions: now the life of man, being only the worke of
his soule, and the sweet influence of his quickning spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
into the dull flesh; I do much maruaile, how this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
spirit should bee the cause of our mortality?
for it cannot bee denied, but that the soule receiues
some kinde of perfection from the flesh; for without
the ministery of the body, were not our members the
soules vessels and instruments, she could neuer exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3385:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those excellent powers of sense and vegetation; &amp;
therefore in her separation, though her state may seeme
to be more perfect then it was, during the time of her
mariage, or couerture with our flesh, our corrupted
flesh, wherein iars and contentions did daily arise to
the great disquieting of both; yet certainly the soule
hauing these faculties, desires the free vse and exercise
of them. Which desire, that it might not be frustrat and
vaine, doth in some sort (by a naturall sequell) inforce a
last resurrection; when the soule shall be re-united to a
spirituall body better befitting it selfe: and in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim
concludes, that either man is vnnaturally compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or that the separation of his parts, must be wholly
vnnaturall, which I rather suppose; seeing it makes
much for mans dignitie and natures perfection, the
soule no way desiring a separation; for as the state
now stands, there is a kinde of correspondencie, if the
flesh be corrupted, the soule is likewise tainted with
sinne; here is a proportion, though an euill proportion
between both.</p>

God would neuer imploy in such an excellent worke,

him. Now the soule hauing thus framed the body, if she
dislikes any thing, she must blame none but her selfe; if
all things be perfect and sound in the first fabricke and
architecture of man, then in the succeeding actions of
life, the soule is the first fountaine, and the onely acti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the aspersion vpon my soule; that notwithstanding her

is onely subiect to passion, as it please the soule to
worke, so it must suffer: as the soule receiues the praise

so let her take vnto her selfe, the shame and reproch in

a Physitian;<note place="margin">How easily the soule may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue life by a naturall course.</note> you will say that there is a great difficulty
in the receiptes, and therfore the life of man would
hardly suffice to learne the remedy and cure: but I pray'
marke the art and industrie of man, I am verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and I speake it by experience, that mans body, by
the helpe of feare-clothes, powders, balmes, and oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may bee preserued for the space of two hundred

wherein now it is, at least to the outward shew and
appearance; then why should not the like medicines
inwardly taken, preserue life for such a terme of yeeres?
why should not physicke growe to that ripenesse and
perfection, that knowing the nature of diseases, the
course &amp; inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of humors, by application of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as it were vsing the tree of life in Paradise, it might
prolong mans age, if not for euer giue him eternitie?
But see, see corruption consists in the root, in nature her
selfe! for physicke cannot worke, but must first presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the strength and furtherance of nature: left thou
shouldest blame the Physitian, or thinke the meanes
which God hath appointed for thy health, to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vnprofitable; behold thine owne nature is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3385:186"/>
and defectiue to her selfe.</p>
            <p>If nature might faile in her particular ends, yet (me
thinks) the whole scope and generall intent of nature
should not bee frustrate and made voide. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so common and triuiall in Schooles (wherein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is best discouered,<note place="margin">How the death of man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole scope of nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> as is this knowne and palpable
truth) <hi>Corruptio vnius est generatio alterius,</hi> the death
of one is the birth of another, for nature consists in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
and change; and it would much disparage
nature, if there were such a death, as did wholly make
for her losse, and no way redound to her encrease. In
all other creatures you shal obserue this truth: Suppose
a beast were slaine, his body should be dissolued into
the bodies of the elements, his forme into the formes of
the elements, as both of them were first composed
of the elements, nothing should bee lost through the
negligence of nature, but all should be gleaned vp, and
very safely reserued for a new succeeding generation.
Now in the death of man, the body is the sole bootie of
nature, she cannot seaze vpon the soule, she cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
such an inestimable treasure, the soule is escaped:
as long as life continued in man, the soule was vnder
the iurisdiction and power of nature; but the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once dissolued, nature hath lost her owne right, and
cannot intend any new generation by vertue of that
soule. A foule error of nature, that hauing the soule
once committed to her custodie and charge, she should
open the gates, or breake downe the prison walles to
lose such a iewell, which was neuer gotten by her owne
purchase, nor cannot bee recalled againe with all her
might and power: so then in the death of man, and so
man alone, the corruption, and nothing but the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of nature sufficiently appeares.</p>
            <p>I would not willingly speak of a punishment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the mercie and goodnesse of God should not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3385:187"/>
appeare with his iustice: but when I haue once
spoken of death,<note place="margin">How death serues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct vs.</note> me thinkes I am then come to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
and conclusion of all, beyond which I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any blessing, I meane any naturall blessing, for
death is the end and period of nature; yet giue me leaue
to make these foure good vses of death: 1. To reproue
sinnes: 2. To strengthen and fortifie the bulwarkes of
Religion. 3. As to giue comfort, courage, and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the true Christian man; 4. so to discomfort, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and put to flight the infidell and heathen.</p>
            <p>First, death seemes to instruct man, to preach vnto
him the reformation of his life, and thereby doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
his naturall and inbred corruption: the couetous
man,<note place="margin">Death is a very powerfull meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call a sinner.</note> whose heart could neuer be touched, or moued to
take pitie or compassion by the cries and prayers of a
poore wretch, yet at length will howle and lament,
when hee considers that hee shall dye in the middest of
his treasure, and all his substance shall leaue him: the
oppressing tyrant, stained with the blood of poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
shall knocke his owne breast, teare his owne
haire, readie to shed his owne blood, when hee sees the
pale and liuelesse carkase of his persecuted foe, to shew
him his owne state, and condition, and being dead, to
threaten his death: but it were to be wished (if it might
be spoken without offence) that one might arise from
the dead, who might relate vnto vs the state of the
dead, and of the vanities of this life, which passe like a
shadow. And to this end, I haue heard it as a tradition
of the Church, that Christ hauing told the parable of
<hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the Iewes little regarding it (to
stirre vp faith in them, as likewise in some sort to satisfie
the request of <hi>Diues,</hi> that one from the dead might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
his brethren), God raised vp <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the brother
of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who might witnesse and testifie as
much as Christ had reported: I will not stand vpon the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3385:187"/>
truth of this traditon; though certaine it is, that both
these accidents fell out much about the same time. The
very bones of the dead, being serued vp at a banket, wil
bee a fit sauce to season our immoderate mirth: the
tombes of the dead are for the instruction of the liuing,
<hi>monumenta monent mentem,</hi> we tread vpon the flesh of
our forefathers, which is now become the dust of the
Temple. Death is an excellent meanes to stirre vp pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and deuotion: the mariners in guiding their ships,
must sit in the end, to hold and gouerne the stearne; and
the end of euerything, is the first in intension, though
the last in execution. Hence it is, that the religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in al ages, were <hi>frequentes in cemiterijs,</hi> alwaies bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
imploied about the tombes of the dead: their cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of recreation were places of burials for their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
if they found themselues giuen to immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ioy, their delight was abated with the sight &amp; smell
of dead bones. Thus liuing they were dead, their mind
was among the dead, they conuersed with the dead:
and thus the meditation of death, did prescribe vnto
them (answerable to a vale of miserie, befitting a sinfull
state) a course of life in mortification and sorrow.</p>
            <p>O death, which doest astonish man with thy sight,

death is the passage to that other world: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

with his promises; in vaine should we teach the
law of nature, the instinct of nature, the moral precepts,
the mysteries of grace, the maiestie of God; in vaine
should wee preach humilitie, to sustaine iniuries with
patience, to forgiue all offences, to make restitution for
wrongs; in vaine should wee perswade men, to spend
whole nights in watchings, fastings, and prayers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in sackcloth and ashes: alas, alas, these are all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
lessons to the worldlings, let vs therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the force of Church discipline, Ecclesiasticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
Excommunications, &amp;c. let vs implore <hi>brachium
seculare,</hi> the helpe of the temporall power to restraine
sinne. Remember thine owne death, remember thine
owne death; if thou wilt not forsake the world, the
world shall at length forsake thee; here is our last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
to serue at a dead lift, for the conuersion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
here is no faith of things inuisible, here are no strict
rules of mortification, here are no precepts, which seeme
to oppose the practise of mans naturall inclination: but
consider the state of thine owne body, and the degrees
of thine age, how thou doest daily decline, and learne
to dye by the daily precedent, experience, and example
of others: <hi>Filimi memorare nouissima &amp; in aeternum non
peribis;</hi> My sonne, remember thy last end, and thou
shalt neuer perish euerlastingly.</p>
            <p>As it serues for a meanes of our conuersion, so is it no
lesse cause of great ioy and comfort to a well resolued
Christian;<note place="margin">The Christian man desires death as the meane of his happinesse.</note> 
               <hi>Cupio dissolui, &amp; esse cum Christo:</hi> Life is the

can be erected: now death serues as a bridge or a
passage to a better life; it is a holie relique, which first
seazed vpon Christs bodie, and at length shall befall vs;
we must dye with him, that wee may raigne with him;
where the head hath already entred, the whole bodie
must follow. But here is our comfort, hee that stood in
the forefront, hath now abated the strength of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie;
he that sanctified all other creatures, the earth
with his blood, the ayre purified with his breath, the
water washt with his washing, the fire purged with his
spirit in fierie tongues, he hath likewise sanctified death
it selfe by his owne death. Death is now made a safe
harbour vnto vs, which before was the terrour of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for as it was truly prophecied of Christ, so is it
verified in the members of Christ, <hi>He shall not leaue his
soule in hell, nor suffer his holy one to see corruption.</hi> Thus
is death now become the sole sacrifice of a Christian
man,<note place="margin">Death is the sacrifice of our selues.</note> a free oblation at Gods altar, wherein whole man
is bequeathed vnto God; wee commit our soules to his
safe custodie and keeping, wee leaue our bodies to be
the dust of his Temple: all our goods we dispose as he
shall direct vs, some by the course of nature, which hee
himselfe hath appointed; some to pious and religious
vses, which hee himselfe hath commanded; some to
almes-deedes and charitable beneuolence, according
to that natural compassionate instinct, which God hath
imprinted in our hearts, and as the present necessitie of
these times seemes to require: and what is so left, wee
leaue it not behind vs, but it followes vs, and ouertakes
vs at heauen gates. And thus is man become a whole
burnt offering vnto God, and that by the meanes of his
death: and therefore we may now securely triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
death, <hi>O death where is thy sting! O hell where is thy
victorie! the sting of death is sinne, the strength of sinne is
the law: but thankes be vnto God who hath giuen vs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie,

            <p>Death is the sole comfort in all my worldly miseries,
for it seemes to be the vpshot and period of my woe:
which if I shal once attaine (as needs I must attaine),
then shall I be like the sea faring man, who being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

of death is his armour of proofe, for conquer
hee will, and conquer he must, though with his owne
passion; fearefull and terrible hee is to his enemies, for
hee that regards not his owne life, is Lord of another

his happinesse here in the course of this life, is indeed a
base coward, fearefull, vnfaithfull, performing his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
onely to the outward shew, carrying a heart full of

doe as farre exceede the number and weight of my
sinnes, as the goodnesse and power of God exceeds my
weaknesse and frailtie: the mercie of God is infinite,
able to couer the whole multitude of my sinnes; the
hate of God vnto sinne is infinite, and therefore he will
leaue nothing vnattempted, which may serue to cut
downe the body of sinne: the desire which God hath
of my saluation, farre exceeds mine owne desire of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;
seeing his glorie and the manifestation of his
mercie, (which was the scope and end of my creation)
is a farre greater good, then my particular soules health.
The greater my sins are, the greater occasion may God
take to manifest his mercie, for God himselfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
my saluation, not to consist in not sinning, or
to be free and innocent from all sinnes; but in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for sinne, and in the satisfaction of his deare
Sonne: and therefore to assure mee of this mercie, it is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3385:191"/>
one of the Articles of my Creed (which not to beleeue
were not to be saued), that I should bouldlie and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
beleeue <hi>the remission and forgiuenesse of sins.</hi> Yet
conceiue me aright, for some there are who laying
hould to soone on Gods mercy, as it were snatching at
his mercy, do indeed loose the fruits of his mercy; when
(laying the whole burthen of their sins vpon Christ, as
it were making long and deepe furrowes in his backe)
themselues continuing in their owne sinnes, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
and hardnesse of their owne hearts, do indeed
dreame of saluation.</p>
            <p>My sinnes are innumerable, yet before I was borne,
before they could be committed, God did foresee them;
notwithstanding his foresight,<note place="margin">Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> when hee might haue
preuented my sinnes, and left me to my first nothing,
yet in his gratious goodnes and mercie, hee made and
created me: he hath giuen me my life, my strength, my
health, my senses, my wit, and al my temporall blessings,
together with the knowledge of himselfe, the plentifull
and powerful meanes of my saluation; notwithstanding
my sinnes, be they neuer so great, yet these are the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of his fauour, the pledges of his loue, the assurances
of his promises, and the earnest of my future happines.
Why should I then despaire of Gods mercy? though I
haue lost that sanctitie and holinesse, wherewith I
might be saued, yet God hath not lost that vertue and

corruption of man, to the conquest of nature; me thinks
I haue subdued the little world, and brought man as a
captiue or sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue, through much misery and sorrow, at
length to the place of his execution; and hauing now
possest my selfe of the fairest fortresse, or tower in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(man that is a little world), I cannot here content
my selfe, but I begin to enquire, whether there are as
yet more worlds to be conquered? and behold in the
second place, I will fall vpon the great world, and I
will attempt with Archimedes, to shake her foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to threaten her ruine, in this generall corruption
and dissolution of man: for this punishment (<hi>morte mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieris</hi>)
though it principally concernes man, yet the
whole world cannot be exempted from it, being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and ordained onely for mans vse, containing in it
selfe the very same seedes, and causes of death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
and as it is most fit and agreeable to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition, that being corruptible in our selues, we
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3385:192"/>
should likewise dwell in houses of corruption.</p>
            <p>For proofe and demonstration wherof, I must ascend
from the indiuiduals and singulars, to the species and
kindes of the creatures; and among all other kindes,<note place="margin">The kinds and species of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</note>
assuredly man is the most noble, and therfore best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
to be the subiect of our knowledge: wee should
be best acquainted with our selues, which makes for the
certainty of our knowledge; and speaking of things
which so neerely concernes our selues, we should much
desire to bee better informed, in our owne state and
condition: now if the whole kinde and species of man
seemes daily to decline and decay, which shall appeare
by the comparison of times past with times present; of
our selues, with our ancestors; then assuredly the whole
world cannot be excused from corruption; but as it dies
daily in the singulars, so at length it shall faile in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersals,
and in the kindes of the creatures.</p>
            <p>This truth seemes to relie vpon these three foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
1. Man (as all other creatures) being immediatlie
created by God,<note place="margin">Three reasons why all the creatures doe decline.</note> as he comes nearer and nearer the first
mould, so is he more and more perfect, and according
to the degrees of his distance, so he incurres the more
imperfection and weakenesse; as the streames of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the further they runne through vncleane passages,
the more they contract the corruption. 2. It would
implie a contradiction in nature, if the parts and the
whole were not of like condition; but how wonderfull
is the difference, if you will suppose a corruption of the
singulars, and an eternitie of the kinde? for whereas the
recompence shuld be made by succession or equiualen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
we must consider, that succession may well prolong
the corruption, adding more degrees, proceeding more
leasurely, but cannot wholie exclude the corruption.
3. The generall intent and scope of nature wholie
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ends to corruption; for I would gladly aske, why should
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:3385:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not nature, either renew mans age, or preserue him in
a state of consistencie? the answere is, because the iuyce
and sap which we receiue from our food, or our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
is not so agreeable to the state of our bodies,
as is that humor, <hi>&amp; calor radicalis,</hi> which wee receiue
from our first birth; heere I will reply, how fals it out,
that our bodies should impart <hi>semen ad procreandum,</hi>
wherin that radicall humor is resident? and (both seede
and humor arising from our food and our nourishment)
yet nature should seeme in the preseruation of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
to refuse the best, making it an excrement of the
third concoction, and taking for her owne foode and
sustenance, the worst part of the substance. See then, the
generall intent and scope of nature tending to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
must likewise argue that nature her selfe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
shall at length be tainted with the same corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>First for the apparell of the Ancients, if you please to
obserue the fashion of their garments, you shall finde
them to be such,<note place="margin">The clothing and apparell of the Ancients compared with ours.</note> as (no way inforcing nature, nor made
onely for comlinesse) they might best serue for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the agilitie of their bodies: which well argues
a greater actiuity in them then in vs, though I suppose
they would not suffer any, to practise for danger, much
lesse to get a dishonest liuing, by vaulting, tumbling, or
any such apish toyes; yet generally they were more
actiue, and had lesse vse of horses, then we haue in these
dayes. For the substance of their garments, our clothing
is much more gentle, and soft then theirs, for they had
not that vse of linnen which we haue; which well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
the weaknes and tendernes of our flesh, in respect
of theirs; their garments being courser, were likewise
much weightier and heauier then ours, which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kens
the strong foundation of their bodies, for in these dayes
wee could hardly indure their burthen or weight; it
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3385:193"/>
should seeme, they did accustome themselues to much
hardnesse, for amongst the common sort of men, stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
and shooes were not then grown into fashion: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for the trunke or bulke of their bodies, they were
more warmely clothed then wee are, as committing
themselues more to the weather; and as the heate of a
mans owne body, being kept in with warme clothes, is
much more naturall, more healthfull and cordiall to
man, then is the burning, scorching and consuming
heate of the fire; therefore the Ancients did more desire
warme clothes and apparell, then the vse of fire; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them you shall finde little preparation for fire,
their houses built with very fewe chymnies, they were
very sparing and thriftie in their woods, their chambers
very close and warme, desiring rather to keepe out the
cold winde, then to let in the fresh ayre; whereas our
wantonnes appeares in large windowes &amp; high roofes,
as if we made no difference of being without doores,
and being within doores; or that we did neuer purpose
to vse our limbes, to goe and take the fresh ayre, but
that the fresh ayre should be brought vnto vs; their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or bedding was very hard, few of them knew what
feather-beds meant, and assuredly their bodies would
better indure it then ours;<note place="margin">The Ancients more giuen to their sports then now we are.</note> as likewise for their lodging
in campes, or professing a strict and austere life, as many
religious men did; and as they were more apt for their
labours, so were they more giuen to their pastimes, their
sports and their games then we are; which I suppose
did neither argue lightnesse in them, nor any counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
grauitie in vs, but the state of their bodies were
such as did require them, and the weaknenesse of our
bodies is such, as we dare not attempt them, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the disposition of the body the minde is affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>From the apparell let vs come to the foode, now it
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3385:194"/>
should seeme is the ould age of the world, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the pampering of our selues; for take our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
foode, it was neuer heretofore so delicat, so dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
so tender,<note place="margin">Our food com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the food of the Ancients.</note> as it is at this day, the vsuall, ould, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
food not agreeing with our weak stomackes:
we must haue warme and delicious brothes to comfort
our decayed nature, exquisite sauces to prouoke our
appetite, such purboyling, such helpes and remedies of
art to prepare our meates for digestion; which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
do wel argue, that the world is either dangerously
sicke, or come to her ould age, that she should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to vse, or indeed can admit such a physicall diet.
For during the strength of nature, while things were in
their perfection, a stronger foode did better be fit them,
&amp; did more agree with their bodies; cookerie was then
wholy vnknowne, they could be content with the bare
vse of the creatures, without any further delicacy or
preparation; water did then serue for their drinke, and
they did feede much vpon hearbes, milch-meates and
course bread; as the world grew elder, so they did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more &amp; more decline in the strength of their nature;
fasting and eating of fish in succeeding ages, did not so
well agree with the state of their bodies, and therefore
you shall finde euen in Church-discipline, a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuencie,
toleration, and dispensation vpon any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
cause; and we, that are now falne in this last pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of times, we are now growne to that faintnesse, that
hot waters, and strong drinkes, were neuer so much v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
hot spices were neuer brought ouer in such plentie,
as may well appeare in the custome-house: yea such is
the continuall weaknesse of our stomackes,<note place="margin">The vse of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco in these dayes.</note> that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
and helpe thereof, this last age hath found out an
Indian drug (the vse of Tobacco) which at all times, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all occasions, to all complexions, the full stomacke, the

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:3385:194"/>
must serue to cure the rawnesse of the stomack; to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
and exhale the ill humors, to help the vndigested
foode; but you will say, that the vse, or at least the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat
vse of this hearbe, proceeds from the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of these times, which truely I do easily confesse;
yet assuredly the temper and constitution of our bodies,
would neuer admit such a wantonnes, were it not, that
it proceeds from the weaknesse of our nature: for if wee
should presume as far vpon hearbes in the extremity of
coldnesse, suppose the iuyce of Oranges or Limons
(which by the art and cunning of man, might bee made
euery way as delicious and delicate), certainely wee
should feele the smart of our owne follie.</p>
            <p>The clothing and foode doe much betoken the
soundnesse and constitution of our bodies, yet I cannot
content my selfe with them, but I will descend to
speake more immediately of our bodies:<note place="margin">Heretofore the constitution of mens bodies was better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now it is.</note> it should seeme
that death is not onely competent to euery person in
particular, but euen the whole world, and all the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kindes of creatures tend to confusion; there is a
great decay in euery species, men come not to that
strength, nor to that growth, nor to that ripenesse of
wit, nor to that fulnesse of yeeres which they did in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times; the world hath his period and his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
course of yeeres: now is the olde age or decay of
this world. The growth and strength of men seeme to
proceede from the same causes, and to relie vpon the
same foundation (the bones), which according to their
massinesse, their weight, or their length giue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and strength to the whole bodie; these bones
are yet extant, and are daylie taken vp in sepulchers,
whereof I haue often been an eye-witnesse, and hauing
duely considered them according to measure and
weight, I finde by most vndoubted experience, that
they did far exceede ours; their weapons will likewise
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:3385:195"/>
testifie as much, for these are yet extant, and are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
as relikes and trophies of their valour, which the
strength of man in these dayes cannot mannage or rule;
many things there are likewise, wherein I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which were (in former times) trialls for their
strength, but now seeme very impossible to our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Consider all their actions which they did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
for therein they did as farre exceede vs, as their
strength did exceede ours; obserue their attempts in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
stately Cathedrall Churches for the exercise of
Religion, in building huge Castles for defence of their
people, in contriuing high waies, caus-waies, bridges, &amp;
such like, which well betoken noble and braue spirits:
whereas our wits in these daies make their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in things of lesse moment, some prettie toyes
and trifles, some new fashion and attire; our buildings
are paper-buildings, made onely to serue the present
vse and occasion. I am ashamed of our selues, we doate,
we doate; though herein I doe acknowledge a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
prouidence of God, while the world had some
time of continuance,<note place="margin">Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in mans actions.</note> when the yeeres were not fully
expired, then God gaue man a minde and disposition to
intend the good of posteritie: but now in these latter
daies, when the world is almost come to an vpshot,
when the period of time is now approching; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile
if God leaue man to himselfe, that out of his own
immoderate loue of himselfe, neglecting the common
good, and the good of succession, he should onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
in his buildings, in the waste of his woods, and in
all other his actions, his owne priuate and present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.</p>
            <p>Very credible it is, that their grear labours and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
were more performed by their own only strength,<note place="margin">A great change doth appeare in mans owne disposition.</note>
for they had lesse vse of instruments, and craines in their
buildings, notwithstanding their huge foundations,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:3385:195"/>
then we haue at this day. But I will not insist in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
actions; rather this decay of nature, shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the general disposition and inclination of men,
together with the diseases whereunto they are subiect:
that a change should appeare in the very nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
of man, after so great a change in his temper and
constitution, I am the rather perswaded to beleeue;
when I consider how many titles, paragraphes, what
large discourses, and iudgements haue past in the Ciuill
lawes, concerning the adoption of sonnes; whereof at
this day we finde little, or no vse, being lawes which sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or neuer come to the practise. Certainly as the
children of Israel were most carefull, to preserue their
tribes whole and entire, vntill the comming of their
Messias; and as the Patriarkes were most carefull, as of
their succession and seede, so of their dead bones; for
<hi>Iacob</hi> gaue charge, that his dead body should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of Egypt (as it were going to Ierusalem in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage),
there to be laid &amp; rest, neere the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:
but since the comming of Christ, you shall finde
that their tribes are confounded, and in themselues you
shall finde no such inclination. So was it in the ancient
Romanes, as long as this world had any time to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
how carefull were they of succession,<note place="margin">The adoption of sonnes.</note> if not from
their owne loynes, yet by their owne adoption, for the
continuance of their names and memories? but now
the world is almost come to an vpshot, see the strange
change and alteration, a change in our nature! for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will neuer faile in her ends and purposes: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to desire a continuance of memorie, when the
world it selfe shall haue no time of continuance, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand with the wisedome and prouidence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which hath ingrafted in vs our naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To shew the change of mens mindes, let vs change
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:3385:196"/>
our profession, <hi>à togis ad arma,</hi> from the penne to the

resolution of the Romanes, who desired nothing
more,<note place="margin">The resolution of the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> then to sow the seede of their owne blood in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their countrey, thereby expecting the eternitie
of their names and memories? Infinite are the examples
which may be brought to this purpose: but wee on the
contrarie supposing (as it were by an implicite faith)
some naturall instinct, that the world shall not continue
the full age of a man; we thinke our blood better saued,

and courage of former times; it was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought fit by

            <p>Let not this change of our mindes seeme strange vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you; for see you not, how the little chickens stand
fearefull of the Kite, whereas the valiant Cocke desires
nothing more then the combat? In young men and old
men you shall not finde a like inclination: and men of
diuers nations you shal finde them seuered, as in their
climates, so in their dispositions. Suppose a change
should appeare in the naturall inclination of man; it is

example, Gun-powder is a late inuention of mans, a
cruell and mercilesse instrument; therefore hath God
giuen them a sent and a smell, for their owne safetie and

inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs, that so there might appeare as great a
prouidence, goodnesse, and power of God in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation,
as there was in their first creation.</p>
            <p>From the change in our mindes, let vs come to the
change in the soundnesse and constitution of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
Considering their strength in former times,<note place="margin">The Ancients were not so subiect to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, as wee are.</note> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they were lesse subiect to diseases, then now wee
are; for thus the old age of the world, as it is a weaknes
in it selfe, so is it accompanied with many infirmities.
This may well appeare by their little vse of physicke;
for in ancient times, the common sort of men being
wholly vnacquainted with physicall receipts, they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
nature to worke her owne will, and did not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loade
their stomackes, with drugges and potions: not
a hundred yeeres since, the Physitian, the Apothecarie
and the Surgion, did seeme to belong to one and the
same calling and profession of men; but now the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of the times inforcing vs, the Physitian containes
himselfe within the bounds of his knowledge, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
his receipts, and giues his direction; the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist
hee turnes an Apothecarie, distils his waters, and
makes his confections; the Barber he proues a Surgion,
with his plaisters and salues, searching the wounds, and
the bones. Here are three distinct and seuerall courses
of life, all set on worke, and all sufficiently employed:
the Physitians haue their Colledge, the Surgions their
Hall, (<hi>Henry</hi> the 8. gaue the first Charters to both, and
that within our memorie); and the Apothecaries are
now verie earnest and busie to make themselues a
whole entire Companie, forsooth a new Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3385:197"/>
the more is our miserie and sorrow.</p>
            <p>For the difference of diseases; the Ancients were more
inclined to hot diseases, such as proceede from the
strength of nature, and doe accompanie youth, then we
are; as plagues, sweating-sicknesses, plurisies, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infectious diseases arising from heate, wherein the
blood is inflamed: so likewise the inclination of men
to their lusts, arising from the constitution of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
was then much greater then now, (though I doe
easily yeeld, that the wantonnesse of these daies farre
exceeds theirs),<note place="margin">The Ancients more apt to ingender.</note> this appeares by the number of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Concubines; for then the world was to bee peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
and their disposition to their lusts was so strong,
as that God out of the idulgencie of his owne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
did permit a polygamie. This appeares likewise in
the dumbe creatures; for the alteration of so many
kindes, such numbers &amp; varietie of different creatures
did only proceed out of the immoderate heate, which
causeth the ingendring &amp; coupling together of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
kinds: for assuredly in the Arke al those seuerall kinds
were not contained, but since haue sprung vp from the
mixture of kindes. So at this day the Southerne people,
<hi>propter ftatum &amp; calorem,</hi> are more inclined to their
lust, though the Northerne people, <hi>propter abundantiam
seminis,</hi> may se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me to equall them; yet of both, the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
are more vicious, because the vice it selfe ariseth
rathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from heate and wantonnesse, then from necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But generally, as was their strength greater in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, so were their infirmities lesse, especially such
as proceed from the weaknesse and coldnesse of nature,
and herein we seeme most to abound: for proofe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there are many diseases onely proper to these times,
such as were vnknowne to the Ancients; I could name
many, but I will onely iusist in the French or Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
disease, which though it be accompanied some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:3385:197"/>
with a great vnnaturall heate,<note place="margin">New diseases proceeding from coldnesse and weaknes.</note> yet certainly it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in <hi>pituita crassa;</hi> it may be long harboured in the
bodie before it discouers it selfe, and works so leisurely
by degrees, as cannot stand with the efficacie of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e;
and therfore it must be a cold disease, and argue a great
measure of naturall coldnesse and weakenesse, such as
their bodies in former times could neuer admit.</p>
            <p>From the diseases and infirmities arising out of the
naturall constitution of our bodies, let vs come to the
cure:<note place="margin">The difference betweene the Ancients and vs, in the cures of our diseases.</note> The physicke of former times agrees with ours, as
in the receipts, so for the dosis and quantitie; thus wee
haue the practise, and experience of al ages: and though
(I suppose) that their drugges in former times were of
farre greater strength and efficacie then ours, (for so I
conceiue that the world is in the declining); yet must
it follow, that in all things it should carrie a like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
as farre foorth as possibly it could, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
should appeare alike; as in the drugges, so in mans
body. Now in this confusion, how shall wee discerne
the variety of times? I will therfore prescribe this course
for our direction: Certaine it is, that we haue the same
dosis, the same measures and weights, for so they agree
in all our receipts: now take our bodies with the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
ioyntly together, and then they will keepe their
proportion; but seuer them, and them, shall appeare the
disparitie. Most sure it is, that in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etting of blood,
which is done according to measure, the Ancients did
vsually take sixe or seuen times as much, as they doe in
these daies: a strange difference, I confesse, and yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
a truth, for <hi>Galen</hi> relates it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From the diseases I will come to the death of both,
if you please to giue me first leaue to speake a word or
two, concerning the inward gifts of our mindes;<note place="margin">The wits of former times did exceede ours.</note> for the
wits of former times, certainly they did farre exceede
ours, their bodies were better tempered, as being nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:3385:198"/>
the first mould, and the minde followes the temper
and disposition of the bodie; though I confesse, that
this our age being most proud, arrogant and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious,
doth most vniustly claime vnto it selfe the
name and title of the learned age; shall we ascribe no
more to the first founders and inuentors of Arts? Was
it a worke of small difficultie to hew and square out
nature, allotting to euery Science her proper subiect,
her due limitation? to reduce all the seuerall starres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
constellations, to obserue their motion, their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
their influence? Grammar, which is the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
and the meanest of all Arts, seemes to bee most
excellent in her inuention; that all the seuerall words,
how different soeuer, in sound and signification, should
be comprehended in an alphabet of foure and twentie
letters; that cases, declensions, numbers, tenses, and the
like, should figure out the varietie of nature. For all
Arts whatsoeuer, the best authors are the most ancient,
euen vnto this day: I could instance in euery one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
though wee building vpon their foundations,
haue added some ornaments, yet such as are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
to perfit the Art: and generally for the Ancients,
whatsoeuer you shal obserue in practise amongst them,
you shall finde that it stood with great wisedome and
prouidence, if you please to haue relation to the times
and occasions. And wherein they seeme to be defectiue,
you may ascribe it to the happinesse of their times; for
their plentie was such, as that they were not inforced to
trie all conclusions in husbandrie, whereas our wants
seeme to require our best inuentions; their honest
plaine and charitable meaning was such, as that they
were vnacquainted, or at least thought it not fit, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the guile and subtiltie of a serpentine generation;
the hardnesse of their bodies, their feare of God, and
the ioy of his seruice was such, as that vtterly detesting
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3385:198"/>
all carnalitie, (searing least the glory and pompe of this
world, might steale away themselues from themselues,
and that they might be carried with an immoderat loue
to the creatures), they thought it fitter to preuent this
mischiefe in the root, to professe a more homely and
strict kinde of life, and therein to giue themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;
that so their time and leisure might better
serue them, for the practise of zeale and deuotion.</p>
            <p>But this great learned age hath found out a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
wherin we might seeme to magnifie the Ancients,
but indeed very cunningly do presse them downe,<note place="margin">A foolish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them our foote-stooles; preferring our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, extolling and exalting our selues aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
for thus it is said, that we are like dwarfes set vpon
shoulders of Gyants, discerning little of our selues, but
supposing the learning and ground-worke of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
we see much further then they, (which in effect is
as much, as that we prefer our own iudgements, before
theirs): in truth, in truth, a very wittie comparison, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
it is either a dwarfe or a Gyant, for it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no mediocrity. But I pray' let vs examine it, though
(I confesse) that comparisons are not alwayes the best
proofes; first how these dwarfes should be exhaled and
drawne vp to the shoulders of the gyants; here is a point
of great difficulty as yet not thought vpon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or I must
tell you my iudgement: as in digging the earth some
mettals are found, and some are vndiscouered, so is it in
reading and perusing the workes of the fathers; we may
continually learne, and daily finde out new mynes in
their writings; suppose these dwarfes to bee now set
vpon the shoulders; it is to bee feared, least seeing so
steepe a descent, they will rather fall to a giddines, then
be able rightly to iudge of the obiects, least they should
be confounded with the multiplicity of learning in the
fathers, not able to fadome the depth of their grounds;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:3385:199"/>
for wil you suppose, that these Gyants should so infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceed the dwarfes in length and in strength, and yet
will you equall them for goodnes and quicknes of
sight? I cannot stay long vpon the shoulders of Gyants,
for heere is but slippery hold; nor yet vpon the feete of
comparisons, for these are but weake grounds and
proofes; let this one reason suffice, it is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
actions voluntary and naturall; that in volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
(such as are the actions of the vnderstanding) no
man can worke according to the vttermost of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but when hee hath once spoken, hee may speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe as much to the purpose; so that hee
which shall make himselfe perfect in an other mans
worke,<note place="margin">The small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which some make of the Fathers.</note> yet can neuer therein so fully informe himselfe
as the Author. This difference likewise appeares in
God, whose vnderstanding being natural and essential,
hee vnderstanding and comprehending himselfe, doth
beget a word euery way equal to himselfe: but suppose
(I pray') that these gyants should stumble or fall, take
heede of the dwarfe, take heede of the dwarfe, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cries out the dwarfe, I will guide and direct them,
and keepe them from falling; if they will not vphold
me, then I will vphold them. Here is presumption in
deede; here you shall see some <hi>expurgatorie index, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasia
patrum, errores conciliorum, lapsus ecclesiae;</hi> see
here what great account they make of the Fathers, and
thus they can vse arguments to serue all turnes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
            <p>I am the more strict to iustifie the wits and learning
of the ancient Fathers, because (I suppose) it maks much
for the certaintie and dignitie of Christian religion;<note place="margin">It cannot sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christian religion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>
that our faith tooke no aduantage by other mens ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
to spread it selfe, and to get growth in the
blindnesse of error: but at the time of Christs birth, all
the liberall Arts did most florish, there was a generall
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:3385:199"/>
peace thorough the whole world, the Romane Empire
fully setled, and established, Poets, Orators, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
Historians neuer more excellent. For thus it stood
with the prouidence of God, that their wits and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
might serue as trials and touch-stones of his truth,
to examine the seuerall miracles, the mysteries and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
precepts of his law, that both in themselues and in
others they might be for confirmation of the saith; that
the power of God might likewise discouer it selfe, for
the greater the aduersarie and opposition is, the more
noble is the conquest: and therefore God by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and foolishnesse of preaching, confounding the
strength and wisedome of this world, did therein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
a miracle, to continue for all succeeding ages. Now
this faith, as finding a strong opposition by learning
and humane knowledge, so in the Apostles it could not
be accompanied with ignorance: and therefore as God
gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gift of tongues, so vndoubtedly the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of nature (the same God being the God both of
nature and grace); for they could not demonstrate the
one, without some reference and relation to the other;
heere you see the Church planted. Now in the great
world, as men came neerer the first mould, so were they
more perfect, both for strength of bodies, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of yeeres, that so they might intend a propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their kinde. So was it in the growth of the
Church, the first Fathers which did neerer approch to
the times of the Apostles, had a greater measure of
knowledge by the imposition of their hands, that so
they might bee better inabled and instructed for the
conuersion of nations.<note place="margin">The Prophets confirme the doctrine of the Fathers.</note> Thus the Prophets in the old
law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speaking of the florishing kingdome of Christ,
seeme to point at the times of the Fathers, and as it
were to seale them before hand, and to proclaime them
to the whole world as Orthodoxall; and therefore as fit
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3385:200"/>
precedents and examples, for all future ages and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to follow; so that to detract from the Fathers and
the primitiue age, were to detract from Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and vnder colour of a naked text (which may

and vncertaintie.</p>
            <p>In the last place, I will speake of the life, and of the
death, both of our selues and of the Ancients: As man
comes not to that strength and growth, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did;<note place="margin">The length of our liues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Ancients.</note> so vndoubtedly hee is sooner ripened, and
comes to that weaknesse, which nature hath appointed
him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretofore he did: and being not of that sound
constitution, as the Ancients were, he hath not that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
in the course of his life, but vpon all occasions,
out of his weaknesse, he is apt and ready to fall. This I
conceiue to bee the reason, why our Gentrie in these
daies should desire to match their children so young,
and that the children themselues should in the spring
or morning of their age, be so fit to ingender: now for
the length of our liues, some haue been much mistaken,
supposing that it might be fitly gathered by the raignes
of Princes in former times, whereas indeede there is
little heede to be taken vnto them; seeing the time of
their gouernment, hath no relation to the yeers of their
age, but to the death of their ancestors, or to the time of
their election; so that if you will suppose, the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
to liue long, the successor may likewise liue long,
yet raigne but a short time. And heretofore Princes
did more aduenture themselues in the danger of their
warres, then now they doe, and therefore more did mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrie;
but if you please to consider their liues together,
most certaine it is, that before the deluge, men liued
many hundred yeeres, and the birth of their children
carried a iust proportion to their age: since the deluge,
(assuredly) the decay hath proceeded by degrees. <hi>Dauid</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:3385:200"/>
in his time, who liued much about the yeere after the
worlds creation 2890, which was twelue hundred
yeeres after the deluge, or thereabouts, confesseth, that
the age of man was threescore and ten yeeres; for then
it should seeme they came to that age with ful strength:
but in these times, few men (I will not speake of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
such as <hi>Dauid</hi> was, whose daintie and delicate fare
doth certainly shorten the course of their liues) doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
with much sorrow and griefe to threescore and
tenne yeeres; though I confesse that this alteration, as
all other naturall alterations whatsoeuer, doth not so
easily appeare to the sense, but is more fitly gathered by
the obseruation of reason; for I thinke that seuentie
yeeres then, had the same proportion that fiftie yeeres
haue now at this time.</p>
            <p>From man I will come to the elements, and I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the neerest eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (the generatiue elements), the
water and earth; for this change and alteration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
not in man alone, but the very elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
are much decaied in their wonted perfection: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

their soyle, so in their coasts, and their seas, which they
cannot neglect, with their owne profit or safetie). But
I may speake it with greater hearts griefe, I feare lest

that any quantitie of ground were yeerely employed

and so should returne againe in compost; certainly this
ground would much decay in goodnesse, for in vaine

the earth carrie in it selfe a kinde of fatnesse. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that some grounds there are, either rich of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

haue them, and where they are in greatest abundance,
yet they cannot supplie the barrennesse of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and bordering grounds: for nature more abounds
in the one, then in the other, so that this must argue a
barrennes in generall,<note place="margin">As in the parts so in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole.</note> though not in particular. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I will adde the weakenesse of the elements, decay
of the heauens, and a generall imperfection in al things
now, in this la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t old and cold age of the world; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those countries, which were first inhabited (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Easterne countries), are very much impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
at this time; the weaknesse of nature discouering
it selfe, not able to supplie those mines and mettals,
which formerly they did; not able to bring foorth or to
ripen those excellent delicious fruits, which heretofore
they had in great plentie.</p>
            <p>To draw neerer home, for this kingdome wherein
we liue; it is not only the complaint of all old men, and
our own experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but likewise many reasons drawne
from husbandrie,<note place="margin">A particular instance for this kingdome.</note> not so fit to bee alleaged in this place,
doe vndoubtedly perswade me, that our land is growne
barraine, and yeelds not that profit, which formerly it
did, in the daies of our forefathers: I will make one or
two instances, following the counsell of the wise man,
Eccles. 39. 31. The fruitfulnesse of a land especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in the hony and wine; the one proceeds from the
dew of the flower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other takes a deeper foundation
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:3385:202"/>
in the earth; the one argues the sweetnesse of the grasse
or the pasture, the other the goodnesse and depth of the
mould; the one is the worke onely of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other
requires the helpe and furtherance of husbandrie and
art; and in both of them it shall sufficiently appeare,
how this land hath declined. When I consider the
great vse of hony in former times,<note place="margin">We haue not the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of hony now, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</note> for their drinkes, for
their foode; and likewise the great quantitie of waxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
which were anciently spent in their diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice;
assuredly our countrey at this day cannot affoord
the one halfe of that which formerly it did, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
for there was neuer so great scarcitie, and yet it is
not transported, and here at home we haue little vse to
imploy it. Is it because men neglect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keeping of Bees?
No certainly, the price would allure them, for there is
no such profit, with so little charge; but certainly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in generall is weakned, the creatures begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and God denies his blessing for the increase.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is very credibly reported, that in this our
Northerne climate we haue had heretofore a vintage in
Wostershire; and it appeares vpon record, that tith hath
bin paid for wine pressed out of grapes, growing in the
little Parke at Winsor,<note place="margin">Our grapes come not to that ripenes now, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</note> in the time &amp; being then in the
possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. But at this time, whether tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the cold mould of the earth, or thorough the
weaknesse and swift declining of the sun, as being not
able to bring our grapes to ripenesse and perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction (the
grapes being a very lateward fruit, containing a great
naturall heate, which appeares by the strength of our
wines, and their long continuance, and therfore require
a hot soyle); yet at this time it is thought to be a work
impossible: the like may bee said for Wales, and the
North parts of this kingdome in many places, where
fruits and saffron did anciently growe, (the places still
carrying the names of those fruits), within these late
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:3385:202"/>
yeeres, triall being made, and all possible diligence and
good husbandry obserued, yet they faild in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>It may be obiected against me, that if nature did thus
decline, yet still the fruits should continue the same,
though not the same in their strength and their power;
for wine here in England, if euer we had, then still wee
should haue, though more imperfect and weake; but
Philosophy is well able to answere this obiection, <hi>datur
in rebus maximum &amp; minimum:</hi> nature hath appointed
certaine limits and bounds to euery kinde of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
beyond which, or beneath which, the creature
cannot subsist. Now in the generall declining, far bee it,
that she should appoint new boundes to the vndeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
essence of the creatures;<note place="margin">An obiection answered in Philosophie.</note> rather she should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
them as long as it lies in her power, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue,
not able to produce them, there should follow
a cessation of their being, and no new qualification of
their nature: and in this declining, some things are
more limited then others, and therfore will admit few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
degrees in their qualities and will sooner perish; so
that notwithstanding the decay doth equally concerne
all, yet some things may wholy cease, while others shall
still be continued, out of the large extent of their owne
bounds.</p>
            <p>That a generall scarcitie and penury may appeare,
consider the prices of things, how excessiue they are in
these our latter dayes, and how they are raised aboue
measure beyond all expectation: heretofore (I confesse)
they haue had as great famins as we haue,<note place="margin">The excessiue prices of things, and the scarcitie of these times.</note> but I suppose
not so vsually; and commonly these famins did not arise
from any vnseasonable weather, or barrennesse of the
earth, but rather from ciuill war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es within themselues,
making hauocke and waste of natures blessings, and of
poore mens labours; for if you would suppose (which
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:3385:203"/>
God forbid) a Campe subsisting of 20000. men to bee
lodged within the hart of our kingdome, assuredly it
would cause an extraordinary great dearth amongst vs:
but now we seeme to sustaine a continuall famine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
our peaceable times, and our great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
(necessity so inforcing vs); and therefore we can
blame none but nature, nor can we thinke that she is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
distempered, for then I would gladly aske, when
at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth (in Gods name) wil she returne to her first tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and constitution? for we see no tokens, signes, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of any recouery; and therefore we feare, that
she daily more and more decayes in her ould age, and in
vaine may we expect reformation: for whereas some
suppose the causes of this scarcitie, to be either the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
increase of people, or the great plentie of coyne,
wherewith we abound in respect of our Ancestors; these
reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns which do so much ouer-sway many, I wil brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
examine.</p>
            <p>For the number of men, wee are not able to send
forth such huge armies, as we read of in former times;
we dare not vndertake such taskes,<note place="margin">A comparison betweene our times and the former, for the number and multitude of men.</note> and infinit labours
as they did: I confesse indeed, that the Cities and
townes do now swarme with people, and therefore they
make the greater shewe of a number; but the country
(which truly and indeed did afford it) in a scattered and
dispersed Multitude (I thinke) was neuer more naked
and desolat then it is at this day. Such depopulation of
townes, inclosing of villages; a shepheard with his dog
their inhabiting, where formerly many hundred men
were maintained, many good horses kept for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our land, and much prouision for our plentie.
He that shall well consider our lawe-bookes, the exact
measuring of lands in those dayes, the largenes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of their Churches, the ould foundations, which
now are daily raked vp by the plow; shall (by all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:3385:203"/>
coniecture) conceiue, that the world was then as wel
peopled as it is in these times. The Church-bookes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are not extant, which might serue for our eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;<note place="margin">Bangor in Wales neere Wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet this I can say for a truth, that in Bangor
(which is a small village in Wales) 800. yeers ago, there
were abiding and daily resident there, two and twenty
hundred Monkes, besides seruants and others which did
attend them: at this day I could see no reliques thereof,
onely some fewe closes did beare the name of porches
and gates; and I thinke at this time, that both our Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
can hardly equall that number. Since (it should
seeme) that our land did surfeit with people, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was to be let bloud, in the wars between the two
houses of Lancaster and Yorke: and he that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
how infinitly the people of Israel did multiply in
a short time, liuing vnder the bondage of Aegypt, will
neuer doubt but that this land might haue bin sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stockt and stored with people, long since the first
plantation.</p>
            <p>Now for the plenty of our coyne, because we haue it
not from our selues, I will therefore first speake of the
fountaines before I come to the streames, that so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

the other. If the West Indies haue now at length bin

their coyne: and heerein I do acknowledge a speciall
prouidence of God, who foreseeing in his wisdom, that
the carnall Mahumetans (his owne professed enemies)
should possesse the land of Promise: and as their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
the Iewes and the Heathen, were guilty of the
bloud of Christ; so they should seaze vpon the holy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
in token of the bloudy persecution of his
Church (all which God did permit in his iustice for our
sinnes), yet hee in his wisedome, first suffered it to bee
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:3385:204"/>
worne out with vse, or to decay of it selfe, before the
cursed <hi>Ottomans</hi> should conquer it: for notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the large circuite of his territories and prouinces,
yet in wealth and treasure, yea in the power of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and most especially in the strength of his Nauie,
the Turke is inferiour to some Christian Princes. But
let vs consider the plentie of coyne, as Scripture reports
it; <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Ephron</hi> (as it may appeare, Gen.
23. vers. 16.)<note place="margin">The great plenty of coine and of siluer and gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes.</note> foure hundred siluer shekels for a field to
burie his dead: Now the common shekell is accounted
twentie pence, which if it shall please you to multiplie,
foure hundred shekels will amount to three and thritie
pound sixe shillings, eight pence; supposing fiue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
sterling the ounce (a very large price to purchace
a buriall). The plentie of their siluer and gold did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
appeare in those times, by their wearing of rings,
bracelets, abilimentss, &amp;c. of the magnificence of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
Court, of the wealth and treasure of the Temple,
where all the vessels were of a wonderfull price; and
of the custome in those times, to send out shipping, and
to returne home loaded with oare, Scripture makes
mention. Whereunto prophane and heathen writers,
doe likewise beare witnesse, for <hi>Eupolenus, Polyhistor,</hi>
and <hi>Hecateus Abderita,</hi> that liued and serued in warre
with King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, make mention (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other things) of the inestimable riches of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
and of the treasures which he did hide and bury
(according to the fashion of that time) in the Sepulchre
of his father <hi>Dauid:</hi> which to be no fable, (though not
mentioned by the Scripture) <hi>Iosephus</hi> well proueth, for
that <hi>Hircanus</hi> the high Priest, and King of Iurie, being
besieged in Ierusalem by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> surnamed <hi>Pius,</hi>
not many yeeres before Christs natiuitie, to redeeme
himselfe and the Citie, and to pay for his peace, opened
the said Sepulchre of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and fetcht out of one part
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:3385:204"/>
thereof, three thousand talents in ready money, which
amount to 600000. pounds English, if we account the
talents but at the least size of <hi>talentum Haebraicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let vs draw to our selues, and come to this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
wherin we liue, and compare our wealth in coyne
with our ancestors: first therefore I must acquaint you,
that our coyne is much fallen,<note place="margin">How the coine here amongst vs, hath daily decayed in weight.</note> &amp; beares not that weight
which formerly it did; for it appeares among the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2, that twentie pence sterling, then
waied an ounce: in the ninth yeere of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3,
26. pence waied an ounce: in the second of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 6.
32. pence waied an ounce: in the 5. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4.
40. pence waied an ounce: in the 31. of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.
45. pence waied the ounce: in the second of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
60. pence waied the ounce: and so it continueth vnto
this day; so that an hundred pounds heretofore, was as
much as three hundred pounds now, besides the finesse
of their coyne: wherein, as I take it, they did farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
vs. I will not dispute, how it may stand with the
wisedome and policie of States, to raise or inhaunce
coynes: but certaine it is, that the prices of all things
will immediatly follow the coynes, according to the
weight, finenesse and goodnesse of the mettall; though
things may be done to serue the present turne, yet they
shall finde a great abatement in their ancient rents:<note place="margin">The great wealth of the Ancients.</note>

are yet extant; or the moneys and coyne which at this

their owne homes, that vndoubtedly for all other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
as Lead, Iron, Tinne, Copper, Brasse, and the like, it
appeares by their buildings, and their other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they had them in a farre greater plentie,
then we haue in these daies: and mettals are so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
mixed together (which is the ground of all

subsist with any great scarcity of the other.</p>
            <p>Now at this time I feare there is more siluer and

            <p>As for some base coynes which they had in ancient

costs and charges at law, were very great and large, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as much as at this day: speaking now out of the
course of mine owne studies, I may seeme to be a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
wholly ignorant therein; yet giue me leaue (with
your good patience) to make one or two instances to
this purpose. <hi>William Wickam</hi> recouered of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
Bishop <hi>Edendon</hi> of Winchester, in the yere 1366,
for dilapidations of his house, 1662. pounds, tenne shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:
and lest you might conceiue that such a large
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3385:206"/>
summe of money might bee allowed for some other
losse and detriment sustained, hee recouered likewise
1556. head of Neate, 3876. Weathers, 4717. Ewes,
3521. Lambes, and 127. Swine; all which stocke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Bishopricke. Because wee cannot take a
perfect suruey of the buildings, how they were left; and
generally because all trespasses are very vncertaine,
whereof wee cannot take due notice; let vs therefore
come to the fines, which certainly were very large in
those daies: In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6, the Duke of
Holland (being then high Admirall) was fined at tenne
thousand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for holding plea in a cause determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the Common law; it was very much for such an
offence, if you please to haue relation to the rates of
coyne, which before I haue prefixed.</p>
            <p>Not to speake of the ransomes of Princes, which
were very great in former times; not to speake of any
particular mans wealth, though I could name many; for
<hi>Thomas Ruthall,</hi> whose meanes of getting were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

or sparing,<note place="margin">The great house-keeping of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> liuing in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7, his
wealth in present coyne did amount to aboue one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand pounds, which was discouered by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Wolsey.</hi> I pray' consider their house-keeping, such
huge gates, and open doores, spatious halles, long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
great kitchins, large chimneys; their sellars, ouens,
vessels, pots, and powdring tubs, deepe, profound, and
bottomlesse: all their other prouision made in a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
manner, as may appeare by the rents of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
their barnes, granaries, granges, slaughter-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
the multitudes of mouthes in their numberlesse fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants;
the ringing of bels to call all to their feasts; their
infinite holy daies, which were the times for their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
These things duly considered, you shall find their
expense was very excessiue. Now take these with their
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:3385:207"/>
prices, and first for those things which were brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
into this kingdome; <hi>Henry Bowet,</hi> Archbishop of
Yorke in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 5, spent in his house
yeerely of Claret wine onely, foure score tunnes: this
might seeme incredible, were it not that it appeares by
such euidence, as cannot bee denied. Now let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the price of this wine: I finde among the slatutes
of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2. (which was long before that time), that
Vintners were appointed to sell their wine at twelue
pence the gallon, and not aboue; we cannot reade, nor
cannot conceiue that since that time wine should fall
in the price,<note place="margin">Wine was dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in ancient times, then it is.</note> being none of our owne commodities; so
then supposing wine at twelue pence the gallon, and
considering that 26 pence then waied an ounce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
now 60 pence goe to the ounce; he then spent only
in Claret wine (if I doe not mistake in my reckonings)
9304. ounces 8/13, which did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amount to 1008 pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds:
which foresaid number of ounces, would now amount
to 2326 pounds, three shillings, one penny: at this time
supposing wine to be at two shillings y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallon, as now
it is sold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may buy as much for 8064 ounces, which
would be worth 2016 pounds of our currant money; so
that you shall saue 1240. ounces 8/13, which heretofore
the same wine would haue cost; which number of oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
being reduced into pounds, it will amount to 310
pounds, three shillings, one penny: so that it appeares,
that wine is now sold cheaper, by a seuenth part, then
heretofore it hath been, which makes much to shew the
plentie of their coyne.</p>
            <p>To speake of our owne countrie prouision, assuredly
the prices of things doe not hold proportion, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie
to the weight and valuation of coynes;
as may appeare by that most excellent statute of rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,
made in the behalfe of our Vniuersities, which
hath proued so beneficiall to Colledges. And if you
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3385:207"/>
please to consider the almes-deedes,<note place="margin">The plentie of their coyne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their almes.</note> and charitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence
of former times, as well in their money, as in
their victuals, you may truly affirme, that as they farre
exceeded vs in the one, so they came not much short in
the other. It shall appeare by this one instance: <hi>Richard
de Burie,</hi> sometimes Bishop of Durrham in the yeere
1333, bestowed weekly, for the reliefe of the poore,
eight quarters of wheate, made into bread, besides the
fragme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his house, the offals of his slaughter-house,
and yeerely much clothing: In his iourney betweene
New Castle and Durrham, he gaue alwaies by his own
appointed order, eight pounds in almes; from Durrham

They that succeeded these old Bishops in their wealth
and abundance, I hope will excuse our new and now
Bishops, if they be not so plentifull in their almes, when
as indeed they seeme to succede them only in the Cure,
the Pastorall charge, and imposition of hands.</p>
            <p>To conclude, these excessiue prices of things do well
argue a great scarcitie,<note place="margin">The corrupt dealings of this age, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of former times.</note> that the whole world is turned
bankrupt, though we to saue our owne credit, can make
the best shew for our honor &amp; reputations sake; we can
name huge summes of money, but wee borrow vpon
such base tearmes, wee set our lands vpon such a rackt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that if the tenant payes one yeere, he runnes away
the next: and therefore I am perswaded, that men in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out their lands in such manner, doe not so much
regard the present rent, as a future intended sale of
those lands, after twentie, or two and twentie yeeres
purchase; for otherwise they would neuer bee fed with
words in effect, and neglect their present securitie. An
other cause of our scarcitie may be (besides the heauie
iudgements of God, whereof I wil not dispute) our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
vse of the creatures; men were neuer so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3385:208"/>
and curious in their diet or food, as they are at this
day, neuer so wastfull in their expence, the world did
neuer so much abound with surfeits and drunkennesse:
heretofore they had their fastings as well as their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,
but this is superstitious (forsooth). Thus while
some proue infinitly lauish, dissolute, and riotous, the
poore people of our land neuer sustained the like scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
and wants. I might likewise accuse the euill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of men, for in ancient times, they knew not the
art of monopolizing, their meaning was honest and
plaine; but we are our crafts-masters, the Landlord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ceasing from racking his poore tenants, and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
must set an answerable price on their wares: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
it was thought a poynt of conscience, <hi>that euerie

doe vndoubtedly proue the diuersitie; by vertue of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue

in the Moone; and within our memorie, in the
yeere 1572. a true Comet did appeare in the eighth
Heauen, which as it had a time of beginning, so had it
a period, and time of dissoluing. And thus being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
of our selues, wee dwell in houses of clay, the roofe
of this world, as well as the foundations shall together
be mooued; for wherefore serues the diuersitie of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

and Winter, the rising and setting of Starres, the
different and contrarie motions, the various aspects
and oppositions? but that in some sort they partake of
our nature, and shall haue their part and portion with
ours.</p>
            <p>For proofe of this truth, let vs compare times with
times, and so it shall better appeare; the hot Zones

they were very wise, and as I suppose far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

so fondly mistaken at their owne homes, being neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and bordering vpon these hot climates, where a
few daies sayling, would discouer the truth? a truth so
manifest and palpable, as that they could not pretend
any grosse ignorance; let vs doe them no wrong, but so
esteeme of them, as we desire our po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

vs. What a shame and dishonour were it to vs, if future
ages shall condemne vs for fooles and lyars; and that
our testimonie should be reiected in such things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
our times, whereof triall and experience might
informe vs, without further reason or discourse? Rather
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3385:209"/>
let vs wonder at the prouidence of God, when the
world was yet in her infancie and youth, no maruell if
heate did abound, the earth as yet was vnpeopled, and
therefore men in those dayes had roome enough, to
make choice of their habitation and dwelling; but now
the world grones vnder the multitude and number of
people, the heauens doe likewise decay in their wonted
strength. And therefore now at length, new Ilands ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the Ocean,<note place="margin">The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> which before neuer were extant;

which were concealed from antiquitie; places former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
knowne to be excessiue in heate, are made habitable
by the weakenesse and olde age of the heauens; the
colde Zones are tempered either thorough thicke misty
ayre, or the stipation of coldnesse, God preparing their
bodies, and giuing them food and clothing according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
Thus God in the beginning of the world, out of his
owne foresight and goodnesse, did fit and temper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
according to the times and occasions (giue mee
leaue to speake after the manner of men, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I know the immutabilitie of Gods nature), as long
as there was vse of Paradise, so long it continued in
state and perfection, being once forsaken and destitute,
then followed the dissolution.</p>
            <p>If the Ancients were strangers abroade, and might
easilie mistake, yet in their owne dwellings and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
their sense for want of reason would serue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them;<note place="margin">The burning of Phaeton.</note> certaine it is, that there was a great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in <hi>Phaetons</hi> time, though grounded I confesse
vpon a fabulous historie; yet for the truth of it, signes
and tokens thereof did appeare for many subsequent
ages: and strange it is among the heathen, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention
of fire did hereby insue; inuenting a kinde of
slate which might resist the violence of fire, and therein
reseruing and laying vp the hidden treasure of their
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:3385:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
writings and records, against such a generall combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whereas in these daies we neuer found the heate of
the sunne to be such, we neuer sustained any such dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
but that the coldnesse and moysture of the winter
could easilie recompence our losse; nay rather we haue
iust cause to complaine of the sunnes weakenesse, and
that he is defectiue in heate: notwithstanding that in
this time of his olde age, God hath appoynted that the
sunne should enter into the hot signes, yet both sunne
and signes are defectiue in their power, and cannot
ripen our fruites in that manner, which formerly the
sunne alone did in the waterie constellations. What a
strange difference appeares in our seasons, more then in
ancient times; we can not promise vnto our selues the
like certaintie, neither in our seede time, nor in our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
nor in the whole course of the yeere, which they
did: for a wonder it is, to heare the relation of old men
in this kinde, how they all seeme to agree in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainte,
which certainely betokens a truth. If you tell
me of our corrupt computation of the yeere, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
is, that the change is so insensible (not a day in an
age) as that it makes no sensible difference; yet herein
I cannot excuse our selues, for if the world should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
many ages, our Christmas would fall out in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest:
whereas certaine it is, that the day was first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
according to Christs birth, and Christ was
borne neere <hi>solstitium brumale,</hi> when the dayes were
the shortest, and then began to increase; as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
was borne at Midsommer, when the dayes were at the
longest, and then began to shorten; to be a figure (as
Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> obserueth) that Christ should increase,
as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> decreased; but now in these times, our
dayes are increased a full houre in length, before the
Natiuitie.</p>
            <p>If still thou proouest wilfull, and wilt not beleeue the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:3385:210"/>
Ancients, but talkest onely of thine owne experience

thou shouldest trie all conclusions in Physicke vpon
thine owne bodie, that so thou mightest see onely with
thine owne eyes, and take nothing by relation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
if thou iudgest of times past by thine owne little

there were little alteration in this world, it would
then argue the newnesse of this world, that it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but this morning, for as yet the Heauens haue not

argue the excellencie of the workeman, as in the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
so in the continuance of his worke; for if the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
should alwaies want some repayring and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
we might well thinke, that the state of the Church

yet in reason, you shall easilie discerne the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
tokens of the worlds ruine.</p>
            <p>Now that I am falne to the generall dissolution of
this world, which shall bee performed by the rage and
violence of fire, according to the receiued tradition of
the Ancients; whereunto Scripture agrees, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the opinion of the best learned Philosophers,
who ascribe the greatest actiuitie to fire: and were it
not for the situation, as being aboue the rest of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

assuredly all the rest of the elements together

this propertie, <hi>congregare homegenea &amp; segregare he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogenea,</hi>

of the iust from the reprobate: I cannot nor dare not
prescribe the day and houre of that iudgement, rather
with patience I will waite on Gods leisure, &amp; with my
assured hope, will expect to see my Redeemer in his
flesh, and in my flesh, so descending as he ascended; for
herein we haue the testimonie of Angels, <hi>This Iesus

to dacay, seemes to hasten Christs comming: to let passe
many strong presumptions of our Diuines, concerning
the approach of that day; these three proofes, drawne
from naturall reason, doe easilie induce mee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it.</p>
            <p>First, looking to the generall decay of this world,
which argues the approach of this iudgement: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to the great preparation for f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, which must then
serue for the execution of Gods wrath: thirdly, the fit
occasions seeming to hasten this iudgement, &amp;c. Most
certaine it is, that if the world should continue many
thousand yeeres, and that wee should suppose that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:3385:211"/>
would decay in such sort, as we are able to proue
by demonstratiue euidence, already she hath done; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
nature of her selfe, thorough her owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
would come to nothing; and the world should
not bee able to supplie mens necessities. Suppose this
one kingdome, besides the generall barrennesse which
hath befalne vs, whereof wee may iustly complaine; if
we should commit the like waste in our woods, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
wee haue done, in this last forepassed age; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
we should bee left so destitute of fuell, of houses,
of shipping, that within a short time, our land would
proue almost inhabitable, for such things as require a
great growth, wherein man cannot see the present
fruites of his prouidence; husbandrie and labour, for
the most part, they are alwaies neglected, and it lies not
in the power of one age to recouer her selfe: thus out
of the decay of nature we may almost expect a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as by the signes and symptomes we iudge of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and desperate disease. Thus you may obserue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a like distance, from the creation to the deluge,
from the deluge to Christ,<note place="margin">An equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time in Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> from Christ vnto vs; as God

after fifteene generations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xpired, you shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
note in Scripture, some great alteration and
change. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was therefore called from the
receite of custome, to cast vp this account in the genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
of Christ, as it appeares in his first chapter: now at
length in Gods name what may wee expect should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
vs? Whatsoeuer concernes the kingdome of Shilo,
<hi>consummatum est,</hi> it is already perfited, wee must not
looke for any further addition; that which remaines, it
is the sound of the trumpet, <hi>vt consummetur seculum,</hi>
that the world may be destroyed by fire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, fire shall bee the second ouerthrowe, this
Scripture and reason confirmes; now certaine it is, that
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:3385:211"/>
God who hath first instituted nature, hath so ordained
her,<note place="margin">The last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be, while the fierie constellations doe rule.</note> as she may best serue to be an instrument to worke
his owne ends and purposes; to shew a conformitie of
the effects with the cause, thereby to manifest his owne
empire and rule which still he retaines in the creatures:
as likewise the obedientiall power, whereunto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are subiect; that so may appeare how absolute and
powerfull he is, first to appoint the creatures, then how
gracious and mercifull he is, to impart himselfe, and to
ioyne with the creatures in the same action. Thus the
waterie constellations did then gouerne and rule, when
the world was ouerwhelmed with waters, now at this
time, and for a few hundred yeeres yet to continue, the
fierie constellations shall haue the predominancie; and
therefore credible it is, that within the compasse of
this time, there shall happen the generall combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the dissolution of this world betokens a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
punishment, the iudgement accompaning hath
reference to our transgressions:<note place="margin">The necessitie of iustice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of our sinnes, seemes to hasten th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s iudgement.</note> as in the first permission
of sinne appeares the goodnesse of God, who can turne
our sinnes to his glorie, either for the manifestation of
his mercy or iustice; so in this great tolerating of sinne
appeares Gods patience and long suffering. But now
our sinnes are come to a full ripenesse, now is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
and the weedes choake vp the wheate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
necessitie seemes to inforce, and to hasten the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of this iudgement, that at length there might
bee a separation of both, though hetherto they haue
growne vp together. Thus Christs first comming in the
flesh was to restore the decaied state of the Iewes, for
then hee was borne into this world, when charitie was
growne colde, the Priesthood bought and sould for a
price, the Kings office extinguished, the tribe of Iuda
neglected, the synagogue diuided into sects and

               </gap>
of the earth, for hee came in the winter season,
and hee was borne at midnight, to argue the worlds
vniuersall darknesse and ignorance. So must it bee for
his second comming, he hath giuen vs a watch-word,
<hi>that the sonne of man will come at an houre, when hee is
not expected,</hi> Luk. 12. vers. 40. Now is that time when
we doe not expect him, we neuer thinke of iudgement,
of hell, of fire, of damnation; Religion hath taken vp
wings, and is returned to heauen, from whence she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended:
Men are now growne carelesse in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and liue after a sensuall manner like beasts; we
are now growne to the height and top of all sinne; our
sinnes, our crying sinnes now crie for vengeance; and
therefore the time of his comming cannot be farre ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
hee will take the best opportunitie, like a theefe in
the night; we may then expect him, when wee doe least
expect him. But I will leaue this, as being not so perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to my purpose, and grounded onely vpon conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now I haue brought man to his graue, and together
with man the whole fabricke of nature, you would
thinke, that at length I should discharge him: I haue
buried him deep enough (I confesse),<note place="margin">Our fall is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losoph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heauens and the earth vpon him, and together with
man intombed the whole world. Yet giue me leaue in
the last place, to preuent one obiection; for some will
say, that if the fall of man should appeare by the light
of nature, how should those great Sages and Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of nature (the ancient Philosophers) be so much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken?
for the Schooles, and all our Diuines hold, that
they were deceiued in the state of man, supposing man
to be in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> without any thought of his
fall, without any hope of his recouerie.</p>
            <p>I confesse indeede, that the ancient Philosophers
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3385:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue not mentioned the fall of man, for they did onely
looke to the present course and order of nature; as, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in the middest of Egypt, they considered Nilus,
the depth of the waters, the violence of the streame, the
ebbings and flowings, but they regarded not the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
into the sea, nor yet could trace the head of the

            <p>Suppose man to bee borne in a prison, where hee

                  </gap>parated Idea of the Platonikes.</note> according to whose image and likenesse,
things were ordained here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth: the ground of this
opinion, is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Gen. 1. where God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> framing
of man, speakes these words; <hi>Let vs make man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our owne image.</hi> Now supposing man to bee
made according to Gods image, according to such a
separated Idea, hee should be wholly spirituall, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
conformable to God. But considering man to
be carnall, sensuall, an enemie and stranger to God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the inclination of his flesh, and wholly tending
to corruption; assuredly he is fallen, and much degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from that high state and dignitie, wherein hee
was first created from the beginning.</p>
            <p>After the framing and constitution of man, the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonikes
did consider in the next place, the transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of soules from bodies to bodies,<note place="margin">The transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of soules.</note> not from man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
beast; for here the different kinds doe betoken dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
soules, which require different organes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
that so they might bee fitted and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the right vse and exercise of their faculties. This
transmigration hath vndoubtedly some reference to
the first infusion of mans soule, <hi>&amp; inspirauit deus spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum
vitae:</hi> and this opinion doth necessarily presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
&amp; is grounded vpon mans fall; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seeing there is no
proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or agreement between the flesh &amp; the spirit,
(as the case now stands), therfore there was a bodie in
the state of innocencie, more capable of this reasonable
soule; the body changing, the soule did likewise change
her habitation and dwelling; one and the same body
being altered, one and the same soule did find her place
of abode to be altered, here was a transmigration; and
at the last day, when this body sowen in corruption,
shall rise againe in incorruption, &amp; be made a spirituall
body, better befitting the dignitie &amp; state of the soule,
here shall be a new transmigration, still of one and the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:3385:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
selfe same soule; and therefore acknowledge the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition of man to bee the fall of man, some pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
or imprisonment of man, that the soule should
be inforced to take her flight, to vse a transmigration,
and to change the place of her dwelling.</p>
            <p>Now for the principall action of the soule, it is our
knowledge or vnderstanding: The Platonikes held,
that <hi>cognitio nostra est reminiscentia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our learning is a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</note> our learning or
knowledge is only a kind of remembrance; supposing
that man had formerly some naturall knowledge, as all
other creatures haue, thought it was lost by some ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
and therfore must be renewed againe, as it were
called to minde, or better remembred by learning; yet
certainly we had it, for otherwise we should finde farre
greater difficultie in regaining and retaining such an
inestimable iewell: and though this may seeme very
displeasing to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who desired to build vp his
fame, in the ruines of <hi>Plato</hi> (the scholler treads on his
schoole-master); yet doe not his followers say as much
in effect, <hi>anima est rasa tabula? rasa est, ergo insculpta
fuit:</hi> Who shaued it? who scrapte it? what image is
lost? See heere the prouidence of God, lest wee should
denie, or forget our owne fall and corruption: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fall and corruption of man, appeares in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes
of man.</p>
            <p>From the Platonikes, I will come to the Schooles of
the famous and thrice renowned <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and heere I
doe ingeniously, and truly confesse,<note place="margin">Proofes out of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie.</note> that whatsoeuer I
haue spoken, for the proofe of mans fall, and of natures
corruption, I haue only borrowed it from the grounds
and foundations of his learning; so that this whole
treatise, may not improperly bee ascribed to him, onely
the errors excepted, which I claime as being due vnto
my selfe. To proue mans fall out of his grounds, were to
repeate all; I will therefore heere insist in those things,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:3385:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which seeme to be most generall, and therein <hi>Aristotle</hi>
shall speake for himselfe. First for the Metaphysicks,
speaking of things most generall, which the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
call <hi>transcendentia; bonum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bonum est transcendens.</note> the goodnesse of a
creature is numbred and accounted with the rest: and
looking to the first institution of nature, nothing is so
common and triuiall in Philosophie, as is this axiome,
<hi>ens &amp; bonum conuertuntur;</hi> whatsoeuer is, is good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the approbation of God, in the first of Gen.
<hi>&amp; vidit deus, &amp; erant omnia valdè bona:</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the Philosophers did acknowledge, that
there was <hi>malum, malitia, defectus, deformitas, monstru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
and the like, and these to be incident to nature her self;
and these to be knowne onely in relation to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
according to the distance or accesse, hauing no
entitie in themselues, and therefore not able to bee the
grounds of our knowledge, which presupposeth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
being: Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not knowne sinne, but by
the law.</hi> These euils (I say) being no <hi>transcendentia,</hi> they
could not be so generall, or equal in time to nature, and
therefore they are the punishments of nature, and haue
crept into nature, since the first institution thereof.</p>
            <p>From the Metaphysicks I will come to naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,
where I will onely in a word touch the first
principles. I would gladly demand, why <hi>priuatio</hi> should
be numbred as one of the three first principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
for priuation hath reference to the act, and first
presupposeth the act;<note place="margin">Why priuation should be one of the first pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nciples.</note> how then can it be one of the first
principles? there should haue been (I confesse) an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
negation, according to the condition of a creature,
as being made of nothing, &amp; nothing includes a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but a priuation is, <hi>when a thing is capable to be, and
ought to be, but is not.</hi> Therefore priuation being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the principles, supposeth that all things
should haue been, and should haue much sooner attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3385:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the height of their perfection, and not so leisurely
haue proceeded by degrees, as now they do; were it not
that some curse had altered the course of nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that, which formerly was onely a bare negation,
should now be conceiued to be a naturall priuation.</p>
            <p>From the huge Continent of nature, let vs draw nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
home, and discouer the vnknowne region of the
reasonable soule: alas how few sparkes of reason doe
appeare in this reasonable soule? The Philosophers
thinke it to be a table-booke, wherein nothing is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and looking more narrowly, they finde indeede
some blinde characters, certaine obscure, darke, hidden,
secret notions, which are the principles of al our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
As for example, <hi>Contradictoria non possunt esse si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul
vera: Omne totum est mains sua parte,</hi> and such like
palpable verities, which in my iudgement seeme rather
to belong to the cognizance of common sense, then of
the reasonable soule. And hence it is, that there is much
more difficultie in adorning the inward minde, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
the nakednesse of the soule, then in the outward
members, and shame of the body. Thus at length all
Arts and Sciences in generall,<note place="margin">All Arts and Sciences take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of mans fall.</note> seeme to suppose this for
their ground-worke and foundation; that in regard of
mans fall, and his ignorance, contracted by his fall,
therefore necessitie inforced the occasion of their
births and beginnings. And hence it is, that those long
courses of studie, those night-watchings and great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in the Vniuersities, are only vndertaken to supply
natures defects.</p>
            <p>We haue no naturall voyce, no naturall tongue, wee

to draw the inference or conclusion. Man, as if he were
a sauage and wilde creature, cannot speake pleasingly
with a smooth phrase, and gracious deliuerie, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
the sociable nature of man, without the helpe
and vse of Rhetoricke.<note place="margin">Rhetoricke.</note> Mathematickes must teach him,<note place="margin">Mathematikes.</note>
how God hath framed his works in number, in weight,
and in measure; the consideration whereof, seemes to
haue been the principall intent and scope of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Metaphysicks will attempt to discourse of first
mouers,<note place="margin">Metaphysicks.</note> intelligences, and separated soules; yet in truth
and veritie, they doe but onely point at them, and so
leaue them with a Supersedeas, acknowledging natures
infirmitie, and that the due cognizance of them, doth
not properly belong to that Court,</p>
            <p>And whereas God hath giuen all things, for our vse
and seruice, certainly it stood with the same wisedome
and goodnesse of God, to discouer and lay open the
vse:<note place="margin">The studie of naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ignorance.</note> let vs not conceiue God like an vnwise and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
father, who left indeed behinde him great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of treasure, but so buried and concealed, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
turned to the profit of his heire; to giue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
iewell, though it be a sufficient argument of
bountie, yet it seemes to detract from the wisedome of
the giuer. Suppose an Apothecaries shop were furnisht
with exquisite drugges, yet if the boxes want names
for direction, or there want a Physitian to prescribe the
medicine; it is to be feared, that in such a confusion, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should be taken for cordials. The principall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
and substance of euery thing consists in the vse,
without due knowledge of the thing, there can bee no
vse: and therefore it stood with the same diuine wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as to giue the creatures outwardly to supply our
necessitie and delight; so inwardly in the minde, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
a due knowledge, how man should vse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them. Euery other facultie hath this knowledge
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3385:216"/>
and instinct toward his obiect; the eye easily concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
all colours, and in a moment, without further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
iudgeth of them by their outward appearance: all
other creatures know what is profitable to themselues,
only the reasonable man is the foole, he is defectiue,
and therefore must intend a long course of Philosophy,
to supplie his owne wants. Howsoeuer, I doe commend
naturall Philosophie,<note place="margin">The imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie.</note> aboue all other humane Arts and
Sciences; yet I haue often wondred, that after so long a
time of studie, (sixe thousand yeeres experience, for so
long the world hath continued), that there should bee
such imperfection, such want of knowledge, such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
of opinions, in such a noble and most excellent
Science.</p>
            <p>But if wee shut our eyes, not looking to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but returning to our selues, wee shall finde farre
greater cause to complaine &amp; lament; the soule, though
otherwise an vnderstanding nature, yet she knowes
not her selfe, but by reflection; she knowes not her
owne beginning, nor her faculties and actions, nor the
extent and bounds of her essence. Blessed God, were it
not sufficient, that all other creatures should bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
but that the soule must bee couered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from her selfe? Herein appeares an admirable
guile and subtiltie, which well argues the high wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and iustice of God: for as the first sinne was the
immoderate and presumptuous desire of knowledge,
<hi>eritis sicut dij scientes bonum &amp; malum;</hi> so God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
of this sinne, <hi>contraria curans contrarijs,</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
man with the heauie yoake of ignorance,<note place="margin">The reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing soule knowes not her selfe.</note> yea,
of the ignorance of himselfe; which herein seemes to
bee more intolerable, considering that man still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
as the same corrupt nature, so the same immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
desire of knowledge. Let the naturalist here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that since God hath herein been more mercifull
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3385:217"/>
to other creatures, then vnto man, therefore this hath
befallen man since the first institution of his nature, as
a punishment for some offence: and since euery facultie
hath reference and some knowledge of his obiect, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
our blindnesse and ignorance is a particular
case, contrarie to the generall current and course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and nature will not varie her course, without
great and iust occasion: the beleeuing man will easilie
acknowledge this, considering that <hi>Adam</hi> before his
fall, was able to giue a name to euery creature, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to his propertie; and the vnbeleeuing man, by the
light of his owne reason, shall be inforced to the same
confession.</p>
            <p>Giue me yet leaue to insist in one thing; Nature hath
made man aboue all other creatures, the most sociable,
(as appeares) in that man cannot subsist without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
without lawes, without gouernment, and
the like; and yet in this one poynt of association, you
shall finde man, aboue all other creatures the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable:
hence it is, that hee must frame and square
out his life by art,<note place="margin">Morall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth mans fall.</note> morall Philosophie must guide and
direct him; for if yee looke into the soule, ye shall onely
finde one generall and obscure principle, which is this
in effect, <hi>quod tibi non vis fieri<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alterine feceris,</hi> doe not
that to another, which thou wouldest not haue done
to thy selfe; whereas all other creatures doe accompanie
together, without any teaching or precepts of arts, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by their owne naturall inclination. Thus then you
see, that the foundation of all arts and sciences seemes
to lay this for a ground-worke, <hi>the fall and corruption
of man;</hi> that notwithstanding his birth-right, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of his nature, the high prerogatiue of his state; yet
in most of his actions, you shall finde him much defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue,
farre inferior to the condition of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
cleane contrarie to the common course and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3385:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of nature, and therefore you cannot conceiue, but
that his corruption hath crept into nature since the first
institution thereof.</p>
            <p>Not onely the occasion and first grounds of all sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and arts doe testifie mans fall, but likewise many
particular opinions doe poynt out this truth (whereof I
will forbeare to speake); assuredly they had an implicite
knowledge concealed as a misterie,<note place="margin">The complaint of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers against nature.</note> though not openly
knowne in expresse tearmes: for otherwise you should
neuer heare such complaints and accusations made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
nature; that she was a step-mother, and rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the destruction of man, then to commiserate
the poore wretched estate of man. You should neuer
haue seene them so much abhorre the actions of nature,
as it were ashamed of their owne nature; for not onely
the faithfull and beleeuing men haue hated and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
their owne flesh, strugling and contending with
nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen here in her owne denne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> denying vnto
themselues all the pleasures and delights of this world;
but likewise Heathen, Pagans, Infidels, they haue beene
in some sort (as I may so say) very mortified men, and
God hath rewarded them accordingly: whether it
were for our example, the rather to stirre vs vp to the
like actions; or God louing the thing, hee did likewise
loue the shadow of it, and reward it with temporall
happinesse, which is the shadow of our true happinesse.
Thus it pleaseth God to require morall vertues with
morall blessings; the Midwiues of Egypt for sparing
the Israelites, they shall finde fauour, &amp;c. If some there
were who did delight in vncleannesse, and would denie
the corruption, then here acknowledge the corruption
of man, in this deniall of his corruption; that he is borne
in a prison, borne in darkenesse, that as yet he hath neuer
seene light, or tasted any true happinesse; and therefore
supposeth his owne slauish and base condition, to bee
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3385:218"/>
the height and scope of his birth-right: and surely God
for the punishment of mans curiositie, hath so fitly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
it, that the knowledge of nature should be fully
and exactly perfited by some higher knowledge (sacred
Theologie) which he himself would reueale.<note place="margin">The Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks are very imperfect.</note> As you see,
there is an order in arts, the principles of one are here
presupposed, yet confirmed by the strength of a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
art, which as a Lady or mistres directs the inferior;
for it cannot bee denied, but that of all other parts of
Philosophie, the Metaphysicks (wherein the fall of man
together with the institution of his nature, might fitly
haue been handled) are the most imperfect; in so much,
that in reading the Metaphysicks, we seeme to leese <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
in <hi>Aristotles</hi> owne workes; and since his time,
not any man (to my knowledge) was euer able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Metaphysicks, to the strict forme of a Science.</p>
            <p>From the theorie of Philosophie, let vs come to the
practicall part; it is not vnknowne to the Chimicks in
their distillations (whose office it is, <hi>secornere purum ab

in the vpper crust of things, <hi>in rerum superficie;</hi> the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
you diue into the substance of any creature, the
more you shall acknowledge the goodnesse and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the creature: as if they did discerne in nature,
that all things in their owne proper essence were good,
not onely as they are creatures, but as they are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for mans vse and seruice; in their owne roote, and
in their first ground of nature they are freed and priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
from all poyson and infection; only some after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
some ill husbandman came, who after the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the good wheate, did sowe his own cockle. Thus
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3385:218"/>
the euill in nature, could not together subsist with the
first ordination of nature: for proofe whereof you shall
obserue, that the first thing which euaporates, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by any meanes endure the triall of the fire, is that
poysonous matter, which flies at first sight, at the first
approach and encounter, as being guiltie to it selfe, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
in anothers nest, and therefore dares not iustifie
it selfe; desiring to auoide the pursuite and chase, and
to saue it selfe with his owne slight. And hence it is,
that all the preparation of our meate, not onely for the
rawnesse, but likewise for the poyson and infection, is to
be performed by the vse and ministerie of fire; as it were
prefiguring, that at the generall combustion of this
world, there should bee the purifying and cleansing of
all the elements, euery thing shall be refined, fire it selfe
shall be purged by fire, and nature shall bee restored to
her first perfection and integritie.</p>
            <p>Thus by the Chimicall operations it appeares, that
the euill and poyson of creatures hath polluted nature,
since the first institution thereof; now if you please to
compare these good and euill qualities together,<note place="margin">Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>istrie shewes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing of euill.</note> it will
be manifest, that the euill hath farre surpassed the good
by many degrees; and therefore doe vndoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that whole nature is corrupted, for in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
their best and purest substance hath onely a
limited goodnesse, and serues onely for some vse and
purposes; but for the drosse, or ill substance, they deeme
it wholy vnprofitable: and had it not beene a former
subiect, to vphold the better qualities; were it not, as a
stocke, reserued to fill vp some place and roome in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they would iudge it to be simplie euill. And thus
by their Chimicall workes they doe easily discerne that
this euill hath crept into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nature; and being once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and harboured in nature, this euill seemes in a large
measure, to ouerflowe and surpasse the better qualities
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3385:219"/>
of nature; yet here is our comfort, that as wee are able
by the force and violence of fire, to separate the drosse
from the good substance, so this euill which hath now
corrupted nature, is not of the essence of nature, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shall at length subsist, by vertue of Gods power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and quickening spirit, without this her malignitie.</p>
            <p>As the Philosophers afforded some proofes of this
fall, deriued from the reasonable soule, her faculties, and
all the workes of nature;<note place="margin">Proofes of the fall of Man borrowed from Poetrie.</note> so for the body and sense, I
will make bolde to borrow some arguments from the

of this corruption; a brasen serpent was appointed as a
meanes to cure their wounds, and they fell at length to
worship this Serpent; a Calfe was slaine in sacrifice to
pacifie God, and in token hereof, they set vp a golden
Calfe for idolatrie: now if this happened to the Iewes
(Gods chosen people), who had the custodie of the law,
together with a continued succession of Prophets; then
what might be thought of the Gentiles? let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
search among their Poets, what proofes and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
there are yet extant of mans fall and corruption.</p>
            <p>Certaine it is that they deriued their linage from the
Gods, and they generally held that the soule was <hi>diuinae
particulaaurae;</hi> and yet immediatly they forbeare not
to speake of the warres, which past betweene the gods
and the gyants, which well argues the opposition and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3385:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
defiance betweene the heauen and the earth; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the strange opposition betweene the flesh and
the spirit, wherein the flesh seemes to conquer and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish,
(hauing the stronger faction, and being more
powerfull ouer the will &amp; inclination of man),—<hi>video
meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor.</hi> And generally for
the whole state of man, it was the common complaint
of those times, that the world did daily degenerate,
<hi>Aetas parentum peior auis, tulit nos nequiores mox da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turos
progeniem vitiosiorem:</hi> when the Poets so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mention the golden age,<note place="margin">The golden age did signifie Paradise.</note> what doe they else, but
point out the state of mans first happinesse, integritie,
and innocencie? there they did conuerse with their
gods, for their gods did inhabit in groues, gardens, and
fountaines, as if man did then leese God, when hee left
the garden of Paradise; <hi>quorum nascuntur in hortis
numina,</hi> this is not to be vnderstoode of garlike or oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but whose gods are as ancient, as was their state in
the garden; then men were numbred among the gods,
to shew the conformitie of their wils, or as our diuines
holde, there should haue been no death in Paradise, but
some happie translation: then men liued free from the
sweate of their browes, <hi>contentique cibis nullo cogente
creat is;</hi> there was a sweete contentment and quietnesse
of minde, free from the disturbance of the bodie, the
fruites of the earth were not gotten with labour, nature
was not inforced, the creation did still seeme to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the production of creatures.</p>

their pleasures in the Elisian fields, and you shall

committed in the vniust vsurpation of some forbidden
fruite.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope by the light of our corrupted reason, it
hath already sufficiently appeared, not onely to vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to whom our vndoubted beleefe, which first wee
receiued by faith,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this third part.</note> might in processe of time seeme a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
knowledge, and so wholly possesse man, as if it
were imprinted in mans owne heart; but likewise to the
ancient Philosophers, who were without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true God, by the force of their owne
reason; as likewise to the ancient Poets, in their
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:3385:220"/>
fables and shadowes, hauing first receiued it by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that many things doe daily befall man, which
could not happen in the first integritie and institution
of his nature: and were they not inflicted on man, as
the iust punishments of sin, it could not stand with the
goodnesse and iustice of the Deitie, to impose them.
The consideration whereof may fitly informe vs, first,
of the state wherein we are fixed, a miserable and sinfull
state; and the hope of our happinesse whereunto euery
man should aspire, not to consist within the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>incts
of this earthly tabernacle; but to extend it selfe to a
more eminent state of a higher nature and condition:
secondly, reason discerning mans fall, it may serue as an
abatement to our pride, that we might not presume too
farre to prie into the high mysteries of Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
considering that corruption hath ouerwhelmed
the whole man, together with all his faculties both sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
and intellectuall; and therefore hee cannot raise
himselfe of himselfe, when as the ground-worke and
foundation which sustaines the whole building, is
wholly corrupted: thirdly, as the first fall of man gaue
way and occasion to the whole course of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
so reason discerning this fall, giues some testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
to our Christian faith, and as farre forth as shee
can, laies the foundation, prepares the way to religion;
that so the truth of nature might beare witnesse to the
truth of grace, the one supporting the other, the one
tending and ending in the other.</p>
            <p>Here I can do no lesse, then magnifie the wonderfull
prouidence and goodnesse of God: for as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a disease is the first degree to the cure;<note place="margin">How this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture serues to instruct vs.</note> so man
by his owne nature, seeing and discerning the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

this corruption, might take some dislike with himselfe;
seeke for some helpe, search for remedie and ease, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3385:221"/>
for the Physitian. Hee that opened our eyes to see
the corruption, certainely intended our cure: can wee
conceiue in reason that wee should bee thus left to our
selues, left destitute of all possible meanes to relieue vs?
that God in his mercy (hauing first made vs of nothing)
should, notwithstanding that mercy, suffer vs againe to
fall vnto nothing? it cannot be, it cannot be, here then
I will first conceiue hope, and rousing vp my spirits, I
will say with the Prophet, Ieremie 8. 22. <hi>Nonne est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina
in Gilead?</hi> Is there not balme at Gilead? Though I
am inwardly sicke at the heart (for all the faculties and
powers of my soule are corrupted); though I am out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
sore wounded (for all the actions of my bodie
are tainted); yet here is my comfort, there is balme in
Gilead, there is balme in Gilead, and balme hath this
propertie, that it may bee taken both inwardly as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
medicine to heale my maladies, and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it may bee poured into my wounds, as an excellent
salue, to cure my infirmities; here then I see there are
sufficient meanes for my recouerie, why should I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish?
But where at length shall I finde the Physitian?

which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall of Man, the
generall corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, how
creatures haue declined by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
since their first beginning,
and institution; but likewise to
proceed in such manner &amp; forme,<note place="margin">Why the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor adioyned this Corollary.</note>
as that my proofes might serue to inforce the naturall
man by the light of his owne reason, to confesse his
owne corruption. Now lest I might seeme to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or defectiue to my intended scope; lest I might
seeme to confound the fall of man, with the manner, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and accidencies of his fall and tentation;
therefore I thought fit to ioyne this present Corollarie
to the Treatise, making it to differ from the rest of the
parts: for here I must ingeniously and truly confesse;
though mans knowledge discerneth his fall, yet by the
same knowledge he cannot possibly conceiue the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his fall. For in Christian religion, such things as
belong to our knowledge, I will ranke in three seuerall
orders: First, some things there are wherein nature her
selfe may informe vs, <hi>viz.</hi> to condemne the corruption
of our owne flesh, to practise the Morall law, &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
some things there are, which though not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to reason at first sight, yet being supposed, and
examined by reason, they shal be found most probable,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:3385:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and most agreeable to the grounds of reason. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
some things are of a higher degree, much aboue the
reach or comprehension of reason, as are the secret and
hidden mysteries of faith; and heerein reason being
naturally taught to humble her selfe, shal acknowledge
her owne darknesse, and these things infinitly to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
her naturall power.</p>
            <p>To the second ranke and condition of things, I will
referre the manner of mans fall, which reason cannot
apprehend of her selfe, for it supposeth matter of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
and this wee receiue not by our owne discoursiue
reason, but only by report and tradition from others. In
this historicall narration of mans fall, we must conceiue
the free-will and election of God; which being no way
determinated,<note place="margin">Why by our reason we can not conceiue the manner of mans fall.</note> might impose lawes at his pleasure; then
the free consent of mans will, which according to
the circumstances, and present occasions, might incurre
the breach of those lawes; for punishment whereof, the
iustice of God might bee allaied and tempered with
mercie, according to Gods owne appointment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any certaine measure or rule. Thus many wayes
supposing the free-will, and election, both in the law-giuer,
and in the offender, in the inuisible God, and in
the visible creature; we can no more iudge of our selues,
or (as I may so say) prophecy of their forepassed actions,
then others can now probably gesse or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture at our
future contingent euents; for things which are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
in nature, reason cannot prescribe a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
course, for their limitation.</p>
            <p>As in generall for the whole scope and truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion, so in particular for this, and all other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
notwithstanding our ignorance,<note place="margin">How we may be assured of the manner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and wauering minde of man, may finde staiednes,
and be safely built vpon a sure rocke and foundation;
examining those grounds and assurances, which wee
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3385:223"/>
haue for our Christian faith, whereby the naturall and
distrustfull man, is fully resolued and perswaded by
signes, working of miracles, euents of prophecies, truth
of histories, succession of times, the immediate and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
prouidence of God, whereby his Church hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
been preserued, and all other sects and schismes
scattered and dissolued, and could neuer endure the
touch-stone; insomuch that I may well say with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi>
Act. 5. 39. <hi>If this truth be of God, then who can
resist it?</hi> Whereunto I will adde the generall consent
and verdict of the whole world, of Iewes, Gentiles,
Turkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. when as religion her selfe, makes but one
body of faith; the seuerall parts and mysteries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as they are directed to each other, so they serue to
strengthen each other. I shall not neede to bring mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to confirme euery point of our faith; much lesse
must wee expect miracles vpon all occasions,<note place="margin">How we must expect mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> for this
were to tempt and prouoke God; we must make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene laying the first foundations, and the
continuance of the building: the needle must first passe
thorow, that the thread may follow after, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there
is no further vse of the needle. Miracles must first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
faith, and lay the foundation; then must the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be perfected, by the practise of pietie and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if wee should continually expect miracles, then
faith should lose her reward, as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith, <hi>Fides
non habet meritum, cui humana ratio indies praebet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentum.</hi>
Doest thou still desire to be an eye-witnesse
of miracles, and yeeldest nothing to the report and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of others? heerein thou must condemne thine
own falsehood, when thou canst not require that others
should giue more credit to thee, then thou doest to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
though miracles haue failed, yet wonders are stil
extant; for a wonder it is to see thy infidelitie, as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Si quis adhuc prodigia (vt credat) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit,

            </p>
            <p>For the manner of mans fall, as I purpose to giue full
contentment to the naturall man, as farre foorth as it
lies in my power; so it shall appeare that nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is related by <hi>Moses,</hi> which might any way seeme
absurd or improbable; and in many things, I will vse the
same weapons of reason, which formerly I haue done;
that so by demonstratiue arguments, I might satisfie
the vnbeleeuing man. First for the vndoubted truth of
our creation, that the world was created of nothing,
which in effect is to proue that there is a God, &amp; a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
as euery thing in nature will necessarily inforce a
creation, so euery argument and proofe in mans braine,
will easily conuince this truth. I doe heartily wish, that
my tongue may cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I be found destitute of arguments in this kind; and
let my right hand forget her cunning, if I be not able in
euery creature to poynt out the footsteps of the Deitie.<note place="margin">Proofes of the Deitie and the creation.</note>
In this infinite number of arguments, I will onely make
choice of these foure, which I suppose to be inuincible,
to confirme this truth: First, if it seemes strange to mans
vnderstanding (which as it is a naturall vnderstanding,
so doth it onely respect the present course and order of
nature) that a thing should be the cause of his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hauing no beginning of existencie, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
his roote from eternitie. Then certainly in things
which are inconuenient, the least inconuenience is to
be admitted in reason: either euery thing in his owne
kinde, must be the cause and author of his owne being;
or onely one thing, which being infinite, and all suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in it selfe, must giue a nature and essence to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
existing creatures. Now as is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
many and one, so is the inconuenience lesse, and
therefore to be admitted in reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:3385:224"/>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reason in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable creatures.</note> things onely sensible seeme to worke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to reason: The birds in building their nests, in
making their prouision, against the hard season; the
wilde beasts in their dennes &amp; their caues, in the choice
of their foode, and in a subtiltie and craft for defence of
themselues; the stockes and the stones in desiring and
seeking their proper places, as being fittest for their
preseruation; and generally in the dumbe creatures
there is a naturall prouidence and instinct for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and gouernment of themselues: heere you see
the actions of reason, in vnreasonable creatures, which
therefore cannot proceed from themselues; neither are
these in themselues alone, but likewise in relation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Thus one thing seemes to bee ordained for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
euery facultie hath his seuerall obiect proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to it selfe; and in euery kinde there is a difference
of sexe, the one being fitted and referred to the other.
The Sunne is in continuall motion, yet not for his owne
vse, neither knowes hee the vse of his motion, being a
bare and a dumbe instrument, yet still he moues, for the
good of this inferiour world: and therfore these things
subsist not of themselues seuerally, but were thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
and appointed by some higher supereminent
and intellectiue Agent, who did foresee and ordain the
power of each other, and had the perfect knowledge of
both, that so the inuisible Deitie might appeare by the
visible creatures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, supposing that the world had no beginning,
but that all things were from eternitie;<note place="margin">Impossibilities in the worlds eternitie.</note> then must it
follow, that whereas the course of the Sunne containes
thirteene reuolutions of the Moone, yet the Sunne
should haue as often finisht his course, as the Moone
hath changed her countenance; for both should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
which indeed implies such a contradiction &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie
in nature, such as cannot be admitted. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3385:224"/>
in this inferiour world, supposing the eternitie,
no reason can be assigned of that difference, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in neighbour and bordering countries, lying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same climate; that one part should abound with
mines, more then another; or should be fitter to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
wilde and fierce beasts, more then another; the
temper and mould of the earth should be the same, the
properties the same, the qualities the same, as lying in
the same situation and distance from the heauens; and
yet notwithstanding there appeares a great diuersitie,
which wee cannot ascribe to any other subordinate
cause, but onely to the roote and first institution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that things were thus created different from the
beginning.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, euery thing giuing it selfe his owne being,
should consequently giue vnto it selfe the best being:
thus if the creatures should subsist of themselues, there
should bee no further comparison among themselues,
but all should be best; this comparison should not only
be abolished in respect of other creatures, but likewise
in respect of their owne parts, some parts should not be
inferiour to others, but all should be best. Againe, the
qualities of creatures must be all alike bounded: for if
you will suppose that any one should be infinite, then al
must bee infinite; if any one finite, then all must bee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
for they must goe together hand in hand by equal
paces, and carrie a iust proportion. As for example, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that a creature weake and faint in self,<note place="margin">Accidents which would follow the worlds eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> should haue
an infinite continuance, then certainly would it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
and get vnto it selfe, by infinite degrees, an infinit
strength, and all other qualities should likewise bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite:
but reason, and daily experience can testifie, that
euery creature is bounded in all other qualities, finite in
extension, finite in power, finite in goodnesse, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why not finite in continuance? though wee in the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3385:225"/>
shortnes of our own liues, cannot discerne the first and
last of the creatures. We see likewise, that they haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of parts, some more ignoble then others, they
cannot adde to their growth, nor helpe their owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections;
and in the creatures in generall, there is a
center, there is a circumference, there is a prioritie, and
posterioritie; and therefore the creatures cannot thus
subsist of themselues, nor cannot subsist from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>I know not how farre I may presume vpon mine own
weaknesse in all other things, but truly (I do perswade
my selfe) I could be infinite in this kinde of arguments;
after these reasons,<note place="margin">The creation of the world proued by an instance.</note> I will bring foorth one instance to
this purpose. True it is, that there are certaine places
here appoynted by nature, for the generation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of things: now if you shall finde any thing (as
many things there are out of their own proper wombs)
which you cannot conceiue, that the art and industrie
of man, could euer displace or transport; then assuredly
these things were thus created from the beginning: for
by the naturall course, euery thing should containe it
selfe within his owne naturall habitation and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Againe, certaine it is in mines, that where siluer
and gold haue anciently been found, in the same place
nature was neuer able to recouer her owne strength,
and to raise vp new mines, notwithstanding the same
disposition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, the same climate &amp; euery thing
alike: and therefore vndoubtedly these mettals were
not onely ingendred by a naturall course; but either the
mettals, or at least a fit seede to bring foorth these met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
was there created from the beginning: and this I
conceiue to be the reason, why the East countrie, which
was first inhabited, should be so much impouerished in
these daies.</p>
            <p>If we suppose this world to haue a beginning, that it
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3385:225"/>
should be made by blind chance, that creatures should
casually meete, and by good fortune fall into such an
excellent order, as now we see things are disposed; for
mine owne part, I doe not thinke this opinion deserues
the confutation. Supposing then the truth of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I will come to the truth of that creation which is
recorded by <hi>Moses;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The proofe of <hi>Moses</hi> his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and this shall appeare besides all
the miracles and wonders, wrought for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therof, by the iust time appointed for the creation,
and by the course and order obserued in the creation. If
I shall reduce all things to a generall deluge, it is the
same in effect, as if I should bring them to the first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the same author relates both, hee deserues a
like credit in both, signes were wrought in testimonie
of both, the same omnipotent power did equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in both. Now for the time, wee must come to the
concent of histories, if you please to remember the most
ancient and first languages,<note place="margin">The time of <hi>Moses</hi> his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as Hebrew, Chaldaike, &amp;c.
and how other tongues doe borrow some proprietie

and how vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multiplying of people, men were

               </gap>ke out forraine habitations; together
with the inuentions of all Arts and Sciences, which we
are able to point out, and their first authors; the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Cities, Townes, and such other monuments and
memorials, which seeme to serue for eternitie; the iust
computation of yeeres, and times; the first great battels
and warres betweene nations; the first Histories, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
and Poets which are extant, and such other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
accidents; you may vndoubtedly conclude,
that all these doe point out one and the same instant
time, which serues for the birth and natiuitie of this
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3385:226"/>
world; beyond whose circuit and comprehension, no
author, no monument, no memorie is extant; and to
this iust period of time, all Histories, sacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
doe together ioyntly conspire, and witnesse one
and the same truth of the creation, here described by
<hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are likewise reliques in nature, which may
seeme in some measure to point out the same time of
the creation; if yee consider the daily decay of nature,
and haue relation to the seuerall degrees of this decay,<note place="margin">An instance to proue the time of the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
you may in some sort gesse at the birth and beginning
of nature. Suppose wee were vpon the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
then thus I would argue; that mountaines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
were from the beginning, or at least from
the deluge, for since that time the face of the earth was
neuer changed or altered. Here I would make a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
search and inquisition for fountaines, and springs;
for so it pleaseth God to moysten the drie and high hils
with sweete waters. Now fountaines (I confesse) may
both begin and cease in one age; for as many things
may cause their production, so many things may stop or
hinder their passage; as immoderate drought, great
earthquakes, boysterous winds, trenches made by mans
labour, the growing vp of young springs, woods, and
the like: I would not therefore much insist in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
but thus I might conclude in reason, that from
the beginning, there hath bin alwaies the same fall and
descent of waters; then let vs conceiue what surrowes
and gutters the fall of waters hath made, and looking to
the difference which might happen in any one age, wee
cannot suppose, but that the world was created much
about that time, which is related by <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the time, I come to the manner of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Gods order in framing; wherein if I should
not impose my selfe silence, I thinke my whole life
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3385:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would hardly suffice to speake of this Subiect; for here
is <hi>seminarium Philosophiae,</hi> some things ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the honestie, credit, and truth of the reporter.
It is not vnknowne to those, who are acquainted with
the course of our Vniuersities, that before wee professe
Theologie,<note place="margin">Three vses of Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>losophie.</note> there is more then a prentiship spent in the
studie of humane arts and sciences; especially of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie,
for the vpshot and conclusion whereof, wee
propose vnto our selues these three seuerall vses: first, to
acknowledge the inuisible God, in the visible creatures;
to beholde the wisdome, goodnesse, and power of the
maker, in the framing and disposing of nature; the
workemanship giues testimonie of the workeman,
<hi>O all yee workes of the Lord, blesse yee the Lord, praise
him, and magnifie him for euer:</hi> Secondly, to consider
how God hath layed the foundations of nature to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the beautifull buildings of grace; wherein consists
the agreement, and wherein the opposition; how the
dumbe creatures (without change or alteration of
their naturall proprietie) are sanctified, and sometimes
made the meanes and conduit-pipes of grace, by Gods
owne institution, and the powerfull assistance of his
spirit: Thirdly, as we desire to confirme the groundes
and principles of Philosophie, by the rule and square of
Diuinitie: so wee examine all the seuerall miracles of
Scripture (which serue for the confirmation of our faith,
together with all the mysteries of our faith), by the
touchstone of our humane knowledge, to see how farre
they are transcendent aboue our naturall reason, and
<hi>therein to acknowledge the height, breadth, and deapth of
Gods vnsearchable wisdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon wee take occasion to examine this great
worke of our creation, by the rules and principles of
reason; wee doe not speake of the absolute power of
God, whereby all things were created of nothing; we
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3385:227"/>
doe not dispute of the absolute will of God,<note place="margin">The order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> who might
haue vsed many infinite meanes, and might haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
many infinite kindes and infinite degrees of
the creatures; but of the conformitie which creatures
had in the beginning, to the following and succeeding
course of their nature: as for example, that the heauens
and the earth should first seuerally be created; how the
confused elements were diuided; wherefore was light
first ordained, and in the fourth day the celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
appointed, and such like. Vpon due deliberation
and examination hereof, I dare confidently auouch,
that to the iudgement of an heathen man, who hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
knowledge of Philosophie, there could not possibly
be a more orderly and methodicall course obserued in
the creation (such as might well argue one and the
same wisdome, power, prouidence in the producing,
or birth, which now appeares in the continuance, and
preseruation of nature), then is here recorded by
<hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supposing the necessitie of a creation, there can bee
but one Creator, for all nature is directed to one end:
the World is circular, which best resembleth the figure
of one;<note place="margin">There can be but one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> all the streames are reduced to one head, all the
degrees of things still tend to the highest (there being
in nature a prioritie &amp; posteriority), euery gouernment
tends and ends in a Monarchie. Nature will not indure
many Competitors; order and decencie requires as
much in effect, all heate is reduced to one first heate, all
bodies to one first bodie. Philosophie beates vpon this
axiome, <hi>that nature desires to worke with the fewest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;</hi>
and therefore euery thing is to bee reduced
to the fewest principles: in the constitution of any
thing she requires but a couple, for the effecting of any
thing one will suffice; to admit of more would rather
hinder and distract the worke, then any way further or
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3385:227"/>
helpe the action. Thus to acknowledge one God, the
workemanship and fabricke of the whole world will
testifie as much in effect; wherein the footesteps and
impression of one and the same God, doe most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
appeare: all of them giuing sufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of one and the same wisdome and prouidence,
which appeares alike in all,<note place="margin">The same wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome appeares in all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> grounding all his workes,
and all his actions, vpon the same principles and rules
of his owne wisdome. There are not gods of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and gods of the vallies, gods of the Land, and
gods of the Ocean; for the fishes of the sea, the birds of
the ayre, the beasts of the fielde haue alike fashion and
forme for their outward feature, and a like inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and prouidence for their course and direction:
which similitude of nature must needes proceede from
the same grounds of wisdome, the voice and verdict of
nature will likewise testifie as much; which (being to
admit some infinite power, transcending reason, and
the course of all creatures), will therefore tie it selfe to
admit of the least inconuenience; rather of one, then of
a multitude.</p>
            <p>From the generall creation of all things, I come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man: that he was created in a more excellent manner,
then now he is, it shall not here neede any proofe; for
it was the principall intent and scope of my whole
speech. I will forbeare to speake of originall grace,
vntill I come to our sanctifying grace, which supplies
her want: I will passe ouer the degrees of his sinne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I come to the steps in his regeneration: I will not
open the wound, vntill I haue already prouided the
salue; and this I haue reserued for the third branch of
of my text. Here let vs consider the wisdome of God,
that hauing giuen an vndoubted token of his mercy in
the creation of man, imparting himselfe according to
the nature of goodnesse, <hi>calling those things which were
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3385:228"/>
not, as if they were,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The end of mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> inlightening their darkenesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>with
the infinite lampe of his owne light; it stoode with the
same wisdome to appoint a law, (since his glorie &amp; our
obedience, was the end and scope of our creation; for
himselfe being the chiefe and greatest good, all must be
directed to him; neither could hee bereaue himselfe of
that honour, no more then he could alter or change his
owne nature); and thorough the obseruance of that
lawe, either to multiplie and increase his owne mercies,
in a further confirmation of our blisse and happinesse;
or by the breach of that lawe, to giue vs some taste of
his iustice, yet so, that the miserie of our fall, might be
some further occasion, to manifest his goodnesse. And
to this end some things were adioyned, as necessarie
and essentiall to our nature, whereof God in his mercy,
and in the constancie of his owne will, would neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
vs; some things againe were added onely as gifts
and as ornaments, without which our nature might
subsist, and these we holde <hi>durante benè placito,</hi> during
his good pleasure and liking; that as our sinnes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
should require, wee might haue them enlarged or
diminished, or indeede might bee wholly depriued. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the condition of man is such, that being a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he could not be independent,<note place="margin">The condition of man.</note> as not in his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
so not in his continuance (for God cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this his owne royal prerogatiue); and being a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made of nothing, there still remained in this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a power to returne vnto nothing: being made a
reasonable creature, and hauing a spirituall soule, he
had likewise a libertie and freedome in his own choice,
either to stand or to fall. And thus the wisdome of the
maker, and the state of man, did require as much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that man might haue a mutable and changeable
condition: whereas all other creatures which were at
first determinated by God, as they are only carried by a
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3385:228"/>
naturall instinct, so in themselues they are of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
degree, directed for the vse and seruice of others,
and are therefore wholie vncapable of any further
blisse. Herein did appeare the rule of Gods mercie, lest
man in the pride and presumption of his owne heart,
might obiect against God, that he was created indeed,
but onely created for Gods seruice, and therein God
might seeme to intend onely his owne honour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath appointed all other creatures to serue
man, that so there might be some kinde of recompence
or restitution made vnto man,<note place="margin">Other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ordained for man, as man was for God.</note> while hee himselfe, with
his continuall prouidence and power, intends the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and preseruation of man; and that it might for
euer appeare, that the seruice of God is more honorable
to man, then was the first appoyntment of his state and
condition, for herein consisteth the height of mans
happinesse.</p>
            <p>Triall being thus made of mans obedience, before I
come to the sinne, I must first speake of the tentation:
the nature of man was innocent and incorrupt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods owne immediate workemanship,<note place="margin">There can be no God of Euill.</note> his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was great, his vnderstanding perfect and pure;
where then shall we finde the first roote, seede, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of this corruption? to make two different gods
of good &amp; of euill (with the Manichees), were to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
both, for who should set them at difference, or
who should appoint them their bounds and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Euill wants no positiue cause, being in it selfe a
meere defect and priuation, want of light causeth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp;c. or if you will suppose a fountaine of euill, then
it should suddainely dissolue it selfe, as consisting of
such contrarieties, which could neuer be reconciled: as
for example, while partialitie and oppression, should
striue to encounter each other in iudgement, and to
make themselues strong in their factions; falsehood
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3385:229"/>
and lying should interpose it selfe as an vmpire, or an
aduocate, and so cunningly corrupt and suborne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and euidencies on both sides, as neither of them
should attaine to their purposes, (loe here sinne doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
the kingdome of sinne, and cannot together
subsist with it selfe), now both of them failing, iustice
takes place. Whereas all the vertues are tyed together
in one golden chaine, <hi>idem volumus, idem nolumus,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from one fountaine, and not able seuerally to
subsist, directed to one end, supporting and vpholding
each other, to the vttermost of their power; Truth will
depose in the behalfe of a right; Iustice will stand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that right; Wisedome will guide and direct iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and send out her Commission to Strength, for the
due execution of her lawes; <hi>Ierusalem adificatur vt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>Man therefore being totally sanctified; inwardly in
the faculties of his soule, outwardly in the right rule of
his senses, and the gouernment of his flesh; being thus
sanctified in the wombe, sealed vp with originall grace,<note place="margin">Man though innocent, yet capable of euill.</note>
yet still hee had the freedome of his will, according to
the condition of his nature; the will being immateriall,
not chained vp with any naturall instinct, but such as
did follow the direction and information of his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
his vnderstanding likewise though sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect, yet had it a certaine measure and bounds in
her perfection, (as all things finite may well admit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
degrees). Thus all were created good; the will
had a libertie and free election, wherby making choice
of the better part, she might deserue at Gods hands her
further confirmation in bliffe; the vnderstanding ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
degrees, which are necessarily incident to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in generall, might in the humble submission of
her selfe, serue and please God, expecting a further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
by Gods holy grace, direction and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3385:229"/>
both will and vnderstanding were good in
themselues, yet capable of euill, and such as might bee
the occasion of our fall.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you see in man a power to stand, or to fall;
<hi>posse malum per velle bonum, cum vinceret Adam, posse
bonum per velle malum, sibi perdidit:</hi> There was onely a
capacitie in his minde, but for the inferiour nature of
his flesh,<note place="margin">That God might iustly suffer man to be tempted.</note> it was wholly sanctified; no ill fansie could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in his braine, no inordinate motion in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
his senses not dissolute, stragling and wandring;
only according to the condition of a creature, hee was
capable of a fall, capable of transgression: which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
was good in it selfe, the minde being not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
affected to both, but rather inclining to good,
especially Gods assisting grace, helping and furthering
the better part. And therefore it might well stand with
Gods decree, and the course of his iustice, to suffer man
to be tempted; tempted, I say, not by his owne flesh, or
that the inward parts should conspire against man, but
to be outwardly tempted, <hi>à longè,</hi> a farre off; for hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

are inclined, yet the pompe and pride of this world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures
man to sinne; and sometimes when nothing in
nature (I say nothing in corrupted nature) can moue,
yet an euil spirit, obseruing the soules actions, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
iudging of her disposition, considering the course
and inclination of humours, doth stir vp fit notions in
the fansie, and thereby perswades vs to sinne. As for
example, many there haue been, whom wee may well
remember with sorrow and griefe, as hauing been the
most accursed of all men, who haue offered violence to
themselues, and haue proued selfe-homicides: now let
vs search, where is the first roote of this tentation? not
in flesh and blood, for there in we finde no such inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
not in the pride and vanitie of this world, which
rather desires to retaine vs as slaues in her seruice, then
to manumit, or to set vs at libertie; not in whole nature,
which though neuer so much corrupted, yet she desires
life, and the preseruation of her selfe: and therefore this
tentation proceedes from some spirit, that is maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and opposite to nature, and intends nothing more
then the corruption of nature; which being not able to
effect in the whole, seekes to vndermine and supplant
each one in particular.</p>
            <p>Man being outwardly tempted, could not be the first
cause of sinne; by the streames then I will trace out the
fountaine; and heere I will make a diligent search for
that,<note place="margin">Where wee might finde the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of sinne.</note> which I could wish had neuer been found, I meane
the first roote and occasion of sinne, where sinne should
take the beginning; lower then the state of man I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
descend, for wherein there is no freedome of will,
(that creatures may in some sort be left to themselues),
there can bee no power or abilitie to sinne: and as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
cannot ascend higher, then are the heads of the
fountaines; so earthly contagions arising from dumbe
creatures, cannot deface Gods image. Now this is
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:3385:231"/>
strange, that I should looke vp, and aboue man for that,
which brings man downe, and beneath himselfe; yet
this I must doe, for thus sinne may alter and change our
condition. I haue alreadie proued that there could bee
no God of sinne, no God of euill, which is euident by
considering the properties of euill in it selfe: I must
therefore come to those creatures, which seeme to bee
placed in degree betweene God and man; and these are
the angelicall spirits, whom I do the rather accuse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that in man himselfe (though body and soule,
are both tainted with sin), yet the sinne it selfe seemes
first to proceede from the soule and spirit of man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more capable, and therefore more culpable: here
then I must blame and charge the created spirits to
haue been the first fountaines of euill, and first to haue
infected the world with corruption.</p>
            <p>Here wee must consider the different condition of
creatures, some bodies, some spirits, as euery thing is
compounded of matter and forme, and the forme it is
which giues the existencie, and indiuiduation: these
seuerall degrees of creatures make much for the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
perfection of nature; especially when as all bodies
seeme to bee contained and continued within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the first body: what should we thinke, is
aboue the conuexitie of the heauens? an infinite <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum?</hi>
rather acknowledge a want in mans vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
then that there should want inhabitants in such
an excellent region; where the heauens are their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stooles,
to tread and walke ouer our heads, where they
are freed from all annoyance of creatures, and partake
only of happinesse. As in great buildings, the meanest
and basest offices are alwaies beneath, (suppose the
Kitchin, the Seller, the Buttrie, the Pantrie); but for the
stately and magnificent roomes for entertainment (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the dining Chamber, the Galleries, the Turrets),
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:3385:232"/>
and places of pleasure, these are aboue: and thus it is
with vs in respect of the Angels, the truth and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
whereof I haue already proued in the first part. Now
supposing these spirits, their condition must bee alike
with ours, who are in some sort, and in the better part
spirituall: as they were made of nothing, so they must

did herein make them like vnto himselfe, as he was able
to create of nothing, so they might will, when as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should moue them to will; and hauing a limited
vnderstanding, which might admit error and darknes,
through their own pride, they might will nothing, that
is, they might will sinne; for sinne is a defect, a priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a kinde of nothing: in this their willing, although
they could not will themselues, to bee nothing, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their owne condition, for this were to vndoe that,
which God alreadie hath done; yet they could will, or
rather bewitch themselues, to bee worse then nothing,
for sinne is nothing, and to be the seruant of sinne, it is
to be worse then nothing. Thus in the Angels, as well
as in man, in regard of their limited goodnesse, and the
freedome of their willes, there was a power, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
(or rather a weakenesse and impotencie) to sinne,
and to fall.</p>
            <p>And many of them sinned accordingly, God in his
wisedome permitting the sinne, and thereby teaching
all creatures what they are in themselues:<note place="margin">The fall of the Angels.</note> for as in the
same kind of spirits, the best creatures are extant, so the
worst and most accursed should likewise be found, that
no creature might boast of an absolute perfection; that
euery one might know himselfe, and suspect his owne
fall, and that all our righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was a dislike of their present condition, and the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

hauing nothing of themselues, yet they must

that as the creation was a worke of Gods infinite
loue, and as God was existent euery where, according
to the infinite extent of his owne nature; so as an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
effect of that infinite loue, God should tye vnto
himselfe some creature, by an infinite band, namely by
an hypostaticall vnion; and therefore some of them did
claime and challenge this high prerogatiue aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, by vertue of their birth-right. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
did appeare their ignorance and pride, for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was not to aspire to the height and dignitie of the
Creator, but the Creator was to descend to the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and basenes of the creature; neither was God to bee
vnited to the angelicall nature (though otherwise high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in order and condition), but to descend lower, to
giue a more vndoubted token of that infinit loue, euen
to the humane nature and manhood. Mans nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the center in the middest of the circumference; a
little Microcosme, in whom all the creatures are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
things sensible partake in his body, the intelligent
spirits are combinde in his soule: and thus God taking
the nature of man, sits in the very middest of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
imparting himselfe infinitly to all, so farre foorth
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3385:233"/>
as it may well stand with the truth of his Godhead, and
with the state and condition of the creature.</p>
            <p>Thus they might mistake in iudgement, supposing
there might be some probabilitie to effect it: but I must
chiefly and principally condemne their vnthankfulnes,<note place="margin">The sinne of the Angels was vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</note>
their pride, their presumption, which gaue way and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to this their error: but hauing once committed
so great a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, such a foule indignitie against God,
it could not stand with his iustice freely to pardon their
sinne, or to intend the meanes of their redemption, as
in his mercie hee hath performed to man; for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were the first creatures, highest in dignitie and
condition; the great measure of their knowledge and
graces was such, as that we doe not reade that God did
euer appoint them lawes, but that it might bee suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that they of themselues should bee wholly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to God. Againe, they were not tempted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and therefore as the sinne could no way bee cast
vpon others; so being impotent of themselues to make
any recompence, they could no way receiue benefit
by the satisfaction of others: the state of the Angels
was created such, as that they were not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
they cannot change their mindes, or their
willes; whatsoeuer they see, they see in an instant, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they desire, their will is confinde to the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they cannot alter or change their desire; so
that, if once they shall make choice of the worser part,
in vaine may we expect, that euer they should returne
to the better.<note place="margin">Man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but the Angels can not.</note> Whereas the condition of man is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and changeable, as capable of sinne, so capable of
repentance; as hee falles of himselfe, so hee may rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the assistance of grace; for God hath giuen
him a discoursiue reason, proceeding by degrees; if
now hee mistakes himselfe, hereafter hee may bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informed. As the inconstancie of his nature may
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:3385:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cause the alteration of his will, so God fitly vsing this
his inconstancie (as it were working in euery thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that manner which is most proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to the thing), may make it a meanes for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
and conuersion of man; especially being
tempted by others, laying hold on Gods mercie, hee
might receiue the full satisfaction for his sinnes, by the
meanes and passion of another.</p>
            <p>I doe not heere purpose to speake of the creation of
Angels, their nature, their office, their blessings, their
cursings, I wil only speake of them so farre forth as they
concerne man. Supposing then that some of them fell,
and some of them stood, some reprobated and cast
into darkenesse, some sealed and confirmed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
most certaine it is, that all creatures in generall,
as they haue, what they haue, onely from God, so are
they tied to his seruice and ministerie: now in the good
Angels, God requires not onely the free oblation of
themselues,<note place="margin">The office and ministerie of Angels.</note> but likewise as they are vessels of mercie
in themselues, so they should be Gods instruments of
mercie to others; but in the euill Angels, as the power
of Gods iustice appeares in their reprobation, so hee
ordaines them, to bee the fire-brands of his iustice:
onely with this difference, God stirres vp the good
Angels, ioynes with them in the action, and giues them
the high dignitie to bee his fellow-workemen and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers;
but in the euill Angels, there is sometimes
onely a bare permission of God, sometimes a power
inforcing the execution of iustice; but alwaies a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
so to limit and bound the actions, that it might
appeare, that the iustice proceeds from God, the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
from themselues. Thus the execution of iustice,
the torturing of others, discouers their owne cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
their vncompassionate heart, their malice, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
against God and his creatures; and these are sinnes
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3385:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which must be punished againe in the instruments, and
therfore according to the rule of Gods iustice, these
euill spirits in tormenting others, themselues are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
tormented.</p>
            <p>This diuersitie of Angels, some good and some bad,
the generall consent of the whole world seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme;
which hath alwaies acknowledged, and put a
difference betweene <hi>bonus genius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The difference of good and bad Angels.</note> and <hi>malus genius.</hi>
But hearke, doe you not heare the Oracles speaking so
doubtfully; yea sometimes so maliciously, as may well
argue the truth of a spirit, though otherwise the spirit
of vntruth, falsehood, and wrong? If your hearing faile
you, then behold the strange delusions and strong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,
which from time to time haue been discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to all nations; whereof the naturall Philosopher can
assigne no reason, and therefore must vndoubtedly flye
to causes beyond the precincts of nature. If sight and
hearing faile, yet life cannot subsist without touch, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any sense of that certaintie: I pray' let vs
trie this truth by this touch-stone, let vs haue a feeling
of other mens miseries: some there are which are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with diuels, others bewitched: if any one doubt
of this truth, let him know that Scripture doth warrant
it, reason and experience confirmes it; how is it possible
that the body of man should be heauier, then if it did
only consist of pure lead? can the spirits be so dull, the
heate so allaied, and that onely by the ordinarie course
of nature? how should the minde presage euil to come,
without the helpe of some diuining spirit? how should
they speake languages, wherein they were neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed?
All natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the world can testifie this; all the
lawes in the world, whether amongst Iewes, Gentiles,
or Christians, doe witnesse it; daily experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
it: and for any man to embrace his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
and particular opinion, before the generall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3385:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
truth of the whole world, it is to play the pure Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus by the meditation of Gods iudgement, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by outward and more manifest signes and tokens,
appeares the truth and certaintie of these euill spirits.
Now for the tentation, I will first lay downe this for a
ground-worke; that as all bodies are contained within
the circumference of one first bodie; all the elements
adiacent and contiguous together, the fire it selfe next
and immediatly vnder the spheare of the Moone, (and
therefore this world carries a round figure, the forme of
a Globe, that all things might be better prest and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together): so it stood with the vnitie and identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of one &amp; the same God, that all his creatures should
be linckt and tyed together,<note place="margin">How all the creatures are knit together.</note> to betoken and point out
one workman. Thus he himselfe sitting aboue, and ins<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>finitly
transcending all creatures, the holy Angels as
they draw neerer and neerer his throne, so doe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
degrees in their order, and make one perfect Hie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rarchie.
The Angels are knit to this visible world, by
the mediation of man, who consists of spirit and flesh;
man here conuerseth with the dumbe creatures, takes
them for his foode, vseth them for his labour. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
all these creatures (as it is credibly supposed), in
the heart or center of the earth there is the place of Hel,
where the euill spirits are tormented, as in their owne
habitation and dwelling; God hauing excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he appointed a place best befitting their pride,
most remote, and in the furthest distance from himself;
to teach all the creatures, that notwithstanding their
naturall right and dignitie, yet it lies in his power to
cast them downe, to deiect them, and to make them the
basest in degree and condition. Here then you see all
the creatures knit together: now this order appeares,
not onely in place and precedencie, (as I may so say)
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:3385:235"/>
but likewise in the mutuall actions receiued from each
other.<note place="margin">Why God did suffer man to be tempted.</note> In the visible world it sufficiently appeares, for al
are directed to man; now in respect of the Angels, as it
hath pleased God to appoint the good Angels to bee
our guardians and protectors; so in his iustice, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the euill Angels, to bee the tempters and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of man; for thus it stoode with the wisdome of
God being dishonored by the Angels, to make a new
triall of mans obedience, whom he created in place of
the Angels (to accomplish the number of his elect), to
see whether man would grow wise by their fall; and for
default of mans strength, hee purposed to ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the quarell. Thus he suffers man to be tempted,
vntill in his due time, hee shall set a wall of separation
betweene both (by a definitiue sentence, or a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
past) for the setling and establishing of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Here you see a commission graunted, and a power
giuen vnto Satan to tempt man, and that in the time
of his innocencie, (for innocencie is best discouered by
the triall of tentation): thus Christ was likewise temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the wildernesse, but Satan had not such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power as was giuen him ouer Iob 1. 12. <hi>Loe, all
that he hath is in thine hand;</hi> or as it followes in the
next chapter, verse 6. where his commission is renewed
and enlarged, and power is giuen him ouer the bodie
and person of <hi>Iob, Loe hee is in thine hand, but saue his
life.</hi> Here rather, we may admire the wonderfull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, that had set such a separation betweene
man and the diuell, that they could not outwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
together,<note place="margin">The great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and the diuell.</note> as being creatures of a different kinde
and condition: the diuell could not immediatly seduce
his vnderstanding, delude his senses, stirre vp a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his flesh, for all things were sanctified, herein his
power was limited; he could not vse the ministerie and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:3385:235"/>
helpe of the most noble and best creatures, as being
sunke to the bottome vnder the degree of all creatures.
Thus being destitute of all meanes, which in probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
might well succeede, hauing no right or interest to
enter vpon mans body, or to stirre vp in mans fancie the
least tentation to sinne; yet hee could not forbeare to
tempt, out of his enuie to man, as being heire of that
happinesse, which at first did belong vnto him. Out of
the malice to God, man bearing Gods image, and God
taking a speciall care and charge ouer man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no marueile, if he first makes triall of those baser
wormes (as it were), giuing the first onset, the first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
vpon nature, making the first breach or entrance
into nature, to see whether by their meanes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing,
he might stirre vp and kindle commotion. Thus
as if hee were newly crept out of hell, here lately arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and durst not appeare in sight, but would dissemble
his comming, he makes choice of the Serpent, claimes
neighbourhood, kindred, acquaintance, and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(for both are the basest of all creatures, and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
inhabit the bowels of the earth); here they enter
a league,<note place="margin">The Diuel and the Serpent enter a league.</note> that if they could but cunningly seduce man,
and draw him within the compasse of high treason,
make him subiect to death by the breach of Gods law;
then they would begge his goods and his substance,
betweene them, they would share all his estate, the one
should take his body, the other his soule for a bootie.
Thus at length hee perswades the Serpent to be his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and factor, desiring to inuert and ouerthrow the
whole course of nature, when the basest creature shall
giue aduice and direction to the best, in the highest
point of religion; and that the Serpent should deceiue
the woman, the woman her husband, (the feete must
guide and direct the head), notwithstanding Gods
forewarning and threatning to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:3385:236"/>That this spirit should thus talke by the Serpent; doe
you not conceiue how pipes and musicall instruments,
doe yeeld a iust and fit found, being plaied vpon by the
hands of a curious Artsman?<note place="margin">That the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent should speake.</note> Doe not the wilde forrests
and woods yeeld a proportioned eccho, according to
the last clause of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sentence? Do not many birds speake
perfectly and distinctly many words very sensible and
significant, being taught by the art and industrie of
man? and shall we ascribe no more to the subtiltie of
Satan, who being a spirit, is apt to penetrate all bodies,
and well knowing the nature and vse of all instruments
and parts, can fitly begin the motion? Now if any thing
seemes strange in respect of our parents, you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that as things were then newly created, so their
experience could not be great; as their innocencie did
keepe them from attempting euill, so it kept them from
the least suspition of euill: the sin it selfe taking growth
by degrees, first the woman was tempted,<note place="margin">The degrees of this first sin.</note> who happily
might be ignorant of Gods commaund, for the precept
was not giuen vnto her. This woman tempteth her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
alas what might you ascribe to the loue of a wife?
she was not of his owne choice, but appointed by God
for his helper, and therefore marke his excuse: Gen. 3.
12. <hi>The woman which thou gauest me, gaue me the fruit:</hi>
he might haue supposed that both proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God:
whereas all other things were made onely for him, and
giuen onely to him, so that he alone had the full posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of al, (this one fruite only excepted), his wife now
bringing, and prouoking him to eate of this fruite, hee
might suppose it to bee part of his wiues portion; that
God had inlarged his commission, that now being a
couple, the vse of this fruite was likewise permitted. But
I cannot excuse <hi>Adam,</hi> for his wife was giuen as his
helper, and therefore the sinne is much greater, that she
should be a meanes to entice him in the breach of Gods
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3385:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
law: <hi>though man shall leaue his father and mother, and
cleaue to his wife; yet of any man hate not his wife and
children, yea and his owne life also, and come vnto God,
he shall not be accepted,</hi> Luke 14. 26. <hi>and he that shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake

then conceiue how these senselesse and dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
should haue such notions and phantasies, as to
giue some outward token; were it not that they are
guided and directed by some diuining and presaging
spirit?</p>
            <p>From the manner of his tentation, I come to the sin,
the tasting of the forbidden fruite. God gaue man the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:3385:237"/>
full possession of Paradise; all other fruites were giuen
for his foode,<note place="margin">The greatnes of <hi>Adams</hi> sin.</note> onely one is excluded, that it might serue
for his soules food, that man might be nourished, and
strengthened, by the keeping of Gods holy lawes and
Commandements. If it seemes strange, that God for so
small an offence, should condemne, not onely the first
man, but the whole stocke and posteritie of man; small
indeede it may seeme in mans eyes: but if you consider
those many blessings which God had imparted to
man, the happinesse wherein hee was created, the large
measure of his knowledge, insomuch that he could not
easily be deluded; the strict commaund of God only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
this one fruite, permitting the free vse of the
rest: these things well weighed, will vndoubtedly lay
open the sinne; for the smalnes of the thing, makes the
greatnesse of the offence. If you thinke that God in his
person, or in his attributes, may any way be endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
or suffer eclipse through mans sin, ye deceiue your
selues; for the whole world is but a point, &amp; carries no
sensible quantitie in respect of the heauens: all the mists
that proceede from the earth, cannot any way indarken
the Sunne, but are suddenly dissolued; it lies not in
mans power to obscure Gods glorie, which either will
drop downe in mercie, or breake foorth in iustice: and
therfore the greatest sinne in respect of Gods losse, may
well bee ranckt with the least, and the least with the
greatest; though otherwise not in respect of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
his anger, his punishment.</p>
            <p>But I pray', what sinne could <hi>Adam</hi> haue committed
at that time, greater then was the tasting of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruite? Couetousnesse or oppression could not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
him,<note place="margin">What sinnes <hi>Adam</hi> might then haue committed.</note> as hauing the whole world in possession; there

               </gap>tion, could
not admit of idolatrie: and yet (according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of those times) man was not wanting to his own
sinne; as farre foorth as hee could, he tempted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
God (there being but one precept) in the breach
of that one precept; if more had lien in his power, more
he had attempted in a higher degree: but here was the
mercie of God only to permit the least, for God deales
with man as parents doe with young children, first to
trie with the least, that so the first sinne might not at
first sight be vnpardonable.</p>
            <p>We must here conceiue that according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, who consists of body and soule, so there
was both inward &amp; outward corruption. In the mindes
of our parents there was a great disobedience in the
breach of Gods law; this disobedience proceeded from
a great natural pride, in so much, that as by the inticing,
so according to the example of the bad Angels, they
sinned against God in a very high point of his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue;
namely his wisedome, <hi>

himselfe as a Mediatour betweene God and man, and

come downe in our flesh, and be like vnto vs, whereas
we attempted to be like vnto him. He must breake the
veile of the Temple and Ceremonies, lay open the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecies

and subtiltie of a Serpentine generation.</p>
            <p>Now marke the conformitie of our mindes with our
forefathers, as the similitude of nature, so the similitude
of corruption: The first sinnes of the minde seeme to
be disobedience and pride,<note place="margin">Pride is the first sinne of the minde.</note> when we too highly esteem
of our selues, neglecting and contemning all others;
whereunto if you please to adde the naturall curiositie
of our mindes, here is the first step and degree to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
fall, a fall into all damnable errors and heresies.
And for our bodie, gluttonie seemes to bee the well-spring
of all our carnall and bodily sinnes: as a surfeit
is for the most part the beginning of all our diseases,
the most dangerous of all our diseases, and whereunto
man is most subiect and prone; it doth vndoubtedly
argue that the first sinne was the sinne of a surfeite and
gluttonie,<note place="margin">Gluttonie is the first of all carnall sinnes.</note> the tasting of forbidden fruite. Marueile
not, though our Diuines bee strict in preaching their
fasts, &amp; mortifications, for they desire to preuent sin in
the roote: open warre will not easily preuaile against
a State, vnlesse it bee diuided in it selfe with parts-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and factions: if the flesh be pliable and obedient
to the spirit, wee neede not feare any outward assaults
and tentations.</p>
            <p>If still the offence seeme little, then you may well
coniecture Gods wrath and indignation for sin, which
breakes into vengeance for so small an offence: if the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3385:238"/>
punishment seeme ouer large, in respect of the crime,
thou canst not truly iudge of the foulenesse of sinne,
which is not to be valued according to mans own esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but as it is an high presumption and contempt
of the basest worme against the infinite maiestie of the
diuine power; yet in truth the punishment seemes not
to be so dreadfull and horrid, as the case now stands,
betweene God and man, <hi>Thankes be to the mediator of
this couenant betweene God and man (that God and man
Christ Iesus):</hi> for now it serues rather as an occasion of
a further blisse and happinesse,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the occasion of our blisse.</note> then as a punishment for
sinne, <hi>Felix culpa quae talem habuit redemptorem.</hi> The
miseries of this life they are such, that if they be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with Gods grace, seasoned with the hope of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life to succeede, receiued with patience, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
with true humblenes of minde; I doubt not but
in them wee shall finde sufficient comfort and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in so much that wee may now safely triumph ouer
death it selfe, <hi>O death where is thy sting! O hell where is
thy victorie! the sting of death is sinne, and the strength
of sinne is the law: but thankes be vnto God, who hath
giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the sinne, as it was radically inherent in
<hi>Adam:</hi> now how the posteritie of <hi>Adam</hi> should be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the guilt of this sinne, together with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of propagating this sinne, I will speake briefly, and
so conclude. It may bee questioned, whether it might
stand with Gods iustice to condemne all,<note place="margin">How it stood with iustice to punish the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </note> all the whole
kinde, all the whole succession, the vnborne childe for
the sinnes of one? And for answere of this question, I
will extend my speech further, that if God, for no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
committed, should reprobate and torment all his
creatures, yet could it not be any iniustice in God: for
how shall the vessell say vnto the potter, why madest
thou me thus? This I speake, hauing relation to Gods
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3385:239"/>
infinite and vnlimited power: but as the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se now
stands, assuredly God neuer wrought in his creatures,
according to the rigour and extent of his iustice, for
the creation was a worke of mercie; heere all things
tooke their beginning from mercie; being thus crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Gods mercie doth ouerflow all his workes.</hi> Hence it is,
that mercie sometimes appeares without any taste of
iustice, as in the free distribution of Gods graces; but
iustice is alwaies seasoned with the spice of mercie, in
so much that in the paines of the damned, Gods mercie
still appeares: for hee could by many degrees increase
their tortures and torments, as their sinnes and deserts
doe iustly deserue; and notwithstanding their paine, yet
still they retaine an entitatiue perfection. Now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
this doubt, the father is punished, sometimes in
his sonnes, the shame of the one redounding to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
of the other; as you see it practised in our lawes,
where for the fathers offence, the whole stock is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
sometimes the sonnes doe share in the sinnes of
their parents,<note place="margin">The measure of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> as furtherers and abbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tors in his crime,
being then in his loynes, and part of his substance.
Thus it was with whole mankinde, in respect of <hi>Adam,</hi>
who was like a politike body, and did sustaine the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of vs all; and therefore as wee partake of his seede,
partake of his inheritance, so it might well stand with
iustice, that we should partake in his punishment. The
punishment being such, as hath been the occasion of a
farre greater blisse; such (I say) as rather includes a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of that originall grace, which God first impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to man, then any great inherent malignitie in our
nature, whereby God intends our destruction; and
therefore seemes to bee some inferiour degree of our
nature, that man descending, hee might ascend to a
higher pitch of his happinesse.</p>
            <p>How this sinne should be conueied to the post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ritie
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3385:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Adam,</hi> I finde it a very difficult controuersie, much
questioned by our Diuines; and the rather, because sin
in it selfe is originally and primarily in the soule,<note place="margin">How the sinne is conueied to the postcritie of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </note> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fountaine of all our actions, and therefore the
onely subiect capable of sinne. Now the Diuines, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Philosophers agree, that the soule is
immediatly created of God, and therefore being Gods
owne worke, and nothing but Gods, it cannot be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with sinne. Supposing this for a truth, my answere
is, that sinne ought not to be tyed to the seuerall parts,
to the soule, or to the body separatly; but to the parts
ioyntly together (that is) to the whole man, and to the
whole kinde, as wee are the sonnes of <hi>Adam;</hi> and then
in his loynes actiuely, in committing the sinne, so wee
are sinners; <hi>Quid quaeris</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine) latentem
rimam, cum habeas apertissimam ianuam, per vnum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem
peccatum in hunc mundum intrauit, &amp;c.</hi> Why
should we instance in the soule, as it is created of God?
Why should we stand vpon the body, as it consists of
the elements?<note place="margin">Sinne is in the whole man, not so properly in the parts.</note> But take this soule when it becomes the
forme of man, take this body when it becomes the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
and instrument of this forme, and then both are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
actions and qualities ought not to be ascribed
to parts, but to the compound, or subiect. Thus whole
man is become sinfull, the guilt remaines in the whole
nature, and the fruites of this sinne appeares in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
and opposition of parts; the immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of the flesh, the rebellion of the flesh against the
good motions of the spirit, serues for an vndoubted eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to proue the corruption.</p>
            <p>If it might be spoken without offence, I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discusse this one question; whether the soule bee
created, or otherwise doth issue foorth from the soules
of our parents, <hi>an sit ex traduce?</hi> It is a generall receiued
opinion, that the soule is immediatly created of God,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3385:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as being a spirit, and therefore admitting no feede; as
being an immortall spirit, and therefore free from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
growth, nourishment, or corruption. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> alone considering the descent of this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
sinne, seemes to doubt of the soules first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and originall; and therefore shrouding my selfe
vnder his protection, I may safely say, that it is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
that there should be a generation among
the soules of men,<note place="margin">There may be a generation among spirits.</note> notwithstanding their spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Did not God the Father beget his Sonne from
all eternitie, <hi>verbum in intellectu,</hi> a word in his owne
vnderstanding? Doth not the holy Spirit proceede
from the Father and the Sonne? and might not the
image of this Trinitie, appeare very liuely in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man? for <hi>Adam,</hi> God made his body of the
earth, and for his soule, <hi>Deus inspirauit, &amp;c.</hi> here was an

                  </gap>
               </hi> the rather to stirre vp
loue, and conformitie betweene both, that they might
be made one soule and one minde, as they were made
one flesh; here God ceased from his labours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee expect no longer creation. <hi>Abel</hi> being borne,
partakes of their flesh, and why not partakes of their
soule? for otherwise the sonnes of men, should not bee
so properly sonnes, nor tyed to those naturall duties to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards
their parents, as are the dumbe creatures obliged
to theirs. Thus that one spirit should beget another, it
is the highest mysterie of our Christian faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:3385:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>And it makes much for the absolute perfection in the
worlds diuersitie, for God is a spirit generating his
Sonne, and creating all creatures: the Angels are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
neither creating,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An anima sit ex traduce,</hi>
               </note> nor generating; but being once
created, subsist alone, and leaue no posteritie behinde
them, being all created at once, and hauing a state of
continuance in themselues; the soules of men are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and being subiect to change and alteration in their
state, may beget other soules, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, which is to be generatiue in his own kind.
And thus Christ not onely in regard of his flesh, which
he borrowes from the first elements, and hath his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
common with all the rest of the creatures; but more
especially, and principally in regard of his soule, hee is
the Sonne of man, descended from man; to this soule
the Deitie was first linckt and vnited, and in this soule
the hypostaticall vnion still continued, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his naturall death, and the separation of his soule
from his flesh: this soule did truly, locally and really
descend into hell; and here the prophecie was verified,
<hi>Semen mulieris conteret serpentis caput:</hi> The Sonne of
man hath conquered hell, and damnation, and lead cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
captiue; which I could wish might most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and literally be vnderstood. This soule (as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
separated soules) had in it selfe a naturall desire
and inclination to returne to the body, which well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
that they are both twinnes; and in the time of
their separation, the soules are still tyed to their naturall
duties: for <hi>Diues</hi> (after his death) could remember his
brethren, and yet they were not his brethren, were it
not that they did partake of the soules of their parents;
for otherwise all naturall consanguinitie and affinitie
should cease in a naturall death.</p>
            <p>It seemes very necessarie that the soule should bee
conuaied and diffused, <hi>vnacum semine,</hi> rather then that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:3385:241"/>
the body being already squared out, and the greatest
part of the workmanship past,<note place="margin">How the soule should toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke with the seede.</note> the soule should arriue
(like an vnexpected guest) to this harbour: and it
would greatly disparage man, first to be a plant, then a
beast, then a man; which indeede sauours much of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
his transmigration. God hath appointed the
seuerall kindes of creatures, but I cannot conceiue how
there should be such degrees in the kindes; the essence
and forme of a thing cannot be diuided within it selfe,
<hi>facultates animae non distinguuntur ab essentia animae.</hi> I
cannot possiblie imagine how vegetation and sense
should be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> embrion, before the accesse of the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
soule; for either they are the faculties of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
soule (and heere you make a diuision of that,
which indeede is inseparable), or else you must ioyne
those things together, which are of a different nature;
for if euer they were separated, then to compound
them, were to confound them: or lastly, being first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
they must still continue diuided, and so in the
vnitie of one person, cause the multiplicitie of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>As the Starres and the celestiall bodies, though pure,
spirituall, simple, and incorruptible; yet all of them
haue not in themselues their inbred and naturall light,
but doe receiue their light from the Sunne,<note place="margin">As in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodies, so in spirits.</note> which is the
fountaine of light; and this appeares by the eclipses,
the coniunction and opposition of starres, as likewise
by the order of the vniuerse, that all should be reduced
to one, a number to an vnitie. And as it is thus in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
and spirituall bodies and qualities, so why
not in spirituall soules? the reason is the same, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences
should bee alike in both: herein consists
a difference betweene things spirituall and things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
the one imparts it self without his owne losse,
the Sunne sends foorth infinite beames, inlightens the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3385:241"/>
whole world, yet loseth not part of his light; whereas
bodily substances, the more they ingender, the more
they detract from themselues.</p>
            <p>That generation should necessarily inforce a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
there is no colour of truth.<note place="margin">A thing may be generated, and yet not be corrupted.</note> God the Father did
beget his Sonne, and this Sonne is of equall perfection
with the Father: God created all things of nothing,
therefore shall all things returne againe vnto nothing?
This is a false consequence; for being once produced,
the same power shall vphold and continue them, which
laid their first foundation: euery thing containes in it
selfe a power, or rather an impotencie to returne vnto
nothing; and no creature in it selfe is independent, but
seeing it hath stood with Gods mercie first to produce
them, it cannot but stand with the goodnesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
of his will, still to continue them, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
his owne most excellent workmanship. So that
now all things relie not on the weaknesse of their own
foundation and pillars, but on the inuincible strength
of Gods power, the most certaine assurance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
the most infallible effects of his prouidence: so
that howsoeuer the production was, whether by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
generation,<note place="margin">It sufficeth that the soule was at first created.</note> alteration, &amp;c. yet we shall not neede
to doubt or feare the corruption. And whereas some
will suppose, that creation would make more for the
dignitie of the reasonable soule, let it suffice that at
first she was created, <hi>&amp; inspirauit, &amp;c.</hi> she had a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
beginning from the flesh or the body, she was not
brought foorth by vertue of any mixture, as the formes
of other creatures were, which being not able to subsist
of themselues, therefore both matter and forme were
created in one lumpe together; so that still creation
may not improperly bee ascribed to the reasonable
soule, in regard of her first birth and natiuitie.</p>
            <p>But the question is for the propagation of soules in
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3385:242"/>
these times, me thinkes I should like an opinion which
would reconcile both, that the soule should both bee
created and likewise traduced. For seeing there is an
action both of God and man, and both alike are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the generation of man; man in regard of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
birth generating a sonne according to nature;<note place="margin">The authors opinion is, that <hi>anima creatur ex traduce.</hi>

God concurring not onely as to a creature, but as to
him who might heereafter bee his sonne by adoption
and grace: therefore in respect of Gods action, there is
a creation which includes a beginning, different from
the ordinary course &amp; streame of nature; (for the soule
is beyond the precincts of nature) and likewise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all subiect matter, whereof it might consist; for
the soule is a spirituall substance, which without seede,
and without losse of her parts is propagated by some
extraordinarie power of God. To this creation man
may concurre, for <hi>Eue</hi> was created, though created of
part of mans body; the Angels may minister in a worke
of Gods infinite power, the soule though created, yet
she may bee created <hi>ex trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with God in the action, so in respect both of God and
of man there may be two different actions, as in many
things which proceede from our sinnes, yet God hath
his goodnesse therein. Thus both the opinions may
well together subsist,<note place="margin">The reasons which moue him.</note>

haue herein spoken, I haue onely spoken by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
referring my selfe wholly to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church; wherein if I haue sinned, or in
any other words which haue past from me vnaduisedly,
I doe here humbly desire God, to forgiue me the sinnes
of this pamphlet. Indeede I must confesse, I doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incline to this opinion, first for the authoritie of
S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom I doe reuerence aboue all others:
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:3385:242"/>
secondly, that with stronger chaines I might knit and
vnite the Godhead to our nature in the person of
Christ, than barely to clothe him with our flesh, which
is common to other creatures; when as his soule was
created, himselfe conceiued by the holy Ghost, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
borne of a Virgin: thirdly, to shew the certaintie of
Gods promises to the elect, and to their seede; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to manifest the dutie of children to parents, that
they owe vnto them more then their flesh, (for thus if a
man should giue me my foode, and my nourishment, he
might likewise bee said to giue me my flesh); whereas
Scripture affirmes, that a farre greater duty belongs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
parents, and therefore it should seeme it is for some
greater respect.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that I might more easily trace out the paths of
this originall sinne; how it is safely conuaied from the
parents to the children, laid vp in the soule as the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or rather the burthen thereof; and from the soule
how it is deriued together with life, into the flesh, the
bones, and the inward marrow of man; for the seede
partakes as the strength and vertue, so the faults and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of the whole man.<note place="margin">Sinne is like an infectious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</note> There are naturall and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie
diseases which seeme to bee intailed to one
stocke; there are many vices proper and peculiar to one
kindred: see you not how diuers nations doe differ
from others, as in their forme and their lineaments, so
likewise in colour and properties? Doth not one man
sicke of the plague infect the whole Citie, and is not
the same infection alwaies aptest to taint the same
blood: then why should it seeme strange, that the first
man corrupted with sinne, should taint his whole seed?
why should wee not suppose the poyson and malignitie
of sinne, to be of as great efficacie, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Thus (I hope) by the light of our naturall reason the
fall and corruption of man sufficiently appeares; which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3385:243"/>
I take to be the first principle and ground-worke of all
our Christian faith and religion, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith in
<hi>lib. 1. aduersus Iulianum, cap. 2. Alia sunt, in quibus

it is that man should first acknowledge his fall;
and seeing his owne fall, should therefore distrust in
himselfe, and in his owne naturall light; and from this
diffidence in himselfe, should desire to be instructed in
those waies which concerne his saluation. Hee that is
sicke, wants a Physitian, and if hee takes his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
nourishment, it will increase his disease: he that
is fallen and wallows in the mire, the more he struggles
and striues, the deeper hee sinkes. Let it suffice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen and corrupted in our selues, wee may rouse vp
our spirits, and looking to those few sparkes of reason,
which now lie raked vp in the dead embers of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wee may againe kindle and inflame them, at the
burning and shining lampe of our faith, setting before
our eyes <hi>that day-starre, which springing from an high

vs to life, the life to giue vs full contentment of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
who is the way, the truth, and the life, in whom wee
liue, wee moue, and haue our being, by whom, for whom,

            <p>GOod Reader, I must heere let thee vnderstand,
that the copie was not of mine owne writing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many things were defac't and omitted: and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
not in towne, I could not be alwaies present at the
Presse, so that I confesse many faults haue escaped; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the first sheetes, being begun in my absence, points
displaced, words mistaken, peeces of sentences omitted,
which doe much obscure the sense. As for example, pag.
69. lin. 6. these words are omitted, viz. <hi>For if the horse
knew his owne strength?</hi> then followes, <hi>but God deales
herein with other creatures, &amp;c.</hi> and many such like. I
was very sorrie, to see that, which was so meane in it selfe,
should be made worse: but presently I called to mind, that
the subiect of my booke, was onely to proue a generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
which corruption I should in effect seeme to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
and denie, vnlesse it might euery where appeare, and
therefore a necessitie did seeme so to ordaine it, that it
should first begin in the author, then in the pen, then in
the presse, and now I feare nothing so much as the euill
and corrupt exposition of the Reader, for thus there is a
generall corruption. How happie was I to make choice of
such a subiect, which seemes to excuse all the errors of my
Pamphlet? especially (good Reader) if I shall finde thy
louing and kinde acceptance, well hoping that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will be charitable to me, as I am most
charitable to al others, and so I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thee to the God of
charitie.</p>
