            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:23299:3"/>
And after longe deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had, your Honorable Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
came to my remembrance, a man muche more
woorthy then to whome ſo homely and rude a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be preſented. But when I againe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the ieſtinge and ſportfull matter of the booke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte
to be offred to any man of grauitie and wiſedome,
I was wholly determined to make no Epiſtle dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
at all: till as now of late, perſwaded thereunto by
my fréendes, I haue boldly enterpriſed to offer the
ſame to your Lordſhippe, who as I truſt will with no
leſſe good will accept the ſame, then if it did entreate of
ſome ſerious &amp; loftie matter, conſideryng that although
the matter therein ſéeme very light, and mery, yet the
effect thereof tendeth to a good and vertuous morall, as
in the followynge Epiſtle to the Reader may be cléerly
perceaued. For ſo hath all wryters in times paſte em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
their trauell and labours, that their poſteritie
might receaue ſome fruictfull profite by the ſame. And
therefore the <hi>Poetes</hi> feigned not their fables in vaine,
conſideringe that children in time of their firſt ſtudies,
are muche allured thereby to procéede to more graue
and déepe diſciplines, whereas otherwiſe their mindes
would quickly lothe the wiſe and prudent woorkes of
learned men, wherein in ſuche vnripe yéeres they take
no ſparke of delectation at all. And not onely that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
arriſeth to children by ſuche feigned fables, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the vertues of men are couertly thereby commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and their vices diſcommended and abhorred. For
by the fable of <hi>Actaeon,</hi> where it is feigned, that when he
ſawe <hi>Diana</hi> waſhinge her ſelfe in a well, he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb facs="tcp:23299:3"/>
turned into a <hi>Hart</hi> and ſo was ſlayne of his owne
<hi>Dogges:</hi> may be ment that when a man caſteth his eies,
on the vaine and ſoone vadynge beautie of the worlde,
conſentinge thereto in his minde, he ſeemeth to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a brute beaſt, and ſo to be ſlayne thorough the
inordinate deſire of his owne affectes. By <hi>Tantalus</hi>
that ſtandeth in the middeſt of the floode <hi>Eridan</hi> hauynge
before him a tree laden with pleaſant apples, he beyng
neuertheleſſe alwaies thurſty and hungry, betokeneth
the inſatiable deſire of couetous perſons. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Atreus, Thieſtes, Tereus</hi> and <hi>Progne</hi> ſignifieth the
wicked and abhominable factes wrought and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

proude and arrogant perſons that weeneth to clymbe
vp to the Heauens. By <hi>Mydas,</hi> who obteined of <hi>Bacchus</hi>
that all thinges whiche he touched mought be Golde,
is carped the foule ſinne of auarice. By <hi>Phaeton,</hi> that
vnſkilfully toke in hande to rule the <hi>Charriot</hi> of the
Sunne, are repreſented thoſe perſons whiche attempt
thinges paſſinge their power and capacitie. By <hi>Caſtor</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen that I had (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reader) ſlightly here &amp;
there runne ouer the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt
and delectable ieſtes
of Lucius Apuleius (a man
of auncient diſcent, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
with ſinguler lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge)
written in ſuche a
franke &amp; flouriſhing ſtile,
as he ſéemed to haue the
Muſes alwaies at will, to
féede and maineteine his penne: And when againe I
perceiued the matter to miniſter ſuch excéedinge plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of myrth, as neuer (in my iudgement) the like hath
bene ſhowed by any other, I purpoſed accordinge to
my ſclender knowledge (though it were rudely, and
farre diſagréeyng from the fine and excellent dooinges
now a dayes) to tranſlate the ſame into our vulgar
tongue, to the ende, that amongeſt ſo many ſage and
ſerious woorkes (as euery man welny, endeuor dayly
to encreaſe) there might be ſome freſhe and pleaſante
matter, to recreate the mindes of the Readers withal.
Howbeit I was efteſoones driuen from my purpoſe by
two cauſes: Firſt, perceiuinge that the Authour had
written his woorke in ſo darke and highe a ſtile, in ſo
ſtrange and abſurde woordes, and in ſuch newe inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
phraſes, as he ſéemed rather to ſet it foorth, to ſhow
his magnifency of proſe, then to participate his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
to other: Secondly, fearinge leſt the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this preſent booke (which ſéemeth a méere ieſt and
fable, and a woorke woorthy to be laughed at, by reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:23299:5"/>
of the vanitie of the Authour, mighte be contemned &amp;
deſpiſed of all men, and ſo conſequently, I to be had
in deriſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to occupy my ſelfe in ſuch friuolous and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
toyes: but on the other ſide, when I had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned the intent of the Author, and the purpoſe
why he inuented ſo ſportfull a ieſt: I was verely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that my ſmall trauell, ſhould not onely be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of many, but the matter it ſelfe allowed, &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of all. Wherfore I intend (God willinge) as nighe
as I can, to vtter and open the meaning thereof to the
ſimple and ignorant, whereby they may not take the
ſame, as a thing onely to ieſt and laugh at (for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of Eſope, &amp; the feigninge of Poetes, weare neuer
writen for that purpoſe) but by the pleaſauntnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
be rather induced to the knowledge of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eſtate, and therby tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſforme them ſelues into the
right and perfect ſhape of men. The argument of the
booke is: How Lucius Apuleius the Author him ſelfe,
traueled into Theſſaly (being a region in Grece, where
all the women for the moſt parte, be ſuch wonderfull
witches, that thei can tranſfourme men into the figure
of beaſtes) wheare after he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued a fewe daies,
by the mighty force of a violent confection, he was
chaunged into a miſerable Aſſe, and nothinge might
reduce him to his wonted ſhape, but the eatinge of a
Roſe, whiche after endura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of infinite ſorow, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
he obteined by praier. Verely vnder the wrappe of this
tranſformation, is taxed the life of mortall men, when
as we ſuffer our mindes ſo to be drowned in the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
luſtes of the fleſhe, and the beaſtly pleaſure therof:
(whiche aptly may be called, the violent confection of
witches) that we léeſe wholy the vſe of reaſon and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
(which proprely ſhould be in man) &amp; play the partes
<pb facs="tcp:23299:5"/>
of bruite and ſauage beaſtes. By like occaſion we reade
how diuers of the compaignions of Vliſſes, weare tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the meruelous power of Circe, into Swine.
And finde we not in the Scripture, that Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſer
the ninth King of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by reaſon of his great
dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and roialmes, fell into ſuch excéedyng pride,
that he was ſodenly tranſformed of almighty God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an horrible monſter, hauyng the head of an Oxe, the
féete of a Beare, and the taile of a Lion, and did eate
heye as a beaſt? But as Lucius Apuleius was chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into his humaine ſhape by a Roſe, the compaigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Vliſſes by great interceſſion, and Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſer
by the continuall prayers of Daniell, whereby
they knewe them ſelues, and liued after a good &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
life: So can we neuer be reſtored to the right fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of our ſelues, except we taſte and eate the ſwéete
Roſe of reaſon and vertue, which the rather by media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of prayer, we may aſſuredly attaine. Againe, may
not the meaning of this woorke, be altered &amp; turned in
this ſorte. A man deſirous to apply his minde to ſome
excellent art, or giuen to the ſtudie of any of the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
at the firſt appeareth to him ſelfe an Aſſe without
witte, without knowledge, &amp; not much vnlike a bruite
beaſt, till ſuch time as by muche paine and trauell, he
hath atchieued to the perfectnes of the ſame, &amp; taſtinge
the ſwéete floure and fruicte of his ſtudies, doth thinke
him ſelfe well brought to the right and very ſhape of a
man. Finally, the Metamorphoſie of L. Apuleius, may
be reſembled to youth without diſcretion, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
to age poſſeſſed with wiſedome and vertue.
Now ſince this booke of Lucius, is a figure of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life,
and toucheth the nature and manners of mortall men,
egginge them forward from their Aſinall fourme, to
<pb facs="tcp:23299:6"/>
their humaine and perfect ſhape, beſide the pleaſaunt &amp;
delectable ieſtes therein conteined, I truſt if my ſimple
tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be nothing accepted, yet the matter it ſelfe,
ſhalbe eſtéemed by ſuch, as not onely delight to pleaſe

Apuleius, briefly expreſſed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Vcius Apuleius African, an excellent
folower of Plato his ſect, borne in
Maudara, a countrey ſometime inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the Romaines, and vnder the
iuriſdiction of Syphar, ſituate, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
vpon the borders of Numidia &amp;
Getulia, whereby he calleth him ſelfe, halfe a Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and halfe a Getulian: And Sidonius named him
the Platonian Madaure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: his father called Theſeus,
had paſſed all offices of dignitie in his countrey, with
much honour: his mother named Saluia, was of ſuch
excellent vertue, that ſhe paſſed all the dames of her
time, borne of an auncient houſe, &amp; deſcended from the
noble Philoſopher Plutarche, &amp; Sextus his Nephew.
His wife called Pude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tila was endowed with as much
vertue and richeſſe as any woman might be. He him
ſelfe was of high &amp; comely ſtature, gray eied, his heare
yellow, &amp; a beawtifull perſonage: he floriſhed in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage
in the time of Iolianus Auitus, and Claudius
Maximus proco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſules, where he ſpent his youth in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the liberall ſciences, and much profited vnder his
maiſters there, whereby not without cauſe, he glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
calleth him ſelfe, the nourice of Carthage, &amp; the
Cleſtial Muſe and venerable miſtres of Affrick, ſone
after at Athenes (wheare in times paſt the well of all
doctrine flouriſhed) he taſted many of the cuppes of the
Muſes, he learned Poetry, Geometry, Muſike, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,
and the vniuerſall knowledge of Philoſophie,
and ſtudied not in vaine the nine Muſes, that is to ſay,
the nine noble &amp; roiall diſciplines. Immediatly after
<pb facs="tcp:23299:7"/>
he went to Rome, &amp; ſtudied there the Latine tongue,
with ſuch labour and continuall ſtudie, that he atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to great eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and was knowen and approued
to be excellently learned, whereby he might woorthily
be called <hi>Polyhiſtor,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to ſay, one that knoweth much
or many thinges. And beinge thus no leſſe endewed
with eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, than with ſingular learning, he wrote
many bookes for them that ſhould come after: Wherof
parte by negligence of times be intercepted, and parte
now extant, doo ſufficiently declare with how muche
wiſedome and doctrine he floriſhed, &amp; with how much
vertue he excelled emongſt the rude and barbarous
people. The like was Anacharſis emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the moſt luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhe

but ſuche as are now extant, are the fower
bookes named <hi>Floridorum,</hi> wherein is conteined a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhinge

delighteth, holdeth, and reioyſeth the Reader merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,
wherein you ſhall finde a great varietie of
thinges, as leapinge one from an other: One excellent
and copious oration conteininge all the grace and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the art Oratorie, whereby he cléereth him ſelfe
of the crime of art Magicke, which was ſclaunderouſly
obiected againſt him by his enuious aduerſaries, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is conteined ſuch force of eloquence and doctrine, as
he ſéemeth to paſſe and excell him ſelfe. There is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

conteined that which before was largely expreſſed: one
booke of Coſmographie, compriſinge many thinges of
Ariſtoteles Meteors: the Dialogue of Triſmegiſtus,
tranſlated by him out of Gréeke into Latine, ſo fine,
that it rather ſéemeth with more eloquence turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Latine, then it was before writen in Greke: but
principaly, theſe eleuen bookes of the Golden Aſſe, are
enriched with ſuch pleaſaunt matter, with ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
and variety of floriſhinge Tales, that nothing
may be more ſwéete and delectable, whereby woorthely
they may be intituled: The bookes of the Golden
Aſſe, for the paſſinge ſtile &amp; matter therein. For what

for that it is his nature, when he perceiueth the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

other woman) ſhe turned him into that kinde of ſhape.
Semblably ſhe chaunged one of her neighbours, being
an olde man and one that ſolde wine, into a frogge, in
that he was one of her occupation, and therefore ſhe
bare him grudge, and now the poore miſer ſwimminge

open, the lockes, boltes and poſtes fell downe, that you

by violence was turned vpſide downe, and I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
was ouerwhelmed and couered liyng in the fame.
Then perceaued I in my ſelfe, that certaine affectes of
the minde by nature doth chaunce contrarie. For as
teares oftentimes trickleth downe the chéekes of him
that ſeeth or heareth ſome ioyfull newes, ſo I being in
this fearfull perplexitie, could not forbeare laughinge,
to ſée how of Ariſtomenus I was made like vnto a

when I harde, I fell into a colde ſweate, and my harte
trembled with feare, in ſo much that the bed ouer me

carued, and made with pretious ſtones: Finally there
was all thinges that might be deſired, the Seruiters
waited orderly at the table in riche apparell, the pages
arrayed in ſilke robes did fill great gemmes, &amp; pearles
made in forme of cuppes with excellent wine, then one
brought in candelles and torches: and when we weare
ſette downe and placed in order, we began to talke, to
laugh and be merie. And Birrhena ſpake vnto me, and
ſaide: I pray you Coſin how like you our countrey?
Verely I thinke there is no other Citie which hath the
like Temples, Baynes, and other commodities as we
haue here: Further we haue aboundance of houſehold-ſtuffe,
we haue pleaſure, we haue eaſe, and when the
Romaine marchantes doo arriue in this Citie, they are
gentely and quietly entertained, and all that dwell
within this prouince (when they purpoſe to ſolace and
repoſe them ſelues) doo come to this Citie. Whereunto
I anſweared: Verely (ꝙ I) you tell truthe, for I can
finde no place in all the worlde, whiche I like better
then this, but I greatly feare, the blinde and incuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
trenches of Witchcrafte, for they ſay that the dead
bodies ar digged out of their graues, &amp; the bones of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Then an other ſittinge at the table ſpake and
ſaide, in faith you ſay true, neither yet doo they ſpare or
fauour the liuinge. For I know one not farre henſe
that was cruelly handled by them, who (being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with cuttinge of his noſe) did likewiſe cut of his
eares, whereat all the companie laughed hartely, and
looked vpon one that ſatte at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boordes ende, who being

would haue ryſen from the table, had not Birrhena
ſpake vnto him &amp; ſaide: I pray the fréende Telepheron
ſitte ſtill, and accordinge to thy accuſtomed curteſie,
declare vnto vs the loſſe of thy noſe and eares, to the
ende that my coſin Lucius may be delighted with the
pleaſauntnes of the tale: To whome he anſweared,
a dame you in the office of your bountie ſhall preuaile

This he ſpake very angerly, but Birrhena was
earneſt vpon him &amp; aſſured him that he ſhould haue no
wronge at no mans hande, whereby he was enforced
to declare the ſame: And ſo (lappinge vp the ende of the
table cloth and carpette together) he leaned with his
elbow thereon, and helde out the thrée forefingers of
his right hande in manner of an Oratour, and ſaide:

when I harde, I ſaid to one that paſſed by: what is here

Then anſweared he: holde your peace for you are

tell me the order of this cuſtodie and how it is:
Marry (ꝙ he) firſt you muſt watche all the night, with
your eies bent continuallie vpon the corpſe, neuer loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge

turne them ſelues into ſundry kinde of beaſtes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

what meanes and ſhiftes theſe wicked women doo

ſuch daungerous watchinge is no more then fower or

forgotten, if the keper of the dead bodie doo not render
(on the morninge following) the corps whole &amp; ſounde

That is: if the corpſe be diminiſhed or ſpoyled in any

and ſpoyled in the keper. Whiche when I harde
I toke a good harte and went vnto the crier, and bidde
<pb facs="tcp:23299:28"/>
him ceaſſe, for I would take the matter in hande, and
ſo I demaunded what I ſhould haue: Marry (ꝙ he) a

beholde I am a man made all of yron, and haue neuer
deſire to ſleape, and am more quicke of ſight then Lynx
or Argus. I had ſkarſe ſpoken theſe woordes, when
he toke me by the hande, and brought me to a certaine
houſe, the gate whereof was cloſed faſte, ſo that I
went thorough the wicket, then he brought me into a
chamber ſomewhat darke, and ſhowed me a matron
clothed in mourninge veſture and wepinge in lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

and ſée well to your office: haue no care (ꝙ I) ſo that
you will giue me any thinge aboue that which is dewe
to be giuen, wherewith ſhe was contented: And then
ſhe roſe and brought me into a chamber whereas the
corpſe lay couered with white ſhéetes, and ſhe called
ſeuen witneſſes, before whome ſhe ſhowed the dead
bodie, and euery parte and parcell thereof, and (with
wéepinge eies) deſired them all to teſtifie the matter,
whiche done ſhe ſaide theſe woordes of courſe as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe:
Beholde his noſe is whole, his eies ſalue, his

ſubſcribed with the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the witneſſes to confirme
the ſame: which done, I ſaid vnto the matron: Madame

I pray you that I may haue all thinges here neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
what is that? (ꝙ ſhe) marry ſaide I a great lampe
repleniſhed with oyle, pottes of wine, and water to
delaye the ſame, and ſome other drinke and deintie
diſhe that was lefte at ſupper, then ſhe ſhaked her
head, and ſaide: Away foole as thou arte, thinkeſt thou
to playe the glutton here, and to looke for deintie
meates, where ſo longe time hath not bene ſéene any
ſmoke at all? comeſt thou hither to eate, where we
ſhould wéepe and lament? and there withall ſhe turned
backe and commaunded her mayden Mirrhena to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
me a lampe with oyle, which when ſhe had done,
they cloſed the chamber doore and departed. Nowe
when I was alone I rubbed mine eies, and armed my
ſelfe to kéepe the corpſe, and to the intent I would not
ſleape, I beganne to ſinge, and ſo I paſſed the time till
it was midnight, when as beholde there crepte in a
Weaſell into the chamber, and ſhe came againſt me &amp;
put me in very great feare, in ſo muche that I marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
greatly of the audacitie of ſo little a beaſte. To
whome I ſaide, gette thée hence thou whore, and hie
thée to thy fellowes, leaſt thou féele my fingers? why
wilt not thou goe? Then incontinently ſhe ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and when ſhe was gonne, I fell on the grounde
ſo faſte a ſléepe, that Apollo him ſelfe could not diſcerne
whether of vs twoo was the dead corpſe, for I lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
as one without lyfe, and néeded a keper like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
At length the cockes beganne to crowe declaring
that it was daye, wherewithall I waked and (beynge
greatly affeard) ran vnto the dead bodie with the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe
in my hande, and I viewed him rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de about: And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
came in the Matron wéepinge with her wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
&amp; ranne vnto the corpſe &amp; eftſones kiſſinge him,
<pb facs="tcp:23299:29"/>
turned his body and found no parte diminiſhed: Then
ſhe commaunded one <hi>Philodeſpotus</hi> her ſtewarde to
pay me my wages foorthwith, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had done,
he ſaide: we thanke you gentle yonge man for your
paines, and verely for your diligence herein, we will
accompte you as one of the familie. Whereunto I (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
ioyeous of my vnhoped gaine, and ratlinge my

eſtéeme me as one of your ſeruitours, and if you
néede my ſeruice at any time I am at your commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I had not fully declared theſe woordes, when as
beholde all the ſeruauntes of the houſe were aſſembled
with weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to driue me away, one buffeted me about
the face, an other about the ſhoulders, ſome ſtroke me
in the ſides, ſome kicked me, and ſome tare my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and ſo I was handled emongeſt them and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from the houſe (as the proude yonge man Adonis
who was torne by a Bore). And when I was come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the next ſtreate, I muſed with my ſelfe and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
mine vnwiſe and vnaduiſed woordes which I had
ſpoken, whereby I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered that I had deſerued much
more puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and that I was woorthely beaten for
my follie: And by and by the corpſe came foorth, whiche
(becauſe it was the bodie of one of the chiefe of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
was carried in funerall pompe rounde aboute the
markette place, accordinge to the rite of the countrie
there. And foorthwith ſtepped out an olde man weping
and lamentinge and ranne vnto the biere and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, and with déepe ſighes &amp; ſobbes cried out in this
ſorte: O maiſters I pray you by the faith whiche you

weale publique, take pitie and mercie vpon this dead
corps, who is miſerablie murdred, and doo vengeaunce
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23299:29"/>
on this wicked and curſed woman his wife, whiche
hath committed this facte. For it is ſhe and no other,
that hath poyſoned her huſbande, my ſiſters ſonne, to
the intent to maintaine her whoredome and to get his
heritage. In this ſorte the olde man complained before
the face of all the people. Then they (aſtonied at theſe
ſayinges and becauſe the thing ſéemed to be true) cried
out, burne her, burne her, and thei ſought for ſtones to
throwe at her, and willed the boies in the ſtreate to doo
the ſame: but ſhe (wepinge in lamentable wiſe) did
ſweare by all the goddes that ſhe was not culpable of
this crime. No (ꝙ the olde man)? Beholde here is one
ſente by the prouidence of God to trie out the matter,
euen Zachlas an Egiptian, who is the moſt principall
Prophecier in all this countrie, and who was hired of
me for money to reduce the ſoule of this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Hell,
and to reuiue his bodie for the triall hereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
he brought foorth a certaine yonge man clothed
in linnen rayment, hauing on his féete a payre of pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toffles,
and his crowne ſhauen, who kiſſed his handes
and knées, ſaying: O Prieſt haue mercie, haue mercie,

by the vertue of the naturall Elementes, by

and toke a certaine hearbe, &amp; laide it thrée times vpon

Oraiſons vnto the Sunne, which cauſed all the people
to maruell greatly, &amp; to loke for this ſtraunge miracle
that ſhould happen: Then I preſſed in emongeſt them

miſterie, and beholde incontinently the dead bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to receaue ſpirite, his principall vaines did moue,
his life came againe and he helde vp his head, &amp; ſpake
in this ſorte. Why doo you call me backe againe to this
tranſitorie life, that haue already taſted of the water
of Leche, and likewiſe bene in the deadlie denne of
Stir? leaue of I pray, leaue of, and lette me lie in quiet
teſte: when theſe woordes were vttered by the dead
corpſe, the Prophete drewe nighe vnto the biere, and

&amp; that the wicked Witches &amp; enchantereſſes came into

or beguile his vigilant eies, they caſt him into ſo

without ſpirite or life. After this thei called me by
my name, &amp; did neuer ceaſe till as the colde members of

of more liuely ſoule, howbeit buried in ſleape, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he &amp;
I weare named by one name, and becauſe he knew not

appointed to be done to me. And that ſuch their ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
might not be perceaued, they made him a like payre
of eares and noſe of waxe, wherefore you may ſée that
the poore miſer for lucre of a litle money, ſuſtayned
loſſe of his membres. Whiche when he had ſaide, I
was greatly aſtonied, and (mindinge to proue whether
his woordes were true or no) put my hande to my noſe,
&amp; my noſe fell of, and put my hande to mine eares, and
mine eares fel of. Whereat al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people wondred great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

&amp; couered the loſſe of mine eares, with my longe heare,

Howbeit (beinge inſpired by diuine audacitie)

at length I ganne ſay:<note place="margin">The anſweare of Apuleius.</note> Verely I know that it is a hard

cauſe to doo that facte. For returninge ſomewhat
late from ſupper yeſternight (beinge well tippled with
wine, whiche I will not denie) and approchinge nighe
vnto my common lodginge, which was in the houſe of
one Milo a Citizen of this Citie, I fortuned to eſpie
thrée great Théeues attemptinge to breake downe his

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had remoued the doores out of the hookes, thei

euery parte of the houſe, &amp; ſuche as we finde a ſléepe
let vs ſlea, and ſuch likewiſe as reſiſt let vs kill, and ſo
by that meanes we ſhall eſcape without daunger. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely,
ye iudges, I confeſſe that I drew out my ſwoorde
againſt thoſe thrée citizens, but I thought that it was
the office &amp; duetie of one that heareth good will to this
weale publique ſo to doo, ſpecially ſince they put me in
great feare, and aſſayed to robbe and ſpoile mine hoſte
Milo. But when thoſe cruell and terrible men woulde
in no caſe ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne away, nor feare my naked ſwoorde, but
boldly reſiſt againſt me, I ranne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them and fought
valiantly. One of them which was the Capitaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23299:33"/>
me ſtrongly, and drewe me by the heare, with
both his handes, and beganne to beate me with a great
ſtone, but in the ende I proued the hardier man, and
threwe him downe at my féete and killed him. I toke
likewiſe the ſeconde that claſped about my legges and
bitte me, and ſlewe him alſo. And the thirde that came
running violently againſt me, after that I had ſtroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him vnder the ſtomake fell downe dead. Thus when I
had deliuered my ſelfe, the houſe, mine hoſte, &amp; all his
familie from this preſent daunger, I thought that I
ſhould not onely eſcape vnpuniſhed, but alſo haue ſome
great rewarde of the Citie for my paines. Moreouer I,
that haue alwaies béene cléere and vnſpotted of crime,
and that haue eſtéemed mine innocencie aboue all the
treaſure of the worlde, can finde no reaſonable cauſe
why vpon mine accuſation I ſhould be condemned to
die: ſince, Firſt I was moued to ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the théeues by
iuſt occaſion: Secondly, becauſe there is none that can
affirme, that there hath bene at any time either grudge
or hatred betwene vs: Thirdly, we were men mere
ſtraungers and of no acquaintance: Laſt of all, no man
can proue that I committed that facte for any lucre or
gaine. When I had ended my woordes in this ſort. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
I wéeped againe pitiouſly, and holdinge vp my

weale, and for the loue of my poore infantes and

I ſawe their hartes ſomewhat relented and moued by

that I was vngiltie of the crime, and ſo to their

And ſo when night came, before your retorne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
ſhe (to bringe her purpoſe to paſſe) wente vp to a
high gallery of her houſe, openyng to the Eaſt parte of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23299:37"/>
the worlde, and preparinge her ſelfe accordinge to her
accuſtomed practiſe, ſhe gathered together all her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
for fumigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſhe brought forth plates of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
carued with ſtraunge charecters, ſhe prepared the
bones of ſuch as were drowned by tempeſt in the ſeas,
ſhe made reddy the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of dead men, as their noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrilles
and fingers, She ſette out the lumpes of fleſh
of ſuche as weare hanged, the bloudde whiche ſhe had
reſerued of ſuch as weare ſlaine, and the iawe bones,
&amp; téeth of wilde beaſtes, then ſhe ſaid certaine charmes
ouer the heare, and dipped it in diuers waters, as in
well water, cowe milke, mountaine hony and other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
whiche when ſhe had done ſhe tied and lapped it
vp together, and with many perfumes and ſmelles
threw it into a whote fire to burne. Then by the great
force of this ſorcerie, and the violence of ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
thoſe bodies (whoſe heare was burnyng in the
fire) receaued humaine ſhape, and felte, hard, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
And (ſmellinge the ſent of their owne heare) came
and rappid at our doores in ſtéede of Boetius. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
beinge well tippled, &amp; deceaued by the obſcuritie of the

For this I knowe and plainely féele, that (whereas I

out of a certaine coffer ſondrie kinde of boxes, of the

And when ſhe had ſpoken priuilie with her ſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge

did burgen out, her noſe waxed croked and harde, her

O Fotis I praye the by thy ſwéete pappes, to make

to worke mine owne ſorrowe? Are you in that minde
that you will not tarry in Theſſalie? if you be a birde
where ſhal I ſeeke you? and when ſhal I ſee you? Then
anſweared I: God forbidde that I ſhould commit ſuch a

I haue recourſe to neſt with thee. And I ſweare by the

               <p>AFter that I had wel rubbed euery parte &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

neither feathers nor apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of feathers did burgen
out, but verely my heare did turne into ruggednes, &amp;
my tender ſkinne waxed tough and harde, my fingers

and out of mine arſe grewe a great taile, now my face
became monſtruous, my noſethrilles wide, my lippes
hanginge downe, and mine eares rugged with heare:
Neither could I ſée any comfort of my tranſformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for my membres encreaſed likewiſe, and ſo without all
helpe (viewyng euery parte of my poore bodie) I percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that I was no birde, but a plaine Aſſe. Then I
thought to blame Fotis, but beinge depriued aſwell of
language as humaine ſhape, I loked vpon her with my

<pb facs="tcp:23299:40"/>
eſpied me in ſuche ſorte) cried out alas poore wretche
that I am, I am vtterly caſte away. The feare that I
was in, &amp; my haſt hath beguiled me, but eſpecially the
miſtaking of the boxe hath deceaued me. But it forceth
not much, ſince as a ſooner medicine may be gotten for
this, then for any other thyng. For if thou couldeſt get
a Roſe and eate it, thou ſhouldeſt be deliuered from the

not continue an Aſſe one nightes ſpace, but in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
I will ſéeke ſome remedie. Thus Fotis lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in pitifull ſorte, but I that was now a perfect Aſſe,
and for Lucius a bruite beaſte, did yet retaine the ſenſe
and vnderſtandinge of a man. And did deuiſe a good
ſpace with my ſelfe, whether it were beſte for me to
teare this miſchieuous and wicked harlotte with my
mouth, or to kicke and kill her with my héeles. But a
better thought reduced me from ſo raſhe a purpoſe, for
I feared leaſt by the death of Fotis I ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of all remedie and helpe. Then ſhakinge my head
and diſſimuling mine yre, and takinge mine aduerſitie
in good parte, I went into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtable to mine owne-horſe,
where I found an other Aſſe of Miloes, ſomtime mine
hoſte, and I did verely thinke that mine owne horſe (it
there were any natural co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or knowledge in brute
beaſtes) would take pitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, &amp; proffer me lodging
for that night, but it chaunced farre otherwiſe: For ſee
my horſe &amp; the Aſſe, as it weare, conſented together to
worke my harme, &amp; fearing leaſt I ſhould eate vp their
prouender, would in no wiſe ſuffer me to come nighe
the manger, but kicked me with their héeles from their
meate, whiche I my ſelfe gaue them the night before:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23299:40"/>
Then I, beinge thus handled by them &amp; driuen away,
gotte me into a corner of the ſtable, where (while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
their vncourteſie, and how on the morrow I
ſhould returne to Lucius by the helpe of a Roſe, when
as I thought to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge my ſelfe of mine owne horſe) I
fortuned to eſpie in the middle of a pillor ſuſtainyng y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
rafters of the ſtable, the Image of the Goddeſſe Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,
whiche was garniſhed and decked rounde about
with faire freſh Roſes: then in hope of preſent remedie
I leaped vp with my fore féete as highe as I coulde,
and ſtretchinge out my necke, and with my lippes
coueted to ſnatche ſome Roſes. But in an euill howre
did I goe aboute that enterpryſe, for beholde, the boye
to whome I gaue charge of my horſe came preſently
in, and findinge me climinge vpon the pillor, ranne
freatinge towardes me, and ſaid: How longe ſhall we
ſuffer this vile Aſſe, that dothe not onely eate vp his
fellowes meate, but alſo would ſpoile the images of the
Goddes? why doo I not kill this lame théefe, and weake
wretche? &amp; therewithall lokinge about for ſome kidgel,
he eſpied where lay a faggot of woodde, &amp; chooſinge out
a crabbed trunchion of the biggeſt he could finde, did
neuer ceaſe beating of me poore wretch, vntil ſuch time
as by great noyes and rumbling, he harde the doores of
the houſe burſt open, and the neighbours crying in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
ſorte, whiche enforced him (being ſtroken in
feare) to flie his way. And by and by a troope of théeues
entred in, and kepte euery parte &amp; corner of the houſe
with weapons. And as men reſorted to ayde and helpe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which weare within the doores, the théeues reſiſted
&amp; kept them backe, for euery man was armed with his
ſwoorde and Targette in his hande, the glympſes
whereof did yelde out ſuch light as if it had bene daye.
<pb facs="tcp:23299:41"/>
Then they brake ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great cheſte with double lockes
and boltes, wherein was laide all the treaſure of Milo,
and ranſakt the ſame, which when they had done they
packed it vp, and gaue euery one a porcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to carry, but
when they had more then they could beare away, yet
weare they lothe to leaue any behinde, they came into
the ſtable, and toke vs twoo poore Aſſes, and my horſe,
and laded vs with greater truſſes then we weare able
to beare. And when we weare out of the houſe, they
followed vs with great ſtaues, and willed one of their
fellowes to tarry behinde, and bringe them tidinges
what was done concerninge the robbery, and ſo they
beate vs forwarde ouer great hilles out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> high way.
But I, what with my heauy burthen, and my longe
iourney did nothinge differ from a dead Aſſe, wherfore
I determined with my ſelfe to ſéeke ſome ciuill reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and by inuocation of the name of the Prince of the
countrie, to be deliuered from ſo many miſeries. And
on a time as I paſſed thorough a great faire, I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
a multitude of Gréekes, and I thought to call
vpon the renoumed name of the Emperour, &amp; to ſay:
O Ceſar, and I cried out aloude, O, but Ceſar I could
in no wiſe pronounce: the théeues little regardinge my
criynge did lay me on, and beate my wretched ſkinne
in ſuch ſorte, that after it was neither apte nor méete to
make ſiues or ſarces. How be it at laſte Iupiter mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterd
vnto me an vnhoped remedie. For when we had
paſſed thorough many townes &amp; villages, I fortuned
to eſpie a pleaſaunt garden, wherein, beſides many

eſpecially me, and brought vs foorth out of the

<pb facs="tcp:23299:43"/>
iourney, what with the longe way, my great burthen,
the beatinge of ſtaues, and my worne hoofes, I was ſo
weary that I could ſcantly goe: then I ſawe a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me a riuer, runninge with faire water, &amp; I ſaid to
my ſelfe: behold now I haue founde a good occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
I will fall downe when I come yender, and ſurely I
will not riſe againe, neither with ſcourginge nor bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge,
for I had rather be ſlaine there preſently, then
goe any further. And the cauſe why I determined ſo
to doo, was this, I thought that when the théeues did
ſée me ſo féeble and weake that I could not trauell, to
the intent they would not ſtay in their iourney, they
would take of the burthen from my backe, and put it
vpon my fellowes, and ſo for my further puniſhment
to leaue me as a praye to the Wolues and rauenous
beaſtes: but euill fortune preuented ſo good a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
For the other Aſſe, beinge of the ſame purpoſe
that I was of, by feigned and coloured werines, fell
downe firſt with all his burthen vpon the grounde as
though he weare dead, and he would not riſe neither
with beatinge nor prickinge, nor ſtande vpon his féete
though they pulled him vp by the taile, by his legges,
and by his eares, whiche when the théeues behElde, as
without al hope, they ſaid one to an other, what ſhould
we ſtande here ſo longe, about a dead, or rather a ſtony
Aſſe? let vs be gonne. And ſo thei toke his burthen, and
deuided ſome to me, and ſome to my horſe. And then
they drewe out their ſwoordes and cutte of his legges,
and threwe his bodie from the pointe of a hill downe
into a great valley: then I conſidering with my ſelfe of
the euill fortune of my poore compaignion, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
now to forgette al ſubtiltie and deceite, and to play

by their talke that we weare welny come home

we weare vnladen of our burthens, &amp; all thinges car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

whether I was an Aſſe in iudgement and ſenſe, or no.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there was an excéeding great hill compaſſed
about with bigge trées, very high, with many turning
bottomes, full of ſharpe ſtones whereby it was inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible:
there was many windinge and hollow valleis
enuironed with thickettes and thornes, and naturally
fortreſſed round about: Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the toppe of the hill ranne
a runninge riuer as cléere as ſiluer, and watred all the
valeis below, that it ſéemed like vnto a ſea encloſed, or
a ſtandinge floode: before the denne, where was no hill,
ſtoode a highe towre, &amp; at the foote thereof weare ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotes
fenced and watled with clay: Before the gate of
the houſe were pathes made in ſtéede of walles, in ſuch
ſorte that you would eaſely iudge it to be a very denne
for théeues, &amp; there was nothinge elſe ſaue a litle coate
couered with thatche, wherein the théeues did nightly
accuſtome to watch by order, as after I perceaued. And
when they were all crepte into the houſe, and we faſte
tied with halters at the doore, they began to chide with
an olde woman there, crooked with age, who had the
gouernment and rule of al the houſe, and ſaid: How is
it olde Witche, olde trotte and ſtrumpet, that thou ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
idely all day at home, and (hauinge no regarde to
our perillous labors) haſte prouided nothinge for our

ſuppers? but ſitteſt eating and ſwillinge thy ſelfe from
morning til night: Then the old woman trembled and
ſcantly able to ſpeake, gan ſay: Beholde my puiſant &amp;
faithful maiſters you ſhal haue meate &amp; potage inough
by and by. Here is firſt ſtore of bread, wine plentie, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in cleane rinſed pottes, likewiſe here is whote wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prepared to bathe you. Whiche when ſhe had ſaid,
they put of all their garmentes &amp; refreſhed them ſelues
by the fire. And after thei were waſhed &amp; nointed with
oyle, they ſatte downe at the table garniſhed with all
kinde of deinty meates: thei were no ſooner ſet downe,
but in came an other company of yonge men, more in
number then was before, who ſéemed likewiſe to be
théeues: For thei brought in their praies of Golde, and
Siluer, Plate, Iuelles, &amp; riche robes, &amp; when they had
likewiſe waſhed, they ſatte emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt and ſerued
one an other by ordre. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei dranke &amp; eate exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
criyng, laughing, &amp; making ſuch noyes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I thought
I was emongſt the tirannous &amp; wilde Lapithes, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,
&amp; Centaures. At length one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more valiant
then the reſt ſpake in this ſorte, we verely haue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered the houſe of Milo of Hypata, &amp; beſide all
the richeſſe, &amp; treaſure which by force we haue brought
away, we are all come home ſalue, and are encreaſed
the more by this horſe &amp; this Aſſe. But you that haue
roued about in the countrey of Beotia haue loſte your
valiant Capitaine Lamathus. Whoſe life I more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
then all this treaſure which you haue brought.
And therefore the memorie of him ſhalbe renoumed
for euer emongſt the moſte noble Kinges, and valiant
Capitaines, but you accuſtome when you goe abroade
like men with ganders hartes to créepe through eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
corner and hole for euery trifle. Then one of them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23299:44"/>
that came laſte anſweared: Why are you onely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that the greater the number is, the ſooner they
may robbe and ſpoyle the houſe? and although the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
be diſperſed in diuers lodginges, yet euery man
had rather to defende his owne life then to ſaue the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe
of his maiſter, but when there be but a fewe
théeues, then will they rather not onely regarde them
ſelues, but alſo their ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, how litle or great ſo euer
it be. And to the intent you may beléeue me I wil ſhow
you an example: we weare come nothinge nighe vnto
Thebes, where is the fountaine of our arte and ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
but we learned where a riche chuffe called Chryſeros
did dwell, who for feare of offices in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> publique weale,
diſſimuled his eſtate, and liued ſole and ſolitary in a
ſmall cote, how be it repleniſhed with aboundaunce of
treaſure, and wente dayly in ragged &amp; torne apparell.
Wherefore we deuiſed with our ſelues to goe to his
houſe and ſpoyle him of all his richeſſe. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> night
came, we drew towardes his doore which was ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloſed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we could neither moue it. nor lifte it out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
hookes, &amp; we thought it not beſt to breake it open, leaſt
by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> noyes we ſhould raiſe vp (to our harme) the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
bie. Then our ſtronge &amp; valiant Capitaine Lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus
truſtinge his owne ſtrength &amp; force, thruſt in his
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de through a hole of the doore, &amp; thought to pull backe
the bolte, but the couetous caytife Chryſeros beinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
&amp; making no noyes, came ſoftely to the doore and
caught his hande, &amp; with a great naile nailed it faſt to a
poſte, which when he had donne, he ranne vp to a high
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; called euery one of his neighbours by name,
deſiringe them to ſuccour him with all poſſible ſpéede,
for his houſe was a fire: Then euery one for feare of
their owne daunger came runninge out to ayde him,
<pb facs="tcp:23299:45"/>
wherewith we (fearinge our preſent perill) knewe not
what was beſt to be done, whether we ſhould leaue
our compaignion there, or yelde our ſelues to die with
him, but we by his conſent deuiſed a better way: For
we cut of his arme by the elbow, &amp; ſo let it hange there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then we bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his wound with cloutes, leaſt we ſhould
be traced by the droppes of bloud, which done we tooke
Lamathus and ledde him away for feare we ſhould be
taken, but when we weare ſo nighe purſued that we
weare in preſent daunger: And that Lamathus coulde
not kéepe our companie by reaſon of faintnes: and on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
other ſide perceauinge that it was not for his profite to
linger behinde, he ſpake vnto vs as a man of ſinguler
courage &amp; vertue, deſiringe vs by much entreatie and
prayer, and by the puiſance of the God Mars, and the
faith of our confederacie to deliuer his bodie from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; miſerable captiuitie: And further he ſaid, how
is it poſſible that ſo couragious a Capitaine can liue
without his hand? wherwith he could ſomtimes robbe
and ſlea ſo many people, I would thinke my ſelfe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
happy if I might be ſlaine by one of you: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſaw that we all refuſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte any ſuch facte, he
drewe out his ſwoorde with his other hande, and after
that he had often kiſſed it, he thruſt it cleane thorough
his bodie: Then we honored the corps of ſo puiſant a
man, and wrapped it in linnen clothes and threw him
into the ſea: ſo lieth our maſter Lamathus buried and
hidde in the graue of water, &amp; ended his life as I haue
declared: but Alcinus though he weare a man of great
enterpriſe, yet could he not beware by Lamathus, nor
volde him ſelfe from euil fortune: for on a day when he
had entred into an olde womans houſe to robbe her, he
went vp into a high cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, where he ſhould firſt haue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23299:45"/>
ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled her, but he had more regarde to throw downe
the bagges of money and Golde out at the window to
vs that ſtoode vnder: And when he was ſo gréedie that
he would leaue nothinge behinde, he went to the olde
womans bedde where ſhe lay a ſléepe, and would haue
taken of the couerlet to haue throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe likewiſe,
but ſhe awaked &amp; (knelyng vpon her knées) deſired him
in this manner: O ſir I pray you caſte not away ſuche
torne and ragged clouſes into my neighbours houſes,
for they are riche inough &amp; néede no ſuch thinges: then
Alcinus (thinking her woordes to be true) was brought
in beliefe that ſuch thinges as he had throwen out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and ſuch thinges as he ſhould throwe out after,
was not fallen downe to his fellowes, but into other
mens houſes, wherfore he went to the window to ſée,
and as he thought to beholde the places rounde about,
thruſtinge his bodie out of the window, the old woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
marked him well, &amp; came behinde him ſoftlie, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe had but ſmall ſtrength, yet with a ſodaine
force ſhe tooke him by the héeles &amp; thruſt him out head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe,
and ſo he fell vpon a meruelous great ſtone, and
burſt his ribbes, whereby he vomited and ſpued flakes
of bloud, and preſently died: Then we threw him into
the riuer likewiſe, as we had done Lamathus before:
When we had thus loſt twoo of our compaignions, we
liked not Thebes, but marched towardes the next Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
called Platea, where we founde a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great fame
named Demochares, that purpoſed to ſet foorth a great
game, where ſhould be a triall of al kinde of weapons:
he was come of a good houſe, meruelous riche, liberall,
and well deſerued that which he had, and had prepared
many ſhowes and pleaſures for the common people: in
ſo much that there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can either by witte or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb facs="tcp:23299:46"/>
ſhowe in woordes his woorthy preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For
firſt he had prouided all ſortes of armes, he greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in huntinge and chaſinge, he ordeyned great
towres and tables to moue hither and thither: he made
many places to chaſe and encounter in: he had ready a
great number of men and wilde beaſtes, and many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
perſons were brought from the iudgement
place to trie and fight with thoſe beaſtes, but emongſt
ſo great preparations of noble pryce, he beſtowed the
moſte parte of his patrimonie in biynge of Beares,
whiche he nouriſhed to his great coſte, and eſtéemed
more then all the other beaſtes, which eitheir by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge
he caught him ſelfe, or whiche he déerely bought,
or which were giuen him from diuers of his fréendes,
howbeit for al his ſumptuous coſte, he could not be frée
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the malitious eies of enuie: for ſome of them were
welnie dead, with too longe tiynge vp: ſome meigre
with the broyling heate of the Sunne: ſome la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guiſhed
with liynge, but all (hauinge ſundry diſeaſes) weare ſo
afflicted taht they died one after an other, and there
was welnie none lefte, in ſuch ſorte that you might ſée
them liyng in the ſtréetes piteouſly dead: And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people hauing no other meate to féede on, litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardinge
any curioſitie, would come foorth &amp; fill their
bellies with the fleaſh of the Beares. Then by and by
Babulus and I deuiſed a pretie ſporte, we drewe one
of the greateſt of the Beares to our lodging, as though
we would prepare to eate thereof, where we fleade of
his ſkinne, and kepte his vngles whole, but we medled
not with the head but cutte it of by the necke, and ſo
let it hange to the ſkinne: Then we raſed of the fleaſh

               <p>WHile the ſkinne was a driynge, we made me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and (feminge that he weare a Beare) ſhould be ledde to
Demochares houſe in the night, by whiche meanes
we thought to be receaued and lette in. Many were
deſirous to play the Beare, but eſpecially one Thraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon
of a couragious minde would take this enterpriſe
in hande. Then we put him into the Beares ſkinne,
whiche fitted him finely in euery pointe, we buckled it
faſt vnder his belly, &amp; couered the ſeame with the heare
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it might not be ſéene. After this, we made litle holes
thorough the Beares head, &amp; thorough his noſethrilles
and cies for Thraſileon to ſée out and take winde at, in
ſuch ſorte that he ſéemed a very liuely &amp; naturall beaſt:
when this was done, we went into a caue whiche we
hired for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpoſe, and he crepte in after like a Beare
with a good courage. Thus we began our ſubtiltie, and
then we imagined thus, we feigned letters as though
they come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on Nicanor whiche dwelled in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

our forged letters and preſented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Demochares.
When Demochares behelde this mightie Beare, and

his ſeruaunt to deliuer vnto vs tenne crownes, as

viewyng and priyng perceaue the truthe) ranne vpon
them to put them in feare, that thei durſt not come nie.
The people ſaid: verely Demochares is right happy, in
that, after the death of ſo many beaſtes, he hath gotten
(maugre fortunes head) ſo goodly a Beare, then Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chares
commaunded that with great care he ſhould be
put into the parke by, emongſt the other beaſtes, but I
immediatly ſpake vnto him, and ſaid: Sir I pray you
take héede how you put a beaſte tyred with the heate of
the Sunne, and with longe trauell emongſt others,
whiche (as I here ſay) haue diuers maladies &amp; diſeaſes:
let him rather lie in ſome ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place of your houſe nighe
to ſome water, where he may take ayre and eaſe him
ſelfe, for doo not you know that ſuche kinde of beaſtes
doo greatly delight ot couche vnder ſhadow of trées, &amp;
hillockes, nigh vnto pleaſant welles &amp; waters. Hereby
Demochares admoniſhed, and remembringe how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he had before that periſhed, was contented that we
ſhould put the Beare where we would: Moreouer we
ſaide vnto him, that we our ſelues wre determined to
lie all night nigh vnto the Beare, to looke vnto him, &amp;
to giue him meate and drinke at his due hower. Then
he anſweared: Verely maiſters you néede not to put
your ſelues to ſuch paines: for I haue men taht ſerueth
for nothinge but for that purpoſe: ſo we toke leaue of
him and departed, and when we weare come without
the gates of the towne, we perceaued before vs a great
Sepulchre ſtandinge out of the highe way, in a priuie
and ſecreate place. And thither we wente and opened
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23299:47"/>
the mouth thereof, whereas we founde the ſides coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the corruption of man, and the aſhes and duſt
of his longe buried bodie, wherein we gotte our ſelues
to bringe our purpoſe to paſſe, and (hauinge a reſpect to
the darke time of the night accordinge to our cuſtome)
when we thought that euery man was a ſléepe, we
went with our weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and beſieged the houſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mochares
round about: Then Thraſileon was reddy
at hande, and leaped out of the cauerne, and wente to
kill all ſuch as he founde a ſléepe, but when he came to
the porter he opened the gates and let vs all in: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſhowed vs a large counter, wherin he ſawe put (the
night before) a great aboundaunce of treaſure, whiche
when by violence we had broken open, I bidde euery
one of my fellowes take as much Golde and Siluer as
they could beare away, and carry it to the Sepulchre,
and ſtill as they caried, I ſtoode at the gate, watchinge
diligently when they would retorne. The Beare run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about the houſe to make ſuch of the familie affeard
as fortuned to wake and come out: For who is he that
is ſo puiſant and courageous, that at the vgly ſight of
ſo great a Monſter will not quaile and kéepe his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
eſpecially in the night, but when we had brought
this matter to ſo good a pointe, there chaunced a pitiful
caſe: For as I looked for my compaignions that ſhould
come from the Sepulchre, beholde there was a boye of
the houſe, that fortuned to looke out at a windowe and
eſpied the Beare ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning about, and he went and tolde
al the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the houſe, whereupon incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they came foorth with torches, lanthornes, and other
lightes that they might ſée all the yarde ouer, thei came
with clubbes, ſpeares, naked ſwoordes, greyhoundes
&amp; maſties to ſlea the poore beaſt: Then I (duringe this broile)
<pb facs="tcp:23299:48"/>
thought to runne away, but becauſe I would ſée
Thraſileon fightinge with the dogges, I lay behinde y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
gate to beholde him. And although I might perceaue
that he was welnie dead, yet remembred he his owne
faithfulnes and ours, and valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly reſiſted the gaping
and rauenous mouthes of the helhou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, ſo toke he in
grée the pageant which willingly he toke in hande him
ſelfe, and with much a doo tumbled at length out of the
houſe, but when he was at libertie abroade, yet coulde
he not ſaue him ſelfe, for all the dogges of the ſtreate
ioyned them ſelues to the greyhou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; maſties of the
houſe, and came vpon him: Alas what a pitifull ſight it
was, when our poor Thraſileon was thus enuironed &amp;
compassed with ſo many dogges, that tare &amp; rente him
miſerably, then I (impatient of ſo great his miſerie)
ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in emongſt the preaſe of the people, &amp; (ayding him
with my woordes as much as I might) exhorted them al
in this manner. O great &amp; extreame miſchaunce, what
a pretious and excellent beaſt haue we loſte: but my
woordes did nothinge preuaile. For there came out a
tale man with a ſpeare in his hande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truſt him cleane
thorough, and afterwardes many that ſtoode by, drewe
out their ſwoordes &amp; so they killed him. But verely our

receaued his death ſo patiently, that he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
the league betwene vs, either by criynge, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
or any other meanes, but (being torne with
dogges, &amp; wounded with weapons) did yelde foorth a
dolefull crie, more like vnto a beaſt then a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
his preſent fortune in good parte, with courage &amp;
glory inough did finiſh his life, with ſuch a terrour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the aſſembly, that no perſon was ſo hardy (vntill it

accuſtomed to doo, but the virgin would not aſſwage
her griefes nor mitigate her ſorrow by any entreatie

was accompaigned with his parentes, kinſefolke and

toke me out of my mothers armes, when none of the

Marriage diſtourbed, like the Mariage of Hyppodame
&amp; Perithous: but behold good Mother nowe my vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
fortune is renewed &amp; encreaſed: For I dreamed in
my ſléepe that I was pulled out of our houſe, out of our
chambre, and out of my bedde, and that I romed about
in ſolitary and vnknowen places, callinge vpon the
name of my vnfortunate huſbande, and how that he
(aſſone as he perceaued that I was taken away, euen

toke vp a ſtone that lay at his feete and threwe it

Then the old woman rendringe out like ſighes, began

               <p>When ſhe was come to the ſea, ſhe began to call the

Pſyches ſhould be brought to her appointed place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge

the ſolemnitie was ended, they went to bringe this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
ſpouſe, not to her marriage, but to her finall
ende and buriall. And while the father and mother of
Pſyches did goe forwarde, wepinge and criynge to doo
this enterpriſe, Pſyches ſpake vnto them in this ſorte:
why torment you your vnhappy age with continuall
dolor? why trouble you your ſpirites, which are more
rather mine then yours? why ſoyle ye your faces with
teares, whiche I ought to adoure and woorſhippe? why
teare you my eies in yours? why pull you your hoare
heares? why knocke you your breaſtes for me? now you
ſée the rewarde of my excellent beautie: now, now, you
perceaue (but too late) the plague of enuie. When the
people did honour me and call me new Venus, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
ſhould haue wept, then you ſhould haue ſorrowed, as
though I had béene then dead: For nowe I ſée, and
perceaue that I am come to this miſery by the onely
name of Venus, bring me, and (as fortune hath apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
place me on the toppe of the rocke, I greatly deſire
to ende my marriage, I greatly couette to ſée my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
why doo I delay? why ſhoulde I refuſe him that
is appointed to deſtroy all the worlde? Thus ended ſhe
her woordes, &amp; thruſt her ſelfe emongſt the people that
followed: Then thei brought her to the apointed rocke
of the highe hill, and ſet her thereon and ſo departed.
The torches and lightes were put out with the teares
of the people, and euery man gonne home: the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parentes welny conſumed with ſorrow, gaue them
ſelues to euerlaſtinge darkenes.</p>
               <p>Thus poore Pſyches being left alone wepyng and

that ſéemed to encounter with ſuch as entred in:
al thinges weare ſo curiouſly and finely wrought, that
it ſéemed either to be the worke of ſome demigod, or
God him ſelfe, the pauement was al of pretious ſtone,
deuided and cut one from an other, whereon was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
diuers kindes of pictures, in ſuch ſorte that bleſſed
and thriſe bleſſed weare they whiche might goe vpon
ſuch a pauement: Euery parte and angle of the houſe
was ſo well adorned, that by reaſon of the pretious
ſtones and ineſtimable treaſure there, it glittered and
ſhone in ſuch ſorte that the chambers, porches, &amp; dores
gaue light as it had bene the Sunne. Neyther other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:23299:54"/>
did the other treaſure of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> houſe diſagrée vnto ſo
great a maieſtie, that verely it ſéemed in euery point a
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly palaice fabricate &amp; builded for Iupiter him ſelf.</p>
               <p>Then Pſyches moued with delectation, approched
nighe, &amp; takinge a bolde harte entred into the houſe, &amp;
behelde euery thing there, with great affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe ſawe
ſtorehouſes wrought excéeding fine, &amp; repleniſhed with
abondance of richeſſe. Finally there could nothinge be
deuiſed which lacked there, but emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſuch great ſtore
of treaſure, this was more meruelous, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there was no
cloſure, bolte, or locke to kéepe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame. And when with
great pleaſure ſhe viewed al theſe thinges, ſhe harde a
voice without any body, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaide: Why doo you maruell
madame at ſo great richeſſe? behold al that you ſée is at
your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: wherfore, goe you into the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
&amp; repoſe your ſelfe vpon the bedde, &amp; deſire what bathe
you will haue, and we whoſe voices you here be your
ſeruauntes, and ready to miniſter vnto you accordinge
to your deſire: in the meane ſeaſon, royall meates and
deintie diſhes ſhalbe prepared for you.</p>
               <p>Then Pſyches perceaued the felicitie of diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
&amp; according to the aduertiſement of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
voices, ſhe firſt repoſed her ſelfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bedde, &amp;
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refreſhed her bodie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baines. This done ſhe ſaw
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> table garniſhed with meates, &amp; a chaire to ſit downe.</p>
               <p>When Pſyches was ſet downe, al ſortes of diuine
meates and wines weare brought in, not by any body
but as it weare with a winde, for ſhe coulde ſée no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
before her, but onely here voices on euery ſide. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that al the ſeruices weare brought to the table, one
came in and ſange inuiſibly, an other plaide on the
harpe, but ſhe ſawe no man: The harmony of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes
did ſo greatly ſhrill in her eares, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> (though
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23299:54"/>
there weare no manner of perſon) yet ſéemed ſhe in the
middeſt of a multitude of people.</p>
               <p>All theſe pleaſures finiſhed: when night approched
Pſyches went to bedde: &amp; when ſhe was laide, that the
ſwéete ſléepe came vpon her, ſhe greatly feared her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
becauſe ſhe was alone: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came her vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
huſbande and lay with her: and after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had made a
perfect conſummation of the Mariage, he roſe in the
morninge before day &amp; departed. Sone after came
her inuiſible ſeruantes, preſenting to her ſuch thinges
as were neceſſary for her defloration, and thus ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
foorth a great while: and (as it happeneth) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the thinges by continuall cuſtome did encreaſe
her pleaſure, but ſpecially the ſounde of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
was a comfort vnto her being alone.</p>
               <p>Duringe this time that Pſyches was in this place of
pleaſures, her father &amp; mother did nothinge but wéepe
and lament, and her twoo ſiſters hearinge of her moſte
miſerable fortune came with great dolor and ſorrowe
to comforte and ſpeake with their parentes.</p>
               <p>The night followinge Pſyches huſbande ſpake vnto
her (for ſhe might féele his eies, his handes &amp; his eares)
and ſaide, O my ſwéete ſpouſe and dere wife, fortune
doth menace vnto thée imminent perill and daunger,
whereof I wiſhe thée greatly to beware: For knowe
thou that thy ſiſters, thinkinge that thou arte dead, be
greatly troubled, and are come to the mountaine by
thy ſteppes, whoſe lamentations if thou fortune to
heare, beware that thou doo in no wiſe either make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare
or looke vp towardes them. For if thou doo thou
ſhalt purchaſe to me great ſorrow, &amp; to thy ſelfe vtter
deſtruction. Pſyches (hearinge her huſbande) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to doo all thinges as he commaunded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23299:55"/>
After that he was departed, &amp; the night paſſed away,
Pſyches lamented &amp; cried al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day folowyng, thinkyng
that now ſhe was paſt all hope of comfort in that ſhe
was cloſed within the walles of a priſon, depriued of
humaine conuerſation, and commaunded not to ayde
or aſſiſt her ſorowfull ſiſters, no nor once to ſée them:
Thus ſhe paſſed all the day in wepinge, and wente to
bedde at night without any refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of meate or baine.</p>
               <p>Incontinently after, came her huſbande, who (when
he had embraſed her ſwéetely) gan ſay: Is it thus that
you performe your promiſe my ſwéete wife? what doo
I finde here? paſſe you all the day and the night in we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge?
&amp; will you not ceaſe in your huſbandes armes?
Goe too, doo what you wil, purchaſe your owne deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
&amp; when you finde it ſo, then reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber my woordes,
and repent, but too late: Then ſhe deſired her huſbande
more and more, aſſuringe him that ſhe ſhould die, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he woulde graunt that ſhe might ſée her ſiſters,
whereby ſhe might ſpeake with them &amp; comfort them,
whereat at length he was contented, and moreouer he
willed that ſhe ſhould giue them as much Golde and
Iuelles as ſhe would, but he gaue her a further charge,
ſaying: beware that ye couet not (beinge moued by the
pernicious counſel of your ſiſters) to ſée the ſhape of my
perſon, leaſt by your curioſitie you be depriued of ſo
great and woorthy eſtate. Pſyches beinge gladde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

from you: for whoſoeuer you be, I loue and retaine
you within my harte, as if you weare mine owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
or Cupide him ſelfe: but I pray you graunt this

               <p>After longe ſearch made, the ſiſters of Pſyches came
vnto the hill where ſhe was ſet on the rocke, and cried
with a lowde voice, in ſuche ſorte that the ſtones an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared

her name, that their lamentable cries came vnto her

Come in (ꝙ Pſyches) into our houſe &amp; refreſh your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

twyfolde, crooked, not couragious in payinge my debt,
I am ſayne to rubbe, and mollifie his ſtonie fingers

that we ſhould be borne and blowen away? verely
I liue not nor am a woman, but I will depriue her of
all her bliſſe: And if you my ſiſter be ſo farre bente as
I, lette vs conſulte together, and not vtter our minde
to any perſon, no nor yet to our parentes, nor tell that
euer we ſawe her. For it ſuffiſeth that we haue ſéene
her, whome it repenteth to haue ſéene: neither lette vs
declare her good fortune to our Father, nor to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſince as they ſéeme not happy whoſe richeſſe are
vnknowen: So ſhall ſhe knowe, that ſhe hath ſiſters
(no abiectes) but more woorthier then ſhe. But now
lette vs goe home to our huſbandes and poore houſes,
and when we are better inſtructed lette vs returne to
ſuppreſſe her pryde: ſo this euill counſell pleaſed theſe
twoo euill women, and they hidde the treaſure whiche
Pſyches gaue them, and fare their heare, renewynge
their falſe and forged teares. When their father and
mother behelde them wéepe and lament ſtill, they
doubled their ſorrowes, and griefes, but full of yre
and farced with enuie they toke their voyage home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
deuiſinge the ſlaughter and deſtruction of their

               <p>In the meane ſeaſon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> huſband of Pſiches did warne
her againe in the night with theſe woordes: Séeſt thou

not (ꝙ he) what perill and daunger euill fortune doth
threaten vnto thée, whereof if thou take not good héede,
it will ſhortly come vpon thée: for the vnfaithfull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottes
doo greatly endeuour to ſet their ſnares to catch
thée, and their purpoſe is to make and perſwade thée to
beholde my face, which if thou once fortune to ſée (as I
haue often tolde) thou ſhalt ſée no more: wherefore if
theſe naughty hegges, armed with wicked mindes, doo
chaunce to come againe (as I thinke no otherwiſe but
that they will) take héede that thou talke not with
them, but ſimply ſuffer them to ſpeake what they will,
howbeit if thou canſt not reſtraine thy ſelfe, beware
that thou haue no communication of thy huſbande, nor
anſweare a woorde if they fortune to queſtion of me, ſo
will we encreaſe our ſtocke, and this yonge and tender
childe, couched in this yonge and tender belly of thine,
(if thou conceale my ſecreates) ſhal be made an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
God, otherwiſe a mortall creature. Then Pſyches
was very gladde that ſhe ſhould bringe foorth a diuine
babe, and very ioyfull in that ſhe ſhould be honored as
a mother:<note place="margin">So vſeth yonge wiues to doo.</note> She reckened &amp; nombred carefully the daies
and monethes that paſſed, and being neuer with childe
before, did maruell greatly that in ſo ſmall a time her
belly ſhould ſwell ſo bigge.</p>
               <p>But thoſe peſtilent &amp; wicked furies, breathinge out
their ſerpentine poyſon, toke ſhippinge to bringe their
enterpriſe to paſſe. Then Pſyches was warned againe
by her huſbande in this ſorte: beholde the laſt day, the
extreme caſe, and the enemies of thy bloud, hath armed
them ſelues againſt vs, pitched their campes, ſet their
hoſte in a ray, &amp; are marchinge towardes vs, for now
thy twoo ſiſters haue drawen their ſwoordes, and are
ready to flea thée: O with what force are we aſſayled
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23299:57"/>
this day, O ſwéete Pſyches I pray thée to take pitie on
thy ſelfe, of me, and deliuer thy huſbande, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
within thy belly from ſo great daunger: And ſée
not, neither heare theſe curſed women, whiche are not
woorthy to be called thy ſiſters, for their great hatred,
and breache of ſiſterly amitie, for they will come (like
Sirens) to the mountaine, and yelde out their piteous
and lamentable cries: When Pſyches had harde theſe
woordes, ſhe ſighed ſorowfully, and ſaide: O déere huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
this longe time you haue had experience &amp; triall
of my faith, and boubt you not but that I will perſeuer
in the ſame, wherfore commaunde your winde Zephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
that he may doo, as he hath donne before, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that where you haue charged me, not to beholde
your venerable face, yet that I may comfort my ſelfe
with the ſight of my ſiſters. I pray you by theſe beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

with ioye, who is bounde and linked vnto you for

doo I regarde the night &amp; darknes thereof, for you are
my onely light. Her huſbande (beinge as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted
with theſe woordes, and compelled by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of her often embraſinge, wiping away her teares with
his heare) did yelde vnto his wife. And when morning
came departed as he accuſtomed to doo.</p>
               <p>Now her ſiſters arriued on lande, and neuer reſted
till they came to the rocke, without viſitinge of their
Father and mother, and leaped downe raſhly from the
hill them ſelues: Then Zephyrus accordinge to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
commaundement brought them downe (though it
<pb facs="tcp:23299:58"/>
were againſt his will) &amp; laide them in the valley with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any harme. By and by they went into the pallaice
to their ſiſter without leaue, &amp; when they had eftſones
embraſed their pray, and thanked her (with flatteringe
woordes) for the treaſure whiche ſhe gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei ſaid:
O déere ſiſter Pſyches, know you that you are now no
more a childe but a mother: O what great ioye beare
you vnto vs in your belly? what a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort wil it be vnto

infant nouriſhed emongſt ſo great plentie of treaſure?
that if he be like his parentes, as it is neceſſarie he
ſhoulde, there is no doubte but a newe Cupide ſhalbe
borne: by this kinde of meanes they wente aboute to
winne Pſyches by litle and litle, but becauſe they
were weary with trauell, they ſatte them downe in
chayres, and after that they had waſhed their bodies in
baynes, they wente into a parler, where all kinde of
meates were ready prepared, Pſyches commaunded
one to play with his Harpe, it was donne: Then, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
other ſange, other tuned their inſtrumentes,
but no perſon was ſéene, by whoſe ſwéete harmonie
and modulation, the ſiſters of Pſyches were greatly
delighted.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the wickednes of theſe curſed wemen was
nothing ſuppreſſed by the ſwéete noyes of theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,

and of what parentage: Then ſhe (hauinge forgotten,
by too much ſimplicitie, that, whiche ſhe had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of her huſband) inuented a new anſweare, &amp; ſaide
that her huſband was of a great prouince, a marchant,
and a man of a midle age, hauing his bearde enterſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with gray heares, which when ſhe had ſaid (becauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23299:58"/>
ſhe would haue no further talke) ſhe filled their lappes
full of Golde and Siluer, and bid Zephyrus to beare
them away.</p>
               <p>In their retorne homeward thei murmured with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues ſayinge, how ſay you ſiſter to ſo apparaunt a lie
of Pſyches? For firſt ſhe ſaid that her huſbande was a

and now ſhe ſaith that it is halfe graye with age, what

ſhall finde it no otherwiſe my ſiſter, but that eyther

               <p>After they were thus inflamed and had viſited their
parentes, they returned againe to the mountayne,
and by the ayde of the winde Zephirus were carried
downe into the valey, and after thei had ſtrained their

voyces, this ſeruile and daungerous pleaſure, and the
loue of the Serpent doo more delight thée: ſay not but
that we haue playde the partes of naturall ſiſters in
warninge thée. Then the poore &amp; ſimple miſer Pſyches
was moued with the feare of ſo dreadfull woordes, and
(being amaſed in her minde) did cleane forgette the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of her huſbande, &amp; her owne promiſes made
vnto him. And (throwyng her ſelfe headlonge into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
miſery) with a wane and ſallow countenance,
ſcantly vtteringe a thirde woorde, at length gan ſay in
this ſorte: O my moſt déere ſiſters I hartely tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke you
for your great kindenes towardes me, and I am now
verely perſwaded that they whiche haue enformed you
hereof, haue enformed you of nothinge but truth, for I
neuer ſawe the ſhape of my huſbande, neither know I
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he came, onely I here his voyce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night,
in ſo much that I haue an vncertaine huſbande, &amp; one
that loueth not the light of the day, whiche cauſeth me
to ſuſpect that he is a beaſt as you affirme, moreouer I
doo greatly feare to ſée him, for he doth menace and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23299:59"/>
threaten great euill vnto me, if I ſhould goe about to
ſpie, and beholde his ſhape, wherfore my louing ſiſters
if you haue any holeſome remedy for your ſiſter in
daunger, giue it now preſently: Then they openinge
the gates of their ſubtill mindes, did put away all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
gile, &amp; egged her forward in her feareful thoughts,
perſwadinge her to doo as they would haue her, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one of them began and ſaid, becauſe that we litle
eſtéeme any perill or daunger to ſaue your life, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to ſhow you the beſt way and meane as we may
poſſibly doo: Take a ſharpe raſer and put it vnder the
pillow of your bedde, and ſée that you haue ready a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
burninge lampe with oyle, hidde vnder ſome parte
of the hanginge of the chamber, and (finely diſſimuling
the matter) when (accordinge to his cuſtome) he cometh
to bedde and ſléepeth ſoundly, ariſe you ſecreatly, and
with your bare féete goe and take your lampe, with the
raſer in your right hande, and with valiant force cutte
of the head of the poyſonous Serpent, wherin we will
ayde and aſſiſt you: and when by the death of him, you
ſhalbe made ſalue, we will marry you to ſome comely
man. After they had thus inflamed the harte of their
ſiſter, (fearing leaſt ſome daunger might happen vnto
them by reaſon of their euill counſell,) they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by the winde Zephyrus to the toppe of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and ſo they ranne away, and toke ſhippinge.</p>
               <p>When Pſyches was lefte alone (ſauing that ſhe ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
not to be alone, beinge ſtirred by ſo many furies)
ſhe was in a toſſinge minde, like the waues of the ſea,
and although her wil was obſtinate and reſiſted to put
in execution the counſell of her ſiſters, yet ſhe was in
doubtfull and diuers opinions touching her calamitie,
Sometime ſhe would, ſometime ſhe would not, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb facs="tcp:23299:60"/>
ſhe is bolde, ſometime ſhe feareth, ſometime ſhe
miſtruſteth, ſometime ſhe is moued, ſometime ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the beaſt, ſometime ſhe loueth her huſbande, but
at length the night came, when as ſhe made preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for her wicked intent.</p>
               <p>Sone after, her huſbande came, &amp; when he had kiſſed
and embraſed her, he fell a ſléepe: Then Pſyches (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
féeble in body and minde, yet moued by crueltie
of fate) receaued boldenes &amp; brought forth the lampe,
and toke the raſer, ſo by her audacitie ſhe chaunged her
kinde, but when ſhe toke the lampe and came to the
bedde ſide, ſhe ſawe the moſt méeke, and ſwéeteſt beaſt
of all beaſtes, euen fayre Cupide couched fayrely, at
whoſe ſighte the very lampe encreaſed his lighte for
ioye, and the raſer turned his edge. But when Pſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſawe ſo glorious a bodie, ſhe greatly feared, and
(amaſed in minde, with a pale countenaunce, all trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge)
fell on her knées, and thought to hide the raſer,
yea verely in her owne harte, whiche ſhe had vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
donne, had it not (through feare of ſo great an
enterpriſe) fallen out of her hande. And when ſhe
ſawe and behelde the beautie of his deuine visage, ſhe
was well recreated in her minde, ſhe ſawe his heares
of Golde, that yéelded out a ſwéete ſauour: his necke
more white then milke, his purple chéekes, his heare
hangynge comely behinde and before, the brightnes
whereof did darken the light of the lampe, his tender
plume feathers diſperſed vpon his ſhoulders like ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
flowers, and tremblinge hither and thither, and
his other partes of his bodie ſo ſmothe and ſofte that it
did not repent Venus to beare ſuche a childe: at the
beddes féete lay his bowe, quiuer, and arrowes, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23299:60"/>
did curiouſly behold, and merueling at the weapons of
her huſband toke one of the arrowes out of the quiuer,
and pricked her ſelfe withall, wherewith ſhe was ſo
grieuouſly wounded that the bloudde followed, and
thereby of her owne accorde ſhe added loue vpon loue,
then more and more broylinge in the loue of Cupide,
ſhe embraſed him and kiſſed him a thouſand times fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
the meaſure of his ſléepe: but alas, while ſhe was
in this great ioye, whether it were for enuie, or for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to touche this amiable bodie likewiſe, there fell out
a droppe of burning oyle from the lampe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right
ſhoulder of the God. O raſhe &amp; bolde lampe the vile mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery

that al louers might with more ioye paſſe the nightes

that promiſe and faith was broken he flied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without vtteraunce of any woorde from the eies &amp;

to catch him (as he was riſing) by the right thighe, and
helde him faſt as he flewe aboue in the ayre, vntill ſuch
time, that (conſtrayned by werines) ſhe lette goe and
fell downe vpon the grounde: but Cupide followed her
downe, and lighted vpon the toppe of a Cypreſſe trée,
and angerly ſpake vnto her in this manner: O ſimple
Pſiches conſider with thy ſelfe, how I (little regarding
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of my mother, who willed me that
thou ſhouldeſt be married to a man of baſe &amp; miſerable

wounded mine owne bodie with my proper weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to

               <p>Then Pſyches fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as ſhe might ſee her huſband, ſhe caſt her eies after him
into the ayre wepinge and lamentinge piteouſly, but
when he was gonne out of her ſight, ſhe threw her ſelf
into the nerte running riuer, for the great anguiſh and
dolor that ſhe was in, for the lacke of her huſband, how
be it the water would not ſuffer her to be drowned, but
toke pitie vpon her, in the honour of Cupide which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed

embraſinge and teachyng the Goddeſſe Canna to tune
her ſonges and pipes, by whome were féedinge the

Cupide, and winne him vnto you by your gentle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

               <p>After that Pſyches had gonne a litle way, ſhe fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of her comming. And ſo they mette together, and after
great embraſinge and ſalutation, the ſiſter of Pſyches
demaunded the cauſe of her trauell thither: Marry (ꝙ

and take ſuch thinges as thou diddeſt bringe: for I will
haue thy ſiſter (and named you) to my wife, &amp; ſhe ſhalbe

               <p>Pſyches had ſcantly finiſhed her tale, but her ſiſter
(perced with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pricke of carnall deſire &amp; wicked enuie)
ranne home, &amp; (feigninge to her huſbande that ſhe had
harde woorde of the death of her pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes) toke ſhipping
and came to the mountaine. And although there blewe
a contrary winde, yet beinge brought in a vaine hope
ſhe cried, O Cupide take me a more woorthy wife, and
thou Zephyrus beare downe thy miſtris, &amp; ſo ſhe caſte
<pb facs="tcp:23299:62"/>
her ſelfe downe hedlonge from the mountaine, but ſhe
fell not into the valley neither aliue nor dead, for al the
members &amp; partes of her bodie were torne emongſt the
rockes, whereby ſhe was made a pray vnto the birdes
and wilde beaſtes, as ſhe woorthely deſerued.</p>
               <p>Neither was the vengeaunce of the other delaide,
for Pſiches traueling in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey fortuned to come

tolde to her firſte ſiſter,<note place="margin">As euery vertue is rewarded, ſo euery vice is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſhed.</note> ſhe ranne likewiſe vnto the

(who ſpake euill of all the family of Venus) that her

diſcorde, &amp; debate. This the curious Gull did clatter in
the eares of Venus reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding her ſonne. But Venus
began to crie, and ſaid: what hath my ſonne gotten any
loue? I pray thée (gentle birde y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doeſt ſerue me ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully)
tel me what ſhe is, &amp; what is her name, that hath

To whome the birde anſweared. Madame I know not
what ſhe is, but this I know, that ſhe is called Pſiches.
Then Venus with indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cried out: what is it ſhe?
the vſurper of my beautie, the viccar of my name? what
did he thinke that I was a baude, by whoſe ſhowe he
fell acquainted with the mayde? And immediatly ſhe
departed, and went to her chamber, where ſhe founde
her ſonne wounded as it was tolde vnto her, whome
when ſhe behelde ſhe cried out in this ſorte.</p>
               <p>Is this an honeſt thinge? is this honorable to thy

For (beinge but of tender and vnripe yéeres) thou haſt

thou arte moſte woorthy and excellent, and that I am
not able by reaſon of mine age to haue an other ſonne,
which if I might haue, thou ſhouldeſt well vnderſtand
that I would beare a more woorthier then thou, but to

neither doeſt thou regarde thy valiant and inuincible
Father, and to anger me more thou arte amorous of

wherefore I aduiſe thée to departe henſe, and take it

               <p>Then Pſiches driuen away co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to her hope, was
double afflicted with ſorrow, and ſo ſhe returned backe
againe: and behold, ſhe perceaued a farre of in a valley
a Temple ſtanding within a foreſt, fayre and curiouſly
wrought, and mindinge to ouerpaſſe no place, whither
better hope did direct her, and to the intent ſhe would
deſire the pardon of euery God, ſhe approched nighe to

the praiers of Pſiches, appeared vnto her in al her roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie:
ſaying: Certes Pſiches I would gladly help thée,
but I am aſhamed to doo any thing contrary to the wil
of my daughter in lawe Venus, whom alwaies I haue

the daunger of the lawe intituled, <hi>De ſeruo corrupto,</hi>
Whereby I am forbidden to retaine any ſeruaunt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue

               <p>Then Pſiches caſt of likewiſe by Iuno, as without

whither ſhall I goe? In what caue or darkenes ſhall I
hide my ſelfe to auoide the furor of Venus? why doo I
not take a good harte, and offer my ſelfe with humilitie
vnto her whoſe anger I haue wrought, what doo I
know whether he (whome I ſéeke for) be in the houſe of
his mother or no? Thus beyng in doubte, poore Pſiches
prepared her ſelfe to her owne daunger, &amp; deuiſed how
ſhe might make her Orayſon and prayer vnto Venus.</p>
               <p>After that Venus was wery with ſearchinge by ſea

the heauens opened, &amp; receaued her ioyfully, the birdes

with a proude &amp; bolde petition demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the ſeruice of

with Mercurie, &amp; gaue him an earneſt charge to put in

did neuer enterpriſe to doo any thinge without thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
thou knoweſt alſo how longe I haue ſought for a

the rewarde to ſuche as take hir, ſée thou put in
execution my commanndement, and declare that what
ſo euer he be that retaineth her, wittingly, againſt my
will ſhall not defend him ſelfe by any meane or excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
whiche when ſhe had ſpoken, ſhe deliuered vnto
him a libell wherin was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined the name of Pſiches
and the reſide we of his publication, which done ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
away to hir lodginge. By and by, Mercurius
(not delaying y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter) proclaimed through out all the
worlde, that what ſo euer he were that coulde tell any
tidinges of a Kinges fugitiue daughter, the ſeruaunt
of Venus, named Pſiches, ſhould bring woorde to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,
and for rewarde of his paynes he ſhould receaue
ſeuen ſwéete coſſes of Venus. After that Mercury had
pronounced theſe thinges, euery man was inflamed
with deſire to ſearche out Pſiches.</p>
               <p>This proclamation was the cauſe that put away all
doubte from Pſiches, who was ſcantly come in ſight of
the houſe of Venus, but one of her ſeruauntes called
<pb facs="tcp:23299:66"/>
Cuſtome came out, who eſpiyng Pſiches, cried with a
loude voice, ſayinge: O wicked harlotte as thou arte,
now at length thou ſhalt know that thou haſte a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris
aboue thée, what doeſt thou make thy ſelfe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as though thou diddeſt not vnderſtand what tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
we haue taken in ſearchinge for thée, I am gladde
that thou arte come into my handes, thou arte now in
the goulfe of Hell, &amp; ſhalt abide the paine and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy great contumacie, and there withall ſhe
toke her by the heare, &amp; brought her in before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Venus.</p>
               <p>When Venus eſpied her, ſhe began to laugh, &amp; as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
perſons accuſtome to doo, ſhe ſhaked her head and
ſcratched her right eare, ſaiyng: O goddeſſe, Goddeſſe,
you are now come at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to viſit your mother, or els
to ſée your huſband, that is in daunger of death by your
meanes, be you aſſured I will handle you like a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where be my maydens Sorrow, and Sadnes? To
whome (when they came) ſhe deliuered Pſiches to be
cruelly tormented, then they fulfilled the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of their Miſteris, and after they had piteoufly ſcourged
her with whippes &amp; roddes, they preſented her againe
before Venus. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe began to laugh againe, ſaiyng:
Behold ſhe thinketh (that by reaſon of her great belly
which ſhe hath gotten by playing the hoore) to moue me
to pitie, and to make me a grandmother to her childe:
Am not I happy, that in the flouriſhinge time of all
mine age ſhalbe called a gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmother, and the ſonne of
a vile harlotte ſhalbe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted the Nephew of Venus?
How be it I am a foole to terme him by the name of a
ſonne, ſince as the marriage was made betwéene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall
perſons, in the fieldes, without witneſſes, &amp; not
by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of their parentes, wherfore the marriage
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23299:66"/>
is illegitimate, and the childe (that ſhalbe borne) a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarde,
if we fortune to ſuffer thée to liue ſo longe till
thou be deliuered.</p>
               <p>When Venus had ſpoken theſe woordes ſhe leaped
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of poore Pſiches, and (tearing her apparell)
toke her violently by the heare, &amp; daſhed her head vpon
the ground. Then ſhe tooke a great qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of wheate,
barley, will, popy ſéede, peaſon, lintels, and beanes,
and mingled them al together on a heape, ſaying: thou
euill fauored girle, thou ſéemeſt vnable to gette the
grace of thy louer, by no other meanes, but only by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
&amp; painefull ſeruice, wherfore I will proue what
thou cauſt doo, ſée that thou ſeperate all theſe graynes
one from an other, diſpoſinge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> orderly in their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and lette it be done before night. When ſhe had
appointed this taſke vnto Pſiches, ſhe departed to a
great banquette that was prepared that day.</p>
               <p>But Pſiches went not about to diſſeuer the graine
(as beinge a thinge impoſſible to be brought to paſſe by
reaſon it lay ſo confuſely ſcattered) but beinge aſtonied
at the cruel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of Venus, ſatte ſtill &amp; ſaide
nothing: Then the litle Piſmere the Emote, takings
pitie of her great difficultie &amp; labour, curſing the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the wyfe of Iupiter and of ſo euill a mother,
ranne aboute hither and thither, and called to her all
the Antes of the countrie, ſayinge: I pray you my
fréendes, ye quicke ſonnes of the grounde the mother
of al thinges, take mercie on this poore mayde eſpouſed
to Cupide, who is in great daunger of her perſon, I
pray you helpe her withall diligence. Inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently one
came after an other diſſeueryng &amp; deuiding the graine,
&amp; after that they had put eche kinde of corne in order,
they ranne away againe in all haſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23299:67"/>
When night came, Venus retourned home from
the banquet well tipled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyne, ſmelling of balme, &amp;
crowned with garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Roſes, who when ſhe eſpied
what Pſyches had done, gan ſay, this is not the labour
of thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, but rather of his that is amorous of thée,
then ſhe gaue her a morſell of browne bread, and went
to ſleape.</p>
               <p>In the meane ſeaſon Cupide was cloſed faſt in the
moſte ſureſt chamber of the houſe, partly becauſe he
ſhould not hurte him ſelfe with wanton dalliance, and
partly becauſe he ſhould not ſpeake with his loue, ſo
theſe twoo louers weare deuided one from an other.</p>
               <p>When night was paſſed, Venus called Pſyches &amp;
ſayde: ſéeſt thou yonder foreſt that extendeth out in
lengthe with the ryuer, there be great ſhéepe ſhininge
like golde, and kepte by no maner of perſone, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
thée that thou go thither and bringe me home
ſome of the wool of their fléeces. Pſyches aroſe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not to doo her commaundement, but to throwe her
ſelfe hedlong into the water to ende her ſorowe. Then
a gréene réede inſpired by deuine inſpiration with a
gracious tune and melodie gan ſay. O Pſyches, I pray
thée not to trouble or pollute my water by the death of
thée, and yet beware that thou goe not towardes the
terrible ſhéepe of this coaſt, vntill ſuche tyme as the
heate of the Sunne be paſt, for when the Sunne is in
his force, then ſéeme they moſt dreadfull, and furious,
with their ſharpe hornes, their ſtony forheads, &amp; their
gaping throtes wherwith thei arme them ſelues to the
deſtruction of mankinde: but vntill the midday is paſt
and the heate aſſwaged, and vntill they haue refreſhed
them ſelues in the ryuer, thou maiſt hyde thy ſelfe here
by me vnder this great plane trée: and as ſone as their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23299:67"/>
great fury is paſt, thou maiſt go among the thickettes
and buſhes vnder the wood ſyde and gather the lockes
of their golden fléeces, which thou ſhalt finde ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ginge
vpon the briers. Thus ſpake the gentle and beninge
Réede, ſhowinge a meane to Pſyches to ſaue her life,
whiche ſhe bare well in memory, and with all dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
went and gathered vp ſuche lockes as ſhe founde &amp; put
them in her apron, and carried them home to Venus:
how be it the daunger of this ſeconde labour did not
pleaſe her, nor giue her ſufficient witneſſe of the good
ſeruice of Pſyches, but with a ſower reſemblaunce of
laughter, ſhe ſaid: Of certaintie I knowe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this is not
thy facte, but I will proue if thou be of ſo ſtoute a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and ſinguler prudencie as thou ſéemeſt.</p>
               <p>Then Venus ſpake vnto Pſyches againe: ſaying,
Séeſt thou the toppe of yonder great hill, from whenſe
there ronneth downe water of blacke &amp; deadly colour,
whiche nouriſheth the floodes of Stix and Cocitus, I
charge thée to goe thither and bring me a veſſell of that
water: wherewithall ſhe gaue her a bottell of Criſtall,
menacinge and threatening her rigorouſly.</p>
               <p>Then poore Pſyches went in all haſt to the toppe of
the mountaine, rather to ende hir life then to fetche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
water, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was come vp to the ridge of the
hill, ſhe perceaued that it was impoſſible to bringe it to
paſſe: For ſhe ſawe a great rocke guſſhinge out moſte
horrible fountaines of waters, whiche ranne downe &amp;
fell by many ſtoppes and paſſages into the valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
on eche ſide ſhe ſawe great Dragons, ſtretching
out their longe and blouddy neckes, that neuer ſlept,
but apointed to kéepe the riuer there: the waters ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues likewiſe: ſaying, Away, away, what
wilt thou doo? Fly, fly, or els thou wilt be ſlaine: then
<pb facs="tcp:23299:68"/>
Pſiches (ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> impoſſibilitie of this affaire) ſtoode ſtill
as though ſhe were tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformed into a ſtone, &amp; although
ſhe was preſent in body, yet was ſhe abſent in ſpirite

in ſo much that ſhe could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort her ſelfe with we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,

               <p>But the royall bird of great Iupiter, the Egle, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

he toke it, and filled it with the water of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and takinge his flight thorough thoſe cruell and

thou ſhalt doo one thinge more.</p>
               <p>Take this bore &amp; goe to hell to Proſerpina, and deſire
her to ſende me a litle of her beautie, as muche as will

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſhe ſhoulde neuer returne, &amp; not without cauſe,
when as ſhe was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to goe to the goulfe &amp; furies

vp to a high tower to throwe her ſelfe downe headlong
(thinkinge that it was the nexte and redieſt waye to
Hell) but the towre (as inſpired) ſpake vnto her, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge:
O poore miſer why goeſt thou about to ſlea thy

and daunger? know thou that if thy ſpirite be once
ſeperate from thy bodie, thou ſhalt ſurely goe to Hell,
but neuer to returne againe, wherefore herken to me:
Lacedemon a Citie of Grece is not farre henſe: Goe
thou thither and enquire for the hill Tenarus, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thou ſhalte finde a hole leadinge to Hell, euen to
the pallaice of Pluto, but take héede that thou goe
not with emptie handes to that place of darkeneſſe:
but carry twoo ſoppes ſodden in the flower of barley
and hony in thy handes, &amp; twoo halfpens in thy mouth,
and when thou haſte paſſed a good parte of that way,
thou ſhalt ſée a lame Aſſe carriyng of woodde, &amp; a lame
fellowe driuinge him, who will deſire thée to giue him

doo nothinge, by and by thou ſhalt come vnto the riuer
of Hell, whereas Charon is Ferriman, who will firſt
haue his fare paide him, before he will carry the ſoules
ouer the riuer in his boate, whereby you may ſée that
auarice raigneth emongſt the dead, neyther Charon
nor Pluto will doo any thinge for nought: For if it
be a poore man that woulde paſſe ouer, and lacketh
money he ſhalbe compelled to die in his iourney before
they will ſhowe him any reliefe, wherefore deliuer
<pb facs="tcp:23299:69"/>
to carraine Charon one of the halfepens (whiche thou

toppe of the riuer holdinge vp his deadly handes, and
deſiringe thée to receaue him into the barke, but haue
no regarde to his piteous crie: when thou arte paſſed
ouer the floudde thou ſhalt eſpie old women ſpinninge
who will deſire thée to helpe them, but beware thou doo
not conſent vnto them in any caſe, for theſe and like
baites and trappes wil Venus ſette, to make thée lette
fall one of thy ſoppes: and thinke not that the kéepinge
of thy ſoppes is a light matter, for if thou leſe one of
them thou ſhalt be aſſured neuer to retorne againe to
this world. Then thou ſhalt ſée a great and meruelous
dogge with thrée heades barkinge continually at the
ſoules of ſuch as enter in, by reaſon he can doo them no
other harme, he lieth day and night before the gate of
Proſerpina, and kéepeth the houſe of Pluto with great
diligence, to whome if thou caſt one of thy ſoppes, thou
maiſt haue acceſſe to Proſerpina without all daunger:
ſhe will make thée good chéere, and entertaine thée with
delicate meate &amp; drinke, but ſitte thou vpon the ground
and deſire browne bread, and then declare thy meſſage
vnto her, and when thou haſt receaued ſuch beautie as
ſhe giueth, in thy retorne appeaſe the rage of the dogge
with thy other ſoppe, &amp; giue thy other halfepeny to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
Charon, and come the ſame way againe into

               <p>In this manner the towre ſpake vnto Pſyches, and

               <p>When Pſyches was returned from hell, to the light

downe on the gronnde, &amp; lay there as a ſléepinge corps.</p>

gotte him ſecretely out at a windowe of the chamber

toke his flight towardes his louinge wife, whome whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

prouide for all thinges accordingly: wherewithall he
toke his flight into the ayre, and Pſiches brought her

               <p>Cupide being more and more in loue with Pſiches, &amp;
fearing the diſpleaſure of his mother, did perce into the
heauens, &amp; arriued before Iupiter to declare his cauſe:
then Iupiter after that he had eftſones embraſed him,
gan ſay in this manner: O my welbeloued ſonne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou haſt not giuen due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; honour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

wounded this my breſt (wherby the lawes and order of

When he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe woordes, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
to call al the Goddes to counſell, and if any of the
celeſtiall powers did fayle of appearance, he ſhould be
condemned in ten thouſande poundes: which ſentence
was ſuch a terrour vnto all the Goddes, that the high
Theatre was repleniſhed, &amp; Iupiter began to ſpeake in
this ſorte. O ye Goddes, regiſtred in the bookes of the
Muſes, you all know this yonge man Cupide, whome
I haue nouriſhed with mine owne handes, whoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23299:70"/>
flames of his firſt youth I thought beſt to bridle
and reſtraine. It ſuffiſeth in that he is diffamed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place for his adulterous liuinge, wherefore all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ought to be taken away by meane of marriage: he
hath choſen a mayden that fancieth him well, and hath
beriued her of her virginitie, lette him haue her ſtill
and poſſeſſe her according to his owne pleaſure: then
he returned to Venus, and ſaid: And you my daughter,
take you no care, neither feare the diſhonour of your
progenie and eſtate, neither haue regarde in that it is
a mortall marriage, for it ſéemeth vnto me, iuſte, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and legitimate by the lawe Ciuill.</p>
               <p>Incontinently after, Iupiter commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Mercurie
to bring up Pſiches the ſpouſe of Cupide, into the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layce
of heauen. And then he toke a potte of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and ſaid: Holde Pſyches and drinke to the ende
thou maiſt be immortall, and that Cupide may be thine
euerlaſtinge huſbande.</p>
               <p>By and by the great bankette and marriage feaſt
was ſumptuouſly prepared, Cupide ſatte downe with
his déere ſpouſe betwéene his armes: Iuno likewiſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
Iupiter, and all the other Goddes in order, Ganimides
filled the potte of Iupiter, and Bacchus ſerued the reſt.
Their drinke was Nectar the wine of the goddes, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus
prepared ſupper, the howers decked vp the houſe
with Roſes &amp; other ſwéete ſmelles, the Graces threwe
about baulme, the Muſes ſange with ſwéete harmony,
Apollo tuned pleaſauntly to the Harpe, Venus daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
finely: Satirus and Paniſcus plaide on their pipes:
and thus Pſiches was married to Cupide, and after

While I pondred with my ſelfe all theſe thinges, a

was a certayne manne in the courte of the Emperour

borne tenne children to her huſbande, deſpiſed al

and addict to whore huntyng and continuall reueling.
Whereby he fell in company with théeues,<note place="margin">Theſe vices are lightly linked together.</note> and had his
hande ready to the effuſion of humaine bloudde, his
name was Thraſillus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23299:86"/>
The matter was this according to the report of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man: He demaunded Charites in marriage, who
although he were a man more comely then the reſidue
that wooed her,<note place="margin">Good fame is better then riches.</note> and alſo had richeſſe abundantly, yet
becauſe he was of euill fame, and a man of wicked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and conuerſation, he had the repulſe and was put
of by Charites, and ſo ſhe married with Lepolemus:
howbeit this yonge man ſecretly loued her, yet moued
ſomwhat at her refuſal, he buſily ſerched ſome meanes
to woorke his damnable intent: And (hauinge found oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
and opportunitie to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh his purpoſe, which
he had longe time concealed) brought to paſſe, that the
ſame daye that Charites was deliuered by the ſubtile
meane and valiant audacitie of her huſbande, from the
puiſſance of the Théeues, he mingled him ſelf emongſt
the aſſembly, feigninge that he was gladde of the new
marriage and comminge home againe of the mayden,
whereby (by reaſon that he came of ſo noble parentes)
he was receaued &amp; entertained into the houſe, as one
of their chiefe and principall fréendes:<note place="margin">Here the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes made muche of the Wolfe.</note> Howbeit vnder
cloke of a faithful welwiller, he diſſimuled his miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
minde and intent, in continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time, by much
familiaritie, and often conuerſation and banketinge
together, he fell more and more in fauour, like as we
ſée it fortuneth to louers, who firſt doo litle delight the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues in loue, till as by continuall acquaintaunce they
kiſſe and embraſe eche other. Thraſillus perceauinge
that it was a harde matter to breake his minde ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Charites, whereby he was wholy barred from the
accompliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his luxurious appetite, &amp; on the other
ſide perceauinge that the loue of her and her huſbande
was ſo ſtrongly linked together, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the bonde betwéene
them might in no wiſe be diſſeuered, moreouer it was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23299:86"/>
a thinge impoſſible to rauiſhe her, although he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
therto, yet was he ſtill prouoked forward by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
luſt when as he ſawe him ſelfe vnable to bring
his purpoſe to paſſe. Howbeit at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the thinge which
ſéemed ſo hard and difficil, through hope of his fortified
loue, did now appeare eaſie &amp; facill: but marke I pray
you diligently to what ende the furious force of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
deſire came. On a day Lepolemus went to
the chaſe with Thraſillus to hunte for Goates, for his
wife Charites deſired him earneſtly to medle with no
other beaſtes, which were of more fierce and wilde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when they were come within the chaſe to a great
thicket fortreſſed about with bryers and thornes, they
compaſſed rounde with their dogges, and beſette euery
place with nettes, by and by warninge was giuen to
lette looſe: The dogges ruſhed in with ſuche a crie
that all the foreſt range againe with the noyes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
there leaped out no Goate, nor déere, nor gentle
Hinde, but an horrible and daungerous wilde Boare,
harde &amp; thicke ſkinned, briſteled terribly like thornes,
fominge at the mouth, grindinge his téeth and lokinge
dyrefully with fitie eyes. The dogges that firſt ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him he tare and rent with his tuſkes, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ranne
quight thorough the nettes and eſcaped away: when
we ſawe the furie of this beaſt, we were greatly ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with feare, and becauſe we neuer accuſtomed to chaſe
ſuche dreadfull Boares, and further becauſe we were
vnarmed and without weapons, we gotte and hidde
our ſelues vnder buſhes and trées: then Thraſillus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
founde oportunitie to woorke his treaſon, ſaide
to Lepolemus, what ſtande we here amaſed? why ſhow
we our ſelues like daſtardes? why léeſe we ſo woorthy
a pray with our feminiue hartes? let vs mounte vpon
<pb facs="tcp:23299:87"/>
our horſes and purſue him incontinentlie: Take you a
hunting ſtaffe, &amp; I will take a chaſing ſpeare, by and by
they leaped vpon their horſes and folowed the beaſte.
But he returning againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with furious force, pried
with his eies, on whome he might firſt aſſaile with his
tuſkes: Lepolemus ſtroke the beaſt firſt on the back w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
his hunting ſtaffe.<note place="margin">O wicked deede.</note> Thraſillus faininge to aide and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte
him, came behind, and cut of the hinder legges of
Lepulemus horſe, in ſuch ſorte that he fel downe to the
ground with his maiſter: And ſodenly the Boare came
vpon Lepolemus, and furiouſly tare and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him with
his téeth. Howbeit, Thraſillus was not ſuffiſed to ſée
him thus wounded,<note place="margin">O more miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous facte.</note> but when he deſired his friendlie
helpe, he thruſt Lepolemus through the right thighe
with his ſpeare, the more becauſe he thought the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
of the ſpeare would be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a wound of the Boares
téeth: Then he killed the beaſt likewiſe. And when he
was thus miſerably ſlaine, euery one of vs came out of
our holes, and went towardes our ſlaine maſter. But
although that Thraſillus was ioyfull of the death of
Lepolemus,<note place="margin">Worſe then Iudas.</note> whome he did greatly hate, yet he cloked
the matter with a ſorowfull countenaunce, he feigned
a dolorous face, he often embraſed the body whiche he
him ſelfe ſlewe, he plaied all the partes of a mourninge
perſon, ſauing there fell no teares from his eies. Thus
he reſembled vs in eche point, who verely, and not
without occaſion, had cauſe to lament for our maiſter,
laiyng all the blame of this homicide vnto the Boare.
Incontinently after, the ſoroweful newes of the death
of Lepolemus, came to the eares of all the family, but
eſpecially to Charites, who after ſhe had hard ſuche pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
tidinges, as a madde and raginge woman, ranne
vp and downe the ſtreates, criyng and howling lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23299:87"/>
All the citezins gathered together, and ſuche as
they met, bare them companie runninge towardes the
chaſe. When they came to the ſlaine bodie of Lepole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Charites threwe her ſelfe vpon him, weping and
lamenting greuouſlie for his death, in ſuche ſorte, that
ſhe would haue preſentlie ended her life, vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> corpſe
of her ſlaine huſbande, whome ſhe ſo entierly loued,
had it not bene that her parentes and friendes did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her, and pulled her away. The body was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp,
and in funerall pompe brought to the citie, and buried.
In the meane ſeaſon, Thraſillus feigned much ſorowe
for the death of Lepolemus, but in his hart he was well
pleaſed &amp; ioyful. And to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfect the matter, he would
come to Charites &amp; ſaie: O what a loſſe haue I had by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
death of my friende, my fellowe, my compaignion Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polemus:
O Charites, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort your ſelfe, pacifie your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
refraine your wéeping, beat not your breſtes: And
with ſuch other &amp; like woordes, &amp; diuers exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored
to ſuppreſſe her great ſorowe, but he ſpake not
this for any other inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but to win the hart of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and to noriſh his odious loue with filthy delight.<note place="margin">The parte of a good woman.</note> How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit,
Charites after the buriall of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, ſought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
meanes to folowe him, and (not ſuſteining the ſorowes
wherin ſhe was wrapped) gotte her ſecretly into a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
&amp; purpoſed to finiſh her life there with dolour &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation:
But Thraſillus was very importunate, &amp; at
le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth brought to paſſe that at the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
&amp; friendes of Charites, ſhe ſomewhat refreſhed
her fallen membres with refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of meate and bayne.
Howbeit, ſhe did it more at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
then for any thing els: For ſhe could in no wiſe
be mery, nor receiue any comforte, but tormented her
ſelfe daye and night before the image of her huſbande,
<pb facs="tcp:23299:88"/>
which ſhe had made like vnto Bacchus, &amp; rendred vnto
him diuine honours and ſeruices. In the meane ſeaſon
Thraſillus not able to refraine any le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, before Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
had aſſwaged her dolours, before her troubled
minde had pacified her fury, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the middle of all her
griefes, while ſhe wéeped for her huſbande, while ſhe
tare her garments and rent her heare, demaunded her
in marriage, and ſo without ſhame he detected the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
&amp; vnſpeakeable deceites of his harte. But Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
deteſted and abhorred his demaunde &amp; as ſhe had
bene ſtroken with ſome clappe of thunder, with ſome
ſtorme, or with the lightning of Iupiter, ſhe preſently
fell downe to the grounde all amaſed. Howbeit in the
ende when her ſpirites were reuiued &amp; that ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

ſhe demaunded reſpite to deliberate and to
take aduiſe on the matter, in the meane ſeaſon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſhape
of Lepolemus that was ſlaine ſo miſerably appeared to
Charites with a pale and blouddy face, ſayinge: O my
ſwéete wife (which no other perſon ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay but I) I pray
thée for the loue which is betwéene vs twoo,<note place="margin">Murder is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reueled.</note> if there be

with him, eate not with him, lie not with him,
auoide the blouddy hande of mine enemie, couple not
thy ſelfe with a parricide, for thoſe woundes (the bloud
wherof thy teares did waſh away) were not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des
of the téeth of the Boare, but the ſpeare of Thraſillus
depriued me from thée. Thus ſpake Lepolemus vnto
his louinge wife, and declared the reſidew of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
fact: then Charites awaking from ſléepe beganne
to renew her dolor, to teare her garments, and to beate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:23299:88"/>
her armes with her comely ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, howbeit ſhe reueled
the viſion whiche ſhe ſawe to no manner of perſon, but
diſſimulinge that ſhe knew no parte of the miſchiefe,
deuiſed with her ſelfe howe ſhe might be reuenged on
the traytor, and finiſh her owne life to ende and knitte
vp all ſorrow: Incontinently came Thraſillus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
demaunder of ſodein pleaſure, and weried the
cloſed eares of Charites with talke of mariage, but ſhe
gentely refuſinge his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, and colouring the
matter, with a paſſing crafte in the middeſt of his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
deſiers, gan ſay: Thraſillus, you ſhall vnderſtand
that yet the face of your brother and my huſband, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
before mine eies, I ſmel yet the Cinamome ſent
of his pretious body, I yet feele Lepolemus aliue in my
hart, wherfore you ſhall doo wel if you grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to me, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable

that after the reſidue of a few moneths, the whole yere

and quicke marriage we ſhould iuſtely raiſe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke

Howbeit Thraſillus was not contented with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,<note place="margin">The whote fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of deueliſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but more and more was earneſt vpon her: In ſo

here is my body, take thy pleaſure, but in ſuch ſort and
ſo ſecrete, that no ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the houſe may perceaue it.
Then Thraſillus truſtinge the falſe promiſſes of the
woman, &amp; preferring his inordinate pleaſure aboue all
thinges in the worlde, was ioyfull in his harte &amp; looked
for night, when as he might haue his purpoſe. But
come y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> about midnight (ꝙ Charites) deſguiſed without

Thraſillus meruelouſly, who (ſuſpecting no harme)
did alwaies looke for night, and the houre aſſigned by
Charites: the time was ſkarſe come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as (according
to her commaundement) he deſguiſed him ſelfe, &amp; went
ſtreight to the chamber, where he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the nource at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendinge
for him, who (by the apointment of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris)
fedde him with ſlatteringe talke, and gaue him
mingled &amp; doled drinke in a cuppe, excuſing the abſence
of her miſtris Charites by reaſon that ſhe attended on
her father being ſicke, vntil ſuch time, that with ſwéete
talke and operation of the wine, he fell in a ſounde
ſléepe: now when he lay proſtrate on the grounde rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to all aduenture, Charites (beinge called for) came
in, and with manly courage and bolde force, ſtoode ouer
this ſleepinge murderer, ſaying: Beholde the faithfull
compaignion of my huſbande, beholde this valiaunt
hunter:<note place="margin">The Goddes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth no vice vnpuniſhed.</note> behold my déere ſpouſe, this is the hande which

ſo many ſubtill meanes to worke my deſtruction,
theſe be the eyes whome I haue ill pleaſed, behold now
they forſhowe their owne deſtinie, ſléepe careleſſe,
dreame that thou arte in the handes of the mercifull,
for I will not hurte thée with thy ſwoorde or with any
other weapon, God forbidde that I ſhoulde ſlea thée as
thou ſleweſt my huſband, but thy eies ſhall fayle thée,
and thou ſhalte ſée no more, then that whereof thou
dreameſt: thou ſhalte thinke the death of thine enemie
more ſwéete then thy life: thou ſhalte ſée no light, thou
ſhalte lacke the ayde of a leader, thou ſhalte not haue
me as thou hopeſt, thou ſhalte haue no delight of my
marriage, thou ſhalte not die, and yet liuinge thou
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23299:89"/>
ſhalte haue no ioye, but wander betwéene light and
darkeneſſe as an vnſure image: thou ſhalte ſéeke for
the hande that pricked out thy eies, yet ſhalte thou
not knowe of whome thou ſhouldeſt complaine: I will
make ſacrafice with the bloudde of thine eyes vpon the
graue of my huſband, but what gaineſt thou thorough
my delay? Perhaps thou dreameſt that thou embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
me in thine armes, leaue of the darkenes of ſléepe,
and awake thou to receaue a penall depriuation of thy
ſight, lifte vp thy face, regarde thy vengeance and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
fortune, recken thy miſerie ſo pleaſeth thine eies
to a chaſte woman, that thou ſhalte haue blindneſſe
to thy compaignion, and an euerlaſtinge remorſe of
thy miſerable conſcience. When ſhe had ſpoken theſe
woordes, ſhe toke a great nedle from her head and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out both his eies: which done, ſhe by and by caught
the naked ſwoorde whiche her huſbande Lepolemus
accuſtomed to were, and ranne thorough out all the
Citie like a madde woman, towarde the Sepulchre of
her huſbande: Then all we of the houſe withall the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizins,

when ſhe perceaued that euery one of vs wepte and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
ſhe ſpake in this ſorte: I pray you my fréendes
wéepe not, nor lament for me, for I haue reuenged
the death of my huſbande, I haue puniſhed deſeruedly
the wicked breaker of our marriage, nowe is it time
to ſéeke out my ſwéete Lepolemus, and preſently with
this ſwoorde to finiſhe my lyfe. And therewithall after
ſhe had made relation of the whole matter, declared
the viſion which ſhe ſawe, and tolde by what meane ſhe
deceaued Thraſillus, thruſtinge the ſwoorde vnder her
<pb facs="tcp:23299:90"/>

the matter, &amp; knowinge not by what meanes he might
ende his life, for he thought his ſwoorde was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſo great a crime, at length went to the

you are come to ſupplie my rowme, and to eaſe me of

liue and pleaſe my maiſter well, to thende thou maieſt

of perſons apparelled in diuers colours, hauinge
painted faces, mytres on their heades, veſtimentes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
like ſaffron, ſurpleſſes of ſilke, and on their féete
yellowe ſhoes, who attired the Goddeſſe in a roabe of
purple, and put her vpon my backe. Then they went
foorth with their armes naked to their ſhoulders, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with them great ſwoordes and mightie axes, and
daunſing like madde perſons. After that we had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
many ſmall villages, we fortuned to come to one
Britunis houſe, where at our firſt entrie, they began
to hurle them ſelues hither and thither, as though they
weare madde. They made a thouſand ieſtes with their
féete and their heades: They would bite them ſelues:
Finally, euery one tooke his weapon and wounded his
armes in diuers places. Emongeſt whome there was
one more madde then the reſte, that fette many déepe
ſighes from the bottome of his harte, as though he had

robbing all the countrey ouer: At length they came to
a certaine caſtell, purpoſing to make good chere there,
where vnder coloure of diuinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei brought to paſſe
that they obteined a fatte ſhéepe of a poore huſbandman
for the Goddeſſe ſupper, &amp; to make ſacrifice withal. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

deſier of vnnaturall luxurie. For they compaſſed
him round about ſitting at the table, &amp; abuſed the yong
man contrarie to all nature &amp; reaſon: When I behelde
this horrible fact, I could not but attempte to vtter my
minde and ſaie, O maiſters, but I could pronounce no
more but the firſt letter O, which I roared out ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly,
that the yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the town, ſéeking for a ſtray
Aſſe that they had loſt the ſame night, and hearing my

diſperſed throughout all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Region there of their beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

departed away about midnight. When we had paſſed

we came into a wide deſert, where they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſlea me. For after they had taken the Goddeſſe
from my back and ſet her gingerly vpon the grounde,
they likewiſe tooke of my harneſſe, and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me ſurely
to an oke, beating me with their whippe, in ſuche ſorte
that all my bodie was mortified. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt whome there

hatchet, becauſe by my noyſe I diffamed his chaſtitée,
but the other regarding more their own profit then my

carie home the Goddeſſe: So they laded me againe, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
me before them with their naked ſwoordes til thei
came to a noble citie: where the principal patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bearing

my ſelfe in moſte dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, for there was one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> brought

for the beautie of the ſlouriſhinge crownes did ſo ſticke
in his minde, that where the menaces of his maiſter
compelled him to tarry at home, the peſtilent auarice
of the Golde egged him out a doores, wherfore putting

Then inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinentlie Phileſiterus deliuered him tenne

diſguiſed into his miſtris chamber. About midnight
when he and ſhe weare naked together, making ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

would not diſcouer it to his wife neither to any other
perſone, but putting ſecretly the ſlippers in his boſom,
commaunded his other ſeruauntes to binde Myrmex

while Barbarus went toward the Iuſtice in a furie &amp;

not becauſe he was accuſed before his maiſter, but by

Then ſhe ſat downe with vs at the table to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

But when he ſnyſed more and more, he ſuſpected the

then to runne awaye. In the meane ſeaſon this wicked
woman impacient of her loue, and the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g delaie of her
ſonne, egged her huſbande to ride abroade into farre
countries. And then ſhe aſked the yong man the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of his promiſſe, but he to deliuer him ſelfe,
entierly from her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, would finde alwaies excuſes,
till in the ende, ſhe vnderſtode by the meſſengers that
came in and out, that he nothing regarded her. Then
the, by howe muche ſhe loued him before, by ſo much &amp;
more ſhe hated him nowe. And by and by, ſhe called one
of her ſeruauntes, ready to all miſchiefes: To whome
ſhe declared all her ſecretes. And there it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
betwenè them twoo, that the ſureſt waye was to
kill the yong man: Whereupon this Verlet went inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentlie
to buie poiſon, which he mingled with wine,
to the intent he would giue it the yong man to drinke,
and thereby preſently to kill him. But while they were
in deliberation howe they might offer it vnto him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
here happened a ſtraunge aduenture. For the
yonge ſonne of the woman that came from ſchole at
noone (being very thirſty) tooke the potte wherein the
poyſon was mingled, and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the hidden venym
dranke a good draught thereof, whiche was prepared to
kill his brother:<note place="margin">A woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either loueth thee bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely.</note> Whereby he preſently fell downe to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dead. His ſcholemaiſter ſeing this ſodain chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
called his mother, and all the ſeruauntes of the houſe
with a loude voyce. Incontinently euerie man decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his opinion, touching the death of the childe: But
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23299:112"/>
the cruell woman, the onely example of ſtepmothers
malice was nothinge moued by the bitter death of her
ſonne, or by her owne conſcience of parracide, or by the
miſfortune of her houſe, or by the dolor of her huſbande
but rather deuiſed the deſtruction of all her family. For
by and by ſhe ſent a meſſanger after her huſband to tell
him the great miſfortune which happened after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
And when he came home the wicked woman
declared that his ſonne had empoiſened his brother,
becauſe he would not conſent to his will, and tolde him
diuers other leſinges, adding in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ende that he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to kill her likewiſe, becauſe ſhe diſcouered the fact:
Then the vnhappy father was ſtroken with double do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of the death of his twoo children, for on the one ſide
he ſawe his yonger ſonne ſlaine before his eyes, on the
other ſide he ſéemed to ſée y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> elder conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to die for his

more deadly, but the funeralles of his yonger ſonne
were ſkarſe finiſhed, when the olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father with

&amp; faith to the Goddes: wherefore I pray you giue eare,
and I will ſhowe you the whole truth of the matter:
you ſhal vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this ſeruant which hath merited
to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, came one of theſe daies to ſpeake with me,
promiſing to giue me a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred crounes, if I would giue
<pb facs="tcp:23299:114"/>
him a preſent poyſon, whiche would cauſe a man to die
ſodenly, ſaying: that he would haue it for one that was
ſicke of an incurable diſeaſe, to the ende he might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from all his torment, but I ſmelling his crafty
and ſubtill fetche, and fearinge leaſt he would worke
ſome miſchiefe withall, gaue him a drinke: but to the
intent I might cléere my ſelfe from al daunger y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> might
happen, I would not preſently take the money, which
he offred: but leaſt any one of the crownes ſhould lacke
weight or be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trefaite, I willed him to ſeale the
purſe wherein they were put with his manuell ſigne,
wherby the next day we might goe together to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmithe
to trie them, which he did, wherfore vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he was brought preſent before you this day,
I haſtely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded one of my ſeruantes to fetche the
purſe which he had ſealed, &amp; here I bring it vnto you to
ſée whether he will denie his owne ſigne or no:and you
may eaſely coniect that his woordes are vntrue, whiche
he alleaged againſt the yong man touching the biynge
of the poyſon, conſideringe he bought the poyſon him
ſelfe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Phiſitian had ſpoken theſe woordes you
might perceaue how the trayterous knaue chaunged
his colour, how he ſwette for feare, how he trembled in
euery part of his bodie:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>vſeth theeues to doo, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident proufes are ſhowen.</note> And how he ſet one legge vpon
an other, ſcratchyng his head, and grindinge his téeth,
wherby there was no perſon but would iudge him cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
In the ende when he was ſomewhat returned to
his former ſubtiltie, he beganne to denie all that was
ſaide, and ſtoutely affirmed that the Phiſitian did lie.
But the Phiſitian perceauinge that he was rayled at
and his woordes denied, did neuer ceaſe to confirme his
ſaiynges and to diſproue the verlet, til ſuch time as the
officers by the commaundement of the Iudges, bound
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23299:114"/>
his handes and brought out the ſeale, wherwith he had
ſealed the purſe, which augmented the ſuſpition which
was conceaued of him firſt. Howbeit neither the feare
of the whele or any other torment (according to the vſe
of the Grecians) whiche weare ready prepared, no nor
yet the fire coulde enforce him to confeſſe the matter,
ſo obſtinate and grounded was he in his miſchieuous
minde, but the Phiſitian perceauing that the menaces
of thoſe tormentes did nothing preuaile, gan ſay: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuffer or abide that this yong man who is innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
ſhould againſt all lawe and conſcience be puniſhed and
condemned to die, &amp; the other whiche is culpable ſhould
eſcape ſo eaſely, and after mocke &amp; floute at your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For I will giue you an euident proufe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of this preſent crime, you ſhall vnderſtande
that when this caytife demaunded of me a preſent and
ſtronge poyſon, conſideringe that it was not my parte
to giue occaſion of any others death,<note place="margin">The office of a Phiſician is to cute and not to kill, as I haue harde tell many Phiſicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation haue done, before thei haue come to practiſe.</note> but rather to cure
&amp; ſaue ſicke perſons by meane of medicines: And on the
other ſide, fearinge leaſt if I ſhould denie his requeſt I
might miniſter a further cauſe of his miſchiefe, eyther
that he would bie poyſon of ſome other, or els returne
and woorke his wicked intent with a ſwoorde or ſome
daungerous weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I gaue him no poiſon but a doling
drinke of Mandragora, which is of ſuch force that it wil
cauſe any man to ſléepe as though he weare dead: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it any meruell if this moſte deſperate man, who
is certainely aſſured to be put to death, ordained by an
auncient cuſtome, can ſuffer or abide theſe facill &amp; eaſie
tormentes: but if it be ſo that the childe hath receaued
the drinke as I tempred it with mine owne handes, he
is yet aliue and doth but ſléepe, and after his ſléepe he
ſhall returne to life againe: but if he be dead in déede,
<pb facs="tcp:23299:115"/>
then may you further enquire of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſes of his death:
The opinion of this au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Phiſitian was found good,
&amp; euery man had a deſire to goe to the ſepulchre where
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> childe was laide, there was none of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iuſtices, none
of any reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the towne, nor any of the common

ſhutte their chamber doore and went to the baynes: (O

were ſo rauenous as to deuoure whole diſhes of meate,

In the ende ſhe promiſed a great rewarde to my kéeper

beganne to annointe all her body with baulme, and
mine likewiſe, but eſpecially my noſe, whiche done
ſhe kiſſed me, not as thei accuſtome to doo at the ſtewes,
or in brothell houſes, or in the courtiſant ſchooles for

affection, caſtinge out theſe and like louinge woordes:
Thou arte he whome I loue, thou arte he whome I
onely deſire, without thée I cannot liue, and other like
preamble of talke, as women can vſe well inoughe,
when they minde to ſhowe or declare their burninge
paſſions and great affection of loue: Then ſhe toke me
by the halter and caſte me vpon the bedde, whiche was

to finde newe paſtime for my maiſter. Who after he

to ſhowe before the face of all the people what I

they could finde no other that would endeuour ſo

poore woman, which was condemned to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wild
beaſtes, with whome I ſhould openly haue to doo. But
firſt I will tell you what a tale I hard, concerning this
woman. This woman had a huſbande, whoſe father
<pb facs="tcp:23299:119"/>
minding to ride foorth, commaunded his wife which he
left at home great with childe, that if ſhe weare deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a doughter, it ſhould incontinently be killed.</p>
               <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of her deliuery came, it fortuned that
ſhe had a daughter, whome ſhe would not ſuffer to be
ſlaine, by reaſon of the natural affection which ſhe bare
vnto her childe, but ſecretly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted her to one of her
neighbours to nource. And when her huſbande retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home, ſhe declared vnto him, that ſhe was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a daughter, whome as he commaunded, ſhe had
cauſed to be put to death. But when this childe came to
age, and readie to be maried: The mother knew not by
what meanes ſhe ſhould endow her daughter, but that
her huſband ſhould vnderſtand and perceiue it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe diſcouered the matter to her ſonne, who was
the huſband of this woman, condemned to be eaten of
wilde beaſtes: For ſhe greatly feared, leſt he ſhold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
fancie or fall in loue with his owne ſiſter. The
yong man vnderſtanding the whole matter (to pleaſe &amp;
gratifie his mother) we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t immediatly to the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
keping the matter ſecret in his hart, for feare of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience
&amp; (lamenting to ſée his ſiſter forſaken, both of
mother and father) incontinently after, endowed her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
part of his owne goodes, and would haue maried her to
one of his eſpeciall &amp; truſty frendes: But although he
brought this to paſſe very ſecretly &amp; ſagely, yet in the
ende cruell and enuious fortune, ſowed great ſedition
in his houſe. For his wife, who was now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to
beaſtes, waxed ielous of her huſband, and began to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the yong woman as a harlot and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> queane,
in ſo much that ſhe inuented all manner of meanes to
diſpatche her out of the way. And in the end, ſhe inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this kinde of miſchiefe: She priuely ſtale away her

huſbandes ringe, &amp; went into the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, where as ſhe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded one of her truſtie ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, to take y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ringe
&amp; to carie it to the maiden. To whom he ſhould declare
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> her brother did pray her to come into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie to him,
&amp; that ſhe ſhould come alone without any other perſon.
And to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſhe ſhold not delay but come with al ſpede,

as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meſſenger willed her to do. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was come

inuented &amp; feigned y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter) tooke a burning fireband &amp;

The huſband of this maiden, but eſpecialy her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

who had killed a great many perſons in his daies, &amp;
promiſed him fifty pieces of gold if he would giue her a

<pb facs="tcp:23299:120"/>
her huſband, ſhe feigned that it was neceſſarie for him,
to receiue a certaine kinde of drinke, whiche y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maiſters
and doctours of phiſick, doo call a ſacred potion, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
he might purge choller, and ſkowre the interior
partes of his bodie. But the Phiſition, in ſtéede of that
drinke, prepared a mortall and deadly poyſon, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he had tempred it accordingly, he tooke the potte in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of all the familie, and other neighbours &amp; frendes
of the ſicke yonge man, and offred it vnto the patient.
But the bolde and hardie woman, to thende ſhe might
accompliſh her wicked intent, and alſo gaine the mony
whiche ſhe had promiſed the Phiſition, ſtaide the potte
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her hand, ſaying: I praie you maiſter Phiſition, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter

ſuche time as you haue dronke ſome part thereof your

any poyſon in the drinke or no, wherein I pray you not
to be offended: For I know that you are a man of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and learning, but this I doo to thintent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and loue that I beare to the health &amp; ſaluegarde
of my huſband, may be apparant. The Phiſition being
greatly troubled at the wickednes of this miſchieuous
woman, as voide of all councell and leiſure to conſider
on the matter, and leaſt he might geue any cauſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition
to the ſtanders by, or ſhowe any ſcruple of his
gilty conſcience, by reaſon of long delaie, tooke the pott
in his hande, &amp; preſently dronke a good draught therof,
which done, the yonge man hauing no miſtruſt, dronke
vp the reſidue. The Phiſition would haue gone imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
home to receiue a contrepoiſon, to expell &amp; driue
out the firſt poyſon: But the wicked woman perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in her miſchiefe, would not ſuffer him to departe
one foote, vntill ſuch time as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poyſon began to woorke
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23299:120"/>
in him, and then by much prayer and interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
him to goe home: By the way the poyſon inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the intrailes and bowels of the whole bodie of the
Phiſitian, in ſuch ſort that with great paine he came to
his owne houſe, where he had ſkarſe time to ſpeake to
his wife, and to will her to receaue the promiſed ſalary
of the death of twoo perſones, but he yéelded vp y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ghoſt:
And the other yong man liued not long after, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
died, emongſt the feigned and deceitfull teares of
his curſed wife. A few daies after, when the yong man
was buried, and the funeralles ended, the Phiſicians
wife demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of her the fiftie pieces of golde, whiche
ſhe promiſed her huſband for the drinke, whereat the ill

I might ſee yonge children and maydens in the flowre

about which woodde were many yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; tender Goates,
pluckyng &amp; féeding deintily on the budding trées, then
came a yonge man a ſhéepeherde repreſentinge Paris,
richly arraied with veſtmentes of Barbarie, hauinge a

was Mercury with his rodde called Caduceus, he bare
in his right hand an apple of golde, and with a ſéemely

after that he had deliuered him the apple, he made a
ſigne ſignifiyng that Iupiter had commaunded him ſo
to doo, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had done his meſſage, he departed away:
And by and by, behold there approched a fayre &amp; come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maiden, not much vnlike to Iuno, for ſhe had a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme
of golde vpon her head, and in her hande ſhe bare
a regall Sceptre: then followed an other reſemblinge
Pallas, for ſhe had on her head a ſhining ſallett, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was bounde a garlande made of Oliue braunches,
hauinge in one hande a targette or ſhilde, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſpeare as though ſhe would fight: then came an
other, which paſſed the other in beautie, &amp; repreſented
the goddeſſe Venus, with the colour of Ambroſia, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhe was a mayden, and to the ende ſhe would ſhow her
perfect beautie, ſhe appeared all naked, ſauing that her
fine and deintie ſkinne was couered with a thinne
ſmocke, whiche the winde blewe hither and thither, to
teſtifie the youth and flowre of the age of the Dame,
her colour was of twoo ſortes, for her bodie was white,
as deſcended from heauen, &amp; her ſmocke was blewiſhe
as arriued from the ſea: After euery one of the virgins
whiche ſéemed Goddeſſes, followed certaine waytinge
ſeruauntes, Caſtor and Pollux went behind Iuno, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
on their heades helmettes couered with ſtarres.
This virgin Iuno ſowned a feewte, whiche ſhe bare in
her hand, and moued her ſelfe towardes the ſhéepeherd
Paris, ſhowyng by honeſt ſignes and tokens, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſinge
that he ſhould be Lord of all Aſia, if he would
iudge her the faireſt of the thrée, &amp; to giue her the apple

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23299:122"/>
to be Pallas, was accompaigned with two yong
men, armed and brandiſhinge their naked ſwoordes in
their handes, wherof one was named Terror, and the
other Feare, behinde them approched one ſoundinge
his trumpet to prouoke and ſtirre men to battaile, this
maiden began to daunce and ſhake her head, throwyng
her fierce and terrible eyes vpon Paris, and promiſing
that if it pleaſed him, to giue her the victory of beawtie,
ſhe would make him the moſt ſtronge &amp; victorious man
aliue. Then came Venus and preſented her ſelfe in the
middle of the Theatre, with much fauour of al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for ſhe was accompaigned with a great number of
youth, whereby you would haue iudged them to be all
Cupidoes, eyther to haue flowen from heauen, or els
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuer of the ſea, for they had winges, arrowes,
and the reſidew of their habite according in eche point,
&amp; they bare in their handes, torches lighted, as though
it had bene a day of mariage, then came in a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

Howres, carriyng garlandes and looſe flowres, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge

forwarde more and more, &amp; ſhakinge her head, anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by her motion and geſture, to the ſounde of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes:
For ſometimes ſhe woulde winke gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely,
ſometimes threaten and looke aſperly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
daunce onely with her eies: Aſſone as ſhe was
come before the Iudge, ſhe made a ſigne and token to

then the yonge Phrigian ſhéepeherde Paris,<note place="margin">The offer of loue, paſſed kingdomes and treaſure.</note>
with a willinge minde deliuered the Golden apple to
Venus, whiche was the Victorie of beawtie. Why
doo ye meruell ye Orators, ye Lawiers, &amp; Aduocates,
if many of our Iudges nowe a dayes ſell their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
for money, when as in the beginninge of the

God and men, and that one ruſticall iudge and ſhéepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde,
appointed by the counſell of the great Iupiter,
ſolde his iudgement for a litle pleaſure, which was the
cauſe afterwarde of the ruine of all his progeny: by

noble Gréekes: For the noble and valiaunt perſonage
Palamades was conuicted and atteinted of treaſon, by

of baſe condition, was preferred in Martiall proweſſe
aboue great Aiax, what iudgement was there likewiſe
emongſt the Atheman lawyers, ſage and expert in all

God Apollo aboue all the wiſemen of the worlde, by
enuie and malice of wicked perſons, empoysoned with

the ende I may not be reproued of indignation, by any
one that might ſay, what ſhal we ſuffer an Aſſe to play

After the iudgement of Paris was ended, Iuno &amp; Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
departed away angerly, ſhowynge by their geſture
that they would reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge them ſelues on Paris, but Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

daunſed about the Theatre with much ioye. This done

but in the meane ſeaſon while my maiſter made reddy

When the deuine image had ſpoken theſe woordes, ſhe
vaniſhed awaie: By and by, when I awaked I aroſe,
hauing the members of my body mixt with feare, ioye,

All thinges ſéemed that daie to be ioyfull, as well all

enſued the whote and temperat Sunne, whereby the

did chirp and ſing in their ſteuen melodiouſly: The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

regall manner, and ſinging ioyfully: One was girded
about the middle like a man of armes: An other bare a
ſpeare, and had a cloke and highe ſhooes as a hunter: an
other was attired in a roobe of ſilke, and ſockes of gold,
hauing his heare layde out, and dreſſed in fourme of a
woman: There was an other which ware legharnes, &amp;
bare a target, a ſalette, &amp; a ſpeare, like a martiall ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour:
After him marched one attired in purple, with
<pb facs="tcp:23299:127"/>
vergers before him like a Magiſtrate: After him folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
one with a mantell, a ſtaffe, a paire of pautofles,
and with a graie bearde, ſignifiyng a Philoſopher: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him went one with lyme, betokening a fowler, An
other with hookes, declaringe a fiſher. I ſawe there a
méeke and tame beare, whiche in matron habit was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on a ſtole: An Ape with a bonnet on his head, and
couered with lawne reſemblinge a ſhéepeherde, and
bearing a cuppe of golde in his hande: An Aſſe whiche
had winges glewed to his back, and went after an olde
man, wherby you would iudge, the one to be Pegaſus,
and the other Bellephoron. Amongeſt theſe pleaſures
and populer delectations, whiche wandred hither and
thither. You might ſée the pampe of the Goddeſſe triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

whyte veſtmentes, and reioyſinge in that they bare
garlandes and flowers vpon their heades, beſpred the
wayes with herbes, whiche they bare in their aprons,
where this regall and deuout proceſſion ſhoulde paſſe.
Other caried glaſſes on their backes, to teſtifie obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce
and honour to the Goddeſſe whiche came after.
Other bare combes of Iuorie, and declared by their
geſture &amp; motions of their armes, that they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
and reddy to dreſſe the Goddeſſe. Other drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the waies as they went, baulme and other preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
oyntmentes: Then came a great number, as well
of men as of women, with candles, torches, and other
lightes, doing honour to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> celeſtial goddeſſe: After tht
ſounded the muſicall armonie of inſtrumentes: Then
came a faire company of youth, apareled in white veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
ſinginge both metre &amp; verſe, with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly grace
which ſome ſtudious Poete had made in honour of the
Muſes. In the meane ſeaſon, arriued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blowers of tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23299:127"/>
which were dedicate vnto Serapis, &amp; to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before them, were officers &amp; bedles, preparing rome
for the goddeſſe to paſſe. Then came the great company
of men &amp; women, which had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuine orders, whoſe
garmentes gliſtned al the ſtretes ouer. The weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had
their heare anointed, &amp; their heads couered with linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
but the men had their crownes ſhauen, which were the
terren ſtarres of the goddeſſe, holdinge in their handes
inſtrumentes of braſſe, ſiluer, &amp; gold, which rendred a
pleaſant ſound. The principal prieſtes, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareled
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> white ſurpleſſes hanging down to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
bare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> relickes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> puiſant goddeſſe. One caried in his
hand a light, not vnlike to thoſe whiche we vſed in our
houſes, ſauing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the middle thereof appeared a bole
which rendred a more bright flame. The ſecond attired
like the other, bare in his handes an aultar, whiche the
goddeſſe her ſelfe named the ſuccour of nations. The
third held vp a trée of palme, with leaues of golde, &amp; the
verge of Mercurie. The fourth ſhowed out a token of
equitie by his left hande, which was deformed in euery
place, ſignifiyng thereby more equitie then by the right
hande. The ſame prieſt caried a round veſſell of golde,
in forme of a cap. The fifte bare a Van, wroughte with
ſpringes of gold, and an other caried a veſſel for wyne:
By and by after, the goddeſſe followed a foote as men
doo, and ſpecially Mercurie, the meſſenger of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
infernall and ſupernall, with his face ſometyme
blacke, ſometyme fayre, liftinge vp the head of the
dogge Ambis, and bearing in his lefte hand his verge,
and in his right hande, the braunche of a palme trée,
after whome folowed a cowe with an vpright gate,
repreſentinge the figure of the great Goddeſſe, and he
that guyded her, marched on with muche grauitie.
<pb facs="tcp:23299:128"/>
And other caried after the ſecretes of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in a coffer. There was one that bare on his ſtomack
the figure of his God, not formed like any beaſt, birde,
ſauage thinge, or humaine ſhape, but made by a newe
inuention, whereby was ſignified that ſuch a religion
ſhould not be diſcouered, or reueled to any perſon.
There was a veſſell wrought with a rounde bottome,
hauing on the one ſide pictures figured like vnto the
manner of the Egiptians, and on the other ſide was an
eare, wherevpon ſtoode the ſerpent Aſpis, holdinge out
his ſkaly neck. Finally, came he which was appointed
to my good fortune, according to the promiſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe.
For the great prieſte whiche bare the reſtoration
of my humaine ſhape, by the commaundement of the
goddeſſe, approched more and more, bearing in his left
hande the timbrell, and in the other a garland of roſes
to giue me, to thende I might be deliuered from cruell
fortune, which was alwaies mine enemy, after the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance
of ſo muche calamitie and poine, and after the
endurance of ſo many perilles: Then I, not runninge
haſtely, by reaſon of ſodaine ioye, leſt I ſhould diſturbe
the quiet proceſſion with mine importunitie: But go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoftly through the preſſe of people, whiche gaue me
place on euery ſide, went after the prieſt. The prieſt
being admoniſhed the night before, as I might well
perceiue, ſtoode ſtill, and holding out his hande, thruſt
out the garlande of roſes into my mouth, whiche I (tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling)
deuoured with a great affection: And aſſone as I
had eaten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I was not deceiued of the promiſe made
vnto me. For my deforme and Aſſy face abated, and
firſt the rugged heare of my body fell of, my thick ſkyn
waxed ſoft and tender, the hoofes of my féete chaunged
into toes, my handes returned againe, my neck grewe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:23299:128"/>
ſhort, my head &amp; mouth became rounde, my long eares
were made litle, my great and ſtony téeth waxed leſſe
like the téeth of men, and my taile whiche combred me
moſt, appeared no where, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people began to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
and the religious honored the Goddeſſe for ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a miracle, they wondred at the viſions which they
ſawe in the night, and the facilitie of my reformation,
whereby they rendred teſtimony of ſo great a benefite
which I receaued of the Goddeſſe, when I ſaw my ſelf
in ſuch eſtate, I ſtode ſtil a good ſpace and ſaid nothing,
for I coulde not tell what to ſay, nor what woorde I
ſhould firſt ſpeake, nor what thankes I ſhould render
to the Goddeſſe, but the great prieſt vnderſtanding all
my fortune and miſery by diuine aduertiſement, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
that one ſhould giue me garmentes to couer
me: Howbeit aſſone as I was tranſformed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Aſſe
to my humaine ſhape, I hidde the priuities of my body
with my handes as ſhame and neceſſitie compelled me:
Then one of the companie put of his vpper robe, and
put it on my backe, which done: the Prieſt loking vpon
me with a ſwéete and benigne voyce, ganne ſay in this
ſorte: O my fréende Lucius, after the endurance of ſo
many labors, &amp; the eſcape of ſo many tempeſtes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
thou arte now at length come to the porte &amp; haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of reſt and mercie: Neither did thy noble lignage, thy
dignitie, neither thy doctrine any thing preuaile, but
that thou haſt endured ſo many ſeruill pleaſures, by a
litle folly of thy youthfulneſſe, wherby thou haſt had a
ſiniſter rewarde of thy vnproſperous curioſitie, but
howſoeuer the blindenes of fortune tormented thée in
diuers daungers: So it is that nowe vnwares to her,
thou art come to this preſent felicitie, let fortune goe,
&amp; fume with furie in an other place, let her finde ſome
<pb facs="tcp:23299:129"/>
other matter to execute her cruelty, for fortune hath
no puiſance againſt them which ſerue and honour our
Goddeſſe, for what auailed the theeues? the beaſtes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage?
thy great ſeruitude? the ill &amp; daungerous waies?
the longe paſſages? the feare of death euery day? know
thou that now thou art ſalue, and vnder the protection
of her, who by her cléere light doth lighten the other
Goddes: wherefore reioyſe, and take a conuenable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to thy white habite, followe the pompe of this
deuout &amp; honorable proceſſion, to the ende y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuch which
be not deuout to the Goddeſſe, may ſée &amp; acknowledge
their errour. Beholde Lucius thou art deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo
great miſeries, by the prouidence of the Goddeſſe Iſis,
reioyſe therfore and triumphe of the victory of fortune,
to the ende thou maiſt liue more ſalue and ſure, make
thy ſelfe one of this holy order, dedicate thy minde to
the obſequie of our religion, &amp; take vpon thée a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
yoke of miniſterie: And when thou beginneſt to
ſerue and honor the Goddeſſe, then ſhalt thou féele the
fruicte of thy libertie: After that the great Prieſt had
prophecied in this manner, with often brethinges, he
made a concluſion of his woordes: Then I went emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
the company of the reſte and followed the proceſſion:
Euery one of the people knewe me, &amp; pointinge at me
with their fingers, ſaide in this ſorte: beholde him who
is this day tranſformed into a man by the puiſſance of
the ſoueraigne Goddeſſe, verely he is bleſſed and moſt
bleſſed that hath merited ſo great grace from heauen,
as by the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of his former life, and as it were by
a newe regeneration is reſerued to the obſequie of the
Goddeſſe. In the meane ſeaſon by litle and litle we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched
nighe vnto the ſea coaſte, euen to that place
where I lay the night before beinge an Aſſe. There,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23299:129"/>
after the images &amp; reliques were orderly diſpoſed, the
great Prieſt compaſſed about with diuers pictures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the faſhion of the Egiptians, did dedicate &amp;
conſecrate with certaine prayers a fayre ſhippe made
very cunningly, &amp; purified the ſame w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a torch, an egge,
&amp; ſulphur, the ſayle was of white linnen cloth, wheron
was write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certaine letters, which teſtified the nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be proſperous, the maſte was of a great length
made of a pine trée, rounde, &amp; very excellent with a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
toppe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cabbin was couered ouer with couerings
of golde, &amp; all the ſhippe was made of Citron trée very
fayre, then al the people aſwell religious as prophane
toke a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Vannes repleniſhed with odors &amp;
pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſmelles, and threw them into the ſea mingled
with milke, vntill the ſhippe was filled vp with large
giftes and proſperous deuotions, when as with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
winde it launched out into the déepe: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei
had loſt the ſight of the ſhippe, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carried again
that which he brought, and went towarde the Temple
in like pompe and ordre as they came to the ſea ſide.
When we were come to the Temple, the great Prieſt
and thoſe whiche were deputed to carry the diuine fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
but ſpecially thoſe whiche had longe time bene
worſhippers of the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, went into the ſecrete cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Goddeſſe, where they put &amp; placed the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

whiche was a Scribe or interpretour of letters,
who in forme of a preacher, ſtoode vp in a chayre before
the place of the holy colledge, &amp; began to read out of a

               <p>IN the meane ſeaſon newes was carried into my
countrie (as ſwifte as the flight of birdes, or as the

of our houſe, vnderſtandinge that I was not
dead as thei were falſely enformed, came towardes me
with great diligence to ſée me, as a man rayſed from

ſée them againe, was as ioyfull as they, acceptinge and
takinge in good part, their honeſt giftes and oblations
which they gaue, to the intent I might bie ſuch things
as was neceſſary for my body: After that I had made

of the Goddeſſe, and ordinarily frequent the company
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23299:130"/>
of the prieſtes, wherby I would wholy become deuout
to the Goddeſſe, and an inſeparable woorſhipper of her
diuine name: It fortuned that the Goddeſſe appeared
to me oftentimes in the night, perſwadinge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundinge
me to take the order of her religion, but I
although I was endewed with a deſirous good wil, yet
the reuerende feare of the ſame withhelde me, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
that her obeyſaunce was harde and difficill, the
chaſtetie of the Prieſtes intollerable, and the life fraile
&amp; ſubiect to many inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, beinge thus in doubte
I refrained my ſelfe from all thoſe thinges, as ſéeming
impoſſible: On a night the great Prieſt appeared vnto
me preſenting his lappe full of treaſure, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
what it ſignified, he anſweared that it was

of mine named Candidus was arriued like wiſe:

I verely thought that it was a fore ſhow of gaine &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
chaunce: while I was thus aſtonied I went to
the Temple, and tarried there till the openinge of the
gates, then I wente in, &amp; began to pray before the face
of the Goddeſſe, the Prieſt prepared and ſet the diuine
thinges on euery Aultour, &amp; pulled out of the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine
the holy veſſell with ſolempne ſupplication. Then they
began to ſinge the mattens of the mornyng, teſtifiyng
thereby the howre of the pryme. By and by beholde ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
my ſeruauntes whiche I had left in the countrie,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fotis by errour made me an Aſſe, bringyng with

beſide the promiſſe of gaine, my white horſe was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

conſidering that it was in her power to dampne &amp; ſaue
all perſons, and if any were at the point of death and
in the way to damnation, ſo that he were capable to
receaue the ſecretes of the Goddeſſe, it was in her
power by diuine prouidence to reduce him to the pathe
of health, as by a certaine kinde of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Finaly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23299:131"/>
he ſaide that I muſte attende the celeſtiall precept, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was euident and playne that the Goddeſſe
had already vouchſaued to call and appointe me to her

receaued, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende I might come more apte &amp; cleane to
the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecretes of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then I was
obedient vnto theſe woordes, and attentife with méeke
quietnes, &amp; probable taciturnitie, I dayly ſerued at the

I greatly reioyſed, and aroſe before day to

and after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the morning ſacrifice was ended, he
brought out of the ſecrete place of the temple certaine
bookes, partly writen with vnknowen charecters, and
partely peincted with figures of beaſtes, declarings
<pb facs="tcp:23299:132"/>
briefly euery ſentence, with toppes and tayles turned

he enterpreted to me ſuche thinges as were neceſſary
to the vſe and preparation of mine order. This done, I
gaue in charge to certaine of my compaignions to bie

then he brought me to the next baynes, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paned with

Goddes, waſhed me and purified my body according to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuſtome: After this when noone approched he brought
me backe againe to the Temple, and preſented me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the face of the Goddeſſe, giuinge a charge of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſecrete thinges vnlawfull to be vttered, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
me, and generally all the reſt, to faſt by the
ſpace of tenne continuall dayes, without eating of any
beaſt, or drinking of any wine, which thinges I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with a meruelous continencie. Then beholde the
day approched, when as the ſacrifice ſhould be done, &amp;
when night came there arriued on euery coaſt a great
multitude of Prieſtes, who accordinge to their order
offered me many preſentes and giftes, then was all the
Laitie &amp; prophane people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to depart, &amp; when
they had putte on my backe a linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> robe, they brought
me to the moſt ſecrete and ſacred place of the Temple.

if it were lawfull for me to tell, you ſhould know if it

it to be true: thou ſhalt vnderſtande that I approched
nere vnto Hell, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the gates of Proſerpina, &amp; after
that I was rauiſhed throughout all the Elementes, I
returned to my proper place: About midnight I ſawe
the ſonne ſhine, I ſaw likewiſe the Goddes celeſtiall,
and Goddes infernall, before whome I preſented my
ſelfe and woorſhipped them: beholde now haue I tolde
thée, which although thou haſt harde, yet it is neceſſary
that you conceale it, for this haue I declared without

morninge came and that the ſolempnities were fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
I came foorth ſanctified with twelue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

conſideringe that many perſons ſawe me at that time:
there I was commaunded to ſtande vppon a ſeate of
woodde which ſtoode in the middle of the temple, before
the figure and remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Goddeſſe, my veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was of fine linnen, couered &amp; embrodered with
flowres, I had a pretious cope vpon my ſhoulders han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge
downe to the grounde, whereon were beaſtes
wrought of diuers colours, as Indian Dragons, &amp; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perborian
Gryphones, whome in forme of brides the

ſuch a habit, a celeſtiall Stole: in my right hande I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a light torche, and a garlande of flowres vpon my
head, with Palme leaues ſtroutinge out on euery ſide:
I was adorned like vnto the Sunne, and made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of an Image, in ſuche ſorte that all the people
compaſſed about to beholde me: Then they beganne to
ſolemniſe the feaſt of my natiuitie, and the newe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
with ſumptuous bankets and delicate meates:
the thirde day was likewiſe celebrate with like cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
with a religious dinner, and with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
of the order, when I had continued there
<pb facs="tcp:23299:133"/>
a good ſpace I conceaued a meruelous pleaſure and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
in beholding ordinarily the Image of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe,
who at length admoniſhed me to departe home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
not without rendringe of thankes, whiche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
were not ſufficient, yet they were according to
my power: How be it I could vnneth be perſwaded to
depart, before I had fallen proſtrate before the face of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Goddeſſe, and wiped her ſteppes with my face, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I beganne ſo greatly to wéepe and ſighe, that my
woordes were interrupted, and as deuouring my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
I began to ſay in this ſorte: O holy &amp; bleſſed Dame,
the perpetuall comfort of humaine kinde, who by thy
bountie and grace nouriſheſt all the world, and beareſt
a great affection to the aduerſities of the miſerable as
a louing mother, thou takeſt no reſt, neyther arte thou
idle at any time in giuinge thy benefites, and ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
all men aſwell on lande as ſea, thou arte ſhe that
putteſt away all ſtormes and daungers from mans
life by thy right hande, whereby likewiſe thou reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
the fatall diſpoſitions, appeaſeſt the great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes
of fortunes, and kéepeſt backe the courſe of the
ſtarres, the Gods ſupernall doth honour thée: the Gods
infernall hath thée in reuerence: thou enuironeſt al the
worlde, thou giueſt light to the Sunne, thou gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
the world, thou treadeſt downe the power of Hell:
By thy meane the times returne, the Planets reioyſe,
the Elementes ſerue: at thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement the windes
doo blowe, the cloudes encreaſe, the ſéedes proſper, and
the fruictes preuayle, the birdes of the ayre, the beaſtes
of the hill, the Serpentes of the denne, and the fiſhes
of the ſea, doo tremble at thy maieſtie, but my ſpirite is
not able to giue thée ſufficient prayſe, my patrimonie
is vnable to ſatiſfie thy ſacrifice, my voyce hath no
power to vtter that which I thinke, no if I had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23299:133"/>
mouthes and ſo many tongues: How be it as a
good religious perſonne, and according to my eſtate, I
wil alwaies kéepe thée in remembraunce, and cloſe thee
within my breſt. When I had ended mine orayſon, I
wente to embraſe the great Prieſte Mithra my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Father and to demaunde his pardon, conſidering
I was vnable to recompence the good whiche he had
done me: After great gréetinges &amp; thankes I departed
from him to viſitte my parents &amp; fréendes. And within
a while after by the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Goddeſſe, I made
vp my packquette and toke ſhippyng towardes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie
of Rome, where, with a proſperous winde I arriued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the twelfe day of December. And the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
which I had there was daily to make my praiers to
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſoueraigne Goddeſſe Iſis, who by reaſon of the place
where her temple was builded, was called Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſis, &amp;
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually adored of the people of Rome: Her miniſter
&amp; woorſhipper was I howbeit I was a ſtraunger to her
Church, &amp; vnknowen to her religion there: When the
yeare was ended, &amp; that the Goddeſſe warned me again
to receaue this newe order &amp; conſecration, I merueled
greatly what it ſhould ſignifie, &amp; what ſhould happen,
conſidering that I was a ſacred perſon already. But it
fortuned y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> while I partly reaſoned with my ſelfe, and
partely examined y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing with the Prieſtes &amp; Biſhops,
there came a newe &amp; meruelous thought to my minde,
that is to ſay: I was onely religious to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goddeſſe Iſis,
but not ſacred to the religion of great Oſiris the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Father of all the Goddes, betwéene whome,
although there was a religious vnitie and concorde,
yet there was a great difference of order and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
And becauſe it was neceſſary that I ſhoulde like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be a miniſter vnto Oſiris, there was no longe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay:
For in the night after appered vnto me one of that
<pb facs="tcp:23299:134"/>
order, couered with linnen robes, holding in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des
ſpeares wrapped in yu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and other thinges not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to declare, which he lefte in my chamber, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
in my ſeate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to me ſuche thinges as were
neceſſary for the ſumptuons bankette of mine entry.
And to the ende I might knowe him againe, he ſhowed
me how the ankle of his left foote was ſomewhat may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
whiche cauſed him a litle to halte. After that I did
manifeſtly knowe the will of the God Oſiris, when
Mattins was ended, I wente from one to an other to
finde him out whiche had the haltinge marke of his
foote, accordinge as I learned by my viſion, at length
I founde it true: for I perceaued one of the company of
the Prieſtes who had not onely the token of his foote,
but the ſtature and habite of his body, reſemblyng in
euery point as he appeared in the night, he was called
<hi>Aſinius Marcellus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſinius by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the letter i. is made Aſinus.</note> a name not muche diſagreynge from
my tranſformation, by and by I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nte to him, whiche
knew well inough all the matter, as beynge moniſhed
by like precept in the nighte: for the night before as he
dreſſed the flowres and garlandes about the head of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
God Oſiris, he vnderſtoode by the mouth of his Image,
which tolde the predeſtinations of all men, how he had
ſent a poore man of Madaura, to whom he ſhould mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
his ſacramentes, to the ende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he ſhould receaue a
rewarde by diuine prouidence, and the other glory, for
his vertuous ſtudies, when I ſawe my ſelfe thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
vnto religion, my deſire was ſtopped by reaſon
of pouertie, for I had ſpente a great parte of my goodes
in trauell and peregrination, but moſt of all in the citie
of Rome, whereby my lowe eſtate withdrewe me a
great while: In the ende, being oftentimes ſtirred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
not without great trouble of minde, I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined
to ſel my roabe for a litle money: howbeit, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23299:134"/>
for all my affaires. Then the Prieſte ſpake vnto
me, ſaiyng: How is it that for a little pleaſure thou art
not aferde to ſell thy veſtimentes, and entring into ſo
great ceremonies, doſt feare to fall into pouertie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thy ſelfe, and abſtaine from all animall meates, as
beaſtes and fiſhe. In the meane ſeaſon I did frequent
the ſacrifices of Serapis, whiche were done in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night,
which thing gaue me great comfort to my peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and miniſtred vnto me more plentifull liuing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
I gained ſome money in hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting to the court,
by reaſon of my lattin tongue. Immediatly after, I
was eftſones called and admoniſhed by the god Oſiris,
to receiue a thirde order of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then I was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſtonied, becauſe I coulde not tell what this newe
viſion ſignified, or what the intent of the Celeſtiall
Goddes was, doubting leaſt the former Prieſtes had
giuen me ill councell, and fearinge that they had not
faithfully enſtructed me, beinge in this maner as it
were incenſed. The God Oſiris, appeared to me the
night! folowing, and geuing me admonition, ſaiynge:
There is no occaſion why thou ſhouldeſt be aferd with
ſo often order of Religion, as though there were ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
omitted, but that thou ſhouldeſt rather reioyſe,
ſince as it hath pleaſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goddes to cal thée thrée times,
when as there was neuer yet any perſone that atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to the order but once: Wherfore thou maiſt thinke
thy ſelfe moſt happy for ſo great benefites. And knowe
thou that the Religion which thou muſt nowe receiue,
is right neceſſary, if thou meane to perſeuer in the
woorſhipping of the Goddeſſe and to make ſolempnitie
on the feſtiual day with thy bleſſed habite, which thing
ſhalbe a glory and renoume to thée. After this ſorte
the diuine maieſtie perſwaded me in my ſléepe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by and by I went towardes the Prieſt, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:23299:135"/>
all that which I had ſéene, then I faſted the ſpace of
tenne daies according to the cuſtome, and of mine own
proper wil I abſtained lenger then I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded:
And verely I did nothing repent of the paine whiche I
had taken, &amp; of the charges which I was at, conſidering
that the diuine prouidence had giuen me ſuch an order
that I gayned much money in pleadinge of cauſes: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
after a few dayes the great God Oſiris appeared
to me in the night, not deſguiſed in any other forme
but in his owne eſſence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundinge me that I ſhould
be an Aduocate in the court, &amp; not feare the ſclaunder &amp;
enuie of ill perſons, whiche bare me ſtomacke &amp; grudge
by reaſon of my doctrine, whiche I had gotten by much
labour: moreouer he woulde not that I ſhoulde be any
lenger of the nomber of his Prieſtes, but he allotted
me to be one of the Decurious &amp; Senatours: and after
he appointed me a place within the auncient Pallaice,
which was erected in the time of Silla, whereas I exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
mine office in great ioy with a ſhauen crowne.</p>
