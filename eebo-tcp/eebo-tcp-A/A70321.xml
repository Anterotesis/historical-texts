         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

for taking away the Book of Common-Prayer, and for
eſtabliſhing and putting in execution of the Directory
for the publique worſhip of God; It is ſaid to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among other things, That the Book of Common-Prayer ſhould not
remain, or be from thenceforth uſed in any Church, Chappell or place

Paper ſet forth, ſhould be from thenceforth uſed, purſued, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in all exerciſes of publique Worſhip of God in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
Church, Chappell, and place of publique Worſhip. And by
another printed Paper, dated the 23. day of Auguſt laſt paſt, intituled,
All Ordinance of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament,
for the more effectuall putting in execution the Directory for publique
Worſhip, &amp;c. particular directions are ſet down for the diſperſing,
publiſhing, and uſe of the ſaid Directory, in all pariſhes, Chappelries,
and Donatives, and for the calling in and ſuppreſſing of all Books of
Common-Prayer, under ſeverall forfeitures and penalties to be levyed
and impoſed upon conviction before Iuſtices of Aſſize, or of Over and
Terminer, and of the Peace, as by the ſaid two printed Papers may
appeare. And taking into Our conſideration, that the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer, which is endeavoured thus to be aboliſhed, was compiled
in the times of Reformation, by the moſt learned and pious men of that
Age, and defended and confirmed with the Martyrdome of many; and
was firſt eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament in the time of King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the ſixth, and never repealed or laid aſide, ſave only in that ſhort
time of Queen Maries Reign, upon the returne of Popery and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition;
and in the firſt yeare of Queen Elizabeth, it was again revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, and the repeale of it then
declared by the whole Parliament, to have béen to the great decay of
the due honour of God, and diſcomfort to the Profeſſors of the truth of
Chriſts Religion: and ever ſince it hath béen uſed and obſerved for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
foureſcore yeares together, in the beſt times of peace and plenty
that ever this Kingdome enjoyed; and that it conteines in it an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Forme of Worſhip and Service of God, grounded upon holy
Scriptures, and is a ſingular meanes and helpe to devotion in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and that, or ſome other of the like Forme, ſimply neceſſary
in thoſe many Congregations, which cannot be otherwiſe ſupplyed by
learned and able men, and kéeps up an uniformity in the Church of
England; And that the Directory, which is ſought to be introduced, is
a meanes to open the way, and give the liberty to all ignorant Factious
or evill men, to broach their own fancies and conceits, be they never ſo
wicked and erroneous; and to miſ, lead People into ſin and Rebellion,
and to utter thoſe things, even in that which they make for their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in their Congregations as in Gods preſence, which no conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man can aſſent or ſay Amen to. And be the Miniſter never ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and religious, yet it will breake that uniformity which hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:61555:3"/>
hath béen held in Gods ſervice, and be a meanes to raiſe Factions and
diviſions in the Church; And thoſe many Congregations in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
where able and religious Miniſters cannot be maintained, muſt
be left deſtitute of all helpe or meanes for their publique worſhip and
ſervice of God: And obſerving likewiſe, that no reaſon is given for
this alteration, but only inconvenience alleadged in the generall (and
whether pride and avarice be not the ground, whether rebellion and
deſtruction of Monarchy be not the intention of ſome, and ſacriledge
and the Churches poſſeſſions the aymes and hopes of others, and theſe
new Directories, the meanes to prepare and draw the people in for all,
Wée leave to him who ſearches and knowes the hearts of men,) And
taking into Our further conſideration, that this alteration is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by colour of Ordinances of Parliament made without and againſt
Our conſent, and againſt an expreſſe Act of Parliament ſtill in force,
and the ſame Ordinances made as perpetuall binding Lawes, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
penalties and puniſhments, which was never, before theſe times,
ſo much as pretended to have been the uſe or power of Ordinances of
Parliament, without an expreſſe Act of Parliament, to which Wée
are to be parties. Now leſt Our ſilence ſhould be interpreted by ſome
as a connivance or indifferency in Us, in a matter ſo highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Worſhip and Service of God, the Peace and Unity of the
Church and State, and the eſtabliſh'd Lawes of the Kingdome, Wée
have therefore thought fit to publiſh this Our Proclamation; And
Wée do hereby require and command all and ſingular Miniſters in all
Cathedrall and Pariſh-Churches, and other places of publique Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
within Our Kingdome of England or Dominion of Wales; and
all other to whom it ſhall appertaine, that the ſaid Booke of Common-Prayer
be kept and uſed in all Churches, Chappels, and places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Worſhip, according to the ſaid Statute made in that behalfe in
the ſaid firſt yeare of the ſaid late Quéen Elizabeth; And that the ſaid
Directory be in no ſort admitted, received, or uſed, the ſaid pretended
Ordinances, or any thing in them conteined to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
And Wee do hereby let them know, that whenſoever it ſhall
pleaſe God to reſtore Us to Peace, and the Lawes to their due courſe
(wherein Wée doubt not of his aſſiſtance in his good time) Wée ſhall
require a ſtrict account and proſecution againſt the breakers of the ſaid
Law, according to the force thereof. And in the meane time, in ſuch

ſuffering themſelves thus to be deprived of the uſe and comfort of the
ſaid Booke. Given at Our Court at Oxford this thirteenth day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,

but aire and vapour been vomited out againſt it, objections of
little force to conclude any thing, but onely the reſolute contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious,
either ignorance, or malice of the objectors, which might
at large be proved, both by the view of all the charges that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

which they are accuſable, are therefore not the leſſe, but the more
vehemently accuſed, proſecuted, and dragg'd to execution, that
the puniſhment may prove them guilty, which nothing elſe could,
it being more probable in the judgement of the multitude, (who

appointed to puniſh vileneſſes, will not be ſo likely to commit them, ſo

any that an Aſſembly of wiſe men have ever acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be guilty of, no one of the three Motives being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of ſtrength to beare ſuch a ſuperſtructure, and therefore all
together being as unſufficient; for if the concluſion were only
of the <hi>prudence,</hi> or <hi>expedience,</hi> of taking it away, ſomewhat might
be pretended for that inference from the premiſes, ſuppoſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61555:8"/>
them true: But when 'tis of <hi>neceſſity</hi> (and that twice repeated
and ſo not caſually fallen from them) there muſt then be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of <hi>precept divine</hi> in the premiſes to induce that <hi>neceſſity,</hi> or
elſe it will never be induced: for I ſhall ſuppoſe it granted by
them with whom I now diſpute, that nothing is <hi>neceſſary</hi> in the
worſhip of God, but what God hath preſcribed, the <hi>neceſſity
of precept</hi> being the only one that can have place in this matter,
and the <hi>neceſſitas medii,</hi> being moſt improper to be here pleaded.
But that there is no ſuch <hi>direct precept,</hi> ſo much as pretended to
by thoſe three motives, it is clear, and as clear, that all together do
not amount to an <hi>interpretative precept.</hi> For that a lawfull thing
though preſt with manifold inconveniences ſhould be removed,
is no where <hi>commanded the lawfull Magistrate,</hi> but left to his
prudence to judge whether there be not conveniences on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, which may counterballance thoſe inconveniences;
much leſſe is it commanded the inferiour Courts in deſpight of
King and ſtanding Law. For what ever of expedience, and ſo of
prudence might be ſuppoſed to interpoſe, that may be ſufficient
to incline a <hi>Wiſe Magiſtrate</hi> to make a Law, but not any elſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to uſurpe the power of a Law-maker, or to do any thing
contrary to <hi>eſtabliſh'd</hi> Lawes; there being nothing that can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the leaſt diſobedience of Subjects to their <hi>Prince,</hi> or the <hi>Lawes</hi>
of the Kingdom, but that obligation to that one ſuperiour Law
of that higher Prince, <hi>our Father which is in heaven,</hi> which being

that can make it lawfull for any ſo to diſobey, much leſſe <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

yet ſtealing it ſecretly into the concluſion, ſo each deceiving and
being deceived by each other, I am not ſure that my conjecture is

find in many places of the <hi>Directory</hi> certain footſteps of this kind
of compoſition and compliance, and mixture of thoſe ſo diſtant
ſorts of Reformers. 2. Becauſe the Presbyterians which have
ſformerly appeared both in other and in this Kingdome (whoſe
copy theſe preſent reformers of that party hath tranſcribed) have
conſtantly avowed the lawfulneſſe of Liturgy, and ſo cannot
affirme any neceſſity of aboliſhing; witneſſe <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe

obtaining his favour in that buſineſſe about the year 1585. he
demanded of them, whether they deſired the taking away of all
Liturgy, they anſwered, no, he then required them to make a
better, ſuch as they would deſire to have ſettled in the ſtead of
this. The firſt Claſſis did accordingly frame a new one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
according to the <hi>Geneva</hi> forme: But this the ſecond Claſſis
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61555:9"/>
diſliked, and altered in 600. particulars; that again had the fate
to be quarrell'd by the third Claſſis, and what the third reſolved
on, by the fourth; and the diſſenting of thoſe Brethren, as the
Diviſion of tongues at <hi>Babel,</hi> was a faire means to keep that

by this way of evacuation. I ſhall adde no more to this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,

to the change of the Government into a Forme quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that which for 1600 years hath prevailed in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Church of Chriſt, there ſetled by the Apoſtles, may be allow'd
the ſtile of <hi>inſignis mutatio;</hi> a mutation of ſome conſiderable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to a Chriſtian State, which being admitted altogether
without any preparative alleviating ſteps, will (by the rapid ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain

that if Conſcience would permit the uſe of it, I ſhould allow it
the title of neceſſary. But to make ſhort of this, no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that theſe Armies were raiſed or continued to ſubdue the

'twas found neceſſary for the Houſes to declare, that they had

together. This being too much to be alwaies continued in the
Church, and unſuteable to every mans buſineſſe, is ſaid to have
been the occaſion that S. <hi>James</hi> firſt made choice of ſome ſpeciall
Prayers moſt frequently by them uſed, which was after called his
<hi>Liturgy,</hi> which (or ſome other in the diſguiſe of that) the

that again St. <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> how certain theſe reports are, I ſhall
not take upon me to affirme, but only adde, that the Greek
Church, who are moſt likely to know the truth of it by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
do retain all theſe three <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and would loudly laugh
at any man that ſhould make doubt whether St. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> were not the Authors of them. 2. That the
judgement of that Church (if they are deceived alſo, and may
not be thought worthy to be heeded by our Aſſemblers) is yet
an argument of great authority to any prudent man, if not that
theſe <hi>Liturgies</hi> were purely the ſame with thoſe that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61555:14"/>
by that Apoſtle, and thoſe holy men, yet that there were
ſuch things as <hi>Liturgies</hi> of their penning. The like might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

turn all bowing or kneeling, or bodily worſhip out of the
Church, (were there any ſuperſtition in any one or more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,

better to preſcribe it at fit times, then the <hi>Directory</hi> to omit all
mention of it at all times, unleſſe by way of diſlike and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which concluſion will be the more eaſily evinced againſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61555:18"/>
them, by asking them whether in their Family-Parlour-Prayers,
or in their private Cloſet Prayers, they do not approve and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
that geſture; which as I believe in charity they do, ſo I
muſt from thence inferre, that by them <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> is the
only place thought fit to be deſpiſed. And if it be replyed, that
the <hi>Directory</hi> forbids not kneeling, but only commands it not,
leaving it free to uſe or not to uſe, I anſwer, 1. That the effect
of this liberty is very remarkeable among them, and equall to
that of a prohibition, no man almoſt of their perſwaſion ever
kneeling in their Churches. 2. That the never ſo much as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending</hi>
it, is very near a <hi>forbidding</hi> of it. 3. That <hi>bowing</hi>
or <hi>adoration</hi> is directly forbidden once (which, by the way, is as
much the defining of a Ceremony, <hi>viz.</hi> that of ſtanding or going
upright, and ſo as contrary to the Independents perſwaſions, and
to the great clamorous complaint for <hi>Liberty</hi> in Ceremonies, as
any preſcription <hi>of kneeling or bowing can</hi> be.) 4. That knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
alſo is at the receiving of the Sacrament forbidden, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of conſequence, ſitting being preſcribed, and therefore
that that reply or excuſe is falſe alſo. And ſo now what <hi>ſpeciall
advantage</hi> this is like to bring in to this Church of ours, to have
the Bodies of negligent, or prophane, or Factions men left
(without any ſo much as an admonition) to their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſo what depth of Eccleſiaſticall policy there was
which made this change ſo <hi>neceſſary,</hi> I deſire may now be

our Saviour commanding, <hi>when you pray, ſay our Father;</hi> we

purpoſe, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ever be upon my knees in Prayer, and
riſe up without adding Chriſts forme to my imperfect petitions.</hi> And
whereas this <hi>Directory</hi> is ſo bountifull, as to recommend this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

and the reſponſes after each of them, though it be not antiently
found in the Church, as a part of the Service, (but only retain'd
in the <hi>Catechiſme</hi>) till <hi>King Edwards</hi> ſecond Liturgy, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſure no charge of Popery to be affixt on it) yet ſeemeth it to
me a very profitable part of devotion, being made uſe of as it
ought. The Prieſt after a premiſed prayer for <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>love and
keep Gods Commandements,</hi> is appointed to ſtand and read every
of the Commandements diſtinctly to the people, as a kind of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> bringing them from God to them; Theſe are they to
receive in the humbleſt affection of heart, and poſture of body,
as means to try and examine themſelves, and to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a ſenſe of their ſeverall failings, and thereupon implore
(every one for himſelfe, and for others, even for the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
firſt Gods mercy for pardon for all that hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the letter of each commandement, or what ever
Chriſt and the Goſpell hath ſet down under any, or reducible to
any of thoſe heads. 2. <hi>Grace</hi> to performe for the time to come,
what ever may be acceptable to Chriſt in that particular. This
being thus diſtinctly and leaſurely done to each particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
the heart enlarging to every particular under that, proves
an excellent forme of confeſſion of ſinnes, and of reſolution (and
prayer for ſtrength) to forſake them. And let me tell you, were
Gods pardon thus fervently and often called for by each hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoule in a Kingdome, for every mans <hi>perſonall,</hi> and the whole
Kingdomes <hi>Nationall</hi> ſins, <hi>the Atheiſme ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>practicall,</hi>
the <hi>impiety, infidelity, want of love</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>worſhip of God. &amp;c.</hi>
in the firſt Commandement, and ſo throughout all the reſt, and
<hi>the grace of God,</hi> to worke all the contrary graces in every heart,
in the heart of the whole <hi>Kingdome;</hi> as humbly and heartily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
the benefit would certainly be ſo great, and ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that none but <hi>Satan,</hi> who is to be dethroned, and part with

by relation to theſe <hi>guifts</hi> and <hi>oblations,</hi> as appears by the

moſt ridiculouſly applyed to the body of Chriſt. I have beene
thus large in ſhewing the originall of the <hi>Offertory,</hi> becauſe it
hath in all ages been counted a ſpeciall part of divine worſhip,

inſtead of the ancient <hi>oblation of Bread and Wine,</hi> the offering of
money was by conſent receiv'd into the Church in memory of
the pence in <hi>Judas's</hi> ſayle. Now that this offering of Chriſtians
to God for pious and charitable uſes, deſigned to them who are
his Proxyes and Deputy-receivers, may be the more liberally
and withall more ſolemnly performed, many portions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
are by the <hi>Liturgy</hi> deſigned to be read to ſtirre up and

and when it is received and brought to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he

all Antients, but wholly omitted in this <hi>Directory</hi> (only a caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>credenda</hi> to be believ'd by all then the <hi>Apoſtles
Creed,</hi> as 'tis explain'd in our <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> doth propoſe, and lay
the greater weight upon conſideration and performance of the
<hi>vow of Baptiſme,</hi> and all the commands of God as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
(and ſo the obligation, to obedience enlarged) by
Chriſt, and then only adde the explication of the nature and uſe
of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in thoſe moſt commodious and intelligible

to give an intelligent account of every one of theſe, which
being done, every ſuch Child ſo prepared, ought to be brought

ſuch Child attain'd to years of underſtanding ſhall <hi>ſingly</hi> and

make a firme publick <hi>renew'd promiſe,</hi> that by Gods helpe

and promiſe ſo heightned with all thoſe <hi>ſolemnities,</hi> will
in any reaſon have a mighty impreſſion on the Child, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence

Thus have I, as briefly as I could, examined all the pretended

more then <hi>lanced</hi> even to a <hi>deliquium animae,</hi> to many <hi>fainting

an <hi>Exit.</hi> The leafes which have been ſpent in this ſearch,
as it may ſeem <hi>unneceſſarily,</hi> might perhaps have been better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;
Yet will it not be unreaſonable to expect a favourable
reception of them, when 'tis conſidered, that by this meanes a
farther labour is ſpared, there needing no farther <hi>anſwer</hi> to the
whole <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Directory,</hi> or any part of it, when it ſhall thus
appeare, that there was no <hi>neceſſity</hi> for the change, nay (which

of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> unleſſe ſome better offer or bargain were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

moſt neceſſary. And therefore when we have conſidered the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

to anſwer (not me, but) himſelfe in it ſincerely, and without

in the Actors. Or if the <hi>examples of ſeverity</hi> in her dayes, (the

that anger is a <hi>cauſeleſſe anger,</hi> which he that is guilty of, muſt

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61555:39"/>
minds truly devout, as if it were longer then it is; and that it
may not do ſo, I am ſure it is very prudently framed with as
much variety, and as moderate length of each part, as could be
imagined, and ſure he that ſhall compare the practices, will find
the <hi>burthen</hi> and <hi>length</hi> both to <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to be as great,

unprofitable burthenſome Ceremonies.</hi> Every of thoſe Epithets
is a <hi>calumny;</hi> for 1. They are not many, To the People I am
ſure, For <hi>kneeling</hi> and <hi>ſtanding,</hi> which are the only <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
in the daily <hi>Service,</hi> will not make up that number (and for the
reſt, there is but a ſuperaddition of ſome one in each <hi>Service.</hi>)
As for <hi>ſitting bare,</hi> if reaſon it ſelfe will not preſcribe that civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be paid to God in the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> (where without any
poſitive precept, <hi>Jacob put off his ſhooes from his ſeet</hi>) neither
doth our <hi>Liturgy</hi> preſcribe it. 2. They are not <hi>unprofitable,</hi>
but each of them tending to advance the buſineſſe to which they

and the reſt proportion'd to the buſineſſe in hand; and
3. If not <hi>many,</hi> nor <hi>unprofitable,</hi> then not burthenſome alſo.
As for the <hi>diſquieting the Conſciences of many godly Miniſters and

by what hath formerly been ſaid, and the no-objection in this
<hi>Directory</hi> againſt any ſuch, it appears that there is no <hi>Ceremony</hi>
appointed in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> which is <hi>improper</hi> or <hi>impertinent</hi> to the

then <hi>for mens Conſciences to be diſquieted,</hi> it argues that they have
not, in that manner, as they ought, deſired <hi>information;</hi> as for
<hi>Miniſters,</hi> we know that all that have been received into that
Order, have voluntarily <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> to them, and conſequently
have <hi>receded</hi> from their own ſubſcription, if they have refuſed to

had to the Conſciences of thoſe, who will ſubmit to your <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi>
and afterward refuſe to conforme unto it. I am ſure
the denuntiations which we have heard of againſt the <hi>diſſenting

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61555:39"/>
now lately concerning the <hi>depravers</hi> of your <hi>Directory</hi>) have
been none of the mildeſt, although thoſe are your own fellow-Members,
that have aſſiſted you as affectionately in the grand

by having once conformed to you in thoſe particulars. And
ſo 3. For <hi>depriving them of the Ordinances of God, &amp;c.</hi> if that
were the <hi>puniſhment</hi> appointed for the <hi>obſtinate</hi> and <hi>refractory,</hi>
'tis no more then the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the Land appointed for their <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and in that ſure not without any example in <hi>Scripture</hi> and
<hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> practice, who appointed ſuch <hi>perverſe Perſons to be
avoided,</hi> which is a <hi>cenſure</hi> as high as any hath been here on ſuch
inflicted. What <hi>Ordinances</hi> they were of which ſuch men were
deprived, I conceive is ſpecified by the next words, that <hi>ſundry
good Chriſtians have been by means thereof kept from the Lords
Table,</hi> which muſt needs referre to thoſe that would not <hi>kneele</hi>
there, and why that ſhould be ſo unreaſonable, when the very
<hi>Directory</hi> layes the matter ſo, that none ſhall receive with them
who do not <hi>ſit,</hi> there will be little ground, unleſſe it be that no
poſture in the <hi>Service</hi> of God can be <hi>offenſive,</hi> but only that of
<hi>kneeling,</hi> which indeed hath had the very ill luck by <hi>Socinus,</hi> in

confeſſing thereby that ſome mens hearts are ſo ſet on

the charge of <hi>Offence</hi> is laid on the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and how little 'tis
prov'd by theſe <hi>reaſons,</hi> I ſhall only adde, that the propoſition
pretended to be thus proved by theſe particulars, is much larger
then the proofe can be imagined to extend. For part of the

nor <hi>they deprived of Gods Ordinances by that means.</hi> In
which reſpect 'tis neceſſary for us to conclude, that the word
<hi>Offence,</hi> as applyed to them, is taken in that other notion, that
they are <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> at it. To which we then muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that although there is no guilt inferred from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
this fate of being <hi>diſliked</hi> by ſome, but rather that it is to
be deemed an ill indication to be <hi>ſpoken well of by all,</hi> yet have
we never heard of any Forraigne Church which hath expreſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch offence; the utmoſt that can be ſaid, is (and yet not
ſo much as that is here ſuggeſted) that ſome particular men
have expreſt ſuch diſlike; to whom we could eaſily oppoſe the
judgment of others more eminent among them who have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſt their approbation of it.<note place="margin">Vid. troubl. of Frank. p. 30. &amp;c.</note> And 'tis obſerveable, that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>

with what he finds) though he were ſo farre tranſported as to
call them <hi>ineptias,</hi> follies, yet addes the Epithet of <hi>tolerabiles,</hi>
that though ſuch, they were yet tolerable. And therefore</p>
            <p>In the third place, I may now conclude, that if all that is
thus affirm'd to prove the <hi>Offence</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> uſed in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> were (after all this evidence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)

of the preſent deſigne which is not <hi>reforming,</hi> but <hi>aboliſhing</hi> both
of that and all other <hi>Liturgy.</hi> Were there <hi>Offence</hi> in <hi>the length of
the Service,</hi> that <hi>length</hi> might be reform'd, and yet <hi>Liturgy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
were there <hi>offence</hi> in the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>miſchiefe in the

be left free, that <hi>Conformity</hi> be not thus preſt, and ſtill <hi>Liturgy</hi>
be preſerved inviolate. As for the Forreigne Churches, 1. I
ſhall demand, whether only <hi>ſome</hi> are thus offended, or <hi>all.</hi> Not
all, for ſome of the wiſeſt in theſe Churches have commended
it; and if <hi>ſome only,</hi> then it ſeems others are not <hi>offended,</hi> and
why muſt we be ſo partiall, as to <hi>offend</hi> &amp; <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> ſome, that we

may eſcape the offending others? not ſure becauſe we more eſteem
the judgments of the latter, for by the Apoſtles rule the <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>

2. I ſhall ſuppoſe that their <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or their having none

not be as much obliged to change for the ſatisfying of us, as we
of them? I am aſhamed to preſſe this illogicall diſcourſe too

which I <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. That if this be true, it is very ſtrange that

hence will be, that either theſe preſent Aſſemblers concurred
not in judgment with thoſe <hi>many able and faithfull Miniſters</hi>

is wholly <hi>extrinſecall</hi> and impertinent to the buſineſſe of

the Biſhops thus to reſcue and vindicate it? I ſhall not expect it

of the <hi>Liturgy:</hi> for theſe two, if <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Schiſme</hi> did
not ſet them at <hi>oddes,</hi> would very friendly and peaceably dwell
together, and each tend much to the proficiency and gain which
might ariſe from either. Prayers would prepare us to <hi>heare</hi> as
we ought, <hi>i. e.</hi> to practice alſo; and <hi>Sermons</hi> might incite and
ſtirre up the languiſhing <hi>devotion,</hi> and enliven and animate it
with <hi>zeale</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> in Prayer. And conſtantly the more we
eſteemed the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and ſet our ſelves to the diſcharge of
<hi>the duty of Prayer,</hi> the more ſhould we profit by <hi>Sermons</hi> which
were thus received into an <hi>honeſt heart</hi> thus fitted, and made
capable of impreſſion by Prayer. Theſe two may therefore live
like <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>why ſhould there be any wrangling or
controverſie betwixt thy Heards-men and my Heards-men?</hi> But
ſeeing it is made a ſeaſon of complaining, I anſwer. 3. That
it is on the other ſide moſt notorious, that in many places the
Sermon hath juſtled out the <hi>Common Prayers,</hi> and upon ſuch a
provocation, (and only to prevent the like partiality or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion)
it may be juſt ſo farre now to adde, that as long as the
<hi>Liturgy</hi> continues in its legall poſſeſſion in this <hi>Church,</hi> there is
no other legall way (as that ſignifies, <hi>commanded by Law) of
the publicke worſhip of God among us,</hi> and although that volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <hi>Prayer</hi> of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> before <hi>Sermon,</hi> when it is uſed, is a
part of the <hi>worſhip of God,</hi> (as all <hi>Prayer</hi> is) yet is it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by the Law, nor conſequently can it without uſurpation
cut ſhort or take away any part of that time which is by that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to the Liturgy; <hi>the free-will offerings,</hi> though permitted,
muſt not ſupplant the daily <hi>preſcribed oblations,</hi> the <hi>Corban</hi> muſt
not excuſe the not honouring of <hi>Parents,</hi> the <hi>cuſtomes</hi> which are
<hi>tolerated,</hi> muſt not evacuate or ſupercede the <hi>precepts</hi> of the
Church. As for <hi>Sermons,</hi> which in this period ſeem the onely
thing that is here oppoſed to <hi>Liturgy;</hi> I hope they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to be as eminent a part of <hi>the worſhip of God</hi> among us
as <hi>Prayer.</hi> If they do, I muſt leſſe blame the poor ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that when they have heard a Sermon or two think they
have ſerved God for all that day or week, nor the generality of
thoſe ſeduced ones, who place ſo great a part of <hi>Piety</hi> in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
and think ſo much the more comfortably of themſelves
from the number of the houres ſpent in that <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> which
hath of late been the only buſineſſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> (which was
by God inſtil'd the <hi>Houſe of Prayer</hi>) and the <hi>Liturgy</hi> at moſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

ſuch <hi>hearers;</hi> the conſideration of that place will give us a right
notion of this buſineſſe, and 'tis this, that <hi>hearing</hi> of <hi>Sermons,</hi> or
what elſe appointed by the Church for our <hi>inſtruction,</hi> is a duty
of every Chriſtian preſcribed in order to <hi>practice</hi> or good life, to
which <hi>knowledge</hi> is neceſſarily preparative, and ſo, like many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

an <hi>objection</hi> or <hi>reproach</hi> againſt us, I ſhall then adde) not only to
ours, but to that <hi>Service</hi> which is performed according to the
<hi>Directory</hi> alſo, the only difference being, that if both by them
were conceived <hi>lawfull,</hi> (as by miſtake, I beleeve, in them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of that phraſe [<hi>pretended warrantableneſſe of impoſing of
Ceremonies.</hi>] May any <hi>Ceremonies be impoſed</hi> or no? if they may,
then an act of Parliament may certainly do it, and ſuch was that

For that <hi>generall,</hi> and that <hi>negative</hi> is notation of ſome <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
if it have any ſence in it. The phraſe [<hi>not irreverently</hi>] pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
ſome <hi>reverence,</hi> there being no middle betweene thoſe

of the other. For I ſhall aske. Is keeping on the hat <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence</hi>
at that time? If it be, <hi>then pulling it off,</hi> or <hi>not keeping
of it on</hi> is a <hi>Reverence</hi> then required; And if this be avoyded by
ſaying, that this is only there <hi>directed,</hi> not <hi>commanded.</hi> I reply,
that an <hi>Ordinance</hi> prefixt for the eſtabliſhing that <hi>direction,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that what is there <hi>directed, ſhall be uſed,</hi> amounts to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.
The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>cauſing the Man to take the
Woman by the right hand in Marriage,</hi> in the <hi>Directory,</hi> which is
the preſcribing of a Ceremony, as much as if the <hi>Ring</hi> had been
appointed to be uſed there alſo. 2. I anſwer, that we know
not of any Ceremonies which have been obtruded or forced on
any which the Law hath not commanded, (or if there had, this
had been nothing to the Liturgy, nor conſequently to be fetcht
in as a part of a charge againſt it;) That of <hi>bowing at the entrance
into the Church,</hi> is the moſt likely to be the Ceremony here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, and yet that is neither a <hi>new one</hi> (never by any <hi>Law</hi> or

               <hi>Canen</hi> turn'd out at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but only not then <hi>impoſed</hi>
under any command, and ſince <hi>diſuſed</hi> in ſome places) nor yet
was it lately <hi>impoſed</hi> or <hi>obtruded on the Church,</hi> but on the other
ſide in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the laſt ſo hated <hi>Convocation,</hi> (which alone
could be ſaid to deale with the <hi>Church</hi> in this matter) it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>recommended,</hi> and <hi>explained,</hi> and <hi>vindicated</hi> from all miſtake,
and then the practice of uſing of it left to every mans <hi>liberty,</hi>
with the caution of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that they <hi>that uſe it ſhould not
condemne them that uſe it not, nor they that uſe it not, judge them
that uſe it.</hi> 3. That the warrantableneſſe of <hi>impoſing</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> was no means or occaſion of <hi>obtruding new dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
but rather an <hi>hedge</hi> to keep off ſuch <hi>obtruſion;</hi> for when it is
reſolved by Law, that ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> ſhall be uſed, 'tis the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
<hi>intimation</hi> of that Law, that all other <hi>uncommanded</hi> are
left free, and that, without authority, (as the word [<hi>daily</hi>] ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the diſcourſe here to mean) no other can be <hi>obtruded.</hi> For
ſure 'tis not the quality of <hi>Law</hi> to ſteale in <hi>illegall</hi> preſſures, but
to keep them out rather, to <hi>define</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> our <hi>Liberty,</hi> not to
<hi>enthrall</hi> us, to <hi>ſet</hi> us <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> of life, not to remove all

this period is compoſed (every one of them with the helpe of

ſuch) I ſhall adde that the very <hi>obtruſion</hi> of ſuch <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
if they had been <hi>obtruded,</hi> would never have encouraged a
rational <hi>Papiſt</hi> to expect our return to them, but only have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that we meant by complying with them, as far as it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to leave them without excuſe, if they did not do ſo too,
comply with us in what they might, and reſtore the Peace and
Union of Chriſtendome by that means. This with any moderate
<hi>Papiſt</hi> would moſt probably work ſome good, and for the more

by them, then thoſe who were <hi>favourers</hi> of the Ceremonies

to believe that paſſage in <hi>Romes Maſter-piece,</hi> which you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

to be taken out of the way, we have not yet heard, but
are rather confident that if a <hi>pention of Rome,</hi> or a <hi>Cardinalls cap,</hi>
will keep them long together to do more ſuch work as this, ſo

hath been a great means to make and encreaſe an idle and unedify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miniſtry, which contented it ſelfe with ſet formes made to their
hands by others without putting forth themſelves to exerciſe the gift
of Prayer.</hi> To this I anſwer, that thoſe Miniſters are not preſently
proved to be <hi>idle and unedifying</hi> which have been content to uſe
the Liturgy. I hope there may be other waies of <hi>labour,</hi> beſide
that of <hi>extemporary Prayer</hi> (which can be no longer a <hi>labour</hi>
then while it is a ſpeaking.) For 1. I had thought that theſe
men might have acknowledged Preaching and Catechizing, the
former at leaſt, to have been the <hi>work</hi> of a Miniſter, and that an
<hi>edifying work,</hi> and that ſure thoſe men have been <hi>exerciſed</hi> in,
who have retain'd the <hi>Liturgy</hi> alſo. 2. <hi>Study</hi> of all kind of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

the incloſure, may paſſe with fober men for a <hi>labour</hi> alſo, and
that which may tend to edification, if it hath <hi>charity</hi> joyned
with it, and that may be had too, without hating the <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
But then 3. I conceive that this <hi>Directory</hi> is no neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
againſt this reproached idleneſſe, or unedifyingneſſe in any
that were formerly guilty of them in the daies of <hi>Liturgy.</hi> For
ſure the labour will not be much increaſed to the Miniſter, that
ſhall obſerve the <hi>Directory,</hi> becauſe either he may pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi>
which will be no <hi>paines,</hi> but of his <hi>lungs</hi> and <hi>ſides</hi> in the <hi>delivery,</hi>
or elſe a forme being compoſed by any, according to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi>
(which is in effect a <hi>Forme</hi> it ſelfe,) he may thenceforth
continue as <hi>idle</hi> as he who uſeth our <hi>forme of Liturgy,</hi> and hee
which hath a mind to be <hi>idle,</hi> may make that uſe of it, and that
you acknowledge, when you interpoſe that caution P. 8. [that
<hi>the Miniſters become not hereby ſlothfull and negligent</hi>] which
were wholly an unneceſſary caution, if this <hi>Directory</hi> made <hi>idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
impoſſible; and if a <hi>caution</hi> will ſerve turne, the like may
be added to our <hi>Liturgy</hi> alſo, without abrogating of it. And
for the edifying, I deſire it may be conſidered, whether the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61555:48"/>
and <hi>impertinences,</hi> which our experience (as well

a ſervant and inſtrument to his <hi>inceſt</hi> and <hi>murthering</hi> of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
And then I ſhall no farther apply, then by asking this
queſtion, did you not take this <hi>Covenant</hi> on <hi>purpoſe</hi> to lay this
obligation upon you, and now pretend that for your <hi>Covenants
ſake,</hi> you muſt needs do it? If you cannot deny this, O then
remember <hi>Herod.</hi> But if you took the <hi>Covenant</hi> without any
ſuch <hi>deſigne,</hi> but now find your ſelves thus enſnared by it, then
rather remember the times to get out of that <hi>ſnare,</hi> and not to
to engage your ſelves faſter in it. 3. I anſwer, that if by <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
be meant that among our ſelves in this Kingdome, the
taking away our <hi>Liturgy</hi> by <hi>Ordinance,</hi> while it remaines eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht

by valid Law, is no over-fit <hi>means</hi> to that end, nothing
but a new <hi>Act,</hi> and an <hi>aſſurance</hi> that all would be obedient to
that <hi>Act,</hi> can be proper for that purpoſe; and I am ſure there
are ſome men in the World, whom if ſuch an <hi>Act</hi> diſpleaſed,
the <hi>obedience</hi> would not be very <hi>uniforme;</hi> what ever it may ſeem

But if it be <hi>uniformity with the beſt reformed Churches</hi> (as your
<hi>Covenant</hi> mentions) then 1. That <hi>uniformity</hi> in matters of <hi>Form</hi>
or <hi>Ceremony</hi> is no way neceſſary, (<hi>Communion</hi> betwixt <hi>Churches</hi>
may be preſerv'd without it) nor near ſo uſefull, as that other
among <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and therefore the bargain will be none of the
moſt thriving, when that acquiſition is paid ſo dear for, <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

Warre;</hi> then as a pretious <hi>band that men muſt pray that it

I ſhall now evidence no farther, then by the parallel <hi>vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
diſlikes,</hi> that the <hi>Preſbyteriall</hi> Government hath already met
with among other of our <hi>reforming Spirits,</hi> very liberally expreſt
in many Pamphlets which we have lately received from <hi>London,</hi>
but in none more fully then in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Book</hi> entituled,
<hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> firſt charging the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> (who formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

<hi>unprofitable,</hi> nor burthenſome, <hi>by the diſquieting of Conſciences,
i.e.</hi> only of the <hi>unquiet, by depriving them of the Ordinance, i.e.</hi>
thoſe who would rather looſe the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> then receive it
<hi>kneeling,</hi> or reverently; <hi>that the offence was extended to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches abroad alſo,</hi> and yet for that no one proof offered,
nor Church named, that was ſo <hi>offended:</hi> and if there were, yet
ſtill this ſuppoſed <hi>offenſiveneſſe,</hi> no juſt plea for any thing but
<hi>Reformation.</hi> So alſo <hi>that by means of the Liturgy, many were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
of the exerciſe of their Miniſtry,</hi> the ſuggeſtion for the
moſt part a meer calumny, and that which was true in it, ready
to be retorted upon theſe Reformers; <hi>that the Prelates have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to raiſe the eſtimation of the Liturgy too high,</hi> yet that no
higher then you would the value of your <hi>Directory,</hi> to have it the
rule for the manner of publick worſhip, or if they did, this is the
fault of thoſe <hi>Prelates,</hi> not of the Liturgy: who yet were ſaid
but to have <hi>labour'd</hi> it neither, not to have <hi>effected</hi> it, and even
that labour or deſire of theirs, to have amounted no higher, then
<hi>Calvins</hi> Letter to the <hi>Protector</hi> would avow; <hi>that this hath been
to the juſtling out of Preaching,</hi> which is rather a ſpeciall help to
it, and preſcribes it, and allowes it its proper place, but hath
oft the ill luck to be turn'd out by Preaching; <hi>that it hath been
made no better then an Idoll,</hi> which if it be a fault in the Liturgy,
is farre more chargeable on the hearing of Sermons, <hi>that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pleaſe themſelves in their preſence, and lip-labour in that ſervice;</hi>
an uncharitable judging of mens hearts, and a crime to which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61555:60"/>
your <hi>Directory</hi> makes men as lyable as the <hi>Liturgy, that our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
is a compliance with Papiſts, and ſo a means to confirme them
in their Idolatry, &amp;c.</hi> whereas it complies with them in nothing
that is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> &amp;c. and by complying with them, where they
do with antiquity and truth, it is more apt to convince them of
their errours, and by <hi>charity</hi> to invite, then by <hi>defiance, that it
makes an idle Miniſtry;</hi> which ſure the <hi>Directory</hi> will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make,
being as fit for that turne, either by forming and conning
the Prayer there delineated, or by depending on preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
as the Liturgy can be, <hi>that it hinders the gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
which if it ſignify the elocution, or conception of words in
Prayer, is not peculiar to the Miniſter, and for any thing elſe,
hindring it no more then the <hi>Directory</hi> doth; <hi>that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it would be matter of endleſſe ſtrife, &amp;c.</hi> which ſure 'tis more
reaſonable to think of an introduction of a <hi>new</hi> way of Service,
then the retaining of the <hi>old; that there be many other weighty
conſiderations, and many particulars in the book, on which this
condemnation is grounded,</hi> and yet not one of theſe mention'd, but
kept to <hi>boil</hi> in their own breaſts, if there be any, or which is more
likely, falſely here pretended to <hi>inflame</hi> the reckoning; <hi>that they
are not mov'd to this by any love of novelty,</hi> and yet do that which
is moſt <hi>novell; that they intend not to diſparage the Reformers,</hi> and
yet do that which is moſt to their <hi>diſparagement, that they do this
to anſwer Gods providence,</hi> which never call'd them to this work;
<hi>to ſatisfie their own Conſcience,</hi> which if Erroneous, muſt not thus
be ſatisfied; <hi>to ſatisfie the expectation of other Churches,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it not, or if they did, might rather conforme to us and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy</hi>
us, <hi>and the deſires of many of the Godly at home,</hi> whoſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is no aſſurance that their deſires are reaſonable, and yet are
not known to have expreſt any ſuch deſires; <hi>that they may give
teſtimony of their endeavours for uniformity,</hi> whereas with other
Churches, there is no ſuch neceſſity of <hi>conforming</hi> in ſuch matters,
and within our ſelves, nothing is ſo contrary to uniformity, as
this <hi>endeavour.</hi> And Laſtly, we have learnt from them, a rule
by which they pretend to forme their <hi>Directory,</hi> the agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to <hi>the word of God and Chriſtian prudence,</hi> and are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to juſtify our <hi>Liturgy</hi> by that rule, againſt all diſputers in
the World; And having now over and above all this, a plaine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61555:61"/>
confeſſion under their own hands, in their <hi>Supply of Prayer,</hi> of
juſtify all that we pretend to, and ſo being ſaved the pains of
any farther ſuperfluous confutation, we ſhall now leave it to the
judgement of any rationall Lay-man in the <hi>New Aſſembly,</hi> to
judge betwixt us and his fellow-Members, whoſe pretenſions are
moſt moderate in this matter, whoſe moſt like Chriſtian, thoſe
that are to reſcue and preſerve, or thoſe which to deſtroy. Thus
in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> holden before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Helena,</hi>
in a controverſie of great importance, <hi>Craton</hi> and <hi>Zenoſimus,</hi> not
only <hi>Lay-men</hi> but <hi>Heathens</hi> were appointed judges or arbitrators
only on this ground, becauſe <hi>Craton</hi> a Philoſopher would not
poſſeſſe any worldly goods, and <hi>Zenoſimus</hi> in time of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip,
never received preſent from any, ſaith <hi>Jacobotius:</hi> thus
alſo <hi>Eutropius</hi> a <hi>Pagan Philoſopher,</hi> was choſen umpire between
<hi>Origen</hi> and the <hi>Marcionites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De concil, l. 2. c. 6.</note> it being ſuppoſed, that ſuch an one
was as fit to underſtand their ſeveral claims, and judge according
to Allegations and proofes as any; And if we fall or miſcarry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch an <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> I ſhall then reſolve, that a <hi>Covenant</hi> may
waſt a ſoule, (even drive the man into the <hi>field</hi> with <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>)
deprive it of thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> common principles of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
(by which, till it be debauched, it is <gap reason="foreign">

in ſome meaſure,<note place="margin">Al. Aphrod. in Top.</note> 
               <hi>to judge of truth,</hi> propoſed and debated before

<hi>intelligent heathen,</hi> then for him. My only appeale in that caſe
ſhall be, to Heaven, that the hoſt of Angels, may by the Lord of
that hoſt be appointed, to guard and aſſiſt that cauſe, and thoſe
Armies whoſe pretentions in this, and all other particulars, are
moſt righteous, and moſt acceptable in his ſight.</p>

               <hi>Now the Lord of all mercies, and God of love and Peace,
grant us to be like minded in all things, that we may joyne
with one heart, and tongue, to praiſe him, and worſhip him, to
