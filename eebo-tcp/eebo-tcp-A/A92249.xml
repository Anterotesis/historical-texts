            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS
Humbly Offered for <hi>Encouraging</hi> his MAJESTIES Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Born Subjects, to Export the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of this Realm to <hi>GERMANY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Securing and Promoting of the Trade of Exporting the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
to <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo as may be moſt Beneficial for the Nation, is a Matter of
ſuch Importance, that it is hoped it may not be unworthy the Conſideration of
the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons,</hi> to whom it is Humbly Repreſented.</p>
            <p>That the Supporting the Ancient Company of <hi>Merchant-Adventurers</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> in the ſaid Trade, will be the moſt Effectual Means to Conduce thereunto. For
this Company having Firſt Introduced the Woollen Manufactures into this Kingdom,
and been the ſole Exporters thereof, the ſame did Flouriſh, under their Government and
Conduct, in a Regulated Way of Trade, for above <hi>Two Hundred and Fifty</hi> Years, until
Foreigners, in the Reign of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the II. were indulged, and admitted
to become Principals in Exporting thereof; ſince which, few or no <hi>Engliſh</hi> are concerned
as Principals in the Trade for <hi>Holland,</hi> but only employed as Factors for the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Woollen Manufactures have been <hi>Falſified</hi> and <hi>Debaſed,</hi> the Clothiers Marks altered
and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Seals counterfeited.</p>
            <p>That Foreigners, as ſoon as they can be Accommodated, Prefer their own Natives, to be
their Factors, who, moſt of them, live obſcurely, and bear no Charge to the Government.</p>
            <p>That the Clothiers have had Great Loſſes by the Foreigners becoming inſolvent to a
very conſiderable Summe.</p>
            <p>That the laying open the ſaid Trade about the beginning of the Reign of His preſent
MAJESTY, and the late Queen of bleſſed Memory, hath not had its deſigned Effect,
as is evident by the general Complaint of the Clothiers.</p>
            <p>That by the Preſerving and Supporting of this Company in their Trade to <hi>Germany,</hi>
the following Benefits will accrue, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Merchants Profit will be Secured to the Nation, which will otherwiſe go to
Foreigners.</p>
            <p>The Younger Sons of the Gentry may be Employed in this Trade abroad, whereas now
the Sons and Servants of Foreigners are, and will be Employed here.</p>
            <p>The Reputation of the Woollen Manufacture will be kept up, and the Goods not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be Debaſed, or go out altogether Unmanufactured, whereby a very great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Handicrafts Men have of late been Impoveriſhed.</p>
            <p>The Market abroad will be plentifully furniſhed with great Quantities and choice of
Goods, as was formerly done. Whereas by the laying open that Trade, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men have
been diſcouraged from keeping their Magazines abroad ſo fully ſtored, whereby the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
hath not been ſufficiently ſupplied.</p>
            <p>The Company's Priviledges at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> which are very Honourable as well as Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to the Nation, will be thereby preſerved, which if once loſt, will be irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>The Cuſtoms at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> Inwards and Outwards, will, by the Stipulations made with
that City, be prevented from being Raiſed, wherein the Members of this Company have
greater Priviledge, and pay much Leſs then their own Burgers; but if the Company is not
Supported, there is no doubt, but in a little time, the Cuſtoms there on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
will be advanced, and conſequently the Conſumption thereof will be leſſened.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation to thoſe Parts will be Reſtored. Whereas of late few or no
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships have been Employed.</p>
            <p>Foreigners will be Prevented from becoming the ſole Maſters of this Trade, and having
the abſolute Command of our Markets, which can never be for the Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And many other Advantages will Accrue to the Nation thereby.</p>
            <p>There can be no Reſtraint of Trade, or Want of Buyers, by paſſing the Bill now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending,
ſince thereby all his Majeſties Natural Born Subjects will be intituled to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of this Society, for as ſmall a Fine as the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons</hi> ſhall think fit;
and every Member, ſo coming in, may Buy and Sell as much as he pleaſes, every one Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for his own Account. And many Eminent Merchants have declared their Reſolutions
of coming into the Company when it ſhall be Eſtabliſhed; and the preſent Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
have very conſiderable Stocks ready to be imployed in this Trade, when the Bill is paſſed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, It is Humbly Hoped, that the ſaid Company may be Supported in their Trade
directly to <hi>Germany.</hi> And that a Foreign Intereſt may not be preferr'd in Oppoſition to the
True Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi>
