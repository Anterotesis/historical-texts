            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>h the Church of</hi> England <hi>with the Tithes of all his Lands and Goods by his Charter Royal,</hi> &amp;c. Adding in the end, <hi>That who ſo ſhould encreaſe the Gift, God would pleaſe to proſper, and encreaſe his daies: But if any ſhould preſume to diminiſh the ſame, that he ſhould be called to an account for it at Gods Judgment Seat,</hi> &amp;c. And this he did, not only as Lord <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> but as <hi>Proprietary</hi> of the whole Land, the Lords and great men at that time having no property or eſtates of permanency, but as accountants to the King, whoſe the whole Land was, and yet they alſo gave their free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which the King required that thereby they might be barred from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Tenant-right; as alſo to oblige them to ſtand in maintenance of Tithes againſt all pretenders.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the people can have no Right, or Propriety in them; for they never bought or paid for them: Neither could they come by Inheritance; For that which was not their fore-fathers could not deſcend to them: Neither came they to them by Donation, which they can never ſhew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be agreeable to Piety, Prudence, Juſtice, and Equity to alienate Tithes from the Miniſtry, which have been ſo freely given by our own Chriſtian Kings out of zeal to advance Gods glory, confirmed by many Acts of Parliament, oft-times renewed, and reitered, as by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> thirty times confirmed, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119484:3"/>
many other Statutes ſince, yea by the Text, and Body of the Common Law, which affirms Tithes to be due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> teſtifies in the <hi>ſecond part of his Reports.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the inconveniencies and evils can poſſibly be foreſeen, which will enſue upon the alteration of ſuch fundamental Laws of this Nation, as have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in force through all changes for above a thouſand years together?</p>
            <p>Tithes have been given to the Church for maintenance of Gods Word and Miniſters, with a curſe to all ſuch as ſhould alienate them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it is agreeable to Piety and Prudence, to pull them from God, to rend them from his Church, to violate the dedication of our Fathers, the Oaths of our Anceſtors, the Decrees of ſo many Parliaments, and to expoſe our ſelves to thoſe horrible curſes which the body of the Nation hath obliged it ſelf to, in caſe they conſented to the alienation of the ſame? as <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem</hi> 10. 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether it be not more then probable that the Miniſtry hath had a propriety in the Tithes in all Chriſtian Churches, ever ſince Chriſtians had a propriety in their eſtates; ſince <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived not much above two hundred <note place="margin">Orig. <hi>Hom. Han Num.</hi> Cypr. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 66.</note> years after Chriſt, tell us, That the community amongſt Chriſtians was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſed in their time, and yet where it was, the Tithes were paid?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether it be not Sacriledge to alienate Tithes from the Church, having been dedicated and conſecrated unto God, either by the voluntary conſent of Churches, or by Donation of Princes? Seeing what is voluntarily conſecrated by man, is confirmed by God, and may not be alienated, <hi>Lev.</hi> 28. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Law is the ſame under the Goſpel, as appears in the example of <hi>Annanias,</hi> Act. 5. 3. whom <hi>Peter</hi> arraignes, and God condemns, for this very Sacriledge. <hi>Why haſt thou</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) kept back part of the price of the Land? Whileſt it remained</hi> (viz. <hi>unſold) was it not thine own? and after it was ſold, was it not in thine own power?</hi> viz. to have conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, or not conſecrated it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>And Annanias hearing theſe words, fell down and gave up the ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether it is not againſt the light of Nature, and cuſtom of all Nations, to diſannull the <hi>Will</hi> of the dead? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be but a mans Covenant</hi> (or Teſtament) <hi>yet if it be confirmed (viz.</hi> by the death of the Teſtator) <hi>no man diſſanulleth it, i. e.</hi> no man ought to diſanull it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tithes having been given by Teſtament, confirmed by the death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Is it not againſt the light of Nature, and cuſtom of all Nations to alienate them? <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. <hi>For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Many Impropriations having been reſtored to the Church by godly Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Gentlemen, and others having been bought in and ſetled in the moſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal way that could be deviſed upon the Miniſtry; Is it not againſt all Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to take them from the Church again? and will it not diſcourage all men for the future from works of Piety and Charity when they ſee them thus perverted?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Whether it be not more then probable that there was a poſitive Precept gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God to the Fathers for the giving to him the tenth part of their ſubſtance, as he had formerly required the ſeventh part of their time? And whether do not the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſo readily giving their tenth, evince this; Or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Precept, Had it not been will-worſhip in them? And do not ſuch poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts (if unrepealed) binde all to the end of the world? as we ſee in the caſe of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Whether Tithes, as an honouring of God, be not enjoyned in the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? As they tend to preſerve the publike worſhip of God, in the ſecond
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119484:3"/>
and fourth Commandement? And as maintenance to the perſons of Miniſters, in the fifth Commandement? being part of the honour due to ſpiritual Parents.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Whether Tithes can be called <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> which were paid long before <hi>Antichriſts</hi> time? And when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> [the Popes of <hi>Rome]</hi> were the firſt that durſt take upon them to alienate them from the Church, by granting Exemptions, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby robbing the Church and Pariſh Miniſters, to gratifie the <note place="margin">This alſo is juſtified by <hi>Bellarm. de clericis,</hi> l. 1. c. 25.</note> Monks and Fryers? And whether <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin.</hi> (who lived about four hundred years ago) were not the firſt that pleaded for theſe alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations made by the Pope? And whether they were not the firſt that to juſtifie the Popes Proceedings, pleaded that Tithes were Jewiſh?</p>
            <p n="12">12 Whether theſe Scriptures do not concern <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as well as they did the <hi>Jews?</hi> Prov. 3. 9, 10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine encreaſe: So ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt out with new wine.</hi> Prov. 20. 25. <hi>It is a ſnare to devoure that which is holy, and after the vow to make enquiry.</hi> Prov. 23. 10, 11. <hi>Remove not the old Land-mark, and enter not into the field of the fatherleſſe: For their Redeemer is mighty, and he ſhall plead their cauſe with thee.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

In Tithes and in Offerings. Ye are accurſed with a curſe: for ye have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me, even this whole Nation. Bring ye all the Tithes into the ſtorehouſe, that there may be meat in mine houſe, and prove me now therewith, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, if I will not open you the windowes of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing, that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it: And I will rebuke the devourer for your ſakes, and he ſhall not deſtroy the fruits of your ground, neither ſhall your vine caſt her fruit before the time in the field, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts: And all Nations ſhall call you bleſſed: And ye ſhall be a delightſome Land, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>

Whether thoſe Texts in the New Teſtament do not prove, that to Goſpel-Miniſters belongs as large, if not larger maintenance than to the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as their Miniſtry is more excellent, and the bleſſings conferred thereby are greater. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 4. <hi>Have we not power</hi>

Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame? For it is written in the Law of Moſes, Thou ſhalt not muzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for Oxen? Or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes no doubt it is written: that he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope: and that he that threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in hope ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, Is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnalthings.</hi> Ver. 13, 14. <hi>Do ye not know that they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple? And they which wait at the Altar, are made partakers with the Altar? Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> Gal. 6. 6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> Phil. 4. 17. <hi>Not that I deſire a gift, but I deſire fruit that may abound to your account.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the World and Doctrine.

14. Whether to ſpeak of a ſufficient maintenance without Tithes, be not a meer fancy, that never was, nor (as I believe) ever will be brought into action? And whether it would not trouble the wiſeſt men that are, to name a ſtipend that would be ſufficient at all times, as Tithes are; which proceeding from the wiſdom of God, cannot be matched, much leſſe betterd by mans wiſdome?</p>
            <p n="15">15. Whether be not Tithes the fitreſt maintenance for the Miniſtry, ſeeing hereby they partake with the people in times of plenty, which will more inlarge their hearts in thankfulneſſe; and ſuffer with them in times of ſcarcity, which will more affect them with ſenſe of Gods judgments? for that when natural affections concur with ſpiritual, they are more active and vigorous.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Whether the practice of the Heathens, which uſed to give a Tenth to their gods, will not riſe up in judgment againſt Chriſtians, if they rob God of the Tenth which their Predeceſſors have given to him?</p>

Whether the judgment of ſo many eminent Divines as have held it Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to alienate that from the Church which was once conſecrated to God, ſhould not lay a reſtraint upon all men from practiſing that which is ſo hazardous and ſcandalous?

               <head>Certain Queries concerning bringing Tithes into a Common Treaſury, and reducing Miniſters to ſtipends.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF Tithes ſhould be brought into a common Treaſury, and Miniſters paid out thence, whether would our Countrey-men that ſay Tithes are ſuch an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burden, be any whit eaſed? Yea would they not be more burdened by how much their Tything would be looked more narrowly into?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would not the trouble of Miniſters be far greater, being enforced to ſend, or go from Market to Market for every buſhel of Corn or Mault, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he ſpends in his houſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a dearth come, would it not tend to the ruine of many Miniſters Families, who will be for ced to ſpend more in a quarter then they receive for their half years allowance?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If things ſhould riſe in the price the next hundred of years as they have done the laſt, how ſhall Miniſters be then able to live upon theſe ſtipends?</p>
               <p n="5">5. How many Officers muſt there be imployed in every County to bring the Tithes into a common Treaſury, all which, either in whole or in part, muſt be maintained out of them? And how will this curtail the Miniſters ſhare?</p>
               <p n="6">6. What attendance muſt Miniſters give quarterly, or each half year, upon the Truſtees, or Treaſurers in every County, till they have liſt or leiſure to pay them? What trouble, journeys and expences will this put them to? How will they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to bribe, and pay for expedition, or to be fobbe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. Will not Miniſters hereby be caſt upon ten<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ations, to ſpeak only pleaſing things (like Trencher-Chaplains) leſt their ſtipends ſhould be taken from them?</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119484:4"/>
8. Can it be expected that Miniſters can or will be ſo liberall to the poor, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to hoſpitality, when they buy all with the peny, as when they have it in Tithes?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Will not ſuch as bear the bag, and upon whom the Miniſters muſt depend for their ſubſiſtance, Lord it over them with pride and contempt enough? as bad, or worſe then the Biſhops and their Chancellors did?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Though ſuch as are of the beſt repute in each County, ſhould be choſen out to be the Treaſurers, yet do we not ſee by daily experience, how men are miſtaken in judging of the honeſty of others? And how many men fall from their former principles of honeſty? and that if neither of theſe ſhould be ſo, yet how apt ſtanding waters are to putrifie.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If contentious ſuits have been between Miniſters and People about Tithes, hath it not for the moſt part ariſen from the peoples covetouſneſs, pretending cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, preſcriptions, or compoſitions, to defraud the Miniſters of their due?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Were not Patrons at the firſt made choice of, to defend the Miniſters right againſt the fraud and injuſtice of the people? And may not the wiſdome of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament finde out the ſame, or ſome ſuch like courſe, whereby the Miniſter ſhall neither be engaged in contentions with his people, nor troubled with avocations from his ſtudy thereby?</p>
               <p n="13">13. May there not ariſe as many or more quarrels, in caſe Tithes be brought into a common Treaſury, whileſt ſome pretend conſcience, and ſo will pay none at all; others think themſelves over-rated; others think that the Tradeſman, who gets more by his Shop than they do by the Plough, ſhould bear an equal ſhare in this common burden? And who then ſhall take courſe to enforce ſuch to pay? If the Treaſurers in the Country, ſurely they will prove but cold Solicitors in anothers cauſe. But ſuppoſe they do ſtir, they muſt ſpend out of the common ſtock; and ſuch ſuits being like to be many, eſpecially in ſuch times as theſe, how will the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtipends be curtailed thereby? Beſides, may it not be ſuppoſed, that they which ſpend of other mens purſes, are like to cut large thougs out of others hides?</p>
               <p n="14">14. If the Countryman ſhall pay a rate in money for his Tithes, will it not come far more hardly from him? even like drops of bloud, money being uſally very ſhort with them. And will he not think it far eaſier to part with a cock of Hay, or a ſheaf of Corn, or ſuch a ſmall thing, than to part with ſo much money as his whole Tithes may come to, once or oftner in the year? And how little will he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eaſed hereby?</p>
               <p n="15">15. If Tithes be brought into a common Treaſury, when a Living is worth two, three, or perhaps four hundred pounds by the year, a great part of it will be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to other places, and will it not certainly be a great grief to the people, that their Tithes ſhall go to they know not whom? certainly to ſuch as neither feed their ſouls with the bread of life, nor their bodies with the ſtaff of bread? And will not their poor want that relief, and themſelves that entertainment, which they uſed to have at their Miniſters houſe, to the aggravation of their diſcontent?</p>
