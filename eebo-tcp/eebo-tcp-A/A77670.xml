            <title>A brief survey of the prophetical and evangelical events of the last times: VVherein that which principally is insisted on, is the prophetical little horn, or man of sin, and evangelical beast, and his seven heads and ten hornes. Shewing by the Scriptures what they be, when their rise, what their work, how long their continuance, and their end and ruine. Much differing from former and common interpretations hereupon. Wherein also those prophecies are briefly touched which concern the persecution of the saints, the falling away of the churches, the night of darknesse, the virgins going forth to meet the bridegroom, the mystical whore, the preaching of the Gospel of the kingdome to all the world, and the gathering of the Jewes into their own land. Being a portion of the paines in searching of the holy Scriptures by several members of the congregation of Orpington in Kent. And now published for the comfort of all those that have an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, and wait, look for, and long after his coming, Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13. / By Capt.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe firſt thing that was to befall the Saints af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death, reſurrection and aſcenſion of <note place="margin">Perſecuton.</note> the Lord Ieſus (and after the gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit were given forth (according to his Promiſe, and command to his Diſciples to wait for in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 49, compared with the 2.

Therefore the people of God are to take notice of his wiſdom and goodneſſe to them, in that he knoweth how much better perſecutions and afflictions are for them than reſt and proſperity, and accordingly adminiſters the ſame to them, in a proportion to the ſtability he hath given to every one of them.</p>
            <p>Now as we have proved that perſecution is the portion of the Saints in this life, becauſe they are not of the world 15. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. So the next thing that was to befall the <note place="margin">2. Falingaway of the Churches.</note> Churches, was their falling away from the Truth of that Doctrine that was taught them by the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles; and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> foretels the Church at <hi>Theſalonica,</hi> that there ſhould be a falling away before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119057:6"/>
the man of ſin would be revealed, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whereof is not ſo much the times of perſecution as the Churches neglect of the Light (the Word) that is left them, by which they ought to walk in the times of darkneſſe. The beginning of the falling away of the Churches; was before <hi>Iohns</hi> writing of the book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> in which the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is exhorted to <hi>Remember from whence ſhe is fallen, and repent and do the firſt works, ar elſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent,</hi> 25. Chapter at the 5. verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid falling away uſhers in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſubſequent thing that we are to treat on, that is the night of darkneſſe, which was foretold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by our Lord Jeſus, <hi>The night cometh, ſaith he, when no man can work.</hi> 9. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. Alſo the ſame Evangeliſt in his 12. Chapter 35, and 46. verſes relateth <note place="margin">3. The night of darkdneſſe.</note> more expreſſions of our ſaid Lord, to the ſame effect; take the words as they are recorded by him, <hi>Then Ieſus ſaid unto them, Yet a little while is the Light with you, walk while you have the Light, leſt darkneſſe come upon you: For he that walketh in darkneſſe knoweth not whether he goeth: I am come a Light into the world, that whoſoever believeth in me ſhould not abide in darkneſſe.</hi> We do not ſay that this night of darkneſſe was immediatly to follow the death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or aſcenſion of Chriſt; for although he be the Day, or great Light of the world <hi>(for by him all things were made that were made,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.) according to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſts expreſſion, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 9. <hi>And the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> according to the Prophet <hi>Malachies</hi> Propheſie, in his 4.

            <p>Now this darkneſſe was to fall upon the <hi>Iewes</hi> firſt, for their rejecting of the Light; the Lord Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moanes their ſad condition for the ſame, ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes,</hi> 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 42. And the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> relates the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Lord Jeſus to them (the words we have already repeated at large upon another occaſion, 12. <hi>Iohn</hi> 35. which compared with the expreſſions of the Appoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jews, for their contradicting and blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As this Night of darkneſſe came upon the Jewes for their rejecting of the Light, ſo in the ſecond place it came upon the Gentiles for their neglecting of it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> bids them have a care of boaſting; take his expreſſions a little at large; <hi>Thou wilt ſay then, the Branches were broken off, that I</hi>

And withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well of the words of the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> (who were believers in Chriſt, and had

            <p>This darkneſſe, after the Aſcention of the Lord Jeſus, deceaſe of the Apoſtles, and falling away of the Churches, was a general darkneſſe, and ſo brought on the night, in which <hi>the Virgins were to goe forth, to meet the Bridegroom,</hi>

            <p>Now for the Perſons that doe goe forth to meet the Bridegroom, the Scripture (as we have already declared) ſtiles them Virgins, that is, pure perſons, and ſuch as thoſe who have laid the two firſt foundation Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance and Faith: that is, have repented that they have ſinned, and doe believe that God hath pardoned their ſins by the bloud of the Lord Jeſus, and therefore ſuch muſt needs be pure perſons.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture makes a clear diſtinction between the Spouſe of Chriſt and Virgins: <hi>Solomon</hi> (the wifeſt of Men) in his Song, ſpeaking in the perſon of the Spouſe to her Beloved, ſaith, <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for thy love is better than Wine.

In which two verſes there is a clear diſtinction I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spouſe <hi>(Let him kiſſe me)</hi> and Virgins <hi>(the Virgins love thee.)</hi> Take one other expreſſion of his in his ſaid Song, <hi>chapter</hi> 6. 8, 9. <hi>There are threeſcore Queens, and</hi>

               <hi>fourſcore Concubines, and Virgins without number.

Pſalm 13, and 14. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; <hi>The Kings Daughter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought Gold: She ſhall be brought unto the King in rayment of needle-work: The Virgins, her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that follow her, ſhall be brought unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octject.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Corinth,</hi> call her there a Virgin? <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note>
               <hi>For I have Eſpouſed you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> She is a chaſt Virgin indeed, but is no where in Scripture called by the Name of Virgins, in the Plurall Number; for <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Cant. 6. 9. before quoted, ſaith, <hi>My Dove, my undefiled is but one, ſhe is the onely one of her Mother;</hi> and that expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 45. 14. will farther clear this Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If there be ſuch a diſtinction between the Church of Chriſt and Virgins, then may not we fafely conclude, that the one hundred fourty and four thouſand, mentioned in the 14. <hi>Revelations</hi> 4.

            <p>What the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Captaines did (who had divided his large Dominions among themſelves) Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory doth declare.

            <p>Which brings us to the <hi>ſixth Head,</hi> Government or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe chief City was <hi>Rome,</hi> which <note place="margin">6th <hi>Head, The</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</note> was built in or about the year of the world 3280. and after the building of the Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> 287. and before the birth of our Lord Chriſt 684. whoſe greatneſſe began to appear out of its infancy, in the time of <hi>Pyrrus</hi> King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus,</hi> Succeſſor to <hi>Caſſander</hi> in half the Kingdome of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> taken from <hi>Caſſanders</hi> Children, by him and <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> King of <hi>Tbracia:</hi> (he being a powerfull Prince, <hi>viz.

            <p>In the dayes of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who began to raign about the year 579<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after <hi>Rome</hi> was built (who was he that commanded Swines fleſh to be offered on ſeverall Altars in the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem)</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> have increaſed their Dominions ſo largely, as that they take upon them, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (who had almoſt ſubdued <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And this was agreeable to <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie, chap. 2. 4. who ſaith, that the <hi>fourth Kingdome from Nebuchadneſſer</hi> ſhould be ſtrong as Iron, <hi>for as Iron breaketh in pieces and ſubdueth all things, and as Iron bruiſetb all thoſe things, ſo ſhall it break in pieces and bruiſe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his Viſion in the firſt year of <hi>Belſhazar,</hi> he ſeeth theſe four Kingdomes under ſeverall Types of Beaſts, <hi>but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Daniel 7.</note> 
               <hi>the fourth was different from, or unlike to, all the reſt, verſe</hi> 7. And in the interpretation it is ſaid, <hi>it ſhall be unlike to all the Kingdomes, and ſhall devoure the whole earth, and ſhall tread it down, and break it in pieces, verſe</hi> 23. And out of this muſt ariſe ten hornes, which are ten Kings; and another ſhall ariſe after them, and he ſhall be unlike to the firſt, and ſubdue three Kings, and ſhall ſpeak words againſt the moſt High, verſe 24, 25. So that we find <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie, concerning this fourth Kingdome (or ſixth King in the Apoſtle <hi>Iohns</hi> Revelations, chap. 17. 10.) to have been fulfilled in the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it then being in its heighth.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That many times the Lord is pleaſed in the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets, to wrap up many things in one. As for inſtance, in the 8. <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the Viſion of the <hi>Rough Goat,</hi> upon whoſe fall four Hornes or Kingdomes ariſe, and out of them came forth a little Horn, which waxed exceeding great, &amp;c. verſe 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. which compared with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof, verſe 22, 23, 24, 25. it will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this little Horn muſt be the ſame with the vile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Man of Sin, and Beaſt, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks of in the 17. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> becauſe his power is mighty, but not by his own power, he getting the Dominion by flattery, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21 And he ſhall ſtand up againſt the Prince of Princes (which <hi>Antiochus</hi> never did, as ſome ſay, who imagine him to be this little Horn) and be broken without hands, which cannot have relation to his Perſon onely, but to his Power alſo, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> power was not, though he himſelf were conſumed by Wormes.</p>
            <p>But this vile Perſon, little Horn, Man of Sin, or Beaſt, his Army is deſtroyed, and himſelf taken alive, and caſt into a Lake of fire, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19, 19, 20, 21. Which if ſo, then is not onely the fourth Kingdome left out, in the 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 40. but alſo that Raiſer of Taxes, <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. 20. Another inſtance in the 11. <hi>Daniel,</hi> in that Viſion, he having ſpoken of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Dominion, and the ruine of the laſt, and riſe of the four Kingdomes out of it; there is declared, what ſhall fall out between the two Dominions of the North and the South <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Seleucides</hi> and <hi>Ptolomeys)</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of the fourth Beaſt or Kingdom, and ſixth Head or Kingdome in <hi>Iohns Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then comes to mention the Succeſſor of the King of the North, whom he calls a Raiſer of Taxes, verſe 20. where
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119057:21"/>
it is ſaid, <hi>Then ſhall ſtand up in his Eſtate a Raiſer of Taxes, in the glory of the Kingdome, but within few dayes he ſhall be deſtroyed, neither in anger or in Battell,</hi> and verſe the 21. <hi>And in his Eſtate ſhall ſtand up a vile Perſon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One inſtance more, in the 7. <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Prophet ſees the Viſion of four Monarchies typified by four Beaſts, and the fourth Beaſt to have ten Hornes, verſe 7. where is left out the Raiſer of Taxes, that is to ariſe before the ten Hornes, as will plainly appear in the 17: chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh Head muſt ariſe before the Beaſt, and the ten Hornes are to have power one hour with the Beaſt, verſe 12. So that theſe three inſtances doe make it evidently appear, that the Lord in His Viſions to his Prophet doth not at one time ſhew all things that ſhould be, or fall out, but in ſome more, in ſome leſſe, as we ſee here in theſe inſtances; in the firſt is left out the fourth Kingdome or ſixth Head, and the Raiſer of Taxes or ſeventh Head. In the ſecond is left out the fourth Kingdom or ſixth Head onely: And in the laſt is left out the Raiſer of Taxes or ſeventh Head onely.</p>
            <p>Now concerning this <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> in <hi>Iohns Revelations</hi> chapter 17. according to the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thus; <hi>Here is the mind that hath Wiſdome, the ſeven Heads are ſeven Mountaines, whereon the Woman ſitteth, they are alſo ſeven Kings,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>Five are fallen, and one is, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not yet come, and when he cometh he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace,</hi> and verſe 11. <hi>And the Beaſt that was, and is not, is even the eighth, and is one of the ſeven, and ſhall goe into deſtruction;</hi> which compared with the 11. <hi>Daniel</hi> 20, 21. we ſhall find, that the Raiſer of Taxes (which, by what we have already proved, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may we not queſtion the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation as to this particular ſeeing all our common Tranſlations ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in another ſenſe; as thus, And there are ſeven Kings; not, They are ſeven Kings.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We doe not onely find it in our Engliſh Bibles, of the Geneva Tranſlation, and that of <hi>Tindals</hi> Tranſlation, but alſo the Italian, and ancient French Bibles, printed near one hundred yeares ſince at <hi>Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns;</hi> however the current of the Scriptures will clear it to be ſo; as that Mountaines doe imply Perſons and Powers, or Perſons in power; look upon and conſider well of that expreſſion of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> in his 51. chapter 25. <hi>Behold I am againſt thee, O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Mountain, ſaith the Lord</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the foregoing verſe) <hi>which deſtroyeth all the Earth, and I will ſtretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll the down from the Rocks, and will make thee a burnt Mountain.</hi> Alſo that of the Prophet <hi>Zachery</hi> in his 4. chapter 7. <hi>Who art thou O great Mountain?</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch) <hi>before</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabell <hi>thou ſhalt become a Plain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if that we ſhould ſay, that this ſeventh Head is now ariſing (for we have already ſhewed, that the ſixth Head is ſo farre decayed, that there is little of it now appeares, in compariſon of what it was) I hope we ſhould not be found to be in an error. And we ſhall lay down ſome grounds for what we hope, or in this thing ſhould ſeem to maintain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt we are to obſerve, that the riſe of one Head was the ruine of that which was before it; or the decay of the one made way for the riſe of the other, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this ſeventh Head or Government, according to <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie chap. 11. 20. is ſtiled a Raiſer of Taxes, that is a Government which is upheld by Taxes; not a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that hath a vaſt Treaſure hoorded up, as was in the Capitall at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor that hath a great Revenue of Lands or Tribute, as Kingly and Monarchicall Governments in theſe Ages have; and in particular, this Nation had, when under ſuch a Government; but it is a Government that is wholly ſupported and upheld by Taxes, as this Nation wherein we live is; and this Nation (in reſpect of Government) would not be able to ſubſiſt, were it not for this ſupportation; for now here is no Treaſure to be found, nor Revenue left to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the ordinary Charges incident thereunto, much leſſe for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119057:22"/>
the maintenance of an Army in the three <hi>(quondam)</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and a Navy near ten times as great as was ordinarily maintained under the Royall Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But was not <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> this Perſon or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which did ſubſiſt in this way; for the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> in his 2. chapter 1. ſaith, <hi>And it came to paſſe in thoſe dayes, that there came a Decree from</hi> Auguſtus Ceſar, <hi>that all the world ſhould be taxed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It could not be, for theſe Reaſons: Firſt, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Taxes muſt immediately precede the vile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that Government of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was that which <hi>Iohn</hi> calls the ſixth Head, five are fallen, one is, which is this under which <hi>Iohn</hi> lived, and was baniſhed by into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> and the other is not yet come, which then was not, and is that we now write of, that of Taxes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that Government of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> continued ſome hundred of yeares in its height, and was many ages in decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this Government by Taxes ſhall continue a ſhort ſpace, comparatively with the other.</p>
            <p>So that we may ſafely conclude, that this Government, which is to be ſupported by Taxes, cannot properly be ſaid to have been in any Nation, that was under any of the other ſix Heads or Governments, if not in this Common-wealth of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Ground of our apprehending that the ſeventh Head is ariſing (and that among us) which is to be maintained by Taxes, is the Liberty of Conſcience (or Freedome to exerciſe that knowledge, which is communicated to any, in ſpirituall things, agreeable to the Word of God, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it) that is granted here, whereby the Goſpel of the Kingdome (or Perſonall Raign of Chriſt on Earth) may be freely preached among us (and ſo ſhall paſſe into all the world afterwards, the Sword making way for this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty) which Freedome or Liberty is granted in no Nation, eſpecially upon that account as here; In <hi>France</hi> there is ſome tolleration, but of neceſſity (thoſe that they call Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants there being a conſiderable powerful party, and ſo not eaſily to be ſuppreſſed:) In the United Provinces the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119057:23"/>
granted, proves very advantaglous to them, by drawing others (that cannot have that liberty in their own Country) thither, who bring with them Eſtates; but whether poor or rich, they doe contribute little or much towards the charge of maintaining them in their civill Liberties.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>England</hi> it is otherwiſe, the Liberty that is granted and enjoyed is meerly upon the account, that light is broke forth; and ſince this Liberty hath been granted (and upon this account) all eyes (that are not wilfully ſhut from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the ſame) have ſeen, that no Nation hath proſpered, or hath had the like ſucceſſe that we have had againſt all our Enemies; in ſo much that the neighbour Nations ſtand in admiration at it, if not tremble, (to God onely be all the Glory) as they have good cauſe, if at any time they ſhall combine againſt us; for the ſeventh Head muſt have as large Dominions as any (if not as all) the precedent had.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Lords work, which he will doe under this ſeventh Head, we ſhall find it to be twofold, and that in a way of Mercy, as he permitted a twofold work to be done under the ſixth Head, in a way of affliction or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which (under the ſixth Head) was the ten perſecutions of the Saints (which could not be the ten Hornes, as ſome have imagined, and the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Beaſt) in the firſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt, who then ſuffered under the litterall <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Whore, in reſpect of Worſhip, becauſe they would not ſacrifice to Idols; whoſe judgement <hi>(viz.</hi> the litterall <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Whore) in reſpect of Worſhip, was ſhewn to <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 17. <hi>Revelations</hi> 1, 2. And that by the riſe of another Whore (or whoriſh or falſe Worſhip) in the 3. verſe, <hi>Iohn being carried by the Spirit into the wilderneſſe, where he ſaw a Woman that ſat upon a skarlet coloured Beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having ſeven Heads and ten Hornes.</hi> Whoſe riſe of Worſhip <hi>(viz.</hi> the ſpirituall <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> or <hi>Romiſh)</hi> is and hath been the ruine of the firſt; and her practiſe is, by her Emiſſaries, in reſpect of doctrine, to cry down all litterall Sacrifices (as killing of Beaſts and Fowles, &amp;c.) on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly a ſpirituall Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119057:23"/>
that they bring inſtead there of, by offering up their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God (ſo called) in the hands of their Prieſts; by whom alſo that abſurd doctrine (and bloudy to thoſe poor Saints in the Marian dayes, that would not believe a lie.) of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation was brought in: In oppoſing of her ſpirituall whoriſh Worſhip, how many Saints (ſince her riſe) hath ſhe made the Martyrs of Jeſus, being drunken with their bloud; at which the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn wondred with great admiration,</hi> verſe 6. And this was the ſecond work that ſhould be brought to paſſe under the ſixth Head, in reſpect of affliction or perſecution; which power of hers, in reſpect of Worſhip, will continue in the time of the ſeventh Head; for ſhe is to ſit upon the Beaſt with ſeven Heads and ten Hornes; ſo that ſhe is to have a being after the riſe of the ten Hornes, who ariſe not till the ſeventh Head hath raigned; and ſhe ſhall afterwards be deſtroyed by them in reſpect of place, or Seat, <hi>(viz. Rome</hi> it ſelf) if not of worſhip alſo, verſe 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Now the Lords work that is to be done under this ſeventh Head is, as we ſaid, twofold:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the preaching of the Goſpel of the Kingdome, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the calling home of the <hi>Iewes</hi> into their own Land <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>two Tribes, Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> to build the City of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the Temple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Concerning the preaching of the Goſpel of the Kingdome, ſome it may be will ſay, it hath been preached al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in the dayes of the Apoſtles, who went about into all parts of the world, according to their Maſters Commiſſion in <hi>Math.</hi> 28. <hi>Goe ye into all the world, preach the Goſpel to every Creature, &amp;c.</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 10. <hi>Romans</hi> 18. ſaith, <hi>Their ſound went into all the Earth;</hi> which ſay ſome, is the Goſpel ſpoken of in the 16. verſe of that chapter, <hi>but they have not all obeyed the Goſpel,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which we anſwer, That the Goſpel of the Kingdome could not poſſibly have been preached in all the earth in the Apoſtles time; for if it had ſo been, the end of it had been preſently, that is, it would not have been any more preached.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:119057:24"/>
2. It could not have been ſo preached then, becauſe a large part of the now known world was not then known or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, nor in many hundred yeares after them; and it may well be queſtioned, whether it hath at all been preached (yea hardly known or believed by any there) in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> much leſſe in the Plantations of other Nations (in that now known part of the world) who cannot endure to have the leaſt light of ſpirituall things to break forth in their Dominions; witneſſe that damnable doctrine of theirs, ſo highly cried up by the Popiſh Party, that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, joyned with another of the ſame ſtamp, that Images are Lay-mens books: but chiefly their cruell tyrannizing over the Conſciences of their people, by ſetting up their Hell upon Earth, their cruell Inquiſition, which ſo long as that is maintained in a Nation, there is little hopes of this Goſpel to be preached there. And as concerning that Scripture of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his 10. chapter of his Epiſtle to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> verſe 18. if the coherence of the words be well weighed, the Goſpel there ſpoken of, cannot be the Goſpel of Chriſt, which the Apoſtles had in Commiſſion from him to preach: But it was the Goſpel or glad Tydings, ſpoken of in the Writings of the Prophets <hi>(viz.</hi> in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Nahum)</hi> for the Apoſtle in the 15. verſe of that 10. chapter ſaith, <hi>as it is written, how beautifull are the feet,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore we ſuppoſe we may conclude ſafely, that this Goſpel of the Kingdome or Raign of Chriſt upon Earth) hath not been publiſhed or made known in all the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But why muſt it now be preached in theſe dayes, in the time of the ſeventh Head or Government, or what neceſſity is there for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it hath in ſome meaſure been proved (if not fully) that it hath not been preached in all the world as yet, therefore it muſt be continued to be preached till it hath ſo been.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the time of the ſeventh Heads power or Raign is but ſhort, therefore to be haſtened in that time, for there is little hopes of Peace or Liberty for the Saints in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119057:24"/>
time of the ten Hornes or Kings and the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it cannot be publiſhed in any place, but where there is Liberty and Peace, as there is among us, and it is hoped, the Sword that is in the now Magiſtrates hand of this Nation, will procure the ſame in other Nations, that there it may be preached alſo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe the Coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt draweth nigh, (eſpecially in relation to the taking up of the Saints) for if it be ſo, that the ſeventh Head be ariſing and ſhall continue but a ſhort ſpace, then immediately (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his decay or ſetting) the ten Hornes and the Beaſt will ariſe, before whoſe power is at the height <hi>(viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Beaſts) the Saints will be taken up (as we ſhall clear it more fully hereafter, eſpecially when we open the 12. chapter of the book of the <hi>Revelation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> therefore the more reaſon to ſet upon this moſt neceſſary work of the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the Kingdome, leaſt we be found retarders of our own happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And as concerning the calling of the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Government, we ſay, that is that other work the Lord will <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calling of the</hi> Jewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> now have brought to paſſe; for as yet they are not ſo called, nor permitted by the <hi>Turks</hi> (who have the poſſeſſion of their Country) to make any habitation there, nor to come thither but as Pilgrims, or to bury the bones of their deceaſed Friends, which they bring thither from all parts where they inhabit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Scriptures of the Prophets doe declare, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> muſt be built in its own place (which now it is not, if we may give any belief to Hiſtorians and Travellers) ſo what the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> foretels concerning this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his 30. chapter 18. whoſe words are theſe; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will bring again the Captivity of</hi> Jacobs <hi>Tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places: and the City ſhall be builded upon her own heap, and the Pallace ſhall remain after the manner thereof.</hi> Alſo conſider of the Prophet <hi>Zachery</hi>'s Propheſie as to this particular, in his 12. chapter 6. <hi>In that day will I make the Governours of</hi> Judah <hi>like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a Torch of fire in a ſheaf, and they ſhall</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119057:25"/>
               <hi>devoure all the People round about, on the right hand and on the left, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be inhabited again in her own place, even in</hi> Jeruſalem, And the other Prophets doe declare, that the City muſt be beſeiged, and the daily Sacriſice taken away, and great tribulation upon that people, and all this before the Beaſt is at his height, in regard of his power, who doth immediately ariſe upon the fall of the ſeventh Head.</p>
            <p>So that now having fully made manifeſt the Beaſt, in reſpect of his ſeven Heads; the next thing to be declared and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened is the <hi>ten Hornes or Kings; viz.</hi> who they are, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Scripture is ſilent, onely that they are the <note place="margin">The ten Hornes.</note> ten toes of <hi>Nebuchadneſſar</hi>'s Image, <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. as to their Perſons and Dominion, in reſpect of Countries, where they ſhall particularly raign, we find not, and that as yet, they are not riſen; for the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 17. <hi>Revelations</hi> 12. ſaith, <hi>They are ten Kings, who have received no Kingdome as yet, but receive power one hour with the Beaſt.</hi> But thus much we may take notice of by the way, that the ten Hornes and the Beaſt, when they ariſe, will make <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image compleat, <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. 33. whoſe feet were part of Iron, and part of Clay; of whoſe Iron legs we have already given ſome account) which in the interpretation he ſaith, <hi>Whereas thou ſaweſt the feet and toes, part of Potters Clay, and part of Iron; the Kingdome ſhall be divided, but there ſhall be in it of the ſtrength of Iron, for as much as thou ſaweſt the Iron mixed</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>with the mirie Clay: and as the toes of the feet were part of Iron and part of Clay; ſo the Kingdome ſhall be partly ſtrong, and partly broken. And whereas thou ſaweſt the Iron mixed with the mirie Clay, they ſhall mingle themſelves with the ſeed of men, but they ſhall not cleave one to another, even as Iron is not mixed with Clay. And in the daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of thoſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdome, which ſhall never be deſtroyed, and the Kingdome ſhall not be left to other People, but it ſhall break in peices and conſume all theſe Kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> verſe 41, 42, 43, 44. So that as they are partly ſtrong and partly weak (they being but a mixt power, that are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the perfecting of ſome great deſign, but will not long hold together, for before the little Horn will three of the

            <p>Secondly, concerning the place from whence the Beaſt and ten Kings are to ariſe, it will evidently appear to be, out of <note place="margin">The place where.</note> the Dominion that the ſeventh Head is to have, though <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſeemeth to ſay, that they ſhall ariſe out of the ſixth Head or fourth Beaſt in his 7. chapter 23, 24 yet compared with other Scriptures, it will plainly appear, that they will ariſe out of the ſeventh Head; ſee the 17. <hi>Revelations</hi> 11, 12. and <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. 21. but they muſt ariſe out of that part of the Dominion that was under the ſixth Head, or <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchy, in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, for the Dominion of the ſeventh Head will be of a farre larger extent than ever the ſixth was in <hi>Iohns</hi> dayes, in regard of that large part of the world, that was unknown, and undiſcovered in thoſe dayes, but now is, and ſhall be brought under the power and government of the ſeventh Head.</p>
            <p>And in particular, the Beaſt that was and is not (which is the Beaſt compleat with ſeven Heads and ten Hornes) and which yet ſhall be, he is the eight, and is of the ſeven; his riſe will be in that part of the world that it was at the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and in that part thereof which was called <hi>Caldea;</hi> whoſe chief City ſhall be <hi>Babylon,</hi> as it was at the firſt; for <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Beaſt that thou ſaweſt, was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> chap. 17. 8. Not that it was then ſo made manifeſt or known; for <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw not things as they then were apparent to the world, but what ſhould be in its time; nor that it ſhould be made manifeſt when the Beaſt did ariſe, but what it ſhould be afterwards: So that his riſe is out of that part of the world, that ſhould in its time be made manifeſt to be the bottomleſſe Pit; out of which Pit the Locuſts ſhall ariſe, that ſhall plague or ſting the Inhabitants of the Earth, which have not the Seal of God in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 3, 4. and in which place the Devill ſhall be chained up for a thouſand yeares, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3.

As God overthrew</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Gomorha, <hi>and the neighbor Cities thereof, ſaith the Lord; ſo ſhall no man abide there, neither ſhall any ſon of man dwell therein.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">What they will doe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing to be conſidered of, is what the ten Horns and Beaſt will doe before and after the taking up of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Firſt, before the taking up of the Saints, the ten Hornes will ariſe, and hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 16. and this Whore or <hi>Woman, is that great City, which raigneth over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>(viz.</hi> in that time that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the Viſion and wrote this Book) <hi>and God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree with one conſent to give their Kingdome unto the Beaſt, untill the words of God be fulfilled,</hi> verſe 17. So that they muſt firſt hate the Whore, and deſtroy her, before they give up their power unto the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the Beaſt, what he will doe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Before the Saints are taken up, we find much in the 21. chapter of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie after his riſe. As that Armes ſhall be overthrown with a floud before him, and ſhall be broken, and alſo the Prince of the Covenant (or chief of thoſe who had joyned in a League to oppoſe him;) and after the League made with him (he having obtained
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119057:26"/>
his power and dominion at the firſt by flatteries) he ſhall work deceitfully, for he ſhall come up and overcome with a ſmall people (in regard the Nations had no thoughts of a Warre, a League being lately made before between them) and he ſhall enter into the quiet and plentifull Province (that is, into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe barrenneſſe ſhall then be healed, as ſeverall of the Prophets have foretold; <hi>Eſay</hi> 32. 15. and in his 51. chapter 3. he faith, <hi>For the Lord ſhall comfort</hi> Sion; <hi>he will comfort all her waſt places, and he will make her Wilderneſſe like</hi> Eden, <hi>and her Deſert like the Garden of the Lord: Ioy and gladneſſe ſhall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voyce of melody:</hi> Alſo the 30. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 17. and chap. 33. 6. to the 14. verſe. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 38. 12. and <hi>Ioell</hi> 2. 19, 22, 23, 24.) and he ſhall doe that which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have not done, nor his Fathers Fathers; he ſhall divide among them the prey, and the ſpoil, and the ſubſtance (a thing which his Fathers, nor none of his Predeceſſors ever did, for they took all from the people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> never divided any among them, which he ſhall doe) yea; he ſhall forecaſt his deviſes againſt the ſtrong holds, even for a time, verſe 24. although at that time he doth doe much for them, onely to put them into a ſecure condition. In the 25. and 26. verſes it is ſaid, he ſhall make warre with the King of the South (the <hi>Aegyptdan</hi> Prince) and he ſhall be betrayed to the vile Perſon, by thoſe that feed of the Portion of his meat, but afterwards they ſhall be reconciled ſeemingly, for they ſhall talk of deceit (or ſpeak lies) at one Table, verſe 27. and both ſet their hearts to doe miſchief, but it ſhall not avail, for yet the end ſhall be at the time appointed: and verſe 28. He ſhall return into his own Land, with great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (or Riches) and his heart ſhall be againſt the holy Covenant (or people of the <hi>Iowes,</hi> with whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made a League, and divided his ſpoll among them) ſo ſhall he doe, and return to his own Land; that is, his evill thoughts will then begin to work againſt them, according to <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119057:27"/>
18. to the 23. and 39. chapter 17, 18, 19, 20 with the 19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17, 18.) And at the time appointed he ſhall return and come toward the South; (at which return of his, his evill thoughts doe then begin to ſhew themſelves in actions, by his cauſing them <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Iewes)</hi> to be beſeiged, as he paſſeth through their Country towards the King of the South. For then it is, that <hi>Sheba,</hi> and <hi>Dedan,</hi> and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> ſhall ſay, (to <hi>Gog</hi> or this vile Perſon) art thou come to take the Prey and the Spoile, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 13. So that now will begin to be fulfilled another part of <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> Propheſie, who ſaith in his 8. chapter 13, 14. that the time that the dayly Sacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the tranſgreſſion of deſolation, to give both the Sanctuary and the Hoſt, to be trodden under feet, ſhall be two thouſand three hundred dayes, and then the Sanctuary ſhall be cleanſed. So that the taking away of the daily Sacrifice (by reaſon of his beſeiging <hi>Ieruſalem)</hi> ſhall be near three yeares, or about a thouſand dayes, before the abomination that makes de ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late be ſet up (which cannot be till after the City is taken by the vile Perſon: And from that time, that the abomination is ſet up, it ſhall be one thouſand two hundred and ninety dayes before the end of the vile Perſons Raign be; and bleſſed is he that wait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the laſt (expedition) ſhall not be as the firſt; <hi>For the Ships of</hi> Chittim <hi>ſhall come againſt him,</hi> &amp;c. verſe 30.

            </p>
            <p>Now we ſhall give in ſomething of our own thoughts concerning this verſe (and yet not our own, but what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in unto us; which its likely will be ſleighted by thoſe that are prepoſſeſſed with former and antient Expoſitions on this Subject, but we ſhall leave it to after time, which will manifeſt whether we are in the truth or no;) the Ships of <hi>Chittim</hi> we doe apprehend to be the power or forces of the

            <p>The next particular that we ſhall (with the Lords Aſſiſtance) treat upon, will be the opening of the 12: chapter of the Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi> Viſions and Revelations, which as we ſhall not declare raſh and ſudden thoughts thereon, ſo we deſire it may not be ſuddenly expected from us, but rather to wait a while, for light is breaking forth daily, and that which may be apprehended for a truth to day; to morrow may eaſily be diſcerned to be a miſtake; It is with us as with Military Perſons upon duty in the Field, eſpecially thoſe that are upon the Guard, who looking about them continually (but chiefly upon break of the day) diſcover variety of Objects as they apprehend, &amp; as there are, <hi>quot homines tot Sententioe,</hi> ſo many men ſo many minds or opinions, for one ſaith, that ſuch a black thing that is at a pretty diſtance, is a Man, another ſaith a Tree, another a Horſe, another this or that, when as poſſibly within a ſhort time after (the day dawning more and more) they plainly perceive that they were all in an error, though then when they gave their opinions, they all might be confident, that what they ſaid it was, it was, and then (as we apprehend) no evill in them, becauſe they knew not the contrary, though not poſſible, that one Object upon the near approach, or by day light, could be the ſame thing that men of ſeverall judgements ſaid it was: So it is with us, in reſpect of what we have already written, or ſhall; for many before us, in times of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, have given their interpretation, on theſe Subjects, In a contrary ſenſe; and ſaying, that theſe Propheſies have all (or the moſt part) been fulfilled long ſince; but we who are come near to the dawning of the day of the Lord Jeſus, doe clearly diſcern, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
