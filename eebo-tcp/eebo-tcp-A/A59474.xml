            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER from a
Parliament man
To his FRIEND,
Concerning the Proceedings of the
House of COMMONS this
last Session, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I See you are greatly Scandalized at our slow and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Proceedings.</hi> I confess you have cause enough, but
were you but within these Walls for one half day, and
saw the strange Make and Complexion that this House
is of, you would wonder as much that ever you wondred
at it: For we are such a <hi>pied Parliament,</hi> that none can say
of what <hi>Colour</hi> we are; for we consist of <hi>old Cavaliers, old
Round-haeads, Indigent Courtiers,</hi> and true <hi>Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
the two <hi>latter</hi> are most <hi>numerous,</hi> and would in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
bring things to some Issue, were they not clogged
with the humerous uncertainties of the former. For the
<hi>old Cavalier</hi> grown Aged, and almost past his Vice, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Godly, and makes his doating <hi>Piety</hi> more a Plague to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96666:3"/>
the World, than his youthful <hi>Debauchery</hi> was: For he is
so much a <hi>By got</hi> to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> that he forces his <hi>Loyalty</hi> to
strike Sail to his <hi>Religion,</hi> and could be content to pare the
<hi>Nails</hi> a little of the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> so you would but let
him sharpen the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tallons;</hi> which behaviour of
his so exasperates the <hi>Round-head,</hi> that he on the other hand
cares not what <hi>Increases</hi> the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> receives,
so he can but diminish that of the <hi>Miter:</hi> so that the <hi>Round-head</hi>
had rather enslave the <hi>Man,</hi> than the <hi>Conscience;</hi> The
<hi>Cavalier</hi> rather the <hi>Conscience</hi> than the <hi>Man,</hi> there being a
sufficient stock of Animosity as proper Matter to work
upon.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>these</hi> therefore the <hi>Courtier</hi> mutually plays: For if
any <hi>Anticourt motion</hi> be made, he gains the <hi>Round-head</hi>
either to oppose or absent, by telling them, <hi>If they will joyn
him now, he will joyn with them for Liberty of Conscience.</hi>
And when any Affair is started on the behalf of the <hi>Countrey,</hi>
he assures the <hi>Cavaliers, If they will then stand by him, he
will then joyn with them in promoting a Bill against the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</hi>
Thus play they on both hands, that no Motion of
a publick nature is made, but they win upon the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi>
of them; and by this Art gain a Majority against the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Gentlemen,</hi> which otherwise they would never have:
Wherefore it were happy that we had neither <hi>Round-head,</hi>
nor <hi>Cavalier</hi> in the House; for they are each of them so Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
against the other, that their sitting <hi>here</hi> signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Fostering their old <hi>Venome,</hi> and lying at
Catch to snap every advantage to bear down each other,
though it be in the destruction of their <hi>Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if the <hi>Round-heads</hi> bring in a good <hi>Bill,</hi> the old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
opposes it; for no other reason, but because they
brought it in. So that as the poor <hi>English Silk-weavers,</hi> are
feign to hire a <hi>French-man</hi> to Sell their <hi>Ribbons:</hi> So are the
<hi>Round-heads</hi> a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> to move for those <hi>Bills</hi> they desire
should pass; which so sowers the <hi>Round-head,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges
that Carriage upon any <hi>Bill</hi> the <hi>Cavalier</hi> offers; and
the Rage and Passion of the one and other, are so powerful,
that it blinds them both, that neither perceives the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96666:3"/>
they give the <hi>Courtier,</hi> to abuse both <hi>them</hi> and their
<hi>Countrey</hi> too: so that if either of them do any <hi>Good,</hi> it is
only out of pure Envy against the <hi>other.</hi> Thus you see how
we are yoaked, and seeing this, you may cease your admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we offer at <hi>all,</hi> and do just <hi>nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this Division alone of the <hi>House</hi> all we have to
lament (for Death, that common Cure, does now every day
lessen this evil) but that which is more our misery, is, that
those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who are truly for the <hi>Good</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi>
will not be perswaded to stand upon the sure Basis of <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Principles</hi> (like Workmen too presumptive of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that will not Build by rule) but rather affect the most
loose standing on the Sandy foundation of Heat and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
By reason of which they often do as much harm as
good, and yet perceive it not; this is the sore evil we are
under. For I would not doubt the <hi>Countries</hi> carrying it from
the <hi>Court</hi> in every Vote, let the <hi>Courtiers</hi> use all the Art they
could, would the <hi>Country Gentlemen</hi> but give themselves the
trouble to enform their understandings a little, and not suffer
themselves to be hurried by a heedless Inadvertency into vulgar
Notions. Which, if well examined, are directly contrary to
their honest intentions; For lack of which they totally mistake
their <hi>Interest,</hi> fall foul on their <hi>Friends,</hi> support their <hi>Enemies,</hi>
and carry on the designs of the <hi>Court,</hi> whilst they aim at the
Service of their <hi>Countrey.</hi> For if they would take the pains
but to think what is the greatest <hi>Enemy</hi> in the World, that
<hi>English Law</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> always <hi>had,</hi> still <hi>hath,</hi> and ever must
<hi>have;</hi> It may be the result of such a thought would say, it was
<hi>Encroaching Prerogative.</hi> Well, if then they would but beg
from themselves but so much seriousness, as to think this <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
thought, to <hi>check this Prerogative,</hi> which is so dangerous
an <hi>Enemy</hi> to our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> peradventure that
thought would answer, <hi>In suppressing all they could its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Dependants, and supporting such, whose Interest it is
to keep Prerogative within its just bounds.</hi> Now could they be
prevail'd with but to think a third thought, it would Land
them at the full and satisfactory Solution of the Question,
and will hold in every thing. But I will put it in a <hi>Case</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96666:4"/>
wherein we are most apt to <hi>Err,</hi> and wherein we reckon it
no less than <hi>Piety</hi> to play the <hi>Fool,</hi> to the end you may see
how miserably we are cheated and abused, by sucking in the
untried <hi>Notions</hi> that <hi>Education,</hi> the <hi>Arts</hi> of others, or our own
<hi>Ignorance</hi> have imposed upon us.</p>
            <p>The third thought therefore shall be this: <hi>Which are most
the Creatures and Supporters of boundless Prerogative, Prelates,
or dissenting Protestants?</hi> The answer to which must, and can
be no otherwise, <hi>The Prelates.</hi> Well then, if we would now
reduce this to Practice, and say, <hi>The greatest Friends to Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
are the Prelates, the greatest Enemies to our Laws and
Liberties is Prerogative.</hi> The only way therefore to restrain
<hi>Prerogative,</hi> is to do, <hi>What?</hi> To fortifie and strengthen the
Yoke of the Prelates over the Neck of the People? <hi>No:</hi>
(Surely this were an odd and a barbarous kind of Reasoning)
<hi>But to give Liberty to dissenting Protestants, as the best means to
keep up the Ballance against boundless Prerogative.</hi> For <hi>these</hi>
must and never can be otherwise (unless by Accident, and by
Mistake) than <hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>Liberty:</hi> But the <hi>Prelates</hi> neither
<hi>are</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be otherwise than <hi>Creatures</hi> to <hi>Prerogative,</hi> for all
their <hi>Promotions, Dignities,</hi> and <hi>Domination</hi> depends upon it.</p>
            <p>The same might be said concerning the only Antient and
true Strength of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Legal Militia,</hi> and a <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army.</hi> The <hi>Militia</hi> must, and can never be otherwise
than for <hi>English Liberty,</hi> 'cause else it doth destroy it <hi>self;</hi> but
a <hi>standing Force</hi> can be for nothing but <hi>Prerogative,</hi> by whom
it hath its <hi>idle Living</hi> and <hi>Subsistance.</hi> I could instance also
in many other Particulars, but our Inadvertency in this, is
demonstration enough how much we are <hi>cheated</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and hackney <hi>Notions</hi> imposed upon us; and this is almost
the cause of all the Error we commit. For missing our true
Footing, you see we have run in the mistaken Notion of
being for the <hi>Church</hi> so long, till we have almost destroyed
the <hi>State,</hi> and advanced <hi>Prerogative</hi> so much by suppressing
<hi>Nonconformity,</hi> that it's well nigh beyond our reach or power
to put Check to it; and had not Time, and but an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Observation, shewed us how much we were abused in this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96666:4"/>
matter: And that a <hi>Lay-Conformist</hi> and a <hi>Fanatique</hi> can live as
quietly and neighbourly together (would the <hi>Prelates</hi> but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them) as any in the World, we had ruined our selves
past all recovery. For by our Bouying up the <hi>Bishops</hi> in their
harsh and irreconcileable Spirit, in stead of Healing, we
have so fed and nourished the Discontents throughout the
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> that I think nothing keeps the <hi>Fire</hi> from flaming
out afresh in another intestine <hi>War</hi> but the bare circumstance
of Opportunity only; and how long that will be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
<hi>Passions</hi> that are made Wild by <hi>Oppression,</hi> is worthy a
very serious Consideration; and therefore there is hardly
any thing more a Wonder to wise Men, than to see the
<hi>Clergie</hi> run at this rate upon the <hi>Dissenters:</hi> wherefore since
the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> have given so large and ample a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their willingness to live Peaceably, if yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Clergie</hi> will not suffer <hi>them</hi> to be quiet in their
<hi>Families</hi> and their <hi>Houses,</hi> I doubt, they may at one time
or other, drive <hi>them</hi> into the <hi>Field,</hi> and then it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
their <hi>Divine Art</hi> to <hi>Conjure</hi> them down again; for he
sees but little, that sees not the <hi>English</hi> Temper is better to
be <hi>Led</hi> than <hi>Driven.</hi> And therefore I think it would not
be more a Vanity, to compel the <hi>Ladies</hi> to wear <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths
Ruff,</hi> than to force the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> to be <hi>drest</hi> in
her <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet are these all the <hi>Arts</hi> we are under: For we have
a <hi>Gang</hi> that <hi>Huff,</hi> and bear themselves high on the <hi>Countrey</hi>
side, but <hi>earn</hi> only for the <hi>Court;</hi> these lay out their <hi>Craft</hi>
in putting the <hi>House</hi> upon little trifling things, and spend
and waste the Mettle thereof, upon such pittiful <hi>Pickadilloes,</hi>
as 'tis next to a shame for an <hi>English Parliament</hi> so much as
to mention. <hi>These</hi> start a fierce Dispute about some little
Matter, and keep a bluster as if none were such faithful <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots</hi>
as they, when they do it on purpose only to while out
the Time, and thin the <hi>House,</hi> by tiring the honest <hi>Country
Gentry</hi> in so tedious, fruitless, and trifling attendance. Do
but move things worthy a <hi>Parliament;</hi> as that <hi>we may have
our old known Rights of Annual Parliaments ascertained:</hi> That
<hi>none that are or shall be Bribed by any Place or Office, shall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96666:5"/>
ever sit in this House:</hi> That <hi>Parliament ought not to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued,
Adjourned, or Dissolved, till all Petitions are heard,
and the Aggrievances of the People redressed;</hi> with many
things more of as great <hi>Importance;</hi> O then, forsooth, their
pretended <hi>Loyalty</hi> (which in plain <hi>English</hi> is easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood)
will not abide such unmannerly and clownish <hi>Debates</hi>
as these, and twenty such little shreds of Non-sense are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
urged in stead of Argument.</p>
            <p>But further, These <hi>Country-Court Engines,</hi> after they have
taken the Measures of the <hi>House,</hi> at the opening of every
<hi>Session,</hi> by our thanks for the <hi>gracious Speech,</hi> which being
the true Pulse of the <hi>House;</hi> if it happen to come so hard as
speaks us but saint and cool to the one thing necessary, (<hi>the
matter of Money</hi>) then they know what will follow, that the
<hi>Court</hi> will get no Grist that <hi>Sessions;</hi> and though the <hi>Court</hi>
in indignation could turn them Home on the Morrow, yet
it must consult its Reputation a little, restrain its Resentments,
and suffer them to sit about a <hi>six weeks,</hi> or <hi>two months,</hi> and then
they assure the <hi>Court,</hi> since they can get no good by them,
they shall take no harm; and therefore to stop them from
some worthy Undertaking, they by their feigned Zeal against
<hi>Court</hi>-Corruptions, put them upon Impeaching some <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
Councellor,</hi> or <hi>Minister of State;</hi> and having spent half
our time about this, the rest is spent for the <hi>Clergie</hi> upon
<hi>Church-Work,</hi> which we have been so often put upon and
tired with these many <hi>Sessions:</hi> Though Partiality unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Parliament,</hi> who ought to lay the whole Body that
we represent a like easie, <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> as well as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi>
for we were chosen by <hi>both,</hi> and with that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we should oppress <hi>neither.</hi> To lay one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the Body on a Pillow, and the other on a <hi>Rack,</hi> sorts
our <hi>Wisdom</hi> little, but our <hi>Justice</hi>-worse. You now see all
our Shapes, save only the <hi>Indigents,</hi> concerning whom I
need say but little, for their <hi>Votes</hi> are publickly saleable for
a <hi>Guiny,</hi> and a <hi>Dinner</hi> every <hi>day</hi> in the <hi>Week,</hi> unless the
<hi>House</hi> be upon <hi>Money</hi> or a <hi>Minister of State:</hi> For that is their
<hi>Harvest,</hi> and then they make their Earnings suit the Work
they are about, which inclines them most constantly as sure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96666:5"/>
               <hi>Clyants</hi> to the <hi>Court.</hi> For what with gaining the <hi>one</hi> and
saving the <hi>other,</hi> they now and then adventure a <hi>Vote</hi> on
the <hi>Countrey</hi> side; but the dread of <hi>Dissolution</hi> makes them
strait tack about. The only thing we are obliged to them
for, is, that they do nothing <hi>Gratis,</hi> but make every <hi>Tax</hi>
as well Chargeable to the <hi>Court,</hi> as burthensome to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
and save no Mans <hi>Neck,</hi> but they break his <hi>Purse.</hi>
And yet when all is said, did but the <hi>Country Gentry</hi> rightly
understand the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> let the <hi>Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi>
do what they could, they might yet at last deserve the
Name of a worthy <hi>English Parliament;</hi> Which that we may
do, is not more passionately your desire, than it also is of,</p>
