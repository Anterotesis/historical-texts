            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words are a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal assertion of <hi>Christ</hi>'s concerning his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in them <hi>all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>: and they do easily divide themselves into <hi>two</hi> parts. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> is a <hi>positive</hi> part, wherein there is a state of great and Blessed advantage, which they are declared to be in present possession of: in these words, <hi>Ye are my friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which there are <hi>two</hi> things that make up that advantage, 1. a relation, 2. the person related to. <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>My</hi> friends. The</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> is a <hi>Conditional</hi> part, wherein there are the <hi>terms,</hi> upon which that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94586:3"/>
is made over, and which preserve the Right and Title to them: in these words, <hi>If ye do whatsoever I command you</hi>: in which there are <hi>two</hi> things required as <hi>Conditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Obedience, <hi>If ye do what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That Obedience Universal; <hi>If
ye do whatsoever I command you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing that offers it self to our consideration, is the Relation, <hi>Friends</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a known common-place truth, that a Friend is the most useful thing that is in whatsoever state we are: it is the Soul of life, and of content. If I be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity: We know abundance not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, is but like <hi>Jewells</hi> in the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less while they are there: it is indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>opinion of prosperity.</hi> But tis not possible to <hi>enjoy</hi> abundance otherwise then by <hi>Communicating</hi> it: a man <hi>possesseth</hi> plenty onely <hi>in his friends,</hi> and hath <hi>fruition</hi> of it meerly by <hi>bestowing</hi> it. If I be in <hi>adversity</hi>; to have a person whom I may intrust a trouble to, whose bosom is as open, and as faithful to me, as tis to his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94586:3"/>
own thoughts, to which I may commit a swelling secret; this is in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to <hi>unlade,</hi> and to <hi>poure out</hi> my sorrow from me; thus I divide my greivances, which would be insupportable, if I did not disburthen my self of some part of them: now there is no bosom so safe as that where <hi>friendship</hi> lodges: take <hi>Gods</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the case, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 6. <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosome, or thy friend that is as thine own soul.</hi> This is the highest step in the Gradation. And there is all the reason in the world: for though <hi>Parent,</hi> and <hi>Childe,</hi> are as neer one to other as any thing can be to part of it self; <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> are but two different names of the same one, yet these may become bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and unkind: a <hi>Parent</hi> may grow <hi>cross,</hi> or a <hi>Childe refractory,</hi> a <hi>Mother</hi> may be like the <hi>Ostrich</hi> in the Wilderness, throw off her <hi>bowels</hi> with her <hi>burthen</hi>; and an ungracious Son is <hi>constant pangs</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> to his Mother, his <hi>whole life</hi> gives her <hi>after-throws</hi> which are most deadly: Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes also may rest within the <hi>Marriage
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94586:4"/>
bed,</hi> and lay their heads upon two wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pillow's; but none of these unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses can untie the relation; that ends not where the bitterness begins, he is a <hi>Parent</hi> still though froward, and a <hi>Childe</hi> though stubborn; but a <hi>true friend</hi> can be nothing but <hi>kind</hi>: it does include a <hi>deerness</hi> in its essence, which is so inseparable from it, that they begin and end together: a man may be an <hi>Husband</hi> without <hi>loving,</hi> but cannot be a <hi>lover,</hi> that is a <hi>friend,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>loving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And sure to have no one <hi>friend</hi> in this life, no one that is concerned in any of my interests or me my self, none that hath any cares or so much as good wishes for me, is a state of a most uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prospect. The <hi>Plague</hi> that keeps friends at a distance from me while I live, out of the sphere of my infection, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gives me death, hath yet less of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then this; that leaves me the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions, the Prayers, all the solitary comforts, all indeed but the outward entertainments of my friends: that, though it shut the Door against all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94586:4"/>
yet, puts a <hi>Lord have Mercy</hi> on the Doore: But this I now described hath none of that, hath no good wishes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but hate, is worse then a <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pistelence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet neither is this State so comfortless, in respect of this life, as not to have a friend in the concernments of the Life to come: none that hath so much kindness for my <hi>Soul</hi> as every man hath for his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies beast,</hi> which if he see faln in a Ditch he will at least give notice that it may be helpt out thence: No one, that when a Sin, like to that <hi>Falling Sickness</hi> in the Gospel (and it is such indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Parable) is <hi>casting me into the Water,</hi> quenching my parts, my reason, and the Immortal sparke within me, or <hi>throwing me into the Fire,</hi> raising Lascivious heats within, which after will break out into Hell Fires; none yet that will stretch out his hand to catch me, or to pull me out: None that does care to see me Perish to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, or that values my Soul, which yet did cost the blood of GOD, at a words speaking: This is to be like <hi>Dives</hi> in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94586:5"/>
Flames, to whom they would not lend <hi>the help of the</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 24 25.</note> 
               <hi>tip of a finger,</hi> or give the kindness of <hi>a drop of Water</hi>: I am as it were on the other side the <hi>Gulfe</hi> already. Here is the use of friendship, the onely noble one, that's worthy of that blessed quality: when I have one that will be an <hi>assistant Conscience</hi> to me, who, when that within me <hi>sleeps,</hi> or is <hi>benummed,</hi> will <hi>watch</hi> over my actions; will <hi>testifie</hi> them to my Face, will be as <hi>faithful</hi> to me as the <hi>Conscience</hi> should be, hold a Glass to my Soul, shew me the staines, and the proud tumours, the foule Ulcers that are there, and then will fret, and rub, or prick, lance, and corrode, to cure those tumours, and do oft those spots, such an one is a <hi>familiar Angel-Guardian,</hi> is truely of that blessed heavenly ranke, and onely lesse then the <hi>friend</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>person</hi> related to, and my <hi>next</hi> part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Friends.</hi> There are <hi>three</hi> things from which men use to take the measures of a <hi>friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> From the good things he bestows on them: He that thinks to keep friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94586:5"/>
alive onely with air, that gives good words, but parts with nothing, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains onely with garbs, and civilities, is but the <hi>pageant</hi> of a friend: They that own having but <hi>one soul,</hi> and seem to clasp as if they would have but <hi>one body</hi> too, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep such <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>separate proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in other little things, as not to have communication one from the other. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>friendship</hi> of these benefits is rated by the measures of our <hi>need</hi> of them. When <hi>Midas</hi> was ready to dy for hunger, his God was kinder to him in a little bread, then in making all that he toucht turn into gold: great things engage but little where there is but little use of them: and all these,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Are endeered by the <hi>Affection</hi> they are given with. Good turns done with design, what need soever I have of them, are <hi>hire,</hi> and not <hi>friendship</hi>; it is the kindness onely that obligeth, the gift without the love does but upbraid and scorn my want.</p>
            <p>Now to measure the <hi>friend</hi> here in the <hi>Text,</hi> by these, were an impossible under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94586:6"/>
taking, whose friendship did exceed all bounds and measures. I shall do no more towards it, but read the words before my text, which were the occasion of it, <hi>Greater love bath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>yee are my friends.</hi> The <hi>token</hi> therefore of his friendship, the <hi>guift</hi> he gave them was his <hi>life,</hi> rather that was the least he gave: He gave his <hi>glory</hi> first, that so he might be qualified to give his life: for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

and strave onely for Execution: But for a person of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to leave his heaven to come down to us; to dwell with agonies that he might be at one with us; and be tyed to the cross, that he might be united to us; this is a friendship fitt for <hi>Ecstasies</hi> of <hi>apprehension.</hi> Of all the things that court thy kindness here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that spread snares, and lay baits for thy friendship, if any bid so fair, so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptingly, if any will give such a price, in God's name let it have thy love, I shall not blame him that engageth his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there: But sure <hi>Heaven</hi> cannot give a greater gift then this; for what can <hi>God</hi> give <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>himself?</hi> Yea I may say <hi>God</hi> could not give so much, for he must be <hi>man</hi> too, to give his <hi>life,</hi> and this, saith he, <hi>he gave for his friends,</hi> even in our stead, who must have perish'd else eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which intimates the <hi>second</hi> thing, the <hi>need</hi> we had of this.</p>
            <p>A need great as the gift, necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, that could break into <hi>heaven,</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle the <hi>Trinity,</hi> to serve its self, throw death into those regions of immortality,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94586:7"/>
and which would not be satisfied but with the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now is not the kindness, and the condescension of friendship in his expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions too, when he saith, <hi>greater love then this hath no man?</hi> which was the <hi>third</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearement.</p>
            <p>There never were such <hi>wounds</hi> of loves as those that tore this heart: never such meltings of affection as dissolved this lover into <hi>sweates of bloud.</hi> There was no motive to all this, but his meere love: for all this he designed to us <hi>before we were,</hi> and therefore sure <hi>before we were deserving,</hi> and O our God! thou that from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty didst lay contrivances to give thy life for us, so to redeem, and then to glorifie us, what were we then that thou shouldst do his for us? what <hi>were</hi> we then when we <hi>were not?</hi> and yet that thou from the abyss of everlastingness, shouldst think thoughts of such kindness to us, and such blessedness for us, who then <hi>were not,</hi> and <hi>deserved nothing</hi>; and who since we were, have <hi>deserved nothing but damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as there was no other motive to all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94586:7"/>
this design but <hi>love,</hi> so neither was there any thing but <hi>love</hi> in the fulfilling. Look on your <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>garden,</hi> and upon <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> and you shall find him there in as great agonies of <hi>affection</hi> as <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and hanging down his head upon the Cross with languishments of <hi>kindness,</hi> more then <hi>weakness.</hi> His arms stretched out and Rack't, as if on purpose to the posture of <hi>receiving you to his embraces</hi>; and his side opened not onely to <hi>shed Blood</hi> for you, but to make you a <hi>passage to his very Heart.</hi> Look on <hi>him</hi> offering up his Tears, his Prayers, and his Soul for Sin, and in the midst of all, projecting happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to you, as it were praying, O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, here I charge my self with all the guilt of those my friends, I thy onely Son God, one with thee, am content to suffer Torments that they all may be acquitted, Here I lay down my Life that they may have eternal Life, let me be Crucified, so they be Glorified. Which was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase and the gift of this his Passion to all his <hi>friends,</hi> even to those <hi>that do what he commands</hi>; which is the <hi>first</hi> condition that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94586:8"/>
entitles to his friendship, and my <hi>next</hi> part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do what I command you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not urge, that Great men upon earth will not take any to their Friendship but upon these termes; nor will I plead the reasonableness of this in <hi>Christ,</hi> there being no cause why he should be a friend to any that will daily disoblige him and dishonour him: nor will I press the whole Oeconomy of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which says, all the advantages Christ ever gave or meant us, and all the Acts of friendship that he ever did for us were with this design. He gave his <hi>grace that brings salvation</hi> to save us into an estate of sober virtue. <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. <hi>v.</hi> 11.12. he <hi>gave himself</hi> also to Ransom us from our own evil doings, and to redeem us into his obedience. <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. <hi>v.</hi> 14. without which no dependance on him will availe. <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 21. He will own no acquaintance with, nor services from them who have friendship with sin: though <hi>they have cast out Devils in his name,</hi> if they retain their vices; though they <hi>do miracles,</hi> if they <hi>do wickedly,</hi> he wil bid them <hi>depart,</hi> profess <hi>he never knew them,</hi> v. 22.23.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94586:8"/>
He will not let such have a bare <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to his <hi>Name,</hi> nor have the <hi>friendship of a title.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 19. All his rewards also that he will give are promised to none other, but them that <hi>do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Apocal.</hi> xxii. 14. that is, <hi>do Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically, heartily and faithfully endeavour it,</hi> and do this with all diligence exprest by words, that import all strife imaginable, as <hi>running, wrestling, fighting, warring.</hi> And persevere also <hi>by patient continuance in well doing, Rom.</hi> ii. 7. and he hath nothing else but <hi>vengeance</hi> for all others. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8. and we have neither <hi>Christ,</hi> nor <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor <hi>Religion,</hi> but with these terms.</p>
            <p>But I shall wave all this, and bound my self within the present words. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friend. Ye are my friends if ye do what I command you.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>boasting</hi> of his <hi>love,</hi> making <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,</hi> and <hi>vying friendships</hi> with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nay more, contriving <hi>heights</hi> and <hi>depths of mercy,</hi> such as man hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, nor Fathom for; when he was preparing to do an act of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94586:9"/>
on almost <hi>equal to his Divinity,</hi> when he had resolutions of so much kindness as to give his life that he might shew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Yet could he not then find in his heart to offer or declare one jot of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the men that <hi>will not do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> but in the midst of such <hi>agonies</hi> of <hi>compassion,</hi> he thought of nothing but <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite indignation</hi> and <hi>eternal vengeance</hi> to the disobedient. <hi>I have but now given my body and my blood even to the Traitour</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And then is it not matter of Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to see men fancy they have a right in all Christ's actions and sufferings, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume upon his favour and their own happy condition, though they do nothing, or but very little towards this, and the maine of their life be disobedience, as if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94586:9"/>
all <hi>Christs commands,</hi> appointed them to <hi>do no commands,</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> were but a <hi>liberty</hi> from <hi>virtue.</hi> To pass by those that do nothing but evil, that which the Devil does suggest, or their flesh dictate, and to consider the demurer sort of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> that pretend a respect to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to Religion, and see what they will doe.</p>
            <p>Why sometimes you may find them <hi>troubled</hi> at their Vices, and themselves; and those troubles breath out in <hi>Sighs,</hi> and in <hi>warme-wishes</hi> that they could do that which <hi>Christ</hi> prescribes: to <hi>will is</hi> sometimes strongly <hi>present with them,</hi> but to <hi>performe</hi> they <hi>know not how.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las <hi>Christ</hi> does not tell you that you are <hi>his friends</hi> if you <hi>wish well</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his commands,</hi> but he requires that you shall <hi>do them.</hi> These are but <hi>vapours</hi> of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled soul, which howsoever they may chance rise warm, cath a strong suddain heat, breath up in flashing thoughts. They are but <hi>meteors,</hi> little shooting flames that onely do <hi>catch fire</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>dy</hi>; shew fair, but they warme nothing: and so
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94586:10"/>
these thoughts do never heat the heart into <hi>devotions</hi> and <hi>holy resolutions,</hi> the fire is not strong, nor does it live enough, to <hi>melt</hi> and <hi>worke away</hi> the filthynesses of the soul: No, though they grow to <hi>aversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>: for you may find such men, when wearied with the pursuite of their sins <hi>hating</hi> their customes, and the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the practice of them: complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus, <hi>I know 'tis ill, and 'tis against my heart, that I obey the motions of my passions or lusts: The incitations of my appetite, the usance of the world, the obligations of civility or mistaken honour do indeed prevaile upon me, but 'tis with great reluctancy of minde that I yeild to them, but I cannot avoid it.</hi> There are not few that satisfie themselves with this condition. Now sure <hi>Christ</hi> does not say, <hi>Ye cannot be my friends</hi> except you <hi>sin against me and against your Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>your Conscience</hi> too. 'Tis strange that men should think the Heathen instance of a Witch that cryed
<q>
                  <l>—Video meliora, proboque,</l>
                  <l>Deteriora sequor—</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94586:10"/>
I know, and do approve of better things, but cannot choose but follow these that are the worser: strange, that this <hi>fury</hi> that had the <hi>Devil for familiar,</hi> should make <hi>Christ a friend</hi>; that this should be the state of <hi>Gospel Saints,</hi> and of <hi>God's favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites.</hi> 'Tis possible some therefore go yet further to good purposes towards <hi>Obedience,</hi> and have <hi>holy intentions,</hi> but this is not sufficient neither, if to <hi>do his commands</hi> be necessary: for to <hi>purpose</hi> and <hi>intend to do them,</hi> is not certainly to <hi>do them.</hi> Yet where are any, that do aim at doing any more; and there is none of these but does presume upon his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in <hi>Christ,</hi> and satisfies himself and is secure.</p>
            <p>Yet is it hard to find a ground of this their confidence, unless it rise from the unhappy use they make of <hi>God's preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercies,</hi> and his kindness to them in the concernments of this life. They see without their cares, and upon very weak entreaties indeed against all provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both of God and danger; yet his protections secure them all, though they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94586:11"/>
neither minde the asking them, nor minde the walking worthy of them. The man whose <hi>sins,</hi> not <hi>p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayers,</hi> prepare him for his bed, he sleeps well; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more soundly then he who at his bed-side throws himself on his face into God's arms, and there <hi>bequeaths</hi> himselfe to the <hi>securities</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi>: And he, whose Sleeps onely refresh him for returns to sin, does often live as long, as safely, and as merrily, as he that dayly, most religiously does begg protections from above. And others that affoord the <hi>Lord</hi> some <hi>little homages,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves some <hi>prayers</hi> when their <hi>pleasures</hi> or <hi>occasions</hi> permit, God hath a <hi>care</hi> of them, and their <hi>desires flow</hi> into them, all does <hi>succeed well</hi> with them. Now they take confidence hence to conclude, these are the <hi>tokens</hi> of <hi>Gods friendship,</hi> and <hi>all his mercies</hi> will come in at the <hi>like easie rates</hi>; that <hi>such a short petition</hi> as commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the <hi>refreshments of the night,</hi> and after which they <hi>wak't</hi> into <hi>renewed</hi> strengths and pleasures, <hi>such another</hi> shall lay them down in safety, to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94586:11"/>
sleeps of that <hi>long night,</hi> that afterwards will break in <hi>happy resurrection</hi>: for why! God will not sure fail his <hi>own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> but be as friendly to their <hi>souls</hi> as he is to their <hi>bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus God's preservations here, in meer defiance of our provocations, which are the <hi>arts of his long suffering</hi> his <hi>strivings of Compassion,</hi> meerly to give us <hi>opportunities</hi> of being reconciled to him, and to <hi>invite</hi> us to be so, while we make them occasions of <hi>carelesness</hi> and <hi>security,</hi> they are so far from being <hi>pledges</hi> of his <hi>friendship,</hi> that they have all the aggravations of <hi>affronted goodness,</hi> become <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of ruin. 'Twere fine indeed if <hi>Christ's</hi> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preparations for his friends, would come in to us, without care or doing any thing, as an accession to our pleasures; if when we had lived many years in a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> our days all <hi>Flower'd</hi> with delight; we might expire into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and in soft aires of <hi>Musick</hi> breath into <hi>Hallelujah</hi>'s. But alas! the smooth <hi>easy way</hi> leads <hi>down the Hill,</hi> and he must <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>pant</hi> that will get <hi>up</hi> into the <hi>Mansions</hi> and the <hi>Bosom</hi> of his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94586:12"/>
Saviour, and whosoever will be <hi>his friend,</hi> must <hi>do what he commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is there nothing less indeed will qualify? The <hi>Scripture saith, that</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God, James</hi> ii. 23. and then, is <hi>Christ</hi> more <hi>inaccessible,</hi> and <hi>harder</hi> to be made a <hi>friend?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, truly <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> both are so much <hi>friends</hi> to all <hi>true believers,</hi> that the life of Christ was given for them; <hi>for, God so loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. John</hi> iii. 16. nor are there any qualities more signally peculiar to friendship, more engaging then <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>trust, dependance</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, embosoming</hi> my self in him: now <hi>these</hi> are but the <hi>exercise of Faith</hi>; and tis most certain if we heartily endeavour to do what he commands, there is employment then for all this <hi>work of Faith,</hi> place for its <hi>applications</hi> and <hi>assurances.</hi> My <hi>Text</hi> does make this good. But when his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is made over on <hi>conditions,</hi> as tis not onely in these words, but every where in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94586:12"/>
Scriptures; (there being not one promise absolute that does concern <hi>Gods favour, justification,</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi>: he does not once offer remission of sins, but to those that amend their lives; nay, does express as if he <hi>could not give</hi> it otherwise, <hi>perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they will repent that I may forgive them, Jeremy</hi> xxxvi. 3) The promises there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being conditional, Faith must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the promises that it does rest on and apply; and at the most, can be but <hi>an assurance, that you shall be partaker of what's promised,</hi> that is to say, partaker of the <hi>favour</hi> and the <hi>life of Christ, if ye do his commands.</hi> But then if I perform not this condition, to <hi>trust</hi> upon his friendship which I am <hi>not qualified</hi> for; to think by <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>receive a pardon,</hi> which in that case I am, was <hi>never offered</hi> me; to apply to my self promises which were <hi>never made me,</hi> for none were ever made to them that do <hi>not do</hi>; and to <hi>assure</hi> my self, <hi>Christ</hi> will transgress his everlasting Covenant for my <hi>Vices</hi> sake, meerly to give me leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my sins; will do that which <hi>God may not do, forgive</hi> one that <hi>will not repent</hi>: If
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94586:13"/>
I <hi>believe</hi> thus against <hi>promise,</hi> and against <hi>decree,</hi> am <hi>confident</hi> whether <hi>Christ will or no,</hi> and <hi>will rely</hi> upon him <hi>in despite of him,</hi> if such a faith will make us friends, <hi>affronts</hi> do reconcile. This is indeed <hi>to lay violent hands on his favour,</hi> and to <hi>invade</hi> his <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and without metaphor, <hi>take Heaven by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But sure I am, that this is not the faith made <hi>Abraham</hi> be called <hi>the friend of God</hi> in that place of Saint <hi>James,</hi> but a <hi>faith that was perfected by doing,</hi> v. 22. of that Chapter, a faith that made him <hi>offer up his onely Son upon the Altar,</hi> v. 21. 'Tis true, <hi>he did in hope believe against all hope, Rom</hi> iv. 18. So that his faith was stronger then a contradiction, but yet his resolutions of obedience seem stronger then his faith; for he did that even to the cutting off the grounds of all his Faith, and hope. He trusted God would make his promise good to him, make <hi>all the Nations of the Earth be blessed in the seed of</hi> Isaac; though <hi>Isaac</hi> had no seed, nor could have, if he should be slain: And he resolved at Gods command himself to slay that <hi>Isaac,</hi> so to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94586:13"/>
make him have no seed. His Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did no <hi>dispute</hi> the great impossibility; but his obedience <hi>caused</hi> it. He did not question, how can God perform with me when I have offered up my son? I cannot look that a <hi>large Progeny</hi> should rise out of the <hi>Ashes</hi> on the Altar; nor will those Flames that <hi>devour</hi> all my seed at once, may my <hi>seed numerous, lasting,</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the Stars in Heaven,</hi> which he <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 5.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised me: but much less did he questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why should I obey in this? He that does his commands, can but expect what he hath promis'd: but if I should do this command and slay my Son, I make his promise void, and detroy my own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations: and if I disobey I can but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what he bids me do; my own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will execute all that his indignation would threaten to my Disobedience. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> had <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> xxii. 4.</note> 
               <hi>three daies</hi> time and journy to the Altar, that <hi>Nature</hi> might have leisure the mean while to <hi>reason</hi> with the <hi>precept</hi> thus, and his <hi>affection</hi> might struggle with his <hi>duty</hi>; yet he goes on, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to tear out his own bowels, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94586:14"/>
cut of his hopes, will Sacrifice his <hi>onely Son,</hi> and Sacrifice <hi>God's promise</hi> to his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, He that will trust to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s example of <hi>believing,</hi> yet will not follow him at all in <hi>doing,</hi> will obey no commands; that is so far from offering up an <hi>onely Son,</hi> he will not slay an <hi>onely evil custome,</hi> nor part with <hi>one</hi> out of the <hi>herd</hi> of all his vicious habits; will not give up the satisfaction to any of his <hi>carnal, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>ambitious</hi> appetites; not Sacrifice a <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> or a <hi>lust</hi> to all the Obligations, that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> can urge him with, he hath, nor <hi>faith,</hi> nor <hi>friendship,</hi> no, nor <hi>fore-head.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, he that hath <hi>Abraham's faith,</hi> may well assure himself he is <hi>Christ's friend</hi>; but tis onely on this account, because he that believes as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, he will not stick to <hi>do whatever Christ commands</hi>; which is that <hi>universality</hi> of obedience, that is the <hi>next</hi> condition that entitles to Christ's friendship, and my <hi>last</hi> part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi>

            <p>There is no quality so necessary to a

friend, or so appropriate to friendship, as <hi>sincerity.</hi> They that have but <hi>one soul,</hi> they can have no <hi>reserves</hi> from one another: But disobedience to <hi>one</hi> precept, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with sincerity, that hath <hi>respect unto all the commandments</hi>; and he that will not do whatever <hi>Christ</hi> prescribes, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves of affection for some <hi>darling</hi> sin, and is false to his Saviour.

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7.</note>: Now such a rebel, is, we know, the worst of enemies. Saint <hi>James</hi> does say as much of any of those vicious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that are set on the world: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will be a friend of the world, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God. James</hi> iv. 4. and he calls them <hi>adultereses</hi> and <hi>adulterers,</hi> who think to joyn great strict Religion to some little by-love of an honour, or a profit of this world? Such men are like a wife, that not contented with the partner of her
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94586:15"/>
takes in another now and then, she must not count her self her husbands friend, though she give him the <hi>greatest share</hi> in her affections, no, she is but a <hi>bosom enemy</hi>: and so any one vice allow'd is a <hi>paramour,</hi> sin is whoredome against <hi>Christ,</hi> and our pretended friendship to him in all <hi>other obediences,</hi> is but the <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and the <hi>caresses</hi> of an <hi>adulteress,</hi> the meer <hi>hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>treachery</hi> of love. If it be necessary to the gaining of <hi>Christs friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> that thou <hi>do his commands,</hi> 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that thou <hi>do them all,</hi> that thou divorce thy self from thy beloved sin, as well as any <hi>other</hi>: because, his friendship does no more require <hi>other</hi> obedience then it does <hi>that,</hi> but is as inconsistent with thy <hi>own peculiar</hi> vice as with the rest. Indeed it is impossible that it should bear with any, they being all his murderers. If thou canst find <hi>one</hi> sin that had no hand in putting <hi>Christ</hi> to death, <hi>one</hi> vice that did not come into the <hi>garden,</hi> nor upon <hi>mount Calvary,</hi> that did not helpe to <hi>assassin</hi> thy Saviour, even take thy fill of <hi>that</hi>: but if each had a stab at him, if <hi>no one</hi> of thy

vices could have been <hi>forgiven,</hi> had not thy <hi>Jesus died</hi> for it, canst thou expect he should have <hi>kindness</hi> for his agony, or <hi>friendship,</hi> for the man that entertaines his <hi>Crucifiers</hi> in his heart: if <hi>worldly cares</hi> which he calls <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>And now if these conditions seem <hi>hard,</hi> if any do not care to be his friend upon these terms, they may betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to others.

that <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>lust</hi> can wish for, all that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities</hi> or <hi>wantonness</hi> proposeth to it self to dress out <hi>pomp</hi> or <hi>vice</hi>: But yet when with enjoyment the affections grow, and become so unquiet, work them so, as not to let their thoughts or actions rest, make them, quicken themselves, and like the motions of all things that go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tending to the Earth, increase by the continuance, grow stronger, and more violent towards the end, then when they are most passionate, it failes them: and having fill'd their life with most unsatisfied tormenting cares, it leaves them <hi>nothing</hi> but the <hi>guilt of all</hi>: when their great wealth shall shrink into a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle sheet,</hi> no more of it be left, but a <hi>thin shroud,</hi> and all their vast inheritances, but <hi>six foot</hi> of earth, be gone, yet the <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of all</hi> will stick close to them: and this <hi>false friend,</hi> that does it self forsake them, will neither <hi>go</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let others joy in friends that <hi>wine</hi> does get them: such as have no qualification to endear them, but this, that they will not refuse to <hi>sin</hi> and to be <hi>sick</hi> with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: men that do onely <hi>drink</hi> in their affections, as full of <hi>friendship</hi> as of <hi>liquor,</hi> and probably they do <hi>unload</hi> themselves of <hi>both at once,</hi> part with their <hi>dearness</hi> and their <hi>drink together,</hi> and alike.

into us, but they <hi>provoke</hi> too and <hi>inflame</hi> those tendencies that they may be <hi>more useful</hi> to us, having no other means to work their ends. And then such friends by the same reason, must be <hi>false</hi> and <hi>tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,</hi> and all that we <hi>declaime</hi> at, and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre</hi> in <hi>enemies,</hi> when that shall be the way to serve their ends; because they have no virtue to engage them to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: and to be such, is to be constant to their own <hi>designs,</hi> their <hi>dispositions</hi> and <hi>usances.</hi> These are the <hi>pests</hi> of all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, they speak and live <hi>infection,</hi> and <hi>friendship</hi> with them is to couple with the <hi>Plague.</hi> These do <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> what the <hi>Devil</hi> but <hi>began</hi> in <hi>Eden</hi>: Nurse up <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal sin,</hi> chafe inclination into <hi>appetite</hi> and <hi>habit,</hi> suggest and raise desires, and then feed them into <hi>constitution</hi> and <hi>nature</hi>: in a word, are a <hi>brood</hi> of those <hi>serpents, one</hi> of which was enough to destroy <hi>paradise,</hi> and <hi>innocence.</hi> Tis true, a man would think these were our friends indeed, that venture to <hi>Gehenna</hi> for us: Alas they are but more <hi>familiar devils,</hi> work under <hi>Sathan</hi> to bring us to torments, and differ nothing from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94586:18"/>
him, but that they <hi>draw us into</hi> them, and he <hi>inflicts</hi> them. And when sinful contents come home in ruine, and pleasures dy into damnation; then men will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these treacherous loves, and find such friends are but <hi>projectours</hi> for the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; then they will hate them as they do their own damnation, discerning these are but the kindnesses of <hi>Hell.</hi> Nay, it is possible, I may slander that place in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so ill of it. <hi>Dives</hi> will let us see there are affections of a <hi>kinder</hi> and more <hi>blessed</hi> strain in <hi>Hell Luke</hi> xvi. from the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seventh verse; you find he did make truce with torments, that he might contrive and begg onely a message of repentance for his brethren; he did not mind at all his own dire Agonies, he minded so the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his friends. Good God! when I reflect upon these <hi>pieties</hi> of the <hi>damn'd</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>practices</hi> of those who have given their names in to <hi>Religion,</hi> when I see <hi>fiends</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi> do study how to make men <hi>virtuous,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> upon <hi>earth</hi> with all their art debauch them into <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>ruine,</hi> I cannot choose but pray, <hi>Grant

me such friends as are in Hell.</hi> Rather grant us all the <hi>friendship</hi> in the <hi>Text.</hi> But then, we must have none with any vice. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with that engageth into enmity with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> I shew'd you. And to passe over all those after-retributions of vengeance <hi>Christ</hi> hath studied for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when he, that now courts us to be our friend, and we will make our <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> must be our <hi>Judge</hi>: For were there none of this, and should we look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then this life; yet sure, we of this Nation know, what it is to have <hi>God</hi> our <hi>enemy</hi>; who for so many years, lay under such inflictions, as had much of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his <hi>last executions</hi>; they had the <hi>blasphemies</hi> and the <hi>confusion,</hi> the <hi>dire guilts,</hi> and the <hi>black calamities,</hi> and almost the <hi>despair</hi> and <hi>irrecoverableness</hi> of those in <hi>Hell.</hi> And though He be at <hi>peace</hi> with us at present, at least there is a truce; yet I beseech you in the presence and the fear of God, to think in earnest, whether the present provocations of this Nation do not <hi>equall</hi> those that twenty years agoe engaged him into
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94586:19"/>
Arms against us, and made him dash us so in pieces: whether those Actions of the <hi>Clergy</hi> be reformed, that made the people to abhorre their <hi>function</hi> and their <hi>service,</hi> the <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Lord, and made God himself spew them out. 'Twere endless to go on to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,</hi> to the <hi>loose impieties</hi> and the bold <hi>Atheismes</hi> of the <hi>Laity,</hi> especially of the <hi>better-sort</hi>; in short what one degree, or state or Sex is better? Sure I am, if we are not better, we are worse beyond expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or recovery: who have resisted every method, and conquerd all God's arts of doing good upon us, been too hard for his <hi>judgments</hi> and his <hi>mercies</hi> both.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, when we lay gasping under his severe revenges, we then pretended to be humbled, <hi>begg'd</hi> to be reconciled and be at peace with him, and <hi>vow'd</hi> to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, promising obedience, and <hi>aliened</hi> our selves from our old sins, his foes. But then, when <hi>Christ</hi> came to <hi>confirme</hi> this amity, came drest with all his courtships, brought all the invitations of Love along, Our <hi>Prince</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94586:20"/>
and <hi>State, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Beauty of Holyness,</hi> every thing that might make us be an happy and a pious nation, thus he did tempt, and labour to engage that friendship which we offered him and vowed to him: And we no sooner seiz'd all this, but we break <hi>resolutions</hi> as well as <hi>duty,</hi> to get loose from him; and laden with the spoyls of our defeated Saviour's goodness, we joyne hands with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, resume our old acquaintance-sins, enrich and serve them with his bounties, make appear that we onely drew him in, to work such miracles, but to assist our <hi>Worldlyness, Ambitions</hi> and <hi>Lusts,</hi> to be our opportunities of vice, and provocation of him. And being thus affronted and refused, his enemy preferr'd, <hi>not this God but Barabbas,</hi> any the vilest thing for friend, rather then <hi>Christ,</hi> must he not needs be more our enemy then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

And if you reade the xxv. Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> you will find there a rich bill of <hi>fare,</hi> which his revenge upon his enemies does make, view the sixth verse.

            <p>And if the vicious friendships of the <hi>world</hi> have so much more attractive then <hi>Christ's</hi> love and favour, and the happy consequences of it, as to counterpoise all the danger of such enmity, you may joyn hands with them: but if <hi>his</hi> be the safer and more advantageous, then hearken to his <hi>propositions</hi> and <hi>beseechings</hi>; for He does begg it of you: as he treated this reconciliation in his <hi>blood,</hi> so he does in <hi>Petitious</hi> too.
