            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Explanation of the Frontispiece.</head>
            <l>BIlliards <hi>from</hi> Spain at first deriv'd its name,</l>
            <l>Both an ingenious, and a cleanly Game.</l>
            <l>One <hi>Gamester</hi> leads (the Table green as grass)</l>
            <l>And each like <hi>Warriers</hi> strive to gain the <hi>Pass.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But in the contest, e're the <hi>Pass</hi> be won,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hazzards</hi> are many into which they run.</l>
            <l>Thus whilst we play on this <hi>Terrestrial Stage,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Nothing but <hi>Hazzard</hi> doth attend each age.</l>
            <l>Next here are <hi>Hazzards</hi> play'd another way,</l>
            <l>By Box and Dice; 'tis <hi>Hazzard</hi> is the Play.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Bully-Rock</hi> with mangy fist, and Pox,</l>
            <l>Iustles some out, and then takes up the Box.</l>
            <l>He throws the <hi>Main,</hi> and crys, Who comes at <hi>Seven?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus with a <hi>dry fist nicks</hi> it with <hi>Eleven.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>If out, he raps out Oaths I dare not tell,</l>
            <l>Hot, piping out, and newly come from Hell.</l>
            <l>Old-Nick <hi>o're-hearing, by a</hi> Palming-trick</l>
            <l>Secures the <hi>Gamester;</hi> thus the <hi>Nickers nickt.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now t' <hi>Irish,</hi> or <hi>Back-Gammoners</hi> we come,</l>
            <l>Who wish their money, with their men safe home;</l>
            <l>But as in War, so in this subtle Play,</l>
            <l>The stragling men are ta'ne up by the way.</l>
            <l>By entring then, one reinforceth more,</l>
            <l>It may be to be lost, as those before.</l>
            <l>By <hi>Topping, Knapping,</hi> and foul play some win;</l>
            <l>But those are losers, who so gain by sin.</l>
            <l>After these three the <hi>Cock-pit</hi> claims a name;</l>
            <l>A sport gentile, and call'd a <hi>Royal Game.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now see the Gallants crowd about the <hi>Pit,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And most are stockt with Money more than Wit;</l>
            <l>Else-sure they would not, with so great a stir,</l>
            <l>Lay ten to one on a <hi>Cocks</hi> faithless Spur.</l>
            <l>Lastly, observe the Women with what grace</l>
            <l>They sit, and look their Partners in the face.</l>
            <l>Who from their eyes shoot <hi>Cupids</hi> fiery Darts;</l>
            <l>Thus make them lose at once their Game and Hearts.</l>
            <l>Their white soft hands, (when e're the Cards they cut)</l>
            <l>Make the men wish to change the Game to <hi>Putt.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Women knew their thoughts, then cry'd, Enough,</l>
            <l>Lets leave off <hi>Whist,</hi> and go to <hi>Putt,</hi> or <hi>Ruff.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Ladies don't trust your secrets in that hand,</l>
            <l>Who can't their own (to their great grief) command.</l>
            <l>For this I will assure you, if you do,</l>
            <l>In time you'l lose your <hi>Ruff</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> too.</l>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was once resolv'd to
have let this ensuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
to have stept naked into
the World, without so much
as the least rag of an Epistle
to defend it a little from the
cold welcome it may meet
with in its travails; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that not only custom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
but necessity requires it,
give me leave to show you
the motives inducing to this
present publication.</p>
            <p>It is not (I'le assure you)
any private interest of my
own that caus'd me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb facs="tcp:56740:4"/>
on this subject, but
the delight and benefit of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
individual person; Delight
to such who will pass away
their spare minuts in harmless
recreation if not abus'd; and
Profit to all, who by inspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all manner of Games may
observe the cheats and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and so be arm'd against the
injuries may accrue thereby.</p>
            <p>Certainly there is no man
so severe to deny the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Recreation; There
was never any Stoick found
so cruel, either to himself, or
nature, but at some time or
<pb facs="tcp:56740:4"/>
other he would unbend his
mind, and give it liberty to
stray into some more pleasant
walks, than the miry heavy
ways of his own sowr, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
resolutions. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Heathen Sages of
the first world founded with
their Laws their Feasts, with
their Labours their Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
with their Warfare
their Triumphs. Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at this
day the severest <hi>Dionysian</hi>-Pedagogue
will give his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
their Play-days, &amp; Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
up with a <hi>Horum mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere
laborum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fessum quies pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
<pb facs="tcp:56740:5"/>
juvat.</hi> And the most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Masters will tye their
servants but to certain hours;
every toyl exacting as <hi>ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
or out of duty some time
for Recreation. I my self have
observed in the course of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men of exceeding strict
lives and conversation, to
whom although severity of
profession, infirmity of body,
extremity of age, or such like,
have taken away all actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
yet have their minds
begot unto themselves some
habits or customs of delight,
which have in as large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="tcp:56740:5"/>
given them contentment
whether they were their own,
or borrowed, as if they had
been the sole actors of the
same. Furthermore, Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not only lawful but
necessary:
<q>
                  <l>Interpone tuis inter dum ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dia curis,</l>
                  <l>Vt possis animo quemvis sufferre laborem.</l>
                  <l>So intermix your care with joy, you may</l>
                  <l>Lighten your labour by a little play.</l>
               </q>
Now what Recreation this
should be I cannot prescribe,
nor is it requisite to confine
any to one sort of pleasure,
since herein Nature taketh
to her self an especial Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
for what to one is most
pleasant, to another is most
<pb facs="tcp:56740:6"/>
offensive; Some seeking to
satisfie the Mind, some the
Body, and others both in a
joint motion. To this end I
have laid before you what
variety of Pastimes I could
collect for the present, leaving
the rest (as you like these) to
be suppli'd hereafter. Mistake
me not, it is not my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make Gamesters by this
Collection, but to inform all
in part how to avoid being
cheated by them: If I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect

            <p>To conclude, let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you, if you play (when
your business will permit) let
<pb facs="tcp:56740:7"/>
not a covetous desire of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
another's money en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you to the losing your
own; which will not only
disturb your mind, but by
the disreputation of being a
Gamester, if you lose not
your estate, you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lose your credit and good
name, than which there is
nothing more valuable. Thus
hoping you will be thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd,
and will withal excuse
my Errors, I shall ever study
how to serve you, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
my self a well-willer to

            <head>Of Gaming in General, or an Ordinary
described.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Aming</hi> is an enchanting <hi>witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
gotten betwixt <hi>Idleness</hi> and
<hi>Avarice:</hi> An itching Disease,
that makes some scratch the
head, whilst others, as if they were bitten
by a <hi>Tarantula,</hi> are laughing themselves
to death: Or lastly, it is a paralytical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
which seizing the arm the man
cannot chuse but shake his elbow. It
hath this ill property above all other
Vices, that it renders a man incapable
of prosecuting any serious action, and
makes him always unsatisfied with his
own condition; he is either lifted up
to the top of mad joy with success, or
plung'd to the bottom of despair by
misfortune, always in extreams, always
in a storm; this minute the Gamester's
countenance is so serene and calm, that
one would think nothing could disturb
it, and the next minute so stormy and
tempestuous that it threatens destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it self and others; and as he is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56740:9"/>
transported with joy when he wins, so
losing he is tost upon the billows of a
high swelling passion, till he hath lost
sight both of sense and reason.</p>
            <p>I have seen some Dogs bite the stones
which boys have thrown at them, not
regarding whence they were flung; so
I have seen a losing Gamester greedily
gnawing the innocent Box, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tearing it to pieces as an accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his <hi>throwing</hi> out; nor must the
Dice go unpunished for not running
his <hi>chance,</hi> and therefore in rage are
thrown on the ground to be kickt to
and fro by every body; and at last
lookt upon no other than the fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of every saucy <hi>Skip-jack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then fresh Dice are called for, as
thinking they will prove more kind
than the former, or as if they believed
that some were good natur'd, others
bad, and that every Bale produced a
different disposition. If these run cross
too, the Box-keeper shall not go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a horrid execration, if for nothing
else but that he lookt strictly to the
cast, it may be conceiving that his
very eyes were capable of making them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56740:9"/>
turn to his disadvantage. This rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
man (the miserable Gamester) is
the proper subject of every mans pity.
Restless I call him, because (such is the
itch of play) either winning or losing
he can never rest satisfied, if he wins
he thinks to win more, if he loses he
hopes to recover: To this mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the saying of <hi>Hannibal</hi> to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
may be fitly applied, that <hi>nec
bonam, nec malam fortunam ferre po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,</hi>
he could not be quiet either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
or Conquered. Thus have I
heard of some who with five pounds
have won four hundred pounds in one
night, and the next night have lost it
to a sum not half so much; others who
have lost their estates and won them
again with addition, yet could not be
quiet till they lost them irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>And therefore fitly was that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
propounded, <hi>Whether men in Ships
at Sea were to be accounted among the
living or the dead, because there were
but few inches betwixt them and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
The same <hi>quaere</hi> may be made of
great <hi>Gamesters,</hi> though their estates
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56740:10"/>
be never so considerable, Whether they
are to be esteemed poor or rich, since
there are but few <hi>Casts</hi> at <hi>Dice</hi> betwixt
a rich man (in that circumstance) and
a beggar.</p>
            <p>Now since speculation will not be
convincing, unless we shew somewhat
of the modern practice; we must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lay our <hi>Scene</hi> at an <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and
proceed to action: Where note, an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
is a handsom house, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, about the hour of twelve, a good
Dinner is prepared by way of <hi>Ordinary,</hi>
composed of variety of dishes, in season,
well-drest, with all other accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
fit for that purpose, whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentlemen of great Estates and good
repute, make this place their resort, who
after Dinner play a while for recreation,
both moderately and commonly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deserving reproof: But here is the
mischief, the best Wheat will have Tares
growing amongst it, Rooks and Daws

                  </gap>ry,</hi> being forc'd

               </gap>ke an advantage, when
the <hi>Box-keeper goes with him,</hi> and then
the Knave and Rascal will violate his
trust for profit, and lend him (when
he sees good) a <hi>Tickler</hi> shall do his
business; but if discovered, the Box-keeper
ought to be soundly kickt for
his pains: Such practices, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Box-keepers connivances, are
so much us'd of late, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56740:11"/>
near that fair play in an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
as formerly.</p>
            <p>The day being shut in, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
compare this place to those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which lye far in the North, where
it is as clear at midnight as at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:
And though it is a house of Sin,
yet you cannot call it a house of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for the Candles never go out till
morning, unless the sudden fury of a
losing Gamester make them extinct.</p>
            <p>This is the time (when ravenous
beasts usually seek their prey) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
comes shoals of <hi>Huffs, Hectors, Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Gilts, Pads, Biters, Divers, Lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Filers, Budgies, Droppers, Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
&amp;c.</hi> and these may all pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the general and common appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Rooks.</hi> And in this particular, an
<hi>Ordinary</hi> serves as a <hi>Nursery</hi> for <hi>Tyburn;</hi>
for if any one will put himself to the
trouble of observation, he shall find,
that there is seldom a year wherein there
are not some of this Gang hang as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Iewels</hi> in the ear of <hi>Tyburn:</hi> Look
back and you will find a great many
gone already, God knows how many
are to follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56740:11"/>These Rooks are in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
walking from one Table to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till they can discover some unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
young Gentleman, Casheer or
Apprentice, that is come to this <hi>School
of Virtue,</hi> being unskill'd in the quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and devices there practised; these
they call <hi>Lambs,</hi> or <hi>Colls:</hi> Then do the
<hi>Rooks</hi> (more properly called <hi>Wolves</hi>)
strive who shall fasten on him first, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him close, and engaging him
in some advantageous Bets, and at
length worries him, that is, gets all his
money, and then the <hi>Rooks</hi> (Rogues
I should have said) laugh and grin,
saying, <hi>the Lamb is bitten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of these <hi>Rooks</hi> will be very
importunate to borrow money of you
without any intention to pay you; or
to go with you seven to twelve half a
Crown or more, whereby without a
very great chance (ten to one or more)
he is sure to win: If you are sensible
hereof, and refuse his proposition, they
will take it so ill, that if you have not
an especially care they will pick your
pocket, nim your gold or silver but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
off your Cloak or Coat; or it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56740:12"/>
may be draw your silver-hilted Sword
out of your belt without discovery, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if you are eager upon your
Cast, which is done thus; the silver
buttons are strung, or run upon Cats
guts fastned at the upper and nether
end; now by ripping both ends very
ingeniously (as they call it) give it the
gentile pull, and so rub off with the
buttons; and if your Cloak be loose
'tis ten to one they have it.</p>
            <p>But that which will most provoke
(in my opinion) any mans rage to a just
satisfaction, is their throwing many
times at a good Sum with a <hi>dry fist</hi> (as
they call it,) that is; if they <hi>nick</hi> you,
'tis theirs; if they lose, they owe you
so much with many other quillets:
some I have known so abominably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
that they would snatch up the
Stakes, and thereupon instantly draw,
saying, if you will have your money
you must fight for it; for he is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
and will not want: however, if
you will be patient, he will pay you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time; if you are so tame to take
this, go no more to the Ordinary; for then
the whole Gang will be ever and anon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56740:12"/>
watching an opportunity to make a
<hi>Mouth</hi> of you in the like nature. If
you nick them, 'tis odds, if they wait
not your coming out at night and beat
you: I could produce you an hundred
examples in this kind, but they will
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arely adventure on the attempt unless
they are backt with some <hi>Bully-Huffs,</hi>
and <hi>Bully-Rocks,</hi> with others whose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unes
are as desperate as their own. We
need no other testimony to confirm the
danger of associating with these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropo-phagi
or Man-Eaters, than <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns</hi>
-Inn-Fields whilst <hi>Speerings Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
was kept in Bell-yard, and that
you need not want a pair of Witnesses
for the proof thereof, take in also <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is the House it self to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted,
every night almost some one or
other, who either heated with Wine, or
made cholerick with the loss of his
Money, raises a quarrel, swords are
drawn, box and candlesticks thrown at
one anothers head, Tables overthrown,
and all the House in such a Garboyl,
that it is the perfect Type of Hell. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is the man now that can make the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56740:13"/>
frame of a Table or Chimney-corner
his Sanctuary; and if any are so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to get to the Stair-head, they will
rather hazard the breaking of their own
necks than have their Souls pusht out of
their bodies in the dark by they know
not whom.</p>
            <p>I once observed one of the <hi>Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi>
of the Town (being half drunk)
to press a Gentleman very much (at
play) to lend him a Crown, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
refus'd him several times, yet still
the Borrower persisted, and holding
his head somewhat too near the <hi>Casters</hi>
elbow, it chanced to hit his nose, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinking it to be affront enough to
be denied the loan of Money without
this slight touch of the nose, drew, and
stepping back (unawares to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)
made a full pass at him, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to have run him through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but his drunkenness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>guided
his hand, so that he ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly
through the arm: this put the house
into so great a confusion and fright, that
some fled thinking the Gentleman slain.
This wicked Miscreant thought not this
sufficient, but tripping up his heels,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56740:13"/>
pinn'd him as he thought to the floor;
and after this, takes the Gentlemans
silver sword, leaving his in the wound,
and with a <hi>Grand-Iury of Dammees</hi>
(which may hereafter find him guilty at
the <hi>Great Tribunal)</hi> bid all stand off
if they lov'd their lives, and so went
clear off with sword and liberty; but
was notwithstanding (the Gentleman
recovering) compel'd to make what sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
he was capable of making, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a long imprisonment; and was not
long abroad hefore he was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for <hi>Burglary</hi> committed, condemned,
and justly executed.</p>
            <l>—Fatebere tandem</l>
            <l>Nec Surdum, nec Tiressam quenquam esse Deorum.</l>
            <p>But to proceed on as to play: late at
night when the Company grows thin,
and your eyes dim with watching, false
Dice are frequently put upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
or they are otherwise cheated by
<hi>Topping, Slurring, Stabbing,</hi> &amp;c. and
if you be not careful and vigilant, the
Box-keeper shall score you up double
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56740:14"/>
or treble Boxes, and though you have
lost your money, dun you as severely
for it, as if it were the justest debt in
the World.</p>
            <p>The more subtile and gentiler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort of
<hi>Rooks</hi> (as aforesaid) you shall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
by their outward demeanor
from persons of condition; these will
sit by a whole evening, and observe
who wins; if the <hi>Winner</hi> be <hi>bubblea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
they will insinuate themselves into
his company by applauding his success,
advising him to leave off whilst he is
well; and lastly, by civilly inviting
him to drink a glass of Wine, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
well warm'd themselves to make
him more than half drunk they-wheadle
him in to play; to which if he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
he shall quickly have no money
left him in his Pocket, unless perchance
a Crown the Rooking-winner lent him
in courtesie to bear his charges home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>This they do by false Dice, as High-Fullams
4, 5, 6. Low-Fullams 1, 2, 3.
By Bristle-Dice, which are fitted for
their purpose by sticking a Hogs-bristle
so in the corners, or otherwise in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56740:14"/>
Dice, that they shall run high or low
as they please; this bristle must be
strong and short, by which means the
bristle bending, it will not lie on that
side, but will be tript over; and this is
the newest way of making a high or low
<hi>Fullam:</hi> the old ways are by drilling
them and loading them with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver;
but that cheat may be easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by their weight, or holding
two corners between your forefinger
and thumb, if holding them so gently
between your fingers they turn, you
may then conclude them false; or you
may try their falshood otherwise by
breaking or splitting them: others have
made them by filing and rounding;
but all these ways fall short of the Art
of those who make them: some whereof
are so admirably skilful in making a
Bale of Dice to run what you would
have them, that your Gamesters think
they never give enough for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
if they prove right. They are
sold in many places about the Town;
price current (by the help of a friend)
eight shillings, whereas an ordinary
Bale is sold for six pence; for my part I

shall tell you plainly, I would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those Bales of false Dice to be sold a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
Knaves that made them.</p>
            <p>Another way the Rook hath to
cheat, is first by <hi>Palming,</hi> that is, he
puts one Dye into the Box, and keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the other in the hollow of his little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which noting what is uppermost
when he takes him up, the same shall be
when he throws the other Dye, which
runs doubtfully any cast. Observe this,
that the bottom and top of all Dice are
seven, so that if it be 4 above, it must
be a 3 at bottom; so 5 and 2. 6 and 1.
Secondly, by <hi>Topping,</hi> and that is when
they take up both Dice and seem to
put them in the Box, and shaking the
Box you would think them both there,
by reason of the ratling occasioned with
the screwing of the Box, whereas one
of them is at the top of the Box be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his two forefingers, or secur'd
by thrusting a forefinger into the Box.
Thirdly, by slurring, that is by taking up
your Dice as you will have them advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously
lie in your hand, placing the
one a top the other, not caring if the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56740:15"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urning, and therefore a smooth-table is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ltogether requisite for this purpose;
on a rugged rough board it is a hard
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atter to be done, whereas on a smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
(the best are rub'd over with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ees wax to fill up all chinks and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ises)
it is usual for some to slur a Dye
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wo yards or more without turning.
Fourthly, by knapping, that is when
you strike a Dye dead that it shall not
stir, this is best done within the Tables;
where note there is no securing but of
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Dye, although there are some who
boast of securing both: I have seen
some so dexterous at Knapping, that
they have done it through the handle
of a quart Pot, or over a Candle and
Candlestick: but that which I most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
was throwing through the same
less than Ames Ace with two Dice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Groat held in the left hand on
the one side of the handle a foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and the Dice thrown with the
right hand on the other.</p>
            <p>Lastly, by stabbing, that is having a
Smooth Box, and small in the bottom,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56740:16"/>
you drop in both your Dice in such
manner as you would have them stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein by reason of its narrowness,
the Dice lying one upon another; so
that turning up the Box, the Dice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tumble; if a smooth Box, if true,
but little; by which means you have
bottoms according to the tops you put
in; For example, if you put in your
Dice so that two fives or two fours lie
a top, you have in the bottom turn'd up
two two's, or two treys; so if six and
an Ace a top, a Six and an Ace at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p>Now if the Gentleman be past that
<hi>Classis</hi> of Ignoramusses, then they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their purpose by Cross-byting, or
some other dexterity, of which they
have variety imaginable. A friend of
mine wondring at the many slights a
noted Gamster had to deceive, and
how neatly and undiscoverably he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
his tricks, wondring withall he
could not do the like himself, since he
had the same Theory of them all, and
knew how they were done; O young
man, replied the Gamester, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be attain'd without pains;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56740:16"/>
wherefore had you been as laborious
as my self in the practice hereof, and
had sweated at it as many cold winter
mornings in your shirt as I have done in
mine, undoubtedly you would have
arrived at the same perfection.</p>
            <p>Here you must observe, that if these
<hi>Rooks</hi> think they have met with a sure
Bubble, they will purposely lose some
small sum at first, that they may engage
him the more freely to bleed (as they
call it) which may be at the second, if
not beware of the third meeting, which
under the notion of being very merry
with wine and good cheer, they will
make him pay for the roast.</p>
            <p>Consider the further inconveniences
of Gaming as they are rank'd under
these heads.</p>
            <p>First, if the House find you free to
the Box and a constant <hi>Caster,</hi> you shall
be treated with Suppers at night, and a
Cawdle in the morning, and have the
honour to be stiled a Lover of the
House, whilst your money lasts, which
certainly cannot be long; for here you
shall be quickly destroy'd under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of kindness as men were by the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56740:17"/>
               <hi>Lamiae</hi> of old; which you may easily
gather if from no other consideration
than this; that I have seen three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
sit down at twelve penny <hi>In and
In,</hi> and each draw forty shillings a piece
in less than three hours, the Box hath
had three pound, and all the three
Gamesters have been losers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, consider how many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have been ruined by play, I could
nominate a great many, some who have
had great estates have lost them, others
having good imployments have been
forced to desert them and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from their Creditors in some
foreign Plantation by reason of those
great debts they had contracted
through Play.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this course of life shall make
you liable to so many affronts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
vexations, as in time may breed
destraction. Thus a young fellow not
many years since, had by strange for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
run up a very small sum to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds, and thereupon put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into a garb accordingly; but not
knowing when he was well fell to play
again, fortune turn'd, he lost all, ran mad
and so died.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56740:17"/>Fourthly, is it not extreme folly for a
man that hath a competent estate to
play whether he or another man shall
enjoy it; and if his estate be small, then
to hazard even the loss of that, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
himself to absolute beggery; I
think is madness in the highest degree.
Besides, it hath been generally observed
that the loss of one hundred pounds
shall do you more prejudice in disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your mind, than the gain of two
hundred pounds shall do you good
were you sure to keep it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, consider not only your loss
of time which is invaluable, <hi>Nulla ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
est jactura quam temporis omissio,</hi> but
the damage also the very watching
brings to your health, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to the eyes, confirmed by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</p>

any other time, because there is more
gaming then. He gives more willingly
to the Butler than to the Poors-box,
and is never more religious than when
he prays he may win. He imagines he
is at play when he is at Church; he
takes his Prayer-book for a Pack of
Cards, and thinks he is shuffling when
he turns over the leaves. This man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56740:19"/>
will play like <hi>Nero</hi> when the City is on
fire, or like <hi>Archimedes</hi> when it is sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rather than interrupt his Game.
If play hath reduced him to poverty,
then he is like one a drowning, who
fastens upon any thing next at hand. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other of his shipwracks, he
hath happily lost shame, and this want
supplies him. No man puts his brain to
more use than he; for his life is a daily
invention, and each meal a new strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
and like a flie will boldly sup at
every mans cup. He will offer you a

do no less than pay for it. His borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are like <hi>Subsidies,</hi> each man a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or two, as he can well dispend,
which they lend him not with the hope
to be repaid, but that he will come no
more. Men shun him at length as they
do an Infection, and having done with
the Aye as his cloaths to him, hung on
as long as he could, at last drops off.</p>

                  </gap>es in the Country, for
the recreation of the mind and exercise
of the body.</p>
               <p>The form of a Billiard-Table is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
that is something longer than it
is broad; it is rail'd round, which
rail or ledge ought to be a little swel'd
or stuft with fine flox or cotton: the
superficies of the Table must be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with green-cloth, the finer and
more freed from knots the better it is:
the Board must be level'd as exactly as
may be, so that a Ball may run true up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56740:20"/>
any part of the Table without lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any side thereof; but what by
reason of ill-season'd boards which are
subject to warp, or the floar on which
it stands being uneven, or in time by
the weight of the Table, and the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
yielding and giving way, there
are very few Billiard-Tables which
are found true; and therefore such
which are exactly level'd are highly
valuable by a good Player; for at a
false Table it is impossible for him to
show the excellency of his Art and
Skill, whereby Bunglers many times by
knowing the windings and tricks of the
Table have shamefully beaten a very
good Gamester, who at a true Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
would have given him three in
five.</p>
               <p>But to proceed in the description
thereof; at the four corners of the
Table there are holes, and at each side
exactly in the middle one, which
are called Hazards, and have hanging
at the bottoms nets to receive the
Balls and keep them from falling to the
ground when they are hazarded. I
have seen at some Tables Wooden
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56740:20"/>
Boxes for the hazards, six of them as
aforesaid, but they are nothing near so
commendable as the former, because a
Ball struck hard is more apt to fly out
of them when struck in.</p>
               <p>There is to the Table belonging an
Ivory Port, which stands at one end
of the Table, and an Ivory King at
the other, two small Ivory Balls and
two Sticks; where note if your Balls
are not compleatly round you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expect good proof in your play:
your Sticks ought to be heavy, made of
<hi>Brasile, Lignum vitae</hi> or some other
weighty wood, which at the broad end
must be tipt with Ivory; where note, if
the heads happen to be loose, you will
never strike a smart stroke, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perceive that defect by the hollow
deadness of your stroak and faint run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of your Ball.</p>
               <p>The Game is five by day light, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
if odds be given, and three by
Candle-light or more according to
odds in houses that make a livelihood
thereof; but in Gentlemens houses
there is no such restriction; for the Game
may justly admit of as many as the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56740:21"/>
Gamesters please to make.</p>
               <p>For the Lead you are to stand on the
one side of the Table opposite to the
King, with your Ball laid near the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shon,
and your Adversary on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in like posture; and he that with
his Stick makes his Ball come nearest
the King leads first.</p>
               <p>The Leader must have a care that at
the first stroke his Ball touch not the
end of the Table leading from the
King to the Port, but after the first
stroke he need not fear to do it, and let
him so lead that he may either be in a
possibility of passing the next stroke, or
so cunningly lie that he may be in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fair probability of hazarding his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
Ball, that very stroak he plaid
after him.</p>
               <p>The first contest is who shall pass
first, and in that strife there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
opportunitities of hazarding one
another; and it is very pleasant to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what policies are used in hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another from the pass, as by
turng the Port with a strong clever
stroke; for if you turn it with your
Stick it must be set right again; but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56740:21"/>
indeed more properly he that doth it
should lose one; sometimes it is done
(when you see it is impossible to pass)
by laying your Ball in the Port, or
before your Adversaries, and then all
he can do is to pass after you; if he
hath past and you dare not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to pass after him, for fear he
should in the interim touch the King
and so win the end, you must wait
upon him and watch all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to hazard him, or King him; that
is, when his Ball lyeth in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that when you strike his Ball may
hit down the King, and then you win
one.</p>
               <p>Here note, that if you should King
him, and your Ball fly over the Table,
or else run into a hazard, that then you
lose one notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>The Player ought to have a curious
eye, and very good judgment when he
either intends to King his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
Ball, or hazard, in taking or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
out just so much of the Ball
as will accomplish either; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
must be noted in passing on
your Adversary's Ball, or corner of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56740:22"/>
Port. Some I have observed so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
at this Recreation, that if they
have had less than a fifth part of a
Ball they would rarely miss King or
Hazard.</p>
               <p>As this is a cleanly pastime, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
there are Laws or Orders made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
lolling slovingly Players, that
by their forfeitures they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to regularity and decency;
wherefore be careful you lay not
your hand on the Table when you
strike or let your sleeve drag upon it,
if you do it is a loss; if you smoak
and let the ashes of your Pipe fall
on the Table, whereby oftentimes the
Cloth is burned, it is a forfeiture, but
that should not so much deter you
from it as the hindrance piping is to
your play.</p>
               <p>When you strike a long stroke,
hold your stick neatly between your
two fore fingers and your thumb,
then strike smartly, and by aiming
rightly you may when you please ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fetch back your Adversary's Ball
when he lyeth fair for a pass, or many
times when he lyeth behind the King,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56740:22"/>
and you at the other end of the Table
you may King him backward.</p>
               <p>If you lie close you may use the
small end of your stick, or the flat of
the big end, raising up one end over
your shoulder, which you shall think
most convenient for your purpose.</p>
               <p>Have a care of raking, for if it be
not a forfeiture it is a fault hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
but if you touch your Ball
twice it is a loss.</p>
               <p>Beware when you jobb your Ball
through the Port with the great end
of your Stick that you throw it not
down, if you do it is a loss, but do
it so handsomly that at one stroke
without turning the Port with your
Stick you effect your purpose; it is
good play to turn the Port with
your Ball, and so hinder your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
from passing; neither is it amiss if
you can to make your Adversary a
Fornicator, that is having past your
self a little way, and the others Ball
being hardly through the Port you
put him back again, and it may be
quite out of pass.</p>
               <p>It argueth policy to lay a long Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56740:23"/>
sometimes for your Antagonist,
whereby he is often entrapped for
rashly adventuring at that distance,
thinking to strike your Ball into the
Hazard, which lieth very near it, he
frequently runs in himself by reason of
that great distance.</p>
               <p>There is great art in lying abscond,
that is, to lie at bo-peep with your
Adversary, either subtlely to gain a
pass or hazard.</p>
               <p>Here note, if your Adversary hath
not past and lyeth up by the King, you
may endeavour to pass again, which
if you do, and touch the King, it is
two, but if thrown down you lose:
Some instead of a King use a string
and a bell, and then you need not
fear to have the end, if you can pass
first; this is in my judgment bungling
play, there being not that curious art
of finely touching at a great distance
a King that stands very ticklishly.</p>
               <p>For your better understanding of
the Game<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> read the ensuing Orders.
But there is no better way than pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to make you perfect therein.</p>

                  <head>Orders to be observed by such who will
play at Billiards.</head>
                  <p>1. IF the Leader touch the end of the
Table with his Ball at the first
stroke he loseth one.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Follower intend to hit his
Adversaries Ball, or pass at one stroke
he must string his Ball, that is, lay it
even with the King, or he loseth one.</p>
                  <p>3. He that passeth through the Port
hath the advantage of touching the
King which is one if not thrown
down.</p>
                  <p>4. He that passeth twice, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
having not past at all, and
toucheth the King without throwing
him down wins two ends.</p>
                  <p>5. He that passeth not hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage than the Hazards.</p>
                  <p>6. He that is a Fornicator (that is,
hath past through the back of the
Port) he must pass twice through the
fore part, or he cannot have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of passing that end.</p>
                  <p>7. He that hits down the Port or
King, or hazards his own Ball, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56740:24"/>
strikes either Ball over the Table lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
one.</p>
                  <p>8. He that hazards his Adversary's
Ball, or makes it hit down the King
winneth the end.</p>
                  <p>9. If four play, two against two,
he that mistakes his stroke loseth one
to that side he is of.</p>
                  <p>10. He that after both Balls plaid,
removes the Port without consent, or
strikes his Ball twice together, or that
his Adversaries Ball touch his Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
Clothes, or playeth his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Balls, loseth one.</p>
                  <p>11. He that sets not one foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground when he strikes his
Ball shall lose an end, or if he lay his
hand or sleeve on the Cloth.</p>
                  <p>12. A stander by though he betts
shall not instruct, direct or speak in
in the Game without consent, or being
first asked; if after he is advertised
hereof he offend in this nature, for
every fault he shall instantly forfeit
Two pence for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
or not be suffer'd to stay in the
Room.</p>
                  <p>13 He that plays a Ball, while the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56740:24"/>
other runs, or takes up a Ball before it
lie still loseth an end.</p>
                  <p>14. He that removes the Port with
his Stick when he strikes his Ball, and
thereby prevents his Adversaries Ball
from passing loseth an end.</p>
                  <p>15. All controversies are to be decided
by the Standers by, upon asking judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Here note, that whosoever
breaks the King forfeits a shilling, for
the Port ten shillings, and each Stick
five shillings.</p>
                  <p>16. Five ends make a Game by Day-light,
and three by Candle-light.</p>

                  <p>There are several other Orders
which only concern the house which I
omit, as impertinent to the Rules of
playing at Billiards.</p>
                  <p>Since Recreation is a thing lawful in
it self if not abused, I cannot but
commend this as the most gentile and
innocent of any I know, if rightly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
there being none of those cheats
to be plaid at this as at several other
Games I shall hereafter mention. There
is nothing here to be used but pure
art; and therefore I shall only caution
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56740:27"/>
you to go to play, that you suffer not
your self to be over-matcht, and do
not when you meet with a better
Gamester than your self condemn the
Table, and do not swear as one did play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Nine-Pins,</hi> this <hi>L. N.</hi> hath put
false Pins upon me.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I believe this Pastime
is not so much used of late as formerly,
by reason of those spunging Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which swarm where any Billiard-Tables
are set up, who making that
single room their Shop, Kitching and
Bed-chamber; their Shop, for this is the
place where they wait for ignorant Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to be their Customers; their Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for from hence comes the Major part
of their provision, drinking and smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being their common sustenance;
and when they can perswade no more
persons to play at the Table, they
make it their dormitory, and sleep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; the Floor is their Feather-bed,
the legs of the Table their Bed-posts,
and the Table the Tester; they dream
of nothing but <hi>Hazards,</hi> being never
out of them, of <hi>passing</hi> and <hi>repassing,</hi>
which may be fitly applied to their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56740:28"/>
lewd lives, which makes them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
pass from one prison to another

               <p>
                  <hi>Trucks</hi> is an <hi>Italian</hi> Game, and is
much used in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
it is not very unlike <hi>Billiards,</hi> but
more boisterous, and in my opinion
less gentile.</p>
               <p>It is a pastime less noted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
wherefore the Tables are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
met withal; one I have seen at
<hi>Tower-hill,</hi> but so bunglingly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and so irregularly form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d and
fram'd, that it was fit for none to
play at but such who never saw or
plaid at any other than that.</p>
               <p>A right <hi>Truck-table</hi> ought to be
somewhat larger than a <hi>Billiard-table,</hi>
being at least three foot longer than
it is broad and covered with Green
Cloth, but it need not be every whit
so fine as the former.</p>
               <p>It hath three holes at each end,
besides the corner holes; the middle-most
at one end stands directly against
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56740:29"/>
the <hi>Sprigg</hi> which stands for the King
at <hi>Billiards,</hi> and the other end, middle-most
hole, stands exactly against the
<hi>Argolio,</hi> which is in the nature of a
Port at <hi>Billiards.</hi> Of each side there
are ten holes, none of these have nets
to receive the Balls, and therefore it
is a sport more troublesome than <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Argolio</hi> stands as the Port at
<hi>Billiards</hi> as aforesaid, and is made of
a strong hoop of Iron fastned to the
Table, that it cannot stirr, having a
wider passage than a Port, and in its
bending is higher from the Board.</p>
               <p>The Sprigg is another piece of Iron,
about the thickness of a Man's little
finger, and is taller than the Billiard
King, and driven into the Board, so
that it is immovable.</p>
               <p>The Tacks with which they play,
are much bigger than Billiard Sticks,
and are headed at each end with Iron;
the small end is round from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
or farther running taperwise, but
the great end is flat beneath, though
rounding a top; good Gamesters play
for the most part with the small end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56740:29"/>The Balls are made of Ivory, and
are in bigness like Tennis-balls, and
require much art in their rounding,
for otherwise they will never run
true.</p>
               <p>You may lead as you do at Billi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
but that is lookt upon as bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
play; the best Artist at this Game
usually bank at the fourth Cushon from
the end where the Argolio stands,
and is commonly markt for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whith a little chalk.</p>
               <p>The Game because it is sooner up
than Billiards, is Nine, and sometimes
Fifteen, or indeed as many, or as few
as you please.</p>
               <p>He that leads must have a care he
hit not the end, for that is a loss, but
he may bank if he please; if the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
lie in pass, the Follower must hit
him away if he can, for if he pass it
is ten to one but he wins the end,
because he may boldly strike at the
Sprigg. If the Leader lies not in pass,
he may either strike at him, or lye as
well to pass as the former, and then
all the strife lyeth in trucking one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
or striving who shall pass first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56740:30"/>In passing here is this subtlety to
be observed, if your Adversary's Ball
lie strait before the Argolio, and yours
lies a little behind it, and it is your
stroke, you would think it impossible
to pass by reason of that obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whereas it is easily done thus, take
the small end of your Tack, and set
it sloaping behind your Ball, but
touch it not, for if you do, you lose
the end; then bend your fist, and give
your Stick a smart cuff, and it will
raise you Ball over your Adversary's
through the Port with much facility,
this is called by Artists, falkating; all
that the follower can do to save the
end, is (lying as he doth just against
the Sprigg) to pass and touch the
Sprigg at one stroke, and that is two;
if he touch not the end, is the others;
if in striking the Sprigg too hard, he
run not out of one hole or other, and
then he loseth.</p>
               <p>For the advantage of striking you
may lay one hand on the Table, arm,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> without forfeiture; but you must
not touch your Ball with your sleeve
or hand without leave first obtained
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56740:30"/>
under the loss of the end. As thus,
you may not know which is your
Ball, upon this you cry, <hi>By your leave,
Sir,</hi> and then you may take it up and
see by the mark whether it be yours
or not.</p>
               <p>If you truck your Adversary's Ball
it is one, but if you do it and run
out, or fly over the Table, you lose
one, so if you strike at your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary's
Ball, and one or both fly over
the Table it is a loss to you.</p>
               <p>If after you have past you truck
your Adversary's Ball and hit the
Sprigg it is three; if you pass at one
stroke truck your Adversary's Ball and
hit the Sprigg you win four; this is
very rarely done, as you may well
imagin, yet I have seen it done, but
never done by design, but casually;
there is much art in holding your
Tack rightly, the best way I can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you is to hold the great end in
your right hand, and level the small
end over your fore-finger and thumb,
leaning your left arm on the Table,
for the more steddy and direct guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of your Tack to transmit the Ball
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56740:31"/>
to what part of the Table you shall
think most requisite, and when you
intend a smart stroke let your shove
be brisk.</p>
               <p>In short I must leave this as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Games to your observation and
practice; only this let me advise you,
if any difference arise leave it to the
judgment of the Table, to decide the
Controversie, but end it not with your
lives, by using two such clubbing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
as you play with, for with one
stroke (they are so strong &amp; heavy) they
are sufficient to dash out a mans brains,
and by the several great mischiefs
have been done thereby be advised
not to fall into the like dangerous
rashness.</p>
               <p>One thing I had almost forgot, and
that is, if you fulkate over hand be
very careful how you strike your Ball,
for by carelesness or missing your Ball
you frequently wound the Table. Now
fulkating over hand, is, when you lie
near the Cushon for a pass, and your
Adversary's Ball lies directly before
yours, to make yours to jump over his
through the Argolio, you must strike
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56740:31"/>
a strong stroke,sloaping downwards,
which will make your Ball mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft.</p>

                  <p>1. IF the Leader touch the end, it is
the loss of one.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Follower intend to hit
his Adversary's Ball from the pass at
the first stroke he must string his Ball

               <head type="sub">Of BOWLING.</head>
               <p>BOwling is a Game or Recreation,
which if moderately used is very
healthy for the body, and would be
much more commendable than it is
were it not for those swarms of Rooks
which so pester Bowling-Greens, Bares,
and Bowling-Alleys where any such
places are to be found, some making
so small a spot of gound yield them
more annually then fifty Acres of
Land shall do elsewhere about the
City, and this done cunning, betting,
crafty matching, and basely playing
booty.</p>
               <p>In Bowling there is a great art in
chusing out his ground, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the windings, hanging, and many
turning advantages of the same, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in open wide places, as Bares
and Bowling-greens, or in close Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Alleys.
Where note that in Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the chusing of the Bowl is the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56740:33"/>
greatest cunning. Flat Bowls are best
for close Alleys; round byassed Bowls
for open grounds of advantage, and
Bowls round as a Ball for green swarths
that are plain and level.</p>
               <p>There is no advising by writing how
to bowl, practice must be your best
tutor, which must advise you the risings,
fallings, and all the several advantages
that are to be had in divers Greens, and
Bowling-Alleys; all that I shall say,
have a care you are not in the first
place rookt out of your money, and in
the next place you go not to these
places of pleasure unseasonably, that is
when your more weighty business and
concerns require your being at home,
or some where else.</p>

                  <head>The Character of a Bowling-Ally, and
Bowling-Green.</head>
                  <p>A Bowling-Green, or Bowling-Ally
is a place where three things are
thrown away besides the Bowls, <hi>viz.</hi>
Time, Money and Curses, and the last
ten for one. The best sport in it, is
the Gamesters, and he enjoys it that
looks on and betts nothing. It is a
School of wrangling, and worse than
the <hi>Schools.;</hi> for here men will wrangle
for a hairs bredth, and make a stir where
a straw would end the controversie.
Never did <hi>Mimmick</hi> screw his body into
half the forms these men do theirs; and
it is an Article of their Creed, that the
bending back of the body or screwing
in of their shoulders is sufficient to
hinder the over-speed of the Bowl, and
that the running after it adds to its
speed. Though they are skilful in
ground, I know not what grounds
they have for loud lying, crying
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56740:34"/>
sometimes the Bowl is gone <hi>a mile, a
mile,</hi> &amp;c. when it comes short of the
Jack by six yards; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
crying <hi>short, short,</hi> when he hath
overbowled as far. How sensless these
men appear when they are speaking
sense to their Bowls, putting consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in their intreaties for a good
cast. It is the best discovery of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
especially in the losers, where
you may observe fine variety of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
whilst some fret, rail, swear,
and cavel at every thing, others rejoyce
and laugh, as if that was the sole design
of their creation.</p>
                  <p>To give you the Moral of it, it is
the Emblem of the World, or the worlds
ambition, where most are short, over,
wide or wrong byassed, and some few
justle in to the <hi>Mistress,</hi> Fortune! And
here it is as in the Court, where
the nearest are the most spighted, and
all Bowls aim at the other.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of a Game at Chess.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CHess</hi> is a Royal Game and more
difficult to be understood than
any other Game whatever, and will
take up sometimes in the playing so
long a time that I have known two
play a fortnight at times before the
Game hath been ended: and indeed
I believe the tediousness of the Game
hath caus'd the practice thereof to be
so little used; however since this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime
is so highly ingenious that there
is none can parallel it, I shall here lay
down some brief instructions tending
to the knowledg thereof.</p>
               <p>The first and highest is a <hi>King,</hi> the
next in height is a <hi>Queen,</hi> the cloven
heads are <hi>Bishops;</hi> they who have
heads cut aslaunt like a feather in a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
are called <hi>Knights,</hi> the last are
called <hi>Rooks,</hi> with a round button'd
cap on his head, and these signifie the
Country and Peasantry, the <hi>Pawns</hi> are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56740:35"/>
all alike, and each Nobleman hath one
of them to wait upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Chess-men standing on the
board, you must place the White King
in the fourth house being black from
the corner of the field in the first and
lower rank, and the black King in the
white house, being the fourth on the
other side in your adversaries first rank
opposite to the white King; then place
the white Queen next to the white
King in a white house, which is the
fourth on that side of the field; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the black Queen in a black house
next to a black King in the same
rank.</p>
               <p>Then place on the other side of the
King in the same rank, first a Bishop,
because he being a man of counsel is
placed before the Knight, who is a man
of action or execution; the Knight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Bishop, and after the Knight
place the Rook (who is the Peasant or
Country-man) in the last place or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the field: place also on the
Queens side and next to her a Bishop,
next a Knight and then a Rook; the
Pawns take up the last place; one of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56740:35"/>
which you must place before each No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
as Attendants, so that these
great or Nobleman fill up the first rank
and the Pawns the second from one
corner of the field to the other,
and as many great men and Pawns as
belong to the King so many hath
the Queen, <hi>viz.</hi> three great men and
four Pawns apiece, that is, one Bishop,
one Knight, and one Rook with their
Pawns.</p>
               <p>Having thus placed and ordered
your men, you must in the next place
consider their march how they advance
and take guard and check.</p>
               <p>The Pawns do commonly begin first
the onset, and their march is forward
in their own file, one house at once
only and never backward; for the
Pawns alone never retreat, the manner
of his taking men is side-ways in the
next house forward of the next file to
him on either side, where when he hath
captivated his enemy, and placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his seat, he proceeds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
forward one house at once in
that file, until he find an opportunity
to take again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56740:36"/>The Pawn guards a Piece of his side
which stands in that place, where if it
were one of the contrary party he
might take it. In like manner the
Pawn checks the King, <hi>viz.</hi> as he takes
not as he goes, which Check if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
King cannot shun either by taking
up the Pawn himself (if the Pawn be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded,
or occasion his taking by some
of his Pieces, he must of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
himself out of the Pawns Check)
or if it lie not in his power it is Pawn-Mate,
and so the Game is ended, and
lost by him whose King is so Mate.</p>
               <p>The Rook goes backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in any file and cross-ways to and
fro in any rank as far as he will, so that
there stands no piece between him and
the place he would go to. Thus he
doth guard his own and check the King
also, which check if the King can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cover by the interposition of some
piece of his between the checking
Rook and himself, nor take the Rook,
nor be the cause of his taking, he must
remove himself out of that check or
it is Mate, and the Game is up.</p>
               <p>The Knight skips forward, backward
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56740:36"/>
and on either side from the place he
stands in to the next save one of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
colour, with a sideling march or
a sloap, thus he kills his enemies, guards
his friends, and checks the King of the
adverse party, which because (like the
Pawns check) it cannot be covered,
the King must either remove or course
the Knight to be taken (for he himself
cannot take the Knight that checks
him) or its Mate, and the Game is
up.</p>
               <p>The Bishop walks always in the same
colour of the field that he is first placed
in, forward and backward asloap e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way as far as he lists; provided,
that the way be clear between him and
the place he intends to go to: thus he
rebukes the adversary, guards his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts,
and checks the adverse King,
which not being avoided as aforesaid,
is Mate to him and the Game is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>The Queens walk is more universal;
for she goes the draughts of all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed
pieces, (the Knights only
excepted, for her march is not from one
colour to the other asloap) so far as she
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56740:37"/>
listeth finding the way obstructed
by any piece, and thus she disturbs
her adversaries, protects her subjects,
and mates the King, unless (as aforesaid)
he removes, covers, takes, or causes her
to be taken, otherwise it is his Mate and
the Game is concluded.</p>
               <p>The Kings draught is from his own
to the next to him any way, that either
is empty of his own subjects or where
he may surprise any unguarded enemy,
or where he may stand free from the
check of any of the adverse party.
Thus he confounds his foes, defends his
friends, but checks not the King his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
who never check one another;
for there must ever be one house or
place at least between the two Kings,
though unpossest of any other piece;
and if one King be compel'd to flie for
refuge to the King of the adverse party
then it is Mate or a Stale, and so he that
gives the first wins the Game. Let this
suffice for the various draughts and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
walks of the Chess-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this
is not all, I shall give you some other
instructions as brief as I may, and refer
the rest to your own observation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56740:37"/>Kings and Queens have seven a piece
to attend them. The King whether
white or black guards five persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he goes forth, and being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
into the field, though it be but
into the second house, he then and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in his March guards eight
houses till he come again to one side
or other of the field.</p>
               <p>The five the King guards before his
March, are the Queen, the Bishop, his
own, his Queens, and his Bishops
Pawn.</p>
               <p>The Queen protects her King, and
Bishop her Kings, her Bishops, and her
own Pawn. Thus the Queen guards as
many as the King before she goes forth,
and after till the Game be won or lost.</p>
               <p>The Kings Bishop guards the Kings
Pawn, and his Knights, the Queens
Bishop guards, the Queens Pawn and
her Knights guard but three houses
apiece before they go forth; but after
they are marched off from the side of
the field, they guard as many houses as
the King and Queen do. Those houses
which the Knights guard ere they go
out are the Kings. The Knight guards
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56740:38"/>
the Kings Pawn, and the third house
in the front of the Kings Bishops Pawn,
and the third house in the front of
the Kings Rooks Pawn.</p>
               <p>The Queens Knight guards her
Pawn, and the third house in the front
of her Bishops Pawn, also the third
house in the front of her Rooks Pawn.
The Kings Rook guards his own Pawn,
and the Kings Knight and no more till
he be off of the side of the field, and
then he guards four houses, and the
same does the Queens Rook. The
Pawns likewise guard these places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be advanced into the field,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Kings Pawn guards the third
house before the Queen, and the third
before the Kings Bishop, the Queens
Pawn guards the third house before
the King, and the third before her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
The Kings Bishop's Pawn guards
the third house before the King, and
the third before the Kings Knight. The
Queens Bishop's Pawn guards the third
house before the Queen, and the third
before the Queens Knight. The Kings
Knights Pawn guards the third house
before the Kings Bishop, and the third
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56740:38"/>
before the Kings Rook. The Queens
Knight's Pawn guards the third house
before the Queens Bishop, and the third
before the Queens Rook. The Kings
Rooks Pawns, and the Queens Rooks
Pawn guard but one house apiece,
that is to say, the third houses before
the Knight, because they stand on the
side of the field.</p>
               <p>Next consider the value of the great
men. The King exposeth not himself
to danger upon every occasion, but the
Queen is under him as General, and
doth more sevice than any two great
men besides; and when it happens that
she is lost, her King most certainly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the field, unless the Adversary
knows not how to make use of so great
an advantage. Wherefore if a King
lose two or three of his best men in
taking the opponents Queen, yet he
hath the best of it if he can but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
his Game rightly.</p>
               <p>Next to the Queen in value is the
Rook, and is as much in worth above
the Bishop and Knight as the Queen is
above him; so that a Rook is more
worth than two Bishops or two Knights
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56740:39"/>
because he can give a Mate by the help
of the King, which no other piece can
do, unless plaid with excellent skill.</p>
               <p>Bishops are accounted better than
Knights, because they can give a Mate
with a King when no other men are left
to help them, with more ease than the
Knights can; for they seldom or never
do it: yet it is more dangerous to lose
a Knight than a Bishop, because the
Knights check is more dangerous than
the Bishops; for the Bishop is tyed to
one colour of the field out of which he
cannot pass, but the Knight passeth
through all the houses of the field; the
Bishops check may be covered, the
Knights cannot; besides if it fall out
that one of the Kings hath no other men
left but his Bishops, and the other King
none but his Knights, the Knights with
their checks can take the Bishops one
after another, because the Bishops
cannot guard each other which the
Knights can do; so that at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Game it is better to lose
Bishops for the adversaries Knights
than the contrary.</p>
               <p>The difference of the worth of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56740:39"/>
Pawns is not so great as that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
because there is not such variety
in thier walks, only thus much, the
Kings Bishop's Pawn is the best in the
field among the Pawns, and therefore
the Gamester ought to be very careful of
him; for if it should happen that the
black King lose his Bishop's Pawn to
gain the white Kings Pawn, the black
Kings loss is the greater, because he
cannot after this accident make a rank
of Pawns of three of a rank on that
side of the field for his own security,
which is a great disadvantage, so that
it is better for either of the Kings to
lose his own Pawn than his Bishops.</p>
               <p>But if you should object that the
King which loseth his Bishops Pawn
may relieve himself on the other side of
the field, turning to his <hi>Queens</hi> Rooks
quarters, where he shall have Pawns to
succour him, I answer, 'tis true, he may
do so, but he will be a longer time in
effecting his business, because there are
more pieces between him and his
<hi>Queens</hi> Rooks by one draught than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his own Rook and himself; so
that in playing that draught he indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56740:40"/>
the whole Game if his adversary
know how to make use of advantages.
The Kings Pawn is next in worth which
oftentimes keeps the King from check
by discovery; then the Queens Pawn
is next, and after that the Knights, and
last of all the Rooks Pawns, because
they guard but one house apiece in the
field.</p>
               <p>The King and the Pawn have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
priviledges granted them, which
none of the other Chess-men have; as
for instance, The King whose remove
(as hath been already mentioned) is
from the place of his standing at any
time to the next house in file or rank of
any side (that is one only step at once,)
yet if at any time his rank be empty of
his men, so that no one stands between
the King and the Rook of either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the King may then shift or change
with what Rook he pleaseth, between
whom and himself the way stands clear
from other men; and that for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
security, provided, that neither the
King nor the Rook he intends to change
with, hath not as yet been removed
from the place of their first standing;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56740:40"/>
now the manner of the Kings shifting
or changing with a Rook is thus:</p>
               <p>The rank cleared as aforesaid, and
neither King nor Rook having yet stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he may go two draughts at once
to his own Rook, and so towards his
Queens Rook, causing the Rook he
changeth with to change his place, and
come and stand by him on the other
side; that is, his own Rook in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
place, and the Queens Rook in
the Queens place, and either of these
changes but for one draught. This is the
Kings first prerogative.</p>
               <p>The second is, that whereas any man
may be taken by any adversary, if he
be brought so near as to come within
the compass, the King cannot, but he
is only to be saluted by his adversary
with the word check, advising him
thereby to look about him the more
warily, and provide for his own safety:
now if that adversary do this unguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so near the King, he may step thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his true draught, and the King
may stay him with his own hand if he
judge it convenient.</p>
               <p>As for the Pawn, the first priviledg
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56740:41"/>
he hath, is, that whereas his walk is
but to the next house forward in his
own file at once when he marcheth, and
to the next house side-long forward of
the next file of either side, when he
takes, I say, his priviledg is, that he
may remove to the second house for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which is the fourth rank in his
own file for his first draught, and ever
after but one forward at once.</p>
               <p>The second priviledg is greater, and
that is, when any Pawn is come so far
as to the first rank of the adversary,
and seats himself in any of his Noble
houses, he is dignified for this fact with
the name and power of a Queen, and
so becomes chief of his own Kings
forces if the first Queen were slain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and if the first Queen be yet
standing in the field, the Pawn coming
to the rank aforesaid in any house
whatsoever, may there make what
piece you please which you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
lost.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion that Chess as
well as Draughts may be plaid by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule, indeed I am partly inclined
to believe it notwithstanding that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56740:41"/>
most are of a contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>The first remove is an advantage,
and therefore you must draw for who
shall have the first draught, which
may be done with a black and white
man distributed in to either hand, and
offer'd the Opponent which he will
chuse; if he chuse his own man the first
draught is his; but when a Game is
ended, and a Mate given, he is to have
the first Draught next Game who gave
the former Mate.</p>
               <p>The first remove is divers according
to the judgment of the Gamester, as
some will first remove their Kings
Knights Pawn one single remove, that is
to the third House in his own file, others
play the Kings Rooks Pawn first a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
draught; but the best way is to
play the Kings Pawn first a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
that so if they are not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their adversaries playing the
like, they may still move that Pawn
forward with good guard; for he
will prove very injurious to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
King.</p>
               <p>This Pawn I shall advise you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
first, but not so venturously as a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56740:42"/>
double remove, because if you cannot
guard him cunningly, then are you
like to lose him with a check to your
King, by the Queens. coming forth
upon him to the great hazard of your
Kings Rook; therefore play your
Kings Rook one single remove, that
there may be way made for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of Queen one way two houses
asloap, and to your Kings Bishop the
other way three houses asloap, and so
upon the neglect of your adversary he
may be put to a Scholars check, at least
in danger of it: here note it is ill to play
the Bishops Pawn first, and worse to
play the Queens.</p>
               <p>He that would be an Artist in this
noble Game, must be so careful to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
his pieces, that if any man advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
be taken, the enemy may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
taken by that piece that guards
or seconds it; so shall he not clearly
lose any man, which should it fall out
contrarily might lose the Game; he
must also make his passages free for
retreat, as occasion shall serve, lest he
be worsted.</p>
               <p>In defending you must also be very
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56740:42"/>
careful that you are as able to assault as
your enemy; for you must not only
answer your adversaries assault by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
his design by his play, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
it, but you must likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
plots, how to pester and grieve
your assailant, and chiefly how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
such pieces as are advanced by
him, preventing their retreat, amongst
which a Pawn is the soonest ensnared,
because he cannot go back for succour
or relief; but Bishops and Rooks are
harder to be surprized, because they
can march from one side of the field to
the other to avoid the ensuing danger,
but the Knights and Queens of all are
most difficulty betray'd, because they
have so many places of refuge, and the
Queen more especially; where note as
a gret piece of policie, that if possible
you constantly have as many guards
upon any one piece of yours as you see
your enemy hath when he advanceth
to take it, and be sure withall that
your guards be of less value than the
pieces he encountreth you with; for
then if he fall to taking you will reap
advantage thereby; but if you see you
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56740:43"/>
cannot guard yours but must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
lose it, then be very circumspect
and see whether you can take a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
piece of his in case he takes yours,
by advancing some other piece of yours
in guard; for so (as it often falls out)
that yours which you had given over
for lost may be saved, whereas no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way could have done it.</p>
               <p>When an adverse piece comes in
your way, so that by it all may be taken,
consider with your self first whether it
be equal in worth to yours; next whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it can do you any damage in the
next Draught, if not let it alone; for
as it is best to play first, so it is to take
last; unless as was said you might take
the piece clear, or get a better than
that you lose to take it, or at least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
him one Pawn in his taking your
man that took his; but when you have
the advantage be it but of one good
piece for a worse, or of a Pawn clear,
then it is your best way to take man
for man as often as you can; besides
you are to note, that whatsoever piece
your adversary plays most or best with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
be sure if it lie in your power to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56740:43"/>
deprive him thereof though it be done
with loss of the like, or of one some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
better, as a Bishop for a Knight;
for by this means you may frustrate
your adversaries design and become as
cunning as himself.</p>
               <p>Now the chief aim at Chess is to
give the Mate, which is when you so
check the King of the adverse party, that
he can neither take the checking piece
(because it is guarded) nor cover the
check, nor yet remove out of it.</p>
               <p>Your care ought to be in the interim
how to deprive him of some of his best
pieces, as his Queen or Rook; and the
way to entrap a Queen is two-fold, First
by confining her to her King, so that
she may not remove from him for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in check of an adverse piece;
Secondly, by bringing her to or espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her in such a place as a Knight of
yours may check her King, and the next
draught take her. In the same manner
you may serve a Bishop if the adverse
Queen covers her slope-wise; but if
she stand not in such a posture she may
be brought to it; entice her thither
with some unguarded man, which she
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56740:44"/>
out of eagerness of taking for nothing,
may indiscreetly bring her self into
trouble.</p>
               <p>But if you intend to cath the Queen
with a Knight, imagine that the adverse
King stands in his own place unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and that the Queen hath
brought her self to stand in that place
where the Kings Rooks Pawn stood;
first, she standing in this posture bring
if you can one of your Knights to
check her King in the third house before
his own Bishop; and if there be no
man ready to take up your Knight, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
he will take up the Queen at
the next draught.</p>
               <p>The Rooks are also to be surprized
two ways; first, by playing your Bishop
into your Knights Pawns first place of
standing, which Bishop shall march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slope
towards the adverse Rook of the
opposite corner, which if you can
make uncovered of the Knights Pawn,
your Bishop will then undoubtedly
take clear for nothing; the other way
is like that of surprizing the Queen
with a Bishop or a Knight; where
you must take notice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56740:44"/>
Queens Rook is so much the easier
to be taken with your Queens Knight,
that that Knight at his third draught
may check the King and take the same
Rook at his fourth draught. There
are several other ways to take a Rook,
which practice must inform you.</p>
               <p>There is an ingenious way of taking
a great man for a Pawn; when you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spy
two great men of your adversaries
standing in one and the same rank, and
but one house between them, then
prepare a Guard (if you have it not
ready to your hand) for a Pawn, which
bring up to the rank next to them
in the middle or front of both of
them, and without doubt, if he save
the one your Pawn will take the other;
this way of taking is called a <hi>Fork</hi> or
<hi>Dilemma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The neatest and most prejudicial
trick you can put upon your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
at <hi>Chess</hi> is a Check by discovery,
which may be thus effected; observe
when you find your adversaries King
any way weakly guarded, or perhaps
not all, that is, easie to be checked
then before you bring that piece that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56740:45"/>
can check him there to provide some
other man in that course that checks
him not; afterwards bring that piece
of yours which will check him (your
brought-piece being away) and then
with all possible speed remove away
for that former piece where it may most
annoy him, saying withall, <hi>Check by
discovery of your last brought a piece:</hi>
which he being compelled to cover or
remove, you may do him a greater preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
with that piece you removed from
between the check at the next draught
thus demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Suppose you play with the <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
he removes first his Kings Pawn a
double draught forward, you answer
him with the like play; he then plays
out his Kings Knight in front of his
Kings Bishop's Pawn, you do the like
with yours: that Knight of his takes
your Kings Pawn, and your Knight
takes his likewise; he advances the
Queens Pawn, and removes to chase
away or to take your Knight; you
play up your white Queen one remove
before your King to frighten his Knight
also: he thinks it better to save his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56740:45"/>
Knight from your Queen, than take
yours with his Queens Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n; and
therefore conveys him away into a more
secure place; you play your Kings
Knight in front of his Queens Bishop's
Pawn, and there withall say, <hi>Check by
discovery of your Queen;</hi> now let him
cover this check by Discovery as well
as he can, your Knight at the next
draught will assuredly take his Queen.
There are several other ways to make a
discovery, and a Mate given with it,
which is the noblest Mate of all.</p>
               <p>A Queen if lost indangers m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch the
Game; but if there be Pawns left on
either side, there is possibility of
making a new Queen, and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the renovation of the Game,
which ten to one was lost before:
There are several ways to Mate this
Queen and estate her in as great power
as the former, for brevity sake, two
Pawns in files next one to the other,
and plaid first one forward and the other
backward close together is a good way
to make a new Queen, especially if any
one of them be guarded underneath
with a Rook, for so they will force
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56740:46"/>
their way before them, nor can any of
them be taken without great difficulty
and danger.</p>
               <p>As to short Mates take these obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations:
having both placed your
men and yours the first draught; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you advance your Kings Pawn
forward one single remove, your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
plays his Kings Pawn forward a
double remove in his own file; you at
your second draught come out with
your Queen upon that Pawn, placing
her in the house forward of your Kings
Rooks file, your enemy to guard his
Kings Pawn plays forth his Queens
Knight into the third House of the
Queens Bishops file, you (hoping
that he will not spy the attempt)
bring out for your third draught your
Kings Bishop, which you place in the
fourth house of your Queens Bishops
file, he not perceiving your intention
judging all secure makes for your
Queen with his Kings Knight, playing
it in the front of his Kings Bishops
Pawn, either to chase her away or take
her; you immediately upon this take
up that Bishops Pawn with your
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56740:46"/>
Queen, and for your fourth draught
give him a Mate, which is called a
<hi>Scholars Mate;</hi> because any but young
beginners may prevent it.</p>
               <p>You may also give a Mate at two
draughts if you encounter with a raw
Gamester, playing after this manner;
first remove his Kings Bishops Pawn a
single draught (which is ill play at first)
you your Kings Pawn a single remove,
he his Kings Knights Pawn advanced a
double remove for his second draught,
you bringing out your Queen into the
fifth house of your Kings Rooks file give
him a Mate at your second draught.</p>
               <p>There is another called a <hi>Blind-Mate,</hi>
and that is when your Adversary gives
you a check that you cannot avoid by
any means, and is indeed a <hi>Mate abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute;</hi>
but he not seeing it to be a Mate,
says only to you <hi>check,</hi> and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called a <hi>Blind-Mate;</hi> this should
be both loss of Game and stake if you
before agree not to the contrary.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Stale</hi> may be termed a Mate and
no Mate, an end of the Play but no
end of the Game, because it properly
should be ended with a <hi>Check-Mate.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56740:47"/>
The Stale is thus when his King hath
the worst of the Game, and brought to
such a strait, that he hath but one place
to flie unto, and the pursuing King is so
unadvised as to bar him of that place
or stop it without checking him, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
King being no way able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
but in Check, and having no
other piece of his own that he can
play, then it is a <hi>Stale</hi> and a lost
Game to him that gives it. Therefore
he that follows the flying King gives
him check as long as he hath any place
to fly to; but when he hath none left
to avoid his check, let him then say
<hi>check-Mate,</hi> and both Game and Stake
are won.</p>
               <p>Lastly, there is another term used in
Chess-playing, and that is called a
<hi>Dead-Game,</hi> which makes (if I may
say improperly) an endless end of the
Game, both Gamesters saving their
Stakes: and thus it is, when the Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
falls to take all that comes near,
carelesly giving man for man, so that it
happens that either King hath but one
man apiece left him, the Assailant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his eager pursuit takes his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56740:47"/>
man, not minding that his
King can take his also, so that the
Kings losing all their men and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so unable to come so near as to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Game is ended, but the Stakes
on both sides are saved.</p>
               <div type="rules">
                  <p>I shall conclude this Game with the
Laws of Chess, which are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>1. What Piece soever of your own
you touch or lift from the point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it standeth, you must play it for that
draught if you can, and into what house
you set your Man there it must stand
for that draught, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this Game, <hi>Touch and take, out of
hand and stand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If you take up your Adversaries
man, and after think best to let it
stand untaken, before you set your
piece in place thereof, you must cry
him mercy or lose the Game.</p>
                  <p>3. If your Adversary play a false
draught, and you see it not till you
play your next draught 'twill then be
too late to challenge him for it.</p>
                  <p>4. If you play a false draught through
mistake, and your Adversary take no
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56740:48"/>
notice for his advantage, and plays his
next draught, you cannot recall it.</p>
                  <p>5. If you misplace your men, and so
play a while, and then discover it, it
lies in your Adversaries power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
or begin the Game.</p>
                  <p>6. Pawns may be plaid a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
forward for their first draught,
but no Pawn hath that priviledg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permission, on whose next file on
either side a Pawn of your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
is already advanced as far as your
fourth rank.</p>
                  <p>7. The standing of the King ought
to be certain in his shifting and not as
you please to place him as some men
play.</p>
                  <p>8. If your King standing in the
check of any adverse piece, and you
have plaid one draught or more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
avoiding the check, your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
may say, <hi>check</hi> to you when he
listeth, and for your draught then
make you avoid that check you stood
in, though it may be to your great
peril.</p>
                  <p>9. If any one condition by wager,
that he will give Mate or win the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56740:48"/>
Game, and the Adversary brings it to
a <hi>Dead-Game,</hi> though he save the first
Stake yet he loseth the Wager.</p>
                  <p>10. He that gives over the Game
before it is finished, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of his Adversary, loseth his Stake.</p>
                  <p>Many more observations might be
here inserted for the understanding of
this noble Game, which I am forced to
wave to avoid prolixity.</p>

the Pack the <hi>Deuces, Treys, Fours</hi> and
<hi>Fives,</hi> and play with the rest of the
<hi>Cards,</hi> which are in number thirty and
six.</p>
               <p>The usual <hi>Set</hi> is an hundred, not but
that you may make it more or less; the
last Card deals and the worst is the
Dealers.</p>
               <p>The Cards are all valued according
to the number of the spots they bear,
the Ace only excepted, which wins all
other Cards, and goes for eleven.</p>
               <p>The Dealer shuffles, and the other
cuts, delivering what number he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
at a time, so that he exceed not
four nor deal under two, leaving twelve
on the table between them.</p>
               <p>He that is the elder, having lookt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56740:49"/>
his Cards, and finding never a
Court-Card among them, says <hi>I have</hi> a
blanck, and I intend to discard such a
number of Cards, and that you may
see mine, discard you as many as you
intend; this done, the Eldest shows
his Cards and reckons ten for the
blanck, then taking up his Cards again
he discards those which he judgeth most
fit: here note he is always bound to
that number which he first propounded.
This being done, he takes in as many
from the Stock as he laid out; and if it
should chance to fall out that the other
hath a <hi>Blank</hi> too, the youngers <hi>Blank</hi>
shall bar the former and hinder his <hi>Picy</hi>
and <hi>Repicy,</hi> though the eldest hands
<hi>Blank</hi> consists of the biggest Cards.</p>
               <p>It is no small advantage to the eldest
to have the benefit of discarding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he may take in eight of the
twelve in the Stock discarding as many
of his own for them, not but that if he
find it more advantageous he may take
in a less number; after this the Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist
may take in what he thinks fit,
acquitting his hand of the like number.
Here note, that let the Game be never
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56740:50"/>
so good the Gamesters are both obliged
to discard one Card at least. After the
discarding you must consider the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is how much you can make of one
suit; the eldest speaks first, and if the
youngest makes no more the <hi>Ruff</hi> is
good, and sets up one for every ten
he can produce; as for example, for
thirty reckon three, for forty four, and
so onward, withall take notice you are
to count as many for thirty five as for
forty, and as much for forty five as
fifty, and so of the rest; but from thirty
five to thirty nine you must count no
more than for thirty five, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Queen, King, and Ace; which last is

highest. A Quart is a sequence of four
Cards, a Quint of five, a Sixism of
six, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Sequences take their
denomination from the highest Card in
the Sequence. It is a Tierce Major or
a Tierce of an Ace when there is
Queen, King and Ace, a Tierce of a
King when the King is the best Card;
a Tierce of a Queen when there is
neither King nor Ace, and so till you
come to the lowest Tierce, which is a
Tierce of an eight. You must reckon
for every Tierce three, for a Quart
four, but for a Quint fifteen, for a
Sixiesm sixteen, and so upward; now
what ever you can make of all you
must add to your Blank, and count the
whole together.</p>
               <p>Here note that the biggest Tierce,
Quart, or other Sequence, although
there be but one of them makes all the
others less Sequences useless unto him
be they never so many; and he that
hath the biggest Sequence by vertue
thereof reckons all his less Sequences,
though his Adversaries Sequences be
greater, and otherwise would have
drowned them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56740:51"/>Farther observe, that a Quart drowns
a Tierce, and a Quint a Quart, and so
of the rest, so that he who hath a Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesm
may reckon his Tierces, Quarts,
or Quints, though the other may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to have Tierce, Quart, &amp;c. of
higher value than the others are that
hath the Sixiesm; trace the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in all the other like Sequences.</p>
               <p>After you have manifested your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
you come to reckon your three
Aces, three Kings, three Queens, three
Knaves, or three Tens, as for Nines,
Eights, Sevens, and Sixes, they have no
place in this account; for every Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
you count three, and they are in
value as it is in Sequences; Aces the
highest and best, Kings next, after these
Queens, then Knaves, and last of all
Tens. The higher drowns the lower
here as in the Sequences. He that hath
three Aces may reckon his three Queens,
Knaves, or Tens, if he have them, though
the other hath three Kings; and this is
done by reason of his higher Ternary.
Now he that hath four Aces, four Kings,
four Queens, four Knaves, or four Tens,
for each reckons fourteen, which is the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56740:51"/>
reason they are called Quatorzes.</p>
               <p>Now they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gin to play the Cards,
the elder begins and younger follows
in suit as at Whisk, and for every Ace,
King, Queen, Knave, or Ten, he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
one.</p>
               <p>A Card once play'd must not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
unless he have a Card of the
same suit in his hand, if the elder hand
plays an Ace, King, Queen, or Ten, for
every such Card he is to reckon one,
which he adds to the number of his
Game before; and if the other be able
to play upon it a higher Card of the
same suit, he wins the Trick, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
one for his Card as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whosoever wins the last Trick
reckons two for it, if he win it with a
Ten, but if with any Cards, under, he
reckons but one; then they tell their
Cards, and he that hath the most is to
reckon Ten for them.</p>
               <p>After this, each person sets up his
Game with Counters, and if the <hi>set</hi> be
not up, deal again; now a <hi>set</hi> is won
after this manner, admit that each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is so forward in his Game that he
wants but four or five to be up, if it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56740:52"/>
so happens that any of the two have a
Blank, he wins the <hi>set,</hi> because the
Blanks are always first reckoned; but
if no Blanks, then comes the Ruff, next
your Sequences, then your Aces, Kings,
Queens, Knaves, and Tens, next what
Cards are reckoned in play, and last of
all the Cards you have won. If any of
the Gamesters can reckon, either in
Blanks, Ruffs, Sequences, Aces, &amp;c. up
to thirty in his own hand, without play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Card, and before the other can
reckon any thing, instead of thirty he
shall reckon ninety, and as many as he
reckons after above his thirty, adding
them to his ninety; this is known by
the name of a <hi>Repicy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, he that can make in like
manner, what by Blank, Ruff, Sequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
&amp;c. up to the said number, before
the other hath play'd a Card, or reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing, instead of thirty he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
sixty, and this is called a <hi>Picy.</hi> Here
note, that if you can but remember to
call for your <hi>Picy,</hi> or <hi>Repicy,</hi> before you
deal again, you shall lose neither of
them, otherwise you must.</p>
               <p>He that wins more than his own
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56740:52"/>
Cards reckons Ten, but he that wins
all the Cards reckons Forty, and this is
called a <hi>Capet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rules belonging to this Game
are these. If the Dealer give more
Cards than his due, whether through
mistake or otherwise, it lieth in the
choice of the elder hand whether he
shall deal again or no, or whether it
shall be play'd out.</p>
               <p>He that forgets to reckon his Blank,
Ruff, Sequences, Aces, Kings, or the
like, and hath begun to play his Cards
cannot recall them. So it is with him
that sheweth not his Ruff before he
play his first Card, losing absolutely all
the advantage thereof.</p>
               <p>He that misreckons any thing, and
hath play'd one of his Cards, and his
adversary finds at the beginning, middle,
or end of the Game, that he had not
what he reckoned, for his punishment
he shall be debar'd from reckoning any
thing he really hath, and his adversary
shall reckon all he hath, yet the other
shall make all he can in play. He that
takes in more Cards than he discardeth
is liable to the same penalty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56740:53"/>He that throws up his Cards imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he hath lost the Game, mingling
them with other Cards on the Table
though afterward he perceive his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
yet he is not allowed to take up
his Cards and play them out.</p>
               <p>No man is permitted to discard twice
in one dealing.</p>
               <p>He that hath a <hi>Blank,</hi> his <hi>Blank</hi> shall
hinder the other <hi>Picy</hi> and <hi>Repicy,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath nothing to shew but
his <hi>Blank.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath four Aces, Kings, Queens,
&amp;c. dealt him and after he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded
one of the four reckons the other
three, and the other say to him <hi>it is
good;</hi> he is bound to tell the other,
if he ask him what Ace, King, Queen,
&amp;c. he wants.</p>
               <p>If after the Cards are cleanly cut,
either of the Gamesters know the upper
Card by the backside, notwithstanding
this the Cards must not be shuffled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
In like manner, if the Dealer
perceive the other hath cut himself an
Ace, and would therefore shuffle again,
this is not permitted; and if a Card be
found faced, it shall be no argument
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56740:53"/>
to deal again, but must deal on; but
if two be found faced, then may he
shuffle again.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whosoever is found changing
or taking back again any of his Cards,
he shall lose the Game, and be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a foul Player.</p>

The number of persons playing must be
three, neither more nor less, and most
frequently they play at Farthing, Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny,
or Penny-Gleek, which in play
will amount considerably.</p>
               <p>The Dealer delivers the Cards by
four till every one hath twelve, and the
rest are laid on the Table, for the Stock,
being in number eight, seven whereof
are bought and the Ace is turned up;
the turn'd up Card is the Dealers; and
if it be Tiddy turn'd up is four apiece
from each to the Dealer.</p>
               <p>The Ace is called <hi>Tib,</hi> the Knave
<hi>Tom,</hi> the four of Trumps Tiddy, <hi>Tib</hi>
the Ace is fifteen in hand and eighteen
in play, because it wins a Trick, <hi>Tom</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56740:54"/>
the Knave is nine, and <hi>Tiddy</hi> is four,
the fifth Towser, the sixth Tumbler,
which if in hand Towser is five and
Tumbler six, and so double if turn'd
up, and the King and Queen of Trumps
is three.</p>
               <p>The eldest hand bids for the stock in
hopes of bettering his Game, though
sometimes it makes it worse: the first
penny you bid is twelve, thirteen, and
so on; if at sixteen they say take it, and
none will venture more for it, he is
bound to take it, that is taking in seven
Cards, and putting out seven in their
stead, and must pay besides eight to one
and eight to the other of the Gamesters
for buying, if any odd money be
given, as 15, 17. or the like, the
eldest hand usually claims it, or else it
is given to the box; but if he have
<hi>Mournival, Gleek</hi> or <hi>Tiddy</hi> in his hand
after he hath taken in the Stock he
bates for them all, and so possibly may
gain by it, if he have a good hand and
pay for his buying two.</p>
               <p>Here you must note that if <hi>Tib</hi> be
turned up it is fifteen to the Dealer in
reckoning after play, but he must not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56740:55"/>
make use of it in play being the Trump-Card,
for then 'twould make him
eighteen, because it would win a Trick
which is three more.</p>
               <p>Next you speak for the <hi>Ruff,</hi> and
he that hath most of a suit in his hand
wins it, unless some of the Gamesters
have four Aces and then he gains the
<hi>Ruff,</hi> though you have never so many
of a suit in your hand. If any wins a
<hi>Ruff,</hi> and forgets to show it before a
Card plaid loseth it, and he that shews
any for a <hi>Ruff</hi> after shall have it.</p>
               <p>The first or eldest says, <hi>I'le vye the
Ruff,</hi> the next says, <hi>I'le see it,</hi> and the
third, <hi>I'le see it and revie it: I'le see
your revie,</hi> says the first; because he
hath as many in his hand as another:
the middle probably says, <hi>I'le not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with it;</hi> then they shew their
Cards, and he that hath most of a suit
wins six pence or farthings according
to the Game of him that holds out
longest, and four of the other that
said he would see it, but after refused
to meddle with it; but if any of the
three Gamesters says he hath nothing
to say as to the Ruff he pays but a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56740:55"/>
half-pence, penny, according
as the Game is aforesaid; and if the
eldest and second hand pass the Ruff
the youngest hath power to double it,
and then it is to be plaid for the next
deal, and if any forgets to call for the
double Ruff, it is to be play'd for the
next deal after that.</p>
               <p>Sometimes one of the Gamesters ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all of a suit in his hand bids high
for the Ruff, and the other having four
Aces is resolved to bid higher, so that
it sometimes amounts to sixteen and
more, then <hi>I'le see it and revie,</hi> saith
one; <hi>I'le see it and revie,</hi> saith another,
that is, eight to the winner, and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
is but two a time, as it may be
they will say, <hi>I'le see it and revie it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and I'le see that and revie it again,</hi>
saith another, for which seeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
they reckon but two, after that
it is once come to eight; but he that
hath the four Aces carrieth it clearly,
&amp;c. as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Buying or bidding for the Ruff is
when you are in likelihood to go in for
Mournival, Gleek, or increase of Trumps,
that so if you have bad Cards, you may

save your buyings and your Cards too,

a Gleek is three of any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>Here note, that twenty two are your
Cards; if you win nothing but the
Cards that were dealt you, you lose

ten; if you have neither <hi>Tib, Tom, Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
King, Queen, Mournival,</hi> nor <hi>Gleek,</hi>
you lose because you count as many
Cards as you had in tricks, which must
be few by reason of the badness of
your hand; if you have Tib, Tom,
King, and Queen of Trumps in
your hand, you have thirty by honours,
that is, eight above your own Cards,
besides the Cards you win by them in
play. If you have Tom only, which is
Nine and the King of Trumps, which
is three, then you reckon from twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, till you come
to two and twenty, and then every
Card wins so many half-pence, pence,

the Gamesters will play at <hi>Tiddy,</hi>
or leave it out, it being a Card that is
apt to be forgotten; and know, that it
is lookt upon as very foul play to call

Stakes and the Other makes it good.</p>
               <p>Here note, although the other two
always combine to make him lose, yet
they all do their best (for the common
good) to hinder any one from winning,
only striving to make it <hi>Repuesto,</hi> which
is when the Player wins no more Tricks
than another, in which case the Player
doubles the Stake without any ones
winning it, and remains so for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56740:59"/>
the advantage of the next Player.</p>
               <p>Here note that Kings of any suit are
accounted as good Trumps, mean
while all other Cards but Kings and
Trumps are to be discarded.</p>
               <p>The Player having taken in, the next
is to consider the goodness of the Game,
and to take in more or less for the best
advantage of his Game; neither is any
for the saving a Counter or two to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the taking in, that the other may
commodiously make up his Game with
what Cards he hath left, and that no
good Cards may lie dormant in the
Stock, except the Player playeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking in, when they may refuse to
take in, if they imagine he hath all
the Game.</p>
               <p>When one hath a sure Game in his
hand, he is to play without taking in,
then the others are to give him each
one of the great Counters as he is to
give them, if he play without taking
in a Game that is not sure and loseth it;
if you win all the Tricks in your
hand or the <hi>Voll,</hi> they likewise are to
give you one Counter apiece, but then
you are to declare before the fifth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56740:60"/>
Trick that you intend to play for the
<hi>Voll,</hi> that so they keep their best Cards,
which else, seeing you win five Tricks
(or the Game) they may carelesly cast
away.</p>
               <p>If you renounce you are to double
the Stake, as also if you have more or
fewer Cards than nine, to which end
you must carefully count your Cards
in dealing and taking in before you
look on them; besides according to
the rigour of the Game if you speak any
thing tending to the discovery there of,
either in your own hand or anothers
(excepting <hi>Gagno</hi>) or <hi>play so,</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the making of <hi>Repuesto</hi> or <hi>Codillio,</hi>
you are not fit to play.</p>
               <p>Observe, that in playing Trumps, if
any plays an ordinary one, and you
have only the three best Cards or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadors</hi>
singly or jointly in your hands,
you may resuse to play them without
renouncing, because of the priviledge
which these Cards have, that none but
commanding Cards can force them out
of your hand.</p>
               <p>You are to say nothing when you
play your Card, but I <hi>pass</hi> or <hi>play,</hi> or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56740:60"/>
                  <hi>gagno,</hi> or <hi>gagno del Re</hi> when you play
your Queen to hinder them from taking
it with the King.</p>
               <p>Now since it is impossible to provide
against all accidents in the Game,
only take notice of these general
Rules.</p>
               <p>First, never win more than one
Trick if you cannot win more than
two, because of the advantage you
give the Player by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, in dividing the
Tricks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you are to win the Trick
always from the Player if you can, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you let it pass for mere advantage,
where the second is to let pass to the
third if he have the likelier Game to
beast the Player, or if he be likelier
to win it. There may be diverse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
in refusing to take the Players
Trick; but the chief is, if you have
the <hi>Tenaces</hi> in your hand, that is two
Cards, and if you have the leading, you
are sure to lose one of them; if the Player
lead to you, you are sure to win them
both; For example, if you have <hi>Spadillio</hi>
and <hi>Basto</hi> in your hand, and he have
the <hi>Mallillio</hi> and another Trump, if
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56740:61"/>
you lead you lose one of them;
for either you play your <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillio,</hi>
and he plays the lesser Trump
upon it and wins your <hi>Basto</hi> the next
Trick with his <hi>Mallillio,</hi> and so the
contrary; whereas if he leads he loseth;
for if he leads his <hi>Mallillio</hi> you win
it with your <hi>Spadillio,</hi> and with your
<hi>Basto</hi> win the other Trump, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you are not sure to win five
Tricks, having only three <hi>Matadors,</hi>
and Kings your auxiliary Cards; if
you have the leading, play first a
<hi>Matador</hi> or two before you play your
Kings to fetch out his Trumps which
might have trumped them, and if you
have three <hi>Matadors</hi> with two other
Trumps, your best way is to play
your <hi>Matadors</hi> first to see where the
Trumps lie; if both follow, you are
sure if the Trump be red there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
only one Trump in their hands,
if black none at all.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if the Players have but a
weak Game, they are to imitate cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Beast-players in dividing the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56740:61"/>
Tricks, and consulting to play their
Cards. To conclude, lay your Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head type="sub">The Game at CRIBBIDGE.</head>
               <p>AT Cribbidge there are no Cards
to be thrown out, but all are
made use of; and the number of the
Set is sixty one.</p>
               <p>It is an advantage to deal, by reason
of the Crib, and therefore you must lift
for it, and he that hath the least Card
deals.</p>
               <p>There are but two Players at this
Game, the one shuffles and the other
cuts, the Dealer delivers out the Cards
one by one, to his Antagonist first and
himself last, till five apiece be dealt to
one another; the rest being set down
in view on the Table, each looketh on
his Game, and ordereth his Cards for
the best advantage.</p>
               <p>He that deals makes out the best
Cards he can for his Crib, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the worst, because he will do him
as little good as he can, being his Crib;
which Crib is four Cards, two a piece,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56740:62"/>
which they lay out upon the Table, not
knowing nor seeing one anothers Cards,
and then they turn up a Card from the
parcel that was left of dealing, and each
of them may make use of that Card to
help them on in their Game in hand,
and when they have play'd out their
three Cards, and set up with Counters
their Games in their hands, the Crib is
the others the next deal, and so they
take it by turns.</p>
               <p>The value of the Cards is thus: Any
fifteen upon the Cards is two, whether
nine and six, ten and five, King and five,
seven and eight, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Pair</hi> is two, a <hi>Pair-Royal</hi> six, a
double <hi>Pair-Royal</hi> twelve, <hi>Sequences of
three</hi> is two, <hi>Sequences of four</hi> is four,
<hi>of five</hi> five, &amp;c. and so is a <hi>Flush of three,</hi>
three; <hi>of four,</hi> four, &amp;c. <hi>Knave Noddy</hi>
is one in hand and two to the Dealer;
that is, if you have a Knave of that suit
which is turned up, it is <hi>Knave Noddy.</hi>
A Pair of Aces, Kings, Queens, Knaves,
Tens, &amp;c. is two; Three Aces, Kings,
Queens, &amp;c. is a <hi>Pair-Royal;</hi> a double
<hi>Pair-Royal</hi> is four Aces, four Kings, four
Queens, &amp;c. and is twelve Games to him
that hath them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56740:63"/>
Having lookt on your Cards, you
count your Game after this manner:
Suppose you have in your hand a Nine
and two Sixes, after you have laid out
two Cards for the Crib, that makes you
six Games, because there is two fifteens
and a pair, by adding your Nine to the
two Sixes, and if a Six chance to be
turn'd up, then you have twelve Games
in your hand; for though you must not
take the turn'd up Card into your hand,
yet you may make what use you can of
it in counting, so that the three Sixes
makes you six, being a <hi>Pair-Royal,</hi> and
the Nine added to every Six makes
three fifteens, which six more added to
the former, make twelve, which you
must set up with Counters or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that your Opponent may know
what you are, though you must not see
his Cards, nor he yours; if you think
he plays foul by reckoning too much,
you may count them after the hand is
play'd.</p>
               <p>Thus you have set up your twelve,
your Opposite it may be hath four, five,
and six in his hand; that is two, because
of <hi>Sequences of three;</hi> then it is two more
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56740:63"/>
because it is four, five, and six; again,
taking in the counting six that is turn'd
up, that is in all four, then there is fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and fifteen, four and five is nine,
and six is fifteen, and then with the six
turn'd up 'tis fifteen more, which makes
eight Games, this he likewise sets up,
keeping his Cards undiscovered. Here
note, he that deals not sets up three in
lieu thereof.</p>
               <p>Having thus done, he that dealt not
plays first, suppose it a six, if you have
a nine play it, that makes fifteen, for
which set up two, the next may play a
four which makes nineteen, you a six
twenty five, and he a five that is thirty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you being not able to come in, having
a six in your hand, he sets up one, (for
it is one and thirty you aim at in playing
the Cards), because he is most, and two
for <hi>Sequences</hi> four, five, and six, which
were his four after the fifteen, your five
and his six; and that doth not hinder
them from being <hi>Sequences,</hi> though the
six was play'd between the four and the
five; but if an Ace, Nine, King, Queen,
or thelike, had been play'd between, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey
had been no <hi>Sequences;</hi> so the two for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56740:64"/>
the Sequences, and the one for thirty
being most (as at one and thirty)
makes him three, which he must set
up to the rest of his Game<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in
this playing of the Cards you may
make <hi>Pairs, Sequences, Flush, Fifteens,
Pair-Royals,</hi> and double <hi>Pair-Royals,</hi>
if you can, though that is rarely seen.</p>
               <p>Lastly, you look upon you Crib,
that is the two Cards apiece laid out
at first, which is the Dealers; if he find
no Games in them, nor help by the
Card that was turn'd up, which he
takes into his hand, then he is bilkt,
and sometimes it so happens that he
is both bilkt in hand and crib. Thus
they play and deal by turns till the
Game of sixty one be up.</p>
               <p>Here note, if you get the Game
before your Adversary is forty five
(forty four will not do it) you must
then say, I have <hi>lurkt</hi> you, and that
is a double Game for whatever you
play'd with six shilling, or a greater
summ.</p>

Gentlemen and others of very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
note, who have play'd great

not much to the worth of the Game,
for a man may play away an estate
at <hi>One and Thirty;</hi> as I knew one lose
a considerable sum <hi>at most at three
throws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Game I conceive is called <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fours</hi>
from <hi>Highest, Lowest, Iack,</hi> and
<hi>Game,</hi> which is the Set as some play
it, but you may make from seven to
fifteen, or more if you please, but
commonly eleven.</p>
               <p>There are but two can play at it at
a time, and they must lift for dealing,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56740:65"/>
the highest Put-card deals, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to his adversary three Cards, and
to himself the like, and the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and having six apiece, he turns
up a Card which is Trump; if Jack
(and that is any Knave) it is one to
the Dealer.</p>
               <p>If he to whom the Cards were
dealt after perusal of his Game like
them not, he hath the liberty of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one; if the Dealer refuse to give
him one, then he deals three apiece
more, but if he then turns up a Card
of the same suit, he deals further till
he turns up a Card of another suit.</p>
               <p>Here note, That an Ace is four, a
King is three, a Queen is two, a Knave
one, and a Ten is ten.</p>
               <p>Now you must play down your
Cards, but to what advantage I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
here prescribe, it must be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Cards you have in your
hand managed by your judgment to
the best advantage.</p>
               <p>Having play'd your Cards you rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon,
if you are highest and lowest of
what is Trumps, you reckon two; if
you are only highest but one, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56740:65"/>
the like of Jack and Game; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you are highest, lowest, Jack,
and Game, and then you must reckon
four; the Game is he that tells most
after the Cards are play'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Ten is a very significant Card,
which crafty Gamesters know so well
that they will frequently take out of
a Pack two Tens, and hide them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the knowledg of the other,
which is a great advantage to this
foul player, if he play of the same
suit of these Tens he hath absconded,
for it must of necessity secure him
from losing the Game.</p>
               <p>Here note, That he that wins Jack
wins one also; and furthermore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that for advantage reneging is
allowable if you have Trumps in your
hand to trump it.</p>
               <p>There is another sort of <hi>All-fours</hi>
called <hi>Running-All-fours,</hi> at which they
play One and Thirty up, and in this
Game the Dealer hath a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
for if he turn up an Ace it is
four, a King three, a Queen two, and
a Knave one, and these are the same
also in play. A Ten is the best Card for
making up.</p>

               <p>RUff and Honours <hi>(alias</hi> Slamm)

Known in <hi>England</hi> in all parts
thereof, that every Child almost of
Eight years old hath a competent
knowledg in that recreation, and
therefore I am unwilling to speak any
thing more of them than this, that
there may be a great deal of art used
in Dealing and playing at these Games
which differ very little one from the
other.</p>
               <p>In playing your Cards you must
have recourse altogether to your own
judgment or discretion, still making
the best of a bad market; and though
you have but mean Cards in your
own hand, yet you may play them so
suitable to those in your Partners hand,
that he may either trump them, or
play the best of that suit on the
Board.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56740:66"/>You ought to have a special eye to
what Cards are play'd out, that you
may know by that means either what
to play if you lead, or how to trump
securely and advantagiously. Reneging
or renouncing, that is, not following
suit when you have it in your hand,
is very fowl play, and he that doth
it ought to forfeit one, or the Game
upon a Game, and he that loseth deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loseth one, or a trick as you make
it.</p>
               <p>At Ruff and Honours, by some
called Slamm, you have in the Pack
all the Deuces, and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
four playing having dealt twelve
a piece, there are four left for the
Stock, the uppermost whereof is turn'd
up, and that is Trumps, he that hath
the Ace of that, Ruffs; that is, he
takes in those four Cards, and lays
out four others in their lieu; the four
Honours are the Ace, King, Queen,
and Knave; he that hath three Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in his own hand, his part not
having the fourth sets up Eight by

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56740:67"/>
tricks; it is all one if the two Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
make them three or four between
them, as if one had them. If the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
are equally divided among the
Gamesters of each side, then they say
Honours are split. If either side are
at eight Groats he hath the benefit of
calling Can-ye, if he hath two Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in his hand, and if the other
answers one, the Game is up, which
is nine in all, but if he hath more than
two he shows them, and then it is
one and the same thing; but if he
forgets to call after playing a trick, he
loseth the advantage of Can-ye for
that deal.</p>
               <p>All Cards are of value as they are
superiour one to another, as a Ten
wins a Nine if not Trumps, so a Queen,
a Knave in like manner; but the least
Trump will win the highest Card of
any other Card; where note the Ace is
the highest.</p>
               <p>Whist is a Game not much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from this, only they put out the
Deuces and take in no stock; and is
called Whist from the silence that is
to be observed in the play; they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56740:67"/>
deal as before, playing four, two of a
side, (some play at two handed, or
three handed Whist; if three handed,
always two strive to suppress and keep
down the rising-man), I say they deal
to each Twelve a piece and the Trump
is the bottom Card. The manner of
crafty playing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the number of the
Game Nine Honours and dignity of
other Cards are all alike, and he that
wins most tricks is most forward to
win the set.</p>
               <p>He that can by craft over-look his
adversaries Game hath a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
for by that means he may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know what to play securely; or if
he can have some petty glimpse of his
Partners hand. There is a way by
winking, or the fingers to discover to
their Partners what Honours they
have, as by the wink of one eye, or
putting one finger on the nose or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it signifies one Honour, shutting
both the eyes, two; placing three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or four on the Table, three or
four Honours. They have several
ways of securing an Honour or more
in the bottom when they deal, either
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56740:68"/>
to their Partners or selves; if to their
Partner they place in the second lift
next the top, 1, 2, 3, or four Aces,
or Court cards all of a suit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they could get them together
in the former deal, and place a Card
of the same suit in the bottom, when
the Cards are cut they must use their
hand so dexterously as not to put the
top in the bottom, but nimbly place
where it was before.</p>
               <p>If they would secure Honours to
themselves when dealing, they then
place so many as they can get upon
their lap or other place undiscerned,
and after the Cards are cut, then clap
them very neatly under. But the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
rooking way is by the breef, that
is take a pack of Cards and open
them, then take out all the Honours,
that is as aforesaid, the four Aces, the
four Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then take the rest and
cut a little from the edges of them all
alike, by which means the Honours
will be broader than the rest, so that
when your Adversary cuts to you,
you are certain of an Honour, when
you cut to your Adversary cut
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56740:68"/>
at the ends, and then it is a chance if
you cut him an Honour, because the
Cards at the ends are all of a length,
thus you may make breefs end-ways
as well as side-ways.</p>
               <p>There are a sort of cunning fellows
about this City, who before they go
to play will plant half a dozen of
these Packs (nay sometimes half a
score) in the hands of a Drawer, who
to avoid being suspected will call to
their confederate Drawer for a fresh
pack of Cards, who brings them as
from a shop new, and some of these
Packs shall be so finely markt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Gamester shall plainly and
certainly know every Card therein
contain'd by the outside, although the
best of other eyes shall not discern
where any mark was made at all;
and this done with that variety that
every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ard of every suit shall have a
different distinguishable mark.</p>
               <p>Some have a way to slick with a
slick-stone all the Honours very
smooth, by which means he will be
sure to cut his Partner an Honour,
and so his Partner to him again, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56740:69"/>
that is done by lying a forefinger on the
top indifferent hard, and giving a slur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
jerk to the rest which will slip
off from the slickt Card.</p>
               <p>It is impossible to shew you all the
Cheats of this Game, since your cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Gamester is always studying new
inventions to deceive the ignorant.</p>

               <p>You may play either two, four or
six of a side, dealing to each five a
piece, either two first at a time, or
three, according to pleasure, and he
that deals turns up Trump; the King
is the highest Card at Trumps, and so
it is highest in all other Cards that are
not Trumps, the Queen is next, the
Knave next, and next to that the Ace,
and all other Cards follow in prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
according to the number of
the Pips, but all small Trumps win
the highest of any other suit.</p>
               <p>Having turn'd up Trumps, he that
hath the Ace must take the Ace turn'd
up, and all other Trumps which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

               <p>After this they play, to win two
tricks signifies nothing, to win three

is the winning of five.</p>
               <p>If you play at <hi>forsat</hi> (that is the
rigour of the play) he that deals wrong
loseth one and his Deal. You are bound
to follow suit, and if you renounce or
renege you lose the whole Game, if
you so make it, otherwise but one or
two according to agreement.</p>
               <p>He that plays a Card that is trumped
by the follower, if the next player hath
none of the former suit he must trump
it again, although he hath never a trump
in his hand that can win the former
trump, and so it must pass to the last
player.</p>
               <p>All the Players round are bound to

               <p>THis Game is to be play'd out
only by two persons, of which
the eldest is to play first as in other
Games. You must deal off three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
and turn up the next Card
following; then the Eldest is to take
his choice whether he will <hi>Mogg.</hi> (that
is change a Card or no) and whosoever
refuseth is to give the other one
chalk or hole, of which generally
Threescore and one makes the Game.
Then must the Eldest play, and the
other if he can must make it up fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
for which she shall set up as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
holes or chalks as there are Cards
upon the Table; so likewise for five
and twenty, and also as many Cards
as are play'd to make up thirty, no
more nor less, so many chalks may be
set up who play'd last, to make up
one and thirty, and if one and thirty
be not made, then he that play'd last
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56740:72"/>
and is nearest one and thirty without
making out must set up one, which is
called setting up one for the latter.</p>
               <p>This being done, the eldest must
show how many Chalks he hath in his
hand to set up, and after him the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
which they must reckon in this
manner, taking notice both of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and number of pips upon the Card
turn'd up as those in their hands still,
reckoning as many for all the fifteen
and five and twenty as there go Cards
to make the number; and if you have
it by chance in your hand, and with the
Card turned up one and thirty, then
you must set up four for that: you
must also set up if you have them in
your hands or can make them so in
the Card turn'd up as followeth; two
for a pair, be they either Coat-cards,
or others; two for a Knave, and if a
Knave of the same colour and suit of
the Card turn'd up, then you must
set up four; and so for a Deuce four,
if it be of the same colour turn'd up:
if you have three of a sort, either
three fours, five sixes, or Coat-cards,
you must set up nine, and this is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56740:72"/>
a Pair-Royal; now if they are all
either Hearts, Diamonds, or the like,
then you must set up six for <hi>costly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours.</hi>
If you have three of a colour
you can reckon but two for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>Whosoever dealt, if he turn'd up
either Deuce or Knave, he must set up
four for it; as for example, imagine
you had dealt your Adversary three
Cards, <hi>viz.</hi> the five of Hearts, four of
Hearts, and eight of Hearts; to your
self the Deuce of Hearts, seven of
Clubs, and nine of Hearts. Lastly,
you turn up a Card, which is the
Knave of Hearts, for which you must
set up four; then because he will not
ask you to change one, he gives you
one, which you must set up, and then
he plays, suppose it be his five of
Hearts, you then play your seven of
Clubs, which makes twelve, then he
plays his eight of Hearts, which makes
twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one and thirty. For your five you
must set up five, then he must set up
what he hath in his hand, which you
will find to be but six, for he hath
nothing in his hand but <hi>Costly-Colours.</hi>
Then must you set up your Games,
which first are two, for your nine of
Clubs and nine of Hearts which make
fifteen, then that fifteen and the Knave
turn'd up makes five and twenty, for
which set up three; then for your
Deuce of Hearts which is the right,
set up four, and three for Colours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have three of a sort in your
hand with that turn'd up, now these
with the five you got in playing for
thirty one makes you this Deal with
the Knave turn'd up and the Cards
in your hand just twenty. Many other
examples I might give you, but that it
is needless since this one is sufficient to
direct you in all others. And thus

               <p>There are seven, or eight (or as many

               <p>
                  <hi>PVtt</hi> is the ordinary rooking Game
of every place, and seems by the
few Cards that are dealt to have no
great difficulty in the play, but I am
sure there is much craft and cunning
in it; of which I shall show as much as
I understand.</p>
               <p>If you play at two-handed Putt (or
if you please you may play at three
hands) the best Putt-Card deals. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
shuffled the Cards, the Adversary
cuts them, then the Dealer deals one to
his Antagonist, and another to himself
till they have three apiece: five up or
a Putt is commonly the Game. The
eldest if he hath a good Game, and
thinks it better than his Adversaries,
puts to him, if the other will not or
dare not see him, he then wins one,
but if he will see him they play it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut,
and he that wins two tricks or all three
wins the whole set; but if each win
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56740:75"/>
a trick and the third tyed, neither
win, because it is trick and tye.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they play without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and then the Winner is he that
wins most tricks. Here note that in
your playing keep up your Cards very
close; for the least discovery of any
oue of them is a great advantage to him
that sees it.</p>
               <p>This Game consists very much in da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
for a right Gamester will put
boldly upon very bad Cards sometimes,
as upon a five, seven and a nine; the
other thinking he hath good Cards in
his Adversaries hand, having very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
ones in his own dares not see
him, and so by going to stock loseth
one. Here note that he that once hath
the confidence to put on bad Cards
cannot recal his putting, by which
means he frequently pays for his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado.</p>
               <p>The best Putt-Cards are first the
Trey, next the Deuce, then the Ace,
the rest follow in preheminence thus;
the King, the Queen, the Knave, the
Ten, and so onwards to the four,
which is the meanest Card at Putt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56740:75"/>Some of the Cheats at Putt are done
after this manner:</p>
               <p>First, for cutting to be sure of a
good Putt-Card, they use the Bent, the
Slick, and the Breef; the bent is a
Card bended in play which you cut,
the slick is when beforehand the
Gamester takes a Pack of Cards, and
with a slick-stone smooths all the Putt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cards,
that when he comes to cut to
his Adversary with his forefinger above
and his thumb about the middle, he
slides the rest of the Cards off that
which was slickt, which is done infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
with much facility; but in this
there is required neatness and dexterity
for fear of discovery, and then your
confidence in this contrivance will be
vain and of no effect.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Breef in cutting is very
advantagious to him that cuts, and it
is thus done: the Cheat provides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
a Pack of Cards, whereof
some are broader than others; under
some of which he plants in play some
good Putt-Cards, which though they
shuffle never so much they shall rarely
separate them; by which means he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56740:76"/>
that cuts (laying his fingers on the
broad Card) hath surely dealt him a
Putt-Card.</p>
               <p>In dealing these Rooks have a trick
they call the <hi>Spurr,</hi> and that is, as good
Cards come into their hand that they
may know them again by the outside
(and so discover the strength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Adversaries Game) I say
some where on the outside they give
them a gentle touch with their nail.</p>
               <p>Now when they intend to bleed a
<hi>Col</hi> to some purpose whom they have
set before, they always fix half a score
Packs of Cards before (as I have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Whist</hi>) by slicking them or spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them, that is, giving them
such marks that they shall certainly
know every Card in the Pack, and
consequently every Card that is in his
Adversaries hand, an advantage that
cannot well be greater.</p>
               <p>But if they are not furnished with
such Cards, and cannot accomplish their
ends by the former indirect means
without palpable discovery, then they
have accomplices who standing by the
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nocent <hi>Col</hi> look over his Game, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56740:76"/>
discover what it is to his Adversary:
and to strengthen their interest by
cheating, they frequently carry about
them Treys, Deuces, Aces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
their pockets, which they use as need
requires, or if not, they will steal them
out of the Pack whilst they are playing,
which is the securest way and freest
from discovery.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they have one most egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
piece of Roguery more, and that
is playing the <hi>High-game</hi> at <hi>Putt;</hi>
and this is to be done but once at a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting;
and therefore on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
the absolute overthrow of the
<hi>Col</hi> that plays, or the <hi>Col</hi> that is a
stander by.</p>
               <p>This <hi>High-game</hi> at <hi>Putt</hi> is thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
the Rook whilst playing singles
out the Deuces and Treys for the last
Game, and placeth them thus in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
hiding them in his lap or other
covert, first a Deuce, then a Trey, next
a Deuce, then a Trey, then a Trey
and a Trey; now stooping letting fall
a Card or some other way as he shall
think fit, he claps these Cards fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d at
the bottom, having shuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led the Cards
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56740:77"/>
before, and bids his Adversary cut,
which he nimbly and neatly with
both his hands joyns the divided Cards,
and then the bottom fac'd Cards are
upwards, and then he deals, and lest
there should be a discovery made of
the facing, he palms them as much as
he can, nimbly passing the last Card.</p>
               <p>Now do the Gamesters smile at the
goodness of each others Game, one
shows his to one, the other his to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and cries who would not put at
such Cards? the other in as brisk a
tone, says, Come if you dare. What
will you lay of the Game, says the
Rook? what you dare, says the <hi>col;</hi>
then pausing a while the Rook seems
to consult with his friends, who cry,
they know not what to think on't;
five pound cries a rooking Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
on this Gentlemans side, the <hi>col</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>VVIT</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> is a Game
which seems very easie at
first to the Learner, but in his practice
and observation shall find it otherwise.
It is a Game something like one and
thirty, and is plaid after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Two playing together, the one hath
all the red Cards, and the other hath
the black: then they turn up cross or
pile who shall lead; for the Leader
hath a great advantage over the other,
as shall be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>You are not to play a ten first; for
if you do you shall certainly lose; for
one and thirty being the Game he that
first comes to it wins; now should the
Leader play a ten the follower will play
another ten, that makes twenty; let
the Leader then play any thing next the
Follower will be sure to make it up one
and thirty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56740:78"/>He that hath the Lead if he play a
nine may certainly win the Game, if he
look about him; ever remembring to
get first to twenty, without spending
two of one sort, as two Deuces, two
Treys, two Quaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwise
you will lose: As for example, you
play a nine first, your Adversary plays
a Deuce that makes eleven, you then
play a nine again, and that makes
twenty; thus you have plaid out both
your nines, wherefore your Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist
plays a Deuce, now you can play
no Card but he wins; for if you play
an eight (for you cannot come in with
your ten) and you have never a nine,
then he hath an Ace for one and thirty;
so if you play a seven, which makes nine
and twenty, he hath a Deuce remaining
to make up one and thirty, and so
you may observe in the rest of the
Cards.</p>
               <p>Take this for a general rule, that you
have a very great advantage in fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out by play any two of a number,
as aforesaid; as two fives, two sixes,
two sevens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore you must
not play rashly, but with due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56740:79"/>
arithmetically grounded to make
up a certain Game of one and thirty.
To conclude, he that hath the art of
playing well at one and thirty without
Cards, that is by naming such a number
at first, and prosecuting it by such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of others, that your Adversary
cannot think of any number but
what shall be your Game; I say
such a man is fittest to play at this Game
called <hi>Wit and Reason.</hi>

               <p>THis <hi>Art of Memory</hi> is a Sport at
which men may play for Money,
but it is most commonly the way to
play the Drunkard. It is best when many
play at it; for with few it is no sport
at all: For example, as many persons
as do play so many Cards trebled must
be thrown down on the Table with
their faces upwards; which every one
must take notice of and indeavour to
register them in his Memory. Then
the Dealer must take them all up, and
shuffling them after cutting deals to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one three apiece.</p>
               <p>The first it may be calls for a King,
which must be laid on the Table with
his face downwards by him that hath it
in his hands; the next it may be calls
for a ten of the Spades, which must be
laid down in like manner, and so it
goes round; now if any one calls for
what is already laid down, if they play
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56740:80"/>
for liquor, he must then drink a Glass;
if for mony, he must then pay a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
half-penny, or the like.</p>

several ways, but I shall insist on
none but two; the first way is thus.</p>
               <p>Lift for dealing, and the best Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
carries it; as many may play as
the Cards will permit, to whom must
be dealt five apiece, and then turn up
Trump. Now if three, four, five or
six play, they may lay out the threes,
fours, fives, sixes and sevens to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
they may not be quickly lood;
but if they would have the loos come
fast about then play with the whole
Pack.</p>
               <p>Having dealt set up five scores or
chalks; and then proceed forwards
in your Game.</p>
               <p>He that is Eldest hand hath the
priviledg of passing by the benefit
thereof, that is, he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th the advantage
of hearing what every one will say,
and at last may play or not play ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56740:81"/>
as he finds his Game good or
bad. If the Eldest faith he passeth, the
rest may chuse whether they will play
or no.</p>
               <p>You may play upon every Card
what you please, from a penny to a
pound. Trumps as at Whist are the
best Cards, all others in like manner
take their precedency from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to the lowest.</p>
               <p>You must not revoke, if you do you
pay all on the Table. If you play and
are loo'd (that is, win never a trick)
you must lay down to the stock so
much for your five Cards as you
plaid upon every one of them.</p>
               <p>Every deal rub off a score, and for
every trick you win set up a score by
you till the first scores are out, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you how many tricks you
have won in the several deals in the
Game.</p>
               <p>All the Chalks for the Game being
rub'd out, tell your own scores, and
for so many scores or tricks which
you have won, so much as they were
valued at in the Game so much you
must take from the Stock; thus must
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56740:82"/>
every one do according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of tricks he hath won.</p>
               <p>Here note, that he who hath five
Cards of a suit in his hand loos all
the Gamesters then playing, be they
never so many, and sweeps the board;
if there be two loos he that is eldest
hand hath the advantage.</p>
               <p>As there is cheating (as they say)
in all trades, so more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
in Gaming; as in this for
example, if one of the Gamesters have
four of a suit and he want a fifth, he
may for that fifth make an exchange
out of his own Pocket if he be skil'd
in the cleanly art of conveiance; if
that fail, some make use of a friend,
who never fails to do him that kind
office and favour. There are other
Cheats to be performed, which I shall
omit, since it is not my business to teach
you how to cheat, but so to play as not
to be cheated.</p>

the money may be divided by the
Gamesters according to the number of
their Tricks, if there be a loo the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

five, the King four, the Queen three,

               <p>Having play'd, he that wins the first

what is turn'd up proves an Ace or
Coat-Card, that is a great advantage to
him who won the last trick; for if it
be an Ace turn'd up then he reckons
five, if a King four, if a Queen three,
as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>After all the seven Cards be play'd,
(which at first are dealt one by one)
he that won the last trick turns up a

it is the highest Card and wins all others;
if it be not Trump it wins all Diamonds.</p>

very much play'd in the West of
<hi>England,</hi> as <hi>All-Fours</hi> is play'd in <hi>Kent,</hi>
and <hi>Fives</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Play depends much upon da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
so that some may win very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably,
who have the boldness to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
much upon the Vye, although
their Cards are very indifferent.</p>
               <p>You must first stake at Post then at
Pair; after this deal two Cards apiece,
then stake at the Seat, and then deal
the third Card about. The eldest hand
may pass and come in again, if any of
the Gamesters vye it; if not, the Dealer
may play it out, or double it.</p>
               <p>The Ace of Trumps, as at Ruff and
Honours, is the best Card of all, and
so of the rest in order. At Post the best
Cards are one and twenty, <hi>viz.</hi> two
Tens and an Ace, but a Pair-royal wins
all, both Post, Pair, and Seat. Here
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56740:84"/>
note, that he who hath the best Pair or
the best Post is the winner. A Pair is a
pair of any two, as two Kings, two
Queens, &amp;c. A Pair-Royal is of three,
as three Kings, three Queens, &amp;c. The
Vye is what you please to adventure
upon the goodness of your own hand;
or if it be bad, and you imagine your
Adversaries is so likewise, then bid high
couragiously, by which means you
daunt your Antagonist, and so bring
him to submission. If all the Gamesters
keep in till all have done, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
shew their Cards, the best Cards
carry the Game. Now according to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
those that keep in till last, may
divide the stakes, or shew the best Card
for it.</p>
               <p>Observe, where the Cards fall in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
hands of the same sort, as a Pair
or Pair-Royal, and so forth, the eldest

than <hi>Irish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be sure to make good your Trey,
Ace-points, hit boldly and come away
as fast as you can, to which end if
your Dice run high, you will make
the quicker dispatch.</p>
               <p>When you come to bearing have a
care of making when you need not,
and Doublets now will stand you most
in stead.</p>
               <p>If both bear together he that is first
off without Doublets wins one.</p>
               <p>If both bear and one goes off with
Doublets he wins two.</p>
               <p>If your Tables be clear before your
Adversaries men be come in, that's a
<hi>Back-Gammon,</hi> which is three; but if
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56740:87"/>
you thus go off with Doublets it is
four.</p>
               <p>False Dice are much used at <hi>Irish</hi>
and <hi>Back-Gammon</hi> for the benefit of
entring, wherefore have a special care
that you have not Cinque-Deuces, and
Quater-Treys put upon you, you may
quickly perceive it by the running of
the Dice.</p>
               <p>The person that is cunning at play
has great advantage of a novice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
man; which is commonly by
toping or knaping, which by its often
practice may be suspected by his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
then he has recourse to Dice,
which runs particular chances for his
purpose, which the other being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, is almost an equal advantage
with the former. For example, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
Dice that runs 6, 5, 4, 'tis his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to secure those points, so that if
he happens to surprize any of your
men coming home, as 'tis two to one
but he does, he does without a kind of
Miracle win the set.</p>
               <p>'Tis possible sometimes they may
make use of 3, 2, which are the low
Chances; but that they seldom do for
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56740:88"/>
this reason, the high or forward points
being supplied, you must enter if at all
upon the low points which keeps you
backwards and gives him advantage.
The advantage of this Game is to be
forward if possible upon safe terms, and
to point his men, at that rate that it shall
not be possible for you to pass, though
you have entred your men, till he gives
you liberty, having two to one the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Game.</p>

               <p>ALL your men must stand on the
Ace-point, and from thence play
forward, but have a care of being too
forward, or so at leastwise that Doublets
reach you not.</p>
               <p>Secure your Sice and Cinque-point
whatever you do, and break them not
unless it be when you have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of going in, which is the greatest
advantage you can have next to a hit;
for your Adversaries eleventh point
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56740:88"/>
standing open you have it may be the
opportunity of going in with two of
your men, and then you win a double
Game. A hit is but one, and that is,
when you throw such a cast that some
one of your men will reach your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
unbound, but sometimes
though it hits it will not pass by reason
of a stop in the way, and then it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Sometimes it is good going over
into your Adversaries Tables, but it is
best for an After-game.</p>
               <p>Playing close at home is the securest
way, playing at length is both rash and
unsafe, and be careful of binding your
men when you lie in danger of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Moreover, if you see you are in
danger of losing a double Game give
your Adversary one; if you can it is
better doing so than losing two.</p>
               <p>Here note, if you fill up all the
points of your second Table with your
own men you win two, and that you
may prevent your Adversary from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so (if you are in danger thereof) if
you can, make a vacant point in his
Tables, and it is impossible for him to
do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:56740:89"/>This is the plain Game of Tick-Tack,
which is called so from <hi>Touch,</hi> and <hi>take,</hi>
for if you touch a man you must play
him though to your loss; and if you
hit your Adversary and neglect the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
you are taken with a Why not,
which is the loss of one: likewise if
you are in, and your cast is such that
you may also go into your Adversaries
eleventh point by two other men, and
you see it not, either by carelesness or
eager prosecution of a hit which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
before your eyes, you lose two
irrecoverably. Besides, it is a very
great oversight as your men may stand
not to take a point when you may do
it.</p>
               <p>Now some play this Game with
Toots, Boveries, and Flyers; Toots
is, when you fill up your Table at home
and then there is required small throws;
for if you get over with a Sice you have
no benefit of Toots.</p>
               <p>Boveries is when you have a man in
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e eleventh point of your own Tables,
and another in the same point of your
Adversaries directly answering.</p>
               <p>Flyers is, when you bring a man
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56740:89"/>
round the Tables before your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
hath got over his first Table, to the
effecting of which there is required
very high throwing of your side, and
very low throwing of his.</p>
               <p>Much more might be said as to the
craft of the play, which cannot be so
well discovered as from observation in
your own or others playing.</p>
               <p>There are several foolish pastims to

thought if he could contrive a way to
win a considerable sum at play (having

be the basis of his future settlement;
after various consultations within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
he at length contrived this strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem;
He caused a Box to be made, not
as they are usual screwed within, but
smooth, and procured it to be so well
painted and shadowed within that it
lookt like a screw'd Box; now this
Box was but half board wide at top,
and narrow at bottom, that the Dice
as aforesaid might stick, and the Box
being smooth would come out without
tumbling. With this Box he went and
play'd at <hi>Inn and Inn,</hi> by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>
                  <hi>HAzzard</hi> is a proper name for this
Game; for it speedily makes a
man or undoes him; in the twinkling
of an eye either a Man or a Mouse.</p>
               <p>This Game is play'd but with two
Dice, but there may play at it as many
as can stand round the largest round
Table.</p>
               <p>There are two things chiefly to be
observed, that is, <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Chance;</hi>
the <hi>Chance</hi> is the <hi>Casters,</hi> and the <hi>Main</hi>
theirs who are concerned in play with
him. There can be no <hi>Main</hi> thrown
above nine and under five; so that
five, six, seven, eight and nine are the
only <hi>Mains</hi> and no more which are
flung at Hazzard; <hi>Chances</hi> and <hi>Nicks</hi>
are from four to ten, thus four is a
<hi>chance</hi> to nine, five to eight, six to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
seven to six, eight to five; and
nine and ten a chance to five, six, seven
and eight: in short, four, five, six, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56740:93"/>
eight, nine and ten are chances
to any <hi>Main,</hi> if any of these <hi>Nick</hi> it not:
now <hi>Nicks</hi> are either when the <hi>chance</hi>
is the same with the <hi>Main,</hi> as five and
five, six and six, seven and seven, and
so on, or six and twelve, seven and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven,
eight and twelve; where note,
that twelve is out to nine, seven, and
five; and eleven is out to nine, eight,
six, and five; <hi>Ames-Ace,</hi> and Deuce-Ace,
are out to all Mains what ever.</p>
               <p>That I may the better illustrate this
Game, it will not be amiss to give one
example for your better information;
Seven's the <hi>Main,</hi> the Caster throws
five, and that's his <hi>chance,</hi> and so hath
five to seven; if the Caster throw his
own <hi>chance</hi> he wins all the money-was
set him, but if he throw Seven which
was the <hi>Main,</hi> he must pay as much
money as is on the Board; if again Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
be the <hi>Main,</hi> and the <hi>Caster</hi> throws
eleven, that is a <hi>Nick,</hi> and sweeps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all the money on the Table; but
if he throw a <hi>chance,</hi> he must wait
which will come first; Lastly, if Seven
be the <hi>Main,</hi> and the Caster throws
Ames-Ace, Deuce-Ace or twelve, he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56740:94"/>
is out, but if he throw from four to ten
he hath a <hi>chance,</hi> though they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the worst <hi>chances</hi> on the Dice,
as seven is reputed the best and easiest
<hi>Main</hi> to be flung; thus it is in eight or
six, if either of them be the <hi>Main,</hi> and
the <hi>Caster</hi> throw either four, five, seven,
nine, or ten, this is his <hi>chance,</hi> which
if he throw first, he wins, otherwise
loseth; if he throw twelve to eight, or
six or the same Cast with the <hi>Main,</hi> he
wins; but if Ames-Ace or Deuce-Ace
to all he loseth; or if twelve when the
<hi>Main</hi> is either five or nine. Here note,
that nothing <hi>Nicks</hi> five but five, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
nine but nine.</p>
               <p>Four and Five to Seven is judged to
have the worst on't, because Four
(called by the Tribe of Nickers little
Dick-Fisher) and Five have but two
<hi>chances,</hi> Trey Ace and two Deuces,
or Trey Deuce and Quater Ace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Seven hath three Chances, Cinque
Deuce, Six Ace, and Quater Trey;
in like condition is nine and ten, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
but two chances, six trey, cinque
and quater, or six quater and two
cinques.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:56740:94"/>Now six and eight one would think
should admit of no difference in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
with seven, but if you will rightly
consider the case, and be so vain to
make trial thereof, you will find a great
advantage in seven over six and eight.
How can that be you will say, hath not
six, seven and eight eight equal chances?
For example, in six, quater deuce,
cinque Ace, and two Treys; in eight, six
deuce, cinque trey, and two quaters, and
hath not seven three as aforesaid? It is
confest; but pray consider the disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the doublets, two treys and
two quaters, and you will find that six
deuce is sooner thrown than two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and so consequently cinque Ace or
quater deuce sooner than two treys:
I saw an old Rook once take up a
young fellow in a Tavern, upon this
very score: the bargain was made that
the Rook should have seven always
and the young Gentleman six, and
throw continually; agreed to play
they went, the Rook got the first day
ten pound, the next day the like sum;
and so for six days together losing in all
threescore pounds; notwithstanding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56740:95"/>
the Gentleman, I am confident, had
square Dice, and threw them always
himself. And farther to confirm what
I alledg'd before, not only this Rook,
but many more have told me that they
desir'd no greater advantage than to
have seven always and the <hi>Caster</hi> to
have six. Here note, it is the opinion
of most that at the first throw the Gaster
hath the worst on't.</p>
               <p>Certainly <hi>Hazzard</hi> is the most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
Game that is plaid on the
Dice; for when a man begins to play
he knows not when to leave off; and
having once accustom'd himself to play
at <hi>Hazzard</hi> he hardly ever after minds
any thing else. I have seen an old man
about the Age of Seventy play at an
Ordinary when his own eyes were so
defective, that he was forced to help
them with a pair of Spectacles; and
having an opportunity one day to
speak to him, How a man of his years
could be so vain and boyish still to mind
play; insisting withall upon the folly
of that action to hazzard his money
when he had not sight enough remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to discern whether he had won or
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56740:95"/>
lost; besides Sir, said I, you cannot
but hear how you are derided every
time you come to the Ordinary; one
says, here comes he that cannot rest
quiet, but will cry without the rattle of
the Dice; another cries, certainly such
a one plays by the ear; for he cannot
see to play. Let them talk what they
will, said the Gentleman, I cannot help
it, I have been for above forty years
so us'd to play, that should I leave it
off now, I were as good stop those Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
about me, which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in the preservation of my life
to this length of time.</p>
               <p>To conclude, happy is he that having
been much inclined to this time-spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
-money-wasting Game, hath took
up in time, and resolved for the future
never to be concerned with it more; but

               <head type="sub">The Art and Mystery of RIDING,
Whether the Great-Horse or any other.</head>
               <p>AS an Introduction to the Art of
Riding, I think it requisite to
treat of the taming of a young Colt:
In order thereunto, observe, that after
your Colt hath been eight or ten days
at home, and is reduced to that familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that he will indure currying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
showing aversion thereunto, and
will suffer his Keeper to handle and
stroke him in what part of the body he
thinketh best, then it is time to offer
him the Saddle; first laying it in the
Manger that he may smell to it, and
thereby grow acquainted with it, using
all other means that he may not be
afraid either at the sight thereof or at
the noise of the Stirrops. Having gently
put on the Saddle, take a sweet watring
Trench washt and anointed with Honey
and Salt, and so place it in his mouth,
that it may hang directly about his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56740:96"/>
Tush, somewhat leaning thereon: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so done, which must be in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after dressing, then lead him out
in your hand and water him abroad,
then bring him in, and after he hath
stood rein'd a little upon his Trench
an hour or thereabout, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridle
and unsaddle him, and give
him liberty to feed till Evening, and
then do as before; having cherished
him, dress and cloath him for the
night.</p>
               <p>The next day do as you did before,
and after that put on him a strong Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role,
or sharp Cavezan and Martingal,
which you must buckle at that length,
that he may only feel it when he jerketh
up his head; then lead him forth into
some new plow'd land or soft ground,
and there having made him trot a good
while about in your hand to take him off
from wantonness and wild tricks, offer
to mount, which if he refuse, then trot
him again in your hand, then put your
foot in the Stirrup, and mount half way
and dismount again; if he seem distasted
at it, about with him again, and let
him not want correction; but if he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56740:97"/>
take it patiently, cherish him, and place
your self in the Saddle, but stay there a
very little while, then cherish him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and give him bread or grass to
feed on; then having seen all things fit
and strong without offence to your self
and Horse, remount him, placing your
self even in the Saddle, carrying your
Rod inoffensively to his eye, then let
some person having in his hand the
Chaff-halter, lead him a little way, then
make him stand, and having cherisht
him, let him forward again, do this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight times, or so often till you
have brought him of his own accord to
go forward, then must you stay and
cherish him, and having brought him
home, alight gently, then dress and feed
him well.</p>
               <p>Observe this course every day till
you have brought him to trot, which
will be but three at the most, if you
observe to make him follow some other
Horsman, stopping him now and then
gently, and then making him go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
remembring his seasonable che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishings,
and not forgetting his due
corrections as often as you find him fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56740:97"/>
and rebellious; and when you
ride him abroad, return not the same
way home, that you may make him take
all ways indifferently: and by these
observations you will bring him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
your will and purpose in less
than a fortnights time.</p>
               <p>Having brought your Horse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you to his back, trot foreright,
stop and tetire with patience and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
be never unmindful of your
<hi>Helps, corrections</hi> and <hi>cherishings,</hi> which
consist in the <hi>Voice, Bridle, Rod, Calves
of the Legs,</hi> and <hi>Spurs;</hi> the last of
which is chief for correction, which
must not be done faintly but sharply
when occasion shall require it.</p>
               <p>Cherishings may be comprehended
within three heads, the Voice delivered
smoothly and lovingly, as <hi>so, so boy, so;</hi>
then the hand by clapping him gently
on the neck or buttock: lastly the Rod
by rubbing him therewith upon the
Withers or the Main, in which he very
much delights.</p>
               <p>The next that you are to regard, is
the Musrole or Cavezan and Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale;
this is an excellent Guide to a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56740:98"/>
well-disposed Horse for setting of his
head in due place, forming of his Rein,
and making him appear lovely to the
eye of the Spectator; and withall this
is a sharp correction when a Horse yerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out his Nose, disorders his head,
or endeavours to run away with his
Rider.</p>
               <p>The manner of placing it, is thus: let
it hang somewhat low, and rest upon
the tender grissel of the Horses nose,
that he may be the more sensible of
correction; and let it not be strait,
but loose, whereby the Horse may
feel, upon the yeelding in of his head,
how the offence goeth; from and by
that means be made sensible, that his
own disorder was his only punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>You must carefully observe how
you win your Horses head, and by
those degrees bring his Martingale
straighter and straighter, so as the
horse may ever have a gentle feeling
of the same, and no more, till his
head be brought to its true perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and there stay.</p>
               <p>When you have brought your horse
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56740:98"/>
to some certainty of Rein, and will
Trot forth-right, then bring him to
the treading forth of the large rings.
If your horses nature be sloathful and
dull, yet strong-trot him first in some
new plow'd field; but if agil, and of
a fiery spirit, then trot him in some
sandy ground, and there mark out a
spacious large ring, about a hundred
paces in circumference. Having walkt
him about it on the right seven or
eight times, you must then by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
straitning of your right Rein, and
laying the calf of your left leg to his
side, making a half circle within your
ring, upon your right hand down to
the center thereof, and then by strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a little your left Rein, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the calf of your right leg to his
side, making another semi-circle to
your left hand from the center to
the outmost verge; which two Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles
contrary turned, will make a
perfect Roman S within the ring; then
keeping your first large circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
walk your horse about in your
left hand, as oft as you did on your
right; and then change within your
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56740:99"/>
ring as you did before, to your right
hand again; and then trot him first
on the right hand, then on the left,
as long as you shall think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
either one, two, or three hours,
to perfect him in this lesson; and this
must be done every morning and
evening too, if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd your horse
sloathful and dull; other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ise you
need not take so much pains with
him.</p>
               <p>Having taught him to trot the large
rings perfectly, which will not require
above four or five days; then in the
same manner and changes make him
gallop the same rings, making him
take up his feet so truly and loftily,
that no falshood may be perceived in
his stroke, but that his inward feet
play before his outward, and each of
a side follow the other so exactly,
that his gallop may appear the best
grace of all his motions.</p>
               <p>Here note: You must not enter him
all at once to gallop this great ring,
but by degrees; first a quarter, then
a half quarter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ever remembring,
not to force him into it with the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56740:99"/>
spur, but by the lightness and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of your body let him pass of
his own accord into a gallop.</p>
               <p>Helps, corrections, and cherishings
in the ring-turn, are as aforesaid, the
elevation of the voice, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the rod, and straitning of the
bridle, are good helps, which you must
use as you must the spur, rod and leg,
for timely due corrections: neither
must you ever cherish without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.</p>
               <p>Having made your horse gallop as
well as trot the large ring, then teach
him to stop fair, comely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger, after this manner: First,
having cherisht him, bring him into a
swift trot forward about fifty paces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then draw in your bridle-hand
straightly and suddenly, which will
make him gather up his hinder and
fore-legs together, and thereby stand
still: then ease your hand a little,
that he may give backward: which
if he doth, give him more liberty,
and cherish him: having given a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
respit, draw in your bridle-hand,
and make him go back three or four
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56740:100"/>
paces, at which if he strike, instantly
ease your hand, and draw it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
letting him come and go till he
yeeld and go backward: but if he
refuse it, let some person standing by,
put him back, and then cherish him,
that he may know your intention.
Thus every time you stop, make him
retire, till you have perfected him in
these two lessons at one time.</p>
               <p>Have a care that the ground be not
slippery where you stop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but firm and
hard, lest the horse apprehensive of
the danger of falling, refuse to stop
as you would have him.</p>
               <p>When your horse can stop well,
and retire, you must then teach him
to advance before, when he stoppeth;
a lesson that carrieth much grace and
comeliness therein; it is performed
in this manner: After you have stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
your horse without giving your
hand any ease, lay the calves of both
your legs hard to his sides, shaking
your Rod, and crying, <hi>Vp, up;</hi> which
though he understand not at first, yet
by frequent practice, with helps, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishings,
and corrections as aforesaid,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56740:100"/>
he will come to understand your
meaning. But be sure you look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
to the comeliness of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing,
which consists in taking up
his legs both even together, bending
them inward to his body; next, his
advance must not be too high, for
fear of his coming over upon you; but
let him couch his hinder-loins close
to the ground, but by no means suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to sprawl or paw with his
feet forward. Lastly, he must not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
for his own pleasure (for that
is a great fault) but for yours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your will and command.</p>
               <p>If in advancing he rise too high,
ready to come over, or sprawl, or paw;
give him not only your spurrs both
together, but lash him twice or thrice
with your Rod between his ears, and
if he advanceth of his own accord,
then jerk him over the knees, doing
so as often as he commits those
faults.</p>
               <p>Now the use of advancing is this;
it not only graceth all his other les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but makes his body agil and
nimble, and fits him for ready turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56740:101"/>
it is most used at stopping, and
then very gracefully.</p>
               <p>In the next place you must teach
your horse to yerk out behind, after
this manner: As soon as you have
made him stop, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>presently give him a
good jerk under his belly, near his
flank, which will make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
you in time, though not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
At first doing, cherish him
much, and having let him pawse, make
him do it again, till he will do it as
often as you will have him: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
look to the comeliness of his yerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for it is not graceful for him to
yerk out his hinder-legs till his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs
be above the ground; and see
that he yerk not one leg farther out
than the other, but both even toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not too high, or one leg
out whilst the other is on the
ground.</p>
               <p>Helps in yerking, are the constant
staying of his mouth on the bridle,
the stroke of the Rod under his belly,
or a gentle touch thereof on his
Rump.</p>
               <p>If he refuse to yerk, or doth it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56740:101"/>
disorderly, then a single spur on that
side that is faulty; and lastly, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
diseasing him till he hath done
it.</p>
               <p>Now to teach him to turn readily
on both hands, is first to bring his
large rings into a narrower compass,
that is about four yards in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
walking your horse therein
with all gentleness, and at his own
pleasure, till he is acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
After this, carry your bridle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
constant, and somewhat straight,
the outmost Rein straighter than the
inmost, making the horse rather look
from the ring, than into it; and thus
trot him about, first on the one side,
than on the other, making your chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as aforesaid. Thus exercise him
an hour and half, then stop and make
him advance three or four times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
then retire in an even line,
afterwards stand still and cherish him:
Having pawsed a while to recover
breath, exercise him as aforesaid, still
endeavouring to bring his trot to all
the swiftness and loftiness possible, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him do his changes roundly and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56740:102"/>
readily, and causing him to lap his
outmost leg so much over his inmost
leg, that he may cover it more than
a foot over: and thus exercise him
seven or eight days, every morning at
least three hours, and suffer him only
to practice his former lessons once in
a morning; in this manner you teach
your horse three lessons together, the
<hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> the <hi>Incavalere,</hi> and the
<hi>Chambletta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The turn <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> in the outmost
circle of the straight ring, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavalere</hi>
and <hi>Chambletta</hi> in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
wherein he is forced to lap one
leg over another, or else to lift up the
inmost leg from the ground, whilst he
brings the outmost over it: This les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is so difficult, that a compleat
Horseman should think his horse hath
never perfectly learn'd it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must continually practice his
horse in trading, trotting, and gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these narrow rings; and from
thence to pass them about in ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salts,
as from taking up his fore-legs
from the ground both together, and
bringing his hinder feet in their place,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56740:102"/>
and so passing the Ring as often as the
strength of your horse and your own
reason will allow of.</p>
               <p>Thus you see the perfecting your
horse in the large Ring will easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
him into the knowledg of
the straight Ring, and that brings him
to turn perfectly, and stopping begets
retiring, and retiring advancing.</p>
               <p>Having brought your horse to this
perfection, take off his <hi>Musrole</hi> and
<hi>Trench,</hi> and in their stead put on his
head a gentle <hi>Cavezan,</hi> in such manner
that it lye on the tender grissel of his
nose somewhat near the upper part
of his nostrils; put in his mouth
a sweet smooth cannon-bit, with a
plain watering chain, the cheek being
of a large size, let the <hi>Kirble</hi> be thick,
round and large, hanging loosly upon
his neather lip, so that it may entice
him to play therewith.</p>
               <p>Having so done, mount, casting the
left rein of your <hi>Cavezan</hi> over the
horses right shoulder, and bear it with
your thumb with the reins of the Bit
in your left hand; let the right reins
of the <hi>Cavezan</hi> be cast over his left
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56740:103"/>
shoulder, and bear it with your Rod in
your hand, and so trot him forth the
first morning about two miles in the
high-way, making him now and then
stop and retire, and gather up his head
in its due place; the next day bring
him to his former large Rings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
him therein with the Bit as you did
with the Sanffle in all the foregoing les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which is more easily done by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Bit is of better command and of
sharper correction.</p>
               <p>The next thing we shall speak of (to
avoid every thing that is not very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to our purpose) is the <hi>Turning-Post,</hi>
which must be smooth and strong,
and very well fixt in the center of
the straight Ring, then causing some
person to stand at the Post, give him
the right rein of your <hi>Cavezan</hi> to hold
about the Post, and so walk or trot
your horse about the same as oft as
you think fit on your right hand; then
change your right rein for your left,
and do as before; continue thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till your horse be perfect in every
turn. Having so done, teach him to
manage (the proper posture for a
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:56740:103"/>
sword) which is thus performed: Cause
two Rods to be prickt in the earth,
at what distance as you shall think
fit from one another; then walk your
horse in a straight ring about the first
on your right hand, passing him in an
even furrow down to the other Rod,
and walk about that also in a narrow
Ring on your left hand, then thrust
him into a gentle gallop down the
even furrow, till you come to the first
Rod, and there make him stop (as it
were) and advance without pawse or
intermission of time; thrust him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
again, beat the turn <hi>Terra a Terra</hi>
about on your right hand; then gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
forth right to the other Rod, and
in the same manner beat the turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
on the left hand; do this as
often as you shall think convenient:
Though there are many sorts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages,
yet I hold but two necessary
and useful, and that is this already
described, called <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavalere</hi>
or <hi>Chambletta,</hi> discoursed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-going.
As for the <hi>Career,</hi> I need
not speak much thereof; only this,
when you run him forth-right at full
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56740:104"/>
speed, stop him quickly, suddenly,
firm and close on his buttock, and
mark that you make not your <hi>Career</hi>
too long, nor too short; the one
weakens, and the other hinders the
discovery of his true wind and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
therefore let not the length of
your Career extend above six-score
yards; and be sure you give him
some little warning by your bridle-hand,
before you start him, and then
stop him firmly and strongly.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the War-Horse or
great Saddle.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:56740:104"/>
                  <head>Of the Horse of Pleasure.</head>
                  <p>IF you will make your Horse to <hi>bound</hi>
aloft, you must first trot him about
sixteen yards, then stop him, and when
he hath advanced twice, streigthen a
little your Bridle-hand, and then give
him the even stroke of both your spurs
together hard, which at first will only
amaze him, but if he have good mettle
and courage, he will at length rise from
the ground by often doing it; if he
doth it, though but little, cherish him
very much, then let him pause and give
him your spurs again, and if he acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your desire, cherish him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
make him do thus three or four
times a day, till he is so perfect that he
will do it at any time at your spurs
command.</p>
                  <p>Next, teach him to <hi>corvet</hi> thus; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ground a Horse's length, where
two walls join together, then place a
strong smooth Post by the side of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56740:105"/>
hollowness of a Horse's length likewise
from the wall, then over against the Post
fasten an iron ring at the wall; this done,
ride your Horse into the hollow place,
and fasten one of the Reins of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezan
to the Ring, and the other about
the Post; then having first cherished
your Horse) make him advance by the
help of the calves of your legs, twice
or thrice together, then let him pause;
after this (cherisning him again) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
him half a score times together,
and daily encrease his advancings, till
you perceive he hath got such a habit
therein, that he will by no means go
forward, but keeping his ground cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
advance both before and behind of
an equal height, and keep just and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
time with the motions of your legs;
and if he raise his hinder legs not high
enough, you must have some body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
who having a rod, must gently
jerk him on the fillets, to make him
raise his hinder parts. By taking this
course, in a few days you will so teach
your Horse to corvet, that without any
helps at any time and place, you may
make him corvet at your pleasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:56740:105"/>I need not speak of the <hi>Capriole,</hi> since
it is the same manner of motion as the
<hi>Corvet,</hi> only it is done forward, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

parts as high or higher then the
foremost.</p>
                  <p>If you would have your Horse go
side-long on any hand, you must draw
up your bridle-hand straight, and if
you would have him go on the right
hand, lay your left rein close to his
neck, and the calf of your leg close to
his side, making him put his left leg over
his right, then turning your rod back
ward, gently jerking him on the left
hinder thigh, make him bring his hinder
parts to the right side also, and stand in
an even line as at the first, then make
him remove his fore-parts more than
before, so that he may as it were cross
over the even line, aud then make him
bring his hinder part after, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lessons requisite to be taught
any Horse whatever, either for service

your Horse perfect and compleat.

               <p>FOR the compleating a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
delight in the Art of <hi>Racing,</hi>
he is to take special cognizance of these
subsequent Rules and Orders.</p>
               <p>First, He is to consider what is the most
convenient time to take his Horse from
grass, which is about <hi>Bartholomew-tide,</hi>
the day being dry, fair, and pleasant;
as soon as he is taken up, let him let him
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56740:106"/>
stand all that night in some convenient
dry place to empty his body; the next
day put him into a stable, and feed him
with wheat-straw, but no longer; for
though the Rule be good in taking up
Horses bellies after this manner, yet if
you exceed your time in so doing, this
straw will straigthen his guts, heat his
liver, and hurt his blood; therefore
what you want in straw let it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by riding him forth to water
morning and evening, airings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moderate exercise. And for his
food, let it be good old sweet Hay,
and clothe him according to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and temper of his body; for as
the year grows colder, and thereby
you find his hair rise and stare about
his neck, flanks, or other parts, then add
a woollen cloth, or more if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
till his hair fall smooth. Where
note, <hi>That a rough coat shews want of
cloth, and a smooth coat cloth enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Race-horse ought to be drest in his
resting days twice a day, before his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and evening waterings; and must
be done after this manner: Curry him
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56740:107"/>
from the tips of his ears to the setting
on of his tail, all his body entirely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with an Iron-Comb, his legs under
the knees and gambrels excepted; then
dust him and curry him high again all
over with a round brush of bristles,
then dust him the second time, and rub
all the loose hair off with your hands
dipt in fair water, and continue rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
till he is as dry as at first, then rub
every part of him with a hair-cloth, and
lastly rub him all over with a white
Iinnen cloth; then pick his eyes, nostrils,
sheath, cods, tuel, and feet very clean,
then cloa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h him and stop him round
with wisps.</p>
               <p>There is no better water for a Race-horse,
then a running River or clear
Spring, about a mile and half from the
stable, near some level ground, where
you may gallop him afterwards, having
scop'd him a little, bring him to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
again, then scope him and bring him
again, so often till he refuse to drink
more for that time; after this, walk him
home, clothe and stop him up round
with great so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t wisps, and having stood
an hour upon the bridle, feed him with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56740:107"/>
sweet sound Oats, either dryed by age
or art: If your horse be low of flesh,
or hath a bad stomach, add one third
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to two parts of Oats, and that
will recover both.</p>
               <p>The next food you shall give him
shall be better and stronger, and it is
bread, which you must make after this
manner: take two bushels of beans, and
one of wheat, and grind them together,
then boult through a fine Range the
quantity of half a bushel of pure meal,
and bake it in three loaves, and the
rest sift through a Meal-sieve, and knead
it with water and good store of barm,
and bake it in great loaves; with the
courser bread feed your Runner in his
resting days, and with the finer against
the days of his exercise and greatest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>The times of his feeding, upon the
days of his rest, must be after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from water in the morning, an
hour after mid-day, after his evening
watering, and at ten a clock at night;
but upon his labouring days, two hours
after he is throughly cold, outwardly
and inwardly, afterwards as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:56740:108"/>Let his Hay be dry and short; if it be
sweet no matter how course it is, for if
it be rough it will scowre his teeth. As
for the proportion of his food, I need
not prescribe a quantity, since you must
allow him according to the goodness
and badness of his stomach.</p>
               <p>His exercise ought to be thrice a
week, and it must be more or less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the condition of his body;
for if it be foul, exercise him moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to break his grease; if clean, you
may do as you think fit, having a care
that you discourage him not, nor abate
his mettle; and after every exercise give
him that night, or the next morning, a
scouring; the best I know to purge a
Horse from all grease, glut, or filth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is this, take three ounces of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds,
six drams of Cumminseeds, a dram
and half of Cathamus, two drams of
Fen-greek-seed, and of Brimstone an
ounce and half; beat all these to a fine
powder, and searse them, then take of
Sallet-oyl somewhat more than a pint,
a pound an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> half of Honey, and a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of white Wine, then with fine white
Meal knead it well into a strong paste,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56740:108"/>
and keep it by you, it will last a long
time; when you use it, dissolve a ball
thereof in a Pail of fair water, and give
it him to drink after exercise, in the
dark, lest discolouring the water,
the Horse refuse to drink. This is an
excellent scouring, and a remedy for
all internal distempers.</p>
               <p>Now after exercise, cool him a little
abroad before you bring him home,
then house him and litter him well, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
him with dry clothes till there be
never a wet hair about him, then clothe
and wisp him round.</p>
               <p>Here note, before you air your Horse,
it will be requisite, to break a raw Egg
into his mouth, for it will add to his
wind. If he be fat, air him before Sun-rise
and after Sun-set; but if lean, let
him have as much comfort of the Sun
as you can, Coursing in his clothes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to make him sweat is not irrequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
so it be moderately done; but when
without his clothes, let it be sharp and
swift. Let his body be empty before
he course; and to wash his tongue and
nostrils with Vinegar, or to piss in his
mouth e're you back him, is wholesom;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56740:109"/>
having courst him, clothe him, after
he hath taken breath, and ride him home
gently.</p>
               <p>To be short, what is here defective
in the right ordering of a Race-horse,
your own judgments may easily supply.
All that you have to do, is to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
when to take him up, how to clothe
him and dress him, when and how to
feed and water, what and how much
exercise is requisite either by airing or
by coursing, and his ordering after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
and what scowrings are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite;
and that I may add a little
more to your knowledg, and conclude
this subject, take these general Rules
and Instructions.</p>
               <div type="rules_and_instructions">
                  <p>1. Course not your Horse hard at
least four or five days before you run
your match, lest the soarness of his
li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bs abate his speed.</p>
                  <p>2. Except your Horse be a foul feeder
muzzle him not above two or three
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> before his match, and the night

                     </gap> his bloody courses.</p>
                  <p>3. As you give your Horse gentle
courses, give him sharp ones too, that
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may as well find comfort as disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thereon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:56740:109"/>4. Upon the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> match-day let your
Horse be empty, and that he take his
rest undisturbed till you lead him out.</p>
                  <p>5. Shoo your Horse ever a day before
you run him, then the pain of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
knocks may be out of his feet.</p>
                  <p>6. Saddle your Horse on the Race-day
in the stable before you lead him
forth, and fix both the Pannel and the
Girths to his back and sides with Shoo-makers
wax, to prevent all dangers.</p>
                  <p>7. Lead your horse to his course
with all gentleness, and give him leave
to smell to other horses dung, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may be enticed to stole and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
his body as he goes.</p>
                  <p>8. Lastly, When you come to the
place where you must start, first rub his
limbs well, then uncloath him, then take
his back, and the word given, start him
with all gentleness and quietness that
may, lest doing any thing rashly, you
choak him in his own wind.</p>
                  <p>A Race-horse ought to have all the
finest shapes that may be, but above all
things he must be nimble, quick, and
fiery, apt to fly with the least motion.
Long shapes are tolerably good, for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56740:110"/>
though they shew weakness, yet they
assure sudden speed. The best horse
for this use is the <hi>Arabian Barbary,</hi> or
his Bastard; not but <hi>Gennets</hi> are good,
but the <hi>Turks</hi> much better.</p>
                  <p>Having laid you down all these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for ordering your Racer, from
his taking up, to the day of his running,
I hope you will make such good use of
them, that if upon an equal match you
should lay your money on the heels of
your horse thus ordered, he shall be so
far from kicking away his masters stake,
that the nimbleness of his feet shall make
it double.</p>
                  <p>I might here insert the many subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and tricks there are used in making
a Match, the craft of the Betters, with
the knavery of the Riders, but that
they are now too generally known by
the woful experience of too many <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-losers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ARchery,</hi> as it is a recreation, so it
hath been heretofore, and is still
in some parts of the world very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in military affairs, but now quite
laid aside by <hi>English</hi> men for fighting,
there being found out more dextrous
and speedy ways to kill and destroy
one another.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not so laid aside, but that it
is used by some for pastime, either at
Buts or Rovers, and should not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by Citizens, as appears by the
continuance of that ancient custom
for every Lord Mayor to see the prize
performed by shooting annually with
the pound Arrow.</p>
               <p>Certainly this shooting in the long
Bow is very healthful for the body, by
extending the limbs, and making them
pliant; and it hath been necessary for
a Commonwealth, in the defence and
preservation of the Conntry; but since
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56740:111"/>
it is so little used now adays, I shall
abreviate my discourse.</p>
               <p>There are these Rules to be observed
for shooting in the Long-bow.</p>
               <p>First, He must have a good eye to
behold and discern his mark; and
knowing-judgment to understand the
distance of ground, to take the true
advantage of a side-wind, and to know
in what compass his Arrow must fly;
and a quick dexterity, to give his shaft
a strong, sharp, and sudden loose.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He must in the action it
self stand fair and upright with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
his left foot a convenient stride
before his right, both his hams stiff,
his left arm holding his bow in the
midst, stretcht strait out, and his right
arm with his first three fingers and his
thumb drawing the string to his right
ear, the notch of his Arrow resting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his fore-finger and middle-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his right hand, and the steel of
his Arrow below the feathers upon the
middle knuckle of his fore-finger on his
left hand; he shall draw his Arrow
close up to the head, and deliver on
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56740:111"/>
the instant, without hanging on the
string.</p>
               <p>The best Bow is either <hi>Spanish</hi> or
<hi>English</hi> Yew; the best Shaft is of Burch,
Suger-chest, or Brazel, and the best
feathers gray or white.</p>
               <p>There are three <hi>Marks</hi> to shoot at,
<hi>Buts, Pricks,</hi> or <hi>Rovers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is a level mark, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must have strong Arrow
with a broad feather.</p>
               <p>The second is a mark of some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
yet most certain in the distance,
therefore you must have nimble strong
Arrows, with a middle feather, all of
one weight and flying.</p>
               <p>The last, which is the <hi>Rover,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
sometimes longer, sometimes
sharper, and therefore requires Arrows
lighter or heavier, according to the
distance of shooting.</p>
               <p>If you want strength, by debilitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Arm or Back, you may reap
the same pleasure by using the Cross-bow,
with which you may shoot at
<hi>Buts, Pricks,</hi> or <hi>Rovers.</hi>

               <p>COcking is a sport or pastime so full
of delight and pleasure, that I
know not any Game in that respect is
to be preferred before it, and since the
<hi>Fighting-Cock</hi> hath gain'd so great an
estimation among the Gentry, in respect
to this noble recreation I shall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it before all the other Games of
which I have afore succinctly discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
that therefore I may methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give instructions to such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced,
and add more knowledg
to such who have already gain'd a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
proficiency in this pleasing Art,
I shall as briefly as I can give you infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
how you shall chuse, breed,
and diet the <hi>Fighting-Cock,</hi> with what
choice secrets are thereunto belonging,
in order thus.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:56740:112"/>
                  <head>Of the Choice of the Fighting-Cock.</head>
                  <p>IN the election of a <hi>Fighting-Cock</hi>
there are four things principally to
be considered, and they are <hi>Shape, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
Courage,</hi> and <hi>Sharp-heel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, as to his <hi>shape,</hi> you must not
chuse him neither too small, nor too
large; the first is weak and tedious in
his fighting, and the other unweildy and
not active, and both very difficult to
be matched; wherefore the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siz'd
Cock is the proper choice for your
purpose, being easily matcht, and is
both strong and nimble.</p>
                  <p>His head ought to be small, with a
quick large eye, and a strong back, and
(as Mr. <hi>Markham</hi> observes) must be
crookt and big at the setting on, and
in colour suitable to the plume of his
Feathers, whether black, yellow or
reddish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The beam of his leg
must be very strong, and according to
his plume, blew, gray, or yellow, his
Spurs rough, long, and sharp, a little
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56740:113"/>
bending and looking inward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his <hi>Colour</hi> ought to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gray, yellow, or red, with a
black breast; not but that there are
many other colour'd pyles very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
good, which you must find out by
practice and observation, but the three
former by the experience of most found
ever the best, the pide pyle may pass
indifferently, but the white and dun
are rarely found good for any thing.</p>
                  <p>Here note, That if your Cocks neck
be invested with a scarlet complexion
it is a sign he is strong, lusty and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
but on the contrary, if pale and
wan, it denotes the Cock to be faint,
and in health defective.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you may know his courage
by his proud upright standing, and
stately tread in walking, and if he
croweth very frequently in the Pen,
it is a couragious demonstration.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, his narrow-heel
or sharpness of heel is known no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
than by observation in fighting,
and that is, when upon every rising he
so hits that he extracts blood from his
opponent, gilding his Spurs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56740:113"/>
and every blow threatning imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
death to his adversary.</p>
                  <p>Here note, That it is the opinion of
the best <hi>Cock-Masters,</hi> that a sharp-heel'd
Cock though he be somewhat false, is
better than a true Cock with a dull
heel; and the reason is this, the one
fights long but seldom wounds, the
other carrieth a heel so fatal that every
moment produceth an expectation of
the Battails conclusion; and though he
is not so hardy as to endure the utmost
hewing, so commonly there is little
occasion for it, being a quick dispatcher
of his business; now should your Cock
prove both hardy and narrow-heel'd,
he is then the best Cock you can make
choice of.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, make your choice of
such a one that is of <hi>Shape</hi> strong, of
<hi>Colour</hi> good, of <hi>Valour</hi> true, and of
<hi>Heel</hi> sharp and ready.</p>

                  <head>How to breed a Cock of the Game.</head>
                  <p>VVHatever you do, let your
Hen be of a good complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is to say, rightly plumed, as
black, brown, speckt, gray, grissel, or
yellowish; these are the right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
colours for a Hen of the Game;and
if she be tufted on the crown it is so
much the better, for that argues cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and resolution, and if she have
the addition of weapons they conduce
very much to her excellency.</p>
                  <p>Let her body be large and well po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
behind for the production of large
Eggs; you will do well to observe
how she behaveth her self to her Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
whether friendly or frowardly,
and take especial notice of her carriage
and deportment among other Hens, if
she will receive abuses from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
revenge, or show any thing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice,
value her not, for you may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your self her Chickens will be
good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:56740:114"/>By the way take this observation,
confirmed by the opinions of the best
<hi>Cock-Masters</hi> both ancient and modern,
that a right Hen of the Game from a
Dunghill-Cock will bring forth very
good Chickens, but the best Cock from
a Dunghill-Hen will never get a bird
that's fit for the Game, where if you
intend to have a good breed get per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Cocks for your perfect Hens.</p>
                  <p>The best season for breeding is from
the encrease of the Moon in <hi>February,</hi>
to the encrease of the same in <hi>March.</hi>
Let her nest be so placed that she may
not be disturbed by the sight of any
other fowl, which frequently so raiseth
her choler that the Eggs are in greater
danger; let the composure of her nest
be made of soft sweet straw, and let it
stand in some warm place, for she is a
Bird that is very tender.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
is, whether she turn her Eggs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
or not, if she is remiss therein, you
must supply her duty, but if she save
you the labour, prize her more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
And that she may not straggle
too far from her Eggs being necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56740:115"/>
to seek abroad for food, and so
cool her Eggs, it will be altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for you to set by her such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
food as you shall think fit with
some fair water; and that she may bathe
and trim her self at her pleasure: in the
place where she siteth let there be sand,
gravel and ashes finely sifted.</p>
                  <p>The Hen hatcheth her Chickens
commonly after one and twenty days;
observe in the hatching to take those
newly hatched, and wrapping them in
wool keep them warm by a fire side till
the rest are disclosed; being all hatcht
put them under the Hen, and be sure
to keep her warm, and suffer not your
Hen and Chickens to straggle abroad
till they are above three weeks old;
and let the room wherein they walk
be boarded, for all other Flours are
either too moist or too cold.</p>
                  <p>Let their Walk be in some Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
or Green-place, after they are a
month old, that they may have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of feeding on Worms, and now
and then to scowre themselves with
Grass and Chick-weed, but be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
they come not near Puddles or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56740:115"/>
filthy places, for they engender in
birds of this nature venemous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
which commonly prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
for the prevention of such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies
by way of antidote give them
every morning before they range a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
the blades of Leeks chopt or
minced small and mingled among their
usual diet; also it will be requisite to
perfume their room with burnt Peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal
or Rosemary.</p>
                  <p>Observe to take this course till their
Sexes are distinguishable; as soon as
the Comb or Wattels are discernable,
or plainly visible to the eye, cut them
away, and anoint the sore place with
sweet butter, till it be whole. The
reasons why their Combs or Wattles
should be cut so soon, are these, First
if you let them grow till they arrive
to their full bigness, and then cut them,
there will follow a great flux of blood,
and the least loss of blood in feather'd
fowl is very dangerous; if much, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mortal; moreover to let them
grow thus causeth gouty thick heads,
with great lumps; whereas if you
take them off betime as aforesaid,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56740:116"/>
they will have heads finely small,
smooth and slender.</p>
                  <p>The time of the separation of the
Cock-Chickens is when they begin to
fight with and peck one another, till
which time you may let them walk
with the Hen promiscuously together,
but afterwards let their Walks be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and that Walk is best where he
may securely and privately enjoy his
Hens without the disturbance and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance
of other Cocks, for which
purpose walks at Wind-mills, Water-mills,
Grange-houses, Lodges in Parks,
and Coney-Warrens, are very good
Walks, but that the later is somewhat
dangerous, being too frequently haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Polecats, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
                  <p>Let the place of feeding be as near
as you can on soft dry ground, or on
boards if the place be harder, as on
paved earth, or floors plaister'd, it
will so weaken and blunt their beaks,
that they will be unable to hold
fast.</p>
                  <p>Here note, That any white Corn
is good for a Cock in his Walk, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56740:116"/>
so are white-bread tosts steeped in
drink, or man's urine, which will
both scowre and cool them inwardly.</p>
                  <p>Let not above three Hens walk
with your Cock, for should you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
more they will tread too much by
reason of the heat of their nature, and
by often treading they will cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

their strength, and become so debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated,
that though they have courage
enough, yet they have not strength to
perform their parts as they ought to
do in a battel.</p>
                  <p>Observe the crowing of your Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens;
if you find them crow too soon,
that is before six months old, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably,
and that their crowing is
clear and loud, fit them as soon as
you can for the Pot or Spit, for they
are infallible signs of cowardise and
falshood; on the contrary the true
and perfect Cock is long before he
obtains his voice, and when he hath
got it observes his hours with the best
judgment.</p>
                  <p>Suffer not your Cock to fight a
battel till he is compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in every member, and that is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56740:117"/>
when he is two years old; for to
fight him when his Spurs are but
warts comparatively, is no sign of
discretion, for you may then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
know his valour and courage, but
you cannot know his worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>In especial manner take care that
your Cocks roosting-Perch be not too
small in the gripe, or so ill placed
that he cannot sit without stradling,
or if it be crooked it is bad, for by
these means, a Cock will be uneven
heel'd, and consequently no good stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
and know that a Perch either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
or marreth a Cock; to remedy
or prevent such faults, is to have in
your roost a row of little Perches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eight inches in length, and ten
inches from the ground, that the Cock
may with more facility ascend, and
being up, is forced to keep his legs
near together; and here take notice
of this maxim amongst the best <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeders,
That the Cock which is a
close sitter, is ever a narrow striker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the footstool of the Perch be
round and smooth about the thickness
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56740:117"/>
of a mans arm, or if you will have
the best form for a Perch, go visit the
houses of the most skilful Cock-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and from them all gather what
is most necessary for your purpose by
making inspection into their feeding-pens
and other places; and let the
ground underneath the Perch be soft,
for otherwise when he leaps down, he
will be apt on a rough and hard
ground to hurt his feet, insomuch
that they will grow knotty and
gouty.</p>

                  <p>IN the dieting and ordering of a
Cock for Battail confisteth all the
substance of profit and pleasure; and
therefore your cunning Cock-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
are very cautious of divulging
the secrets (as they call them) of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting,
for on that depends the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or losing of the Battel, they
knowing very well that the best Cock
undieted is unable to encounter the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56740:118"/>
worst that is dyeted; let others be as
niggardly as they please of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and observations, for my part
I shall be free and scorn to conceal
any thing that may tend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the art and mystery of
Cock-fighting; wherefore as to the
dyeting and ordering of fighting
Cocks take these instructions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The time of taking up your Cocks
is about the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> for
from that time till the latter end of
<hi>May</hi> Cocking is seasonable and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
the Summer season being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
by reason of its great heat.</p>
                  <p>Having taken them up, view them
well, and see that they are sound,
hard feather'd, and full summ'd, that is
having all their feathers compleat, then
put them into several pens, having a
moving Perch therein, to set it at
which corner of the Perch you think
most convenient; the fashion and form
of these pens you may have at the
house of any Cocker, and therefore I
shall give you no directions how to
make them; only be advised to keep
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56740:118"/>
your Pens clean, and let not your
Cocks want either meat or water.</p>
                  <p>For the first four days after your
Cock is pend feed him with the crumb
of old Manchet cut into square bits
about a handful at a time, and feed
him thrice a day therewith, that is at
Sun-rising, when the Sun is in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
and at Sun-setting, and let his
water be from the coldest spring you
can get it.</p>
                  <p>Having fed your Cock thus four
days, or so long till you think he
hath purg'd himself of his corn, worms,
gravel, and other coarse feeding, then
in the morning take him out of the
Pen aud let him <hi>Sparr</hi> a while with
another Cock. <hi>Sparring</hi> is after this
manner: Cover each of your Cocks
heels with a pair of <hi>Hots</hi> made of
bombasted rolls of Leather, so cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spurs that they cannot bruise
or wound one another, and so setting
them down on straw in a room, or
green-grass abroad, let them fight a
good while, but by no means suffer
them to draw blood of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the benefit that accrues hereby
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56740:119"/>
is this, it heateth and chafeth their
bodies, and it breaketh the fat and
the glut that is within them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapts
it for purgation.</p>
                  <p>Having sparred as much as is sufficient,
which you may know when you see
them pant and grow weary, then take
them up, and taking off their <hi>Hots</hi>
give them a Diaphoretick or sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after this manner: You must put
them in deep straw-baskets made for
the purpose, or for want of them take
a couple of Cocking-bags and fill these
with straw half ways, then put in
your Cokcs severally, and cover them
over with straw to the top, then shut
down the lids and let them sweat; but
do not forget to give them first some
white Suger-candy, chopt Rosemary,
and Butter mingled and incorporated
together, let the quantity be about
the bigness of a Walnut, by so doing
you will cleanse him of his grease, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his strength, and prolong his
breath.</p>
                  <p>Towards four or five a clock in the
evening take them out of their Stoves,
and having lickt their eyes and head
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56740:119"/>
with your tongue, put them into
their Pens, and having filled their
Troughs with square-cut-manchet, piss
therein, and let them feed whilst the
Urine is hot; for this will cause
their scouring to work, and will
wonderfully cleanse both head and
body.</p>
                  <p>After this, diet your Cocks with a
Bread made after this manner: Of
Wheat-meal, and Oat-meal Flower,
take of each a Gallon, and knead them
into a stiff paste, with Ale, the whites
of half a score Eggs, and some Butter;
having wrought the Dow very well,
make it into broad thick Cakes, and
when they are four days old, cut them
into square pieces; I will not advise you
to use (as some imprudently do) Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorish,
Anniseeds, or rather hot
Spices among your foresaid Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
for they will make a Cork so hot
at the heart, that upon the concluding
of the Battel, he will be suffocated and
overcome with his own heat. In short,
that food is best which is most consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous
to his own natural feeding.</p>
                  <p>The second day after his <hi>sparring,</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:56740:120"/>
take your Cock into a fair green close,
and having a Dunghil-Cock in your
arms, show it him, and then run from
him, that thereby you may intice him
to follow, you permitting him to have
now and then a blow, and thus chace
him up and down abont half an honr;
when he begins to pant, being well
heated, take him up and carry him
home, and give him this scouring; take
half a pound of fresh Butter, and beat
it in a Mortar with the leaves of <hi>Herb
of Grace, Hysop</hi> and <hi>Rosemary,</hi> till they
all look like a green Salve, give him
thereof a piece as big as a Walnut, and
then stove him as aforesaid till evening,
and then feed him according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
prescription.</p>
                  <p>The next day let him feed and rest,
and spar him the next day after; thus
do every other day for the first fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
either <hi>sparring</hi> or <hi>chasing,</hi> and
after every heat a scowring, which will
keep him from being faint and pursie.</p>
                  <p>Feed him the second fortnight as
you did the first, but you must not <hi>spar</hi>
him or <hi>chase</hi> him above twice a week,
observing still, that if you heat him
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56740:120"/>
much, you must stove him long and
give him a greater quantity of scowring.
When well in breath, slight heats, small
scowrings, and little stoving will serve
the turn.</p>
                  <p>The third fortnight (which is a time
sufficient for ordering a Cock for the
Battel) you must feed him as aforesaid,
but you must not <hi>spar</hi> him at all for fear
of making his head sore, but you may
moderately chase him twice or thrice
in that time as aforesaid, then give him
his scowring rolled well in brown Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Candy
which will prevent the
scowring from making the Cock sick;
now may you let him fight, having
first let him rest four days, observing
that he come empty into the Pit.</p>

                  <head>The right way of Cock-matching.</head>
                  <p>OF all things have a special care
how you match your Cock; for
should you feed your Cock with
ever so much circumspect care and
prudence, it will avail nothing if your
Cock be over-matcht.</p>
                  <p>In matching, take notice of these
two things; first, the length of Cocks,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56740:121"/>
secondly, the strength of Cocks; for
the length, if your Adversaries Cock
be too long, yours shall hardly catch
his head, and so be incapable of indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
eye or life; and if he be the
stronger, he will overbear your Cock,
and not suffer him to rise or strike with
any advantage.</p>
                  <p>The length you may judg of by the
eye, when you gripe the Cock by the
waste, and make him shoot out his legs,
in which posture you shall see the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of his height, and so compare
them together, being herein governed
by your judgment, his strength is known
by the thickness of his body. Take
this for a Rule, <hi>That a Cock is ever
held the strongest, which is the largest
in the garth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You shall know the dimension of the
<hi>garth</hi> by the measure of your hands,
griping the Cock about from the points
of your great finger to the joynts of
your thumbs, and either of these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
by no means give your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary;
if you doubt loss in the one,
be sure to gain in the other: for the
week long Cock will rise at more ease,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56740:121"/>
and the short strong Cock will give the
surer blow.</p>

                  <p>SInce all Cocks are not cast in one
mould, the advantages on either
side must be reconciled by matching;
and having made an equal Match as
near as you can, you must thus prepare
him to fight:</p>
                  <p>First, with a pair of fine Cock-shears
cut all his main off close unto his neck,
from the head to the setting on of the
shoulders; Secondly, clip off all the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from the tail close to his rump, the
redder it appears the better is the Cock
in condition. Thirdly, take his wings
and spread them forth by the length of
the first rising feather, and clip the rest
slope-wise with sharp points, that in his
rising he may therewith endanger an
eye of his adversary. Fourthly, scrape,
smooth, and sharpen his Spurs with a
Pen-knife. Fifthly and lastly, see that
there be no feathers on the Crown of
his head for his adversary to take hold
of; then with your spittle, moistning his
head all over, turn him into the pit to
move his fortune.</p>

how to cure wounds.</head>
                  <p>THe battel being ended, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
search your Cocks wounds,
as many as you can find, suck the blood
out of them, then wash them well with
warm urine, and that will keep them
from ranckling; after this give him
a roll or two of your best scowring,
and so stove him up as hot as you can
for that night; in the morning, if you
find his head swell'd, you must suck
his wounds again, and bathe them again
with warm urine, then take the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of herb <hi>Robert,</hi> and put it into a
fine bag, and pounce his wounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
after this give him a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of bread to eat out of warm urine,
and so put him into the stove again,
and let him not feel the air till the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
be fallen.</p>
                  <p>If he hath received any hurt in his
eye, then take a leaf or two of right
ground Ivy, that which grows in little
tufts in the bottom of Hedges, and
hath a little rough leaf; I say, take this
Ivy and chew it in your mouth, and spit
the juice into the eye of the Cock, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56740:122"/>
this will not only cure the present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
but prevent the growth of Films,
Haws, Warts, or the like, destructive to
the eye-sight.</p>
                  <p>If after you have put out your woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Cocks to their Walks, and visiting
them a month or two after, if you
find about their head any swollen
bunches hard and blackish at one end,
you may then conclude in such bunches
there are unsound cores, which must be
opened and crusht out with your
thumbs; and after this, you must suck
out the corruption, and filling the holes
full of fresh Butter, you need not doubt
a Cure.</p>

                  <p>THE Pip is a white thin scale
growing on the tip of the tongue,
by which means Poultry in general
cannot feed, it is very visible to the eye,
and proceedeth from foul feeding or

known by the staring and turning back
of the feathers. For the cure, you must
pull away the feathers, and open the

the place with water and salt, the Cure
is effected.</p>
                  <p>If your Cock or Hen have the flux

                  <p>Lice is a common infirmity among

for wanting of hathing in Sand-Ashes

by taking Pepper beaten to powder, &amp;
mixing it with warm water, wash them
therewith. If they are troubled with
sore eyes, take a leaf or two of ground-Ivy,

spit the juice thereof into their eyes,
