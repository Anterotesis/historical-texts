            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS Upon ſome Paſſages in <hi>George Keith</hi>'s Third Narrative.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 2. HE recites ſome words of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> as if they were <hi>Haeretical,</hi> which are not only <hi>Inoffenſive,</hi> but ſuch as import the Profeſſion of that <hi>Faith,</hi> without which no Man can be <hi>Sanctified.</hi>
               <q>Again, in Anſwer to <hi>T. Smiths</hi> Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>Q.</hi> 43. When you tell us that ye have Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do you mean <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Perſon is now Aſcended into Heaven above the Clouds? Or do you mean only a <hi>Chriſt</hi> within you? <hi>G. W.</hi> replyeth. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here thou wouldſt make two <hi>Chriſts,</hi> a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Perſon is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Clouds, and a <hi>Chriſt</hi> within. But how proveſt thou two ſuch <hi>Chriſts?</hi> We have Faith in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> that Deſcended from The Father, who is The SAME that Aſcended far Above all Heavens, that He might Fill All things, and this CHRIST We Witneſs IN US, who is not divided.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 6. On theſe words, 'His HUMANE PERSON (Agreeable to the <hi>Haereſie</hi> of NESTORIUS) us'd by <hi>John Faldo, G. Keith</hi> hath this Note: <q>He means His Nature of Manhood, Perſonally United to his Godhead.</q>
Why Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109402:2"/>
of Manhood, and not the uſual words <hi>His Humane Nature?</hi> If <hi>G. K.</hi> would put ſo favourable a conſtruction on the Words of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as he does upon thoſe <hi>Haeretical</hi> words of <hi>John Faldo,</hi> the Bulk of his Narrative would ſhrivel into a very Narrow Compaſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 10. He recites theſe words of <hi>William Penn</hi>:
<q>The <hi>Seed of the Promiſe</hi> is an Holy and Spiritual Principle of <hi>Light, Life,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that being received into the Heart, bruiſeth the Serpents Head. And becauſe the <hi>Seed</hi> which cannot be that Body, is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as teſtifie the Scriptures, the <hi>Seed is one,</hi> and that <hi>Seed Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> GOD over all, Bleſſed for ever; we do conclude, and that moſt truly, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, and is the Divine Word of Light and Life, that was in the Beginning with GOD, and was, and is GOD over all Bleſſed for ever.</q>
'Tis Evident that when <hi>W. P.</hi> ſays, the Seed cannot be that Body, he means the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſidered Abſtractly from His <hi>Perſon or Eſſence which is Eternal.</hi> The SEED in the Language of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ſignifies The SON OF GOD, conſidered with reference to that Body which he Aſſum'd in the Womb of the Bleſſed VIRGIN. The reſt of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s words in this Place, contain a plain, and evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Faith in the SON of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 17. <hi>G. K.</hi> hath theſe words:
<q>Nor will <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> nor yet his Moderate, and Learned Church-man, their Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Excuſe <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> his Groſs Error, in thus Oppoſing by <hi>Socinian</hi> Arguments the God-head of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his Moderate Church-man is Idle, and Weak in granting the word Co-creating, and not Co-creator.</q>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Co-CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATING ſignifies there are More <hi>Creating,</hi> or who do <hi>Create,</hi> than One: Co-CREATOR ſignifies there are More CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATORS, than One: The firſt Saying I Approve, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I Abhor. <hi>The Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt are Co-creating,</hi> but ONE CREATOR. Whether I Deſerve the Epithets
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109402:2"/>
of <hi>Idle and Weak</hi>; or <hi>G. Keith</hi> of <hi>Proud and Inſolent,</hi> the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Pious Reader may Determine.</p>
            <p>In his Letter to <hi>G. W.</hi> He ſays that I take part with <hi>G. W.</hi> in his Vile Errors. I CHALLENGE GEORGE KEITH to Prove that I have Aſſerted any one Error, in any one of the ſeveral Papers that have been Publiſh'd for Me by the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> He would have the World to Believe that I am one of thoſe who call themſelves DEISTS, <hi>viz.</hi> who Deny that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the True and Eternal GOD. <hi>E. El.</hi> ſays he, by name, and ſome other Deiſts. Here he's Guilty of a moſt Notorious LYE: For he knows that I do moſt Earneſtly Profeſs the Belief of the <hi>God-head</hi> of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>That this Malitious Aſperſion may not in any meaſure ſtick on Me, I ſhall entreat the Learned Reader to Peruſe my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe entituled, <hi>DEI INCARNATI VINDICIAE,</hi> and my Paper againſt <hi>CRELLI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> I would have <hi>G. Keith</hi> to Know, that the <hi>Moderate Church-man</hi> moſt earneſtly Deſires, that both Himſelf and <hi>G. Keith</hi> may be ever Mindful of thoſe words of the Bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle: Let your MODERATION be known unto all Men. The LORD is at hand.</hi>
