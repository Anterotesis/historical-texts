            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>❀By the Queene. The Queenes Maiesties proclamation, declaring her Princelie intention to inhibit
her subiects vpon most extreme paines, from offending on the Seas: any persons in
their ships or goods, being the subiectes of any Prince, Potentate, or
State, in amitie with her Maiestie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Queenes Maiestie vnderstanding of some generall complaints made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
certeine of her subiects, that haue bene this last Summer on the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
seas, to recouer of the Spaniards recompence for the notable iniuries by
arrests and barbarous cruelties committed in Spaine and Portingall, against
a great number of her subiects, (wherof no remedy could euer be had by order of
iustice) as that they in seeking to recouer the proper goods of the Spaniards,
should there with or by colour thereof, take the ships and goods of diuers subiects
of other Princes and States being in amitie with her Maiestie: Thereupon
her Highnesse, as before time she had alwayes done, commanded not onely her
Councell, but namely such principall officers, as by their office had charge of her Ports, and her high Admirall,
and the officers of all marine causes, to cause the truth of these generall complaints to be heard and examined:
And if they were found true, to see both restitution and full recompence to be made to her frends subiects dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ed,
and the offendours to be punished as farre foorth as the nature of their offence might deserue. And since
that her Maiesties former commandement giuen, and due restitution made to as many as could be found iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grieued, though a great number of the complainants were found to haue had no iust cause of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
for that colourably many taking vpon them without warrant to be common factors, pretended title to
the goods that were prooued merely Spaniards: her Maiestie did lately vnderstand, that one ship, belonging to
the Uenetians, and one other ship, claimed to belong to some of the subiects of the grand duke of Tuscane, with
which Seignorie and Duke her Maiestie professeth to be in perfect good amitie, and doth repute them as her
most louing frends, should be taken on the seas, vpon the coast of Portingal, and brought into some of her Ports,
in the West part of her realme. Thereupon her Maiestie being inwardly mooued in affection of her amitie to
those States, gaue order to haue these latter causes not onely speedily to be examined, and redressed, if the same
were true, but also did giue commandement, afore examination could be had, in respect the parties complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
had not then any good proofes of the propertie of the goods, to haue the said vessels preserued with all their
goods and ladings: for which purpose there was choise made of such commissioners nere the Ports as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants
did name, whereby may appeare to the world, but specially to the Seignory of Uenice, and the grand
Duke of Tuscan, what regard was had by her Maiestie to shew all fauours to their subiects.</p>
            <p>And for further proofe of her Maiesties honorable &amp; frendly meaning in this case, and of the diligence vsed by
her Councell for the execution of her commandement, it is certeine that the ship of Uenice with her lading
is in safety. So as whatsoeuer can any wise be prooued to belong to the Uenetians, is speedily and without
charge to be deliuered: and the other ship clamed by the Florentines, though in very truth the same is knowen
to be English, and lately taken by Spaniards, is also in safety to be deliuered to the Owners, as by the law shall
be iudged, and the goods also, as farre foorth as they be extant: and such as were afore the complaint made, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, are either to be recouered, or recompence to be made by any that haue therein offended, contrarie to
special order prouided vpon bonds, that no person licenced to go to the seas, should at his returne with any prise,
breake any bulke, before the title to the goods were first examined in the Court of the Admiralty, and proued to
belong to the Spaniard. And for that purpose her Maiesty hath straitly charged, that the offendors in dispersing
any of the said goods of the Florentines, shall be apprehended, seuerely punished, and compelled to make full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
to the Owners. And so her Maiestie now commandeth, that whosoeuer shall heereafter breake any
bulke of the goods of any prise, (though the prise be lawfull) before the title thereto be allowed in the Court of
the Admiraltie, such offendour shall be imprisoned, and his ship with the prise also to be forfeited to her Maiesty,
whereby iustice may be done to all persons that haue iust cause of complaint. And like wise her Maiestie decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
her intention to be, and so commandeth it to be executed, that if any person whatsoeuer, shall vpon the
seas take any ships that doe belong to any subiects of her frends &amp; allies (with whom she is in amitie) and after
knowledge had that the said ships do belong to her frends, doe not forbeare to keepe them, or shall take out of
<pb facs="tcp:15881:2"/>
them any goods belonging to her said frends, the said persons so offending shall be reputed and tried as pirats,
and shall receiue the due punishment for piracy. And to the intent that all persons may vnderstand with what
conditions all persons seruing on the seas against the Spaniard, are licenced: her Maiestie hath commanded
that the very condition of the parties bonds that are licensed, should be annexed to this Proclamation, the
which being duely obserued, as her meaning is it should be, her Maiestie doubteth not but her actions shall be
thought consonant to honour, to iustice, and to the allowance of her frends and allies, leauing the false calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations
of her enemies, and the auenge of their wilfull disturbance of the common peace of Christendome,
for satisfying of their ambition, to the iudgement of Almightie God, to whose wisdome and power onely belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the chastisement of such as seeke for their owne ambition to confound the state of Christendome with
bloudy warres and depopulations of Christian countries, wherin they haue no interest. Giuen at her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
