            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An exact Relation of The laſt weekes paſſages in IRELAND. Dated from <hi>Dublin</hi> May 8. 1262.</head>
            <p>ON Tueſday Aprill 26 ſome foot and horſe of the Proteſtant Army, with two large braſſe pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſent againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Leſlep,</hi> and after ſome ſmall oppoſition, the enemy departed out at a backe way unknowne, and left the Caſtle to us; ſome Engliſh men were found dead, killed by the Rebels, being before priſoners unto them: When they were forced out of the Caſtle they burnt <hi>Leſlep</hi> Towne and many Proteſtant houſes. That day our men put a Garriſon into the Caſtle, and returned home to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 27, the Lord <hi>Foyle,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> with ſome horſe marcht from the <hi>Naas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> met them with ſome foot and peeces, who joyning Forces made about 400 horſe and 200 foot, and then marcht toward a place called <hi>Clancury,</hi> hanging ſome ſtraglers by the way; but about the foreſaid Towne were ſome 400 Rebels gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> thought of fighting, and drew out his men to that purpoſe, but theſe ſtood not, ſome few our men killed, with onely the loſſe of a boy ſtragling behind: So we marcht on toward Sir <hi>Luke Fitz Garret</hi> his Caſtle, and ſent for him, but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come, we then comming not ſo neere him as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65329:3"/>
was intended, marcht on to Caſtle <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sir <hi>Iohn Geffard,</hi> where we found much good hee had done to the whole Country, and in good time we relieved him, and that night the Commanders ſtaid with him: but billetted their men on Sir <hi>Lukes</hi> lands, who was well provided for conveniency; wee reſted all night quietly upon his land, though hee wiſht us further off.</p>
            <p>Alſo that day many Prieſts about 17 were ſeized and clapt up in prison.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 28 the Lord <hi>More</hi> came to us; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Troope of horſe, having ſome few dayes before gone out of <hi>Tredath,</hi> and dared the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the <hi>Navan,</hi> killed and hanged ſome ſtraggling Rogues, nere 250. the maine body of them would not ſtand. That day we had ſome foot and horſe went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a place called <hi>Bray,</hi> where they heard the Rebels to be buſie, ſome few they hanged, and brought 11 priſoners tooke in a boat at Sea to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That day alſo we ſet forward to <hi>Philips</hi> Towne, and tooke in the way a Fort of the Rebels called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liboging</hi> with little trouble, they being given to run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wee hanged ſome ſtragglers ſtill as wee went, as we did every day, towards 9 a clocke in the morning we entred <hi>Philips</hi> Towne with ſome oppoſition, but much in the Caſtle wherein were placed 70 Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers who withſtood us valiantly, but in vaine, for we got it after two houres fight, 30 of them killed and the reſt taken by us and hanged, and their Conſtable of the Caſtle, among the reſt one <hi>Conyars:</hi> Wee hanged many of the Towne, alſo in the Towne is a paſſage made by Art over a Bog, able to keepe many men out with few, and no other way of paſſage towards
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65329:3"/>
the Queenes County, but much about; having taken it, we left ſome there to garde it, and paſſed preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward Caſtle <hi>Gaſell</hi> without oppoſition, for all their brags, onely hagning ſtragglers, with much joy were wee in that Caſtle received, which hath beene drawne to many ſtraights, but having relieved it wee returned backe to <hi>Philips</hi> Towne, as being the ſafeſt place where wee ſtaid all night, and in the morning burnt the Towne and departed to the noble Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to Caſtle <hi>Iordan</hi> againe; going within musket ſhot of Sir <hi>Lukes</hi> Caſtle, but he would not be ſeene, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did oppoſe us, that night we ſtayed with Sir <hi>John,</hi> and did to Sir <hi>Luke</hi> as before, which he tooke patiently becauſe he could not helpe it.</p>
            <p>Friday the 29 having relieved Sir <hi>John,</hi> wee bent our courſe toward <hi>Trim,</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> with his men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying of us 5 miles, and returned to his charge, leaving <hi>Trim</hi> to us: after we had parted with him, we met with a man which Sir <hi>Charles</hi> preſt to know how <hi>Trim</hi> was in ſtrength, which for feare of hanging hee confeſt to have no leſſe then 4000 in it, and 4 Lords of the Pale alſo, and that <hi>Navan</hi> had 7000, ſome were thinking theſe too many to incounter, but Sir <hi>Charles</hi> words were 30000 ſhould not keepe him from attempting to take the Towne, and ſo marched on, and when thoſe in the Towne perceived Sir <hi>Charles</hi> reſolution by their Scouts, when Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was within a mile of <hi>Trim,</hi> all theſe foreſaid mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betooke themſelvs to their heeles, leaving onely a few women and children, and the Towne to us. Sir <hi>Charles</hi> entred the place and went on to purſue them, killed ſome of the Reare of them, and there a bullet paſt vvithin three inches of his throat, but miſt him,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65329:4"/>
but the greater part of the Rebels vvith their nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heeles vvhich is their advantage, out-vvent us, and got to the <hi>Navan</hi> and ſet fire of the Suburbs of it themſelves, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> returned tovvard night to the Tovvne vvhere hee novv is, and the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> ſent newes of it to <hi>Dublin,</hi> deſiring more ſtrength to purſue the victory, with theſe merry words, that ſeeing he muſt at laſt dye in the field, hee might kill as many as he could before that time of them, who arrived in <hi>Dublin</hi> to doe his arrant.</p>
            <p>In this exepdition at <hi>Philips</hi> Towne and <hi>Trim</hi> were redeemed forty and more Engliſh priſoners and fired each day many places.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 30. ſome of our men ſcattered out without leave, to plunder ſome of the Enemies horſe, who fell foule on them being few, ſlew foure of our horſe-men, not above five being there, and killed ſome Carmen, in all Souldiers and others ſome twenty.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt one <hi>Marham</hi> a Vintner, <hi>Clavells</hi> wives father, and this way have we loſt more in ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then in Battell.</p>
            <p>This day we heard out of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident was indifferent well recovered, and had with Sir <hi>Thomas Vavaſor</hi> chaſed the Lord <hi>Muſery,</hi> and gave him an overthrow and burnt a part of his Country.</p>
            <p>On Monday the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> we had newes, the Engliſh under the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> marcht towards the <hi>Newry,</hi> and the Scots to the reliefe of <hi>Coulerand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tueſday the third we had newes brought, that the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> on the one ſide, and Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> on the other had taken the <hi>Newry,</hi> but as yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubtfull how, either by fiight or the Enemies flying that it was taken, which make ſome doubt of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65329:4"/>
the truth of it, but little hope can the Enemy have in holding of it: more of this next weeke: but it is from a friend who ſent ſuch word from <hi>Tredoth,</hi> but it was not taken ſo ſoone as you could heare it in <hi>London,</hi> as many Letters ſay from thence.</p>
            <p>This day at ten clock of came a Trooper &amp; Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and Lord <hi>Foyle,</hi> that they had fired a great part of the Country, had relieved Caſtle Gaſſell, had deſtroyed <hi>Philips</hi> Towne, a ſtrong Towne and a bad paſſage, and had in their returne home tooke the Caſtle and Towne of <hi>Trim,</hi> one of the places of moſt ſtrength the Enemy had in thoſe parts, have delivered many priſoners out of <hi>Trim</hi> and <hi>Philips</hi> Towne, brought by the Enemy out of the North to be kept priſoners: this was an exceeding peece of ſervice beyond our thought till we heard of it; in <hi>Trim</hi> were foure Lords of the Pale that delivered themſelves by their legs by running away; there is Sir <hi>Charles</hi> now placing a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, it makes the old Sir <hi>Charles</hi> young againe to ſee God ſo bleſſe him in his enterpriſes, but indeed moſt ſincerely hath he gon on without by-reſpects, which is too much in ſome, and which daily doth us great harme. They hanged and killed ſome 200. or more, but the reſt fled toward the Navan, and for feare our men ſhould follow them, burnt that Towne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and fled, as having no heart to ſtand.</p>
            <p>On the fourth day ſome Troops went to Sir <hi>Charles</hi> cut to <hi>Trim,</hi> to ſtrengthen him there; where hee is fortifying it, intending to proſecute his Victory forward while they are flying, and to take the Caſtle of Navan, which they as yet keepe.</p>
            <p>Alſo this day had we two Church-yards new made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65329:5"/>
without the City, for ſuch dying there is amongſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, nay I dare ſay, twenty for one kill'd, moſt for want; this day in the morning were they Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, our Church-yards in the City are able to hold more.</p>
            <p>On the fifth day the Lord <hi>Moore</hi> departed to <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath,</hi> with two Troopes of Horſe.</p>
            <p>I am now call'd away in ſuch haſte, that I cannot ſtay to write the reſt, till the next weeke I reſt,</p>
