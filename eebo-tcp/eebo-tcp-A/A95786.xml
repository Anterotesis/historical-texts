            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is declared in the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> of the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> cap. 29. <hi>That no
Free-man ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or be diſſeiz'd of his Free-hold, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
or Free Cuſtomes; or be outlaw'd, or exil'd, or any other way deſtroyed; Nor any
Sentence paſſe upon him, nor condemn'd but by lawfull Iudgment of his Peers, or by the Law
of the land: And that juſtice, or right, ſhall be ſold, deny'd, or deferr'd, to no man:</hi> Which
ſaid Charter (obtain'd by the vaſt expence of the wealth and blood of this moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Nation) hath been confirm'd by two and thirty ſeverall Acts of the Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>England;</hi> explain'd, and inlarg'd, in the <hi>Petition of Right, 3. Car'.</hi> From time
to time aſſerted by this preſent Parliament, as <hi>the onely foundation of all Government;
and ever heretofore entruſted, and of late frequently avowed to be maintained accordingly</hi>
(and ſo ſecured, cannot be altered) <hi>by all the Power and Authority of the whole Kingdome
of England:</hi> But nevertheleſſe for the advancement of ſelf-ends, hath been, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is invaded; he ordinary courſe of Juſtice obſtructed, or partially diſpenſed; Our
Poſſeſſions every day more and more ſeiz'd on, ſurcharg'd, and drain'd; till at laſt this
whole Nation do become a prey to the <hi>avarice</hi> and <hi>ambition</hi> of a <hi>prevailing Faction;</hi>
whoſe unſetled condition, (notwithſtanding all pretences of eaſing our preſent <hi>grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
wherewith we have heretofore been too frequently deluded) cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt,
but by the exerciſe of a boundleſſe power over the people, and their proper intereſts:</p>
            <p>

our eyes, but the fear of God, the honour of our Country, the love of our own, and of the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Not reflecting upon the particular deſignes, of any ſelf-ended party; Nor fearing, or ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
