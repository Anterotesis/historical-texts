            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF CHARITY In reference to Other mens SINS. By <hi>JOHN HOWE,</hi> Minister of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LONDON:</hi> Printed for <hi>Tho. Parkhurst,</hi> at the Bible and three Crowns in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> near <hi>Mercers Chappel.</hi> 1681.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:48670:2"/>
            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>A Proposal was made to me, by some friends, for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Papers; which I cannot doubt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <hi>Charity,</hi> both to the <hi>Reader,</hi> whose good they intended in it; and to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> that they could think so slender a performance was
<pb facs="tcp:48670:3"/>
capable of serving it.</p>
            <p>I cannot, indeed, think it unseasonable, to take any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of recommending <hi>Charity,</hi> tho' <hi>this subject</hi> led me only to consider <hi>one single instance of it.</hi> But if the practice of it, in <hi>this one,</hi> would redress <hi>so great an evil,</hi> what might we not expect from its <hi>universal exercise,</hi> in all cases upon which it might have influence?</p>
            <p>Even <hi>the tongues of men and angels,</hi> as <hi>(with our Apostle)</hi> they are insufficient to <hi>supply its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi> so nor are they more than
<pb facs="tcp:48670:3"/>
sufficient, fully to <hi>represent its worth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We vainly expect, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>eloquence,</hi> or <hi>disputation,</hi> the good effects, which <hi>Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> (could it take place) would easily bring about without them.</p>
            <p>How laboriously do we beat our way in the dark! <hi>We grope for the wall, like the blind, and we grope, as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day, as in the night;</hi> but <hi>the way of peace we have not known:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humane wit</hi> is stretch't to
<pb facs="tcp:48670:4"/>
the uttermost; wherein that comes short, the rest is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be supply'd by <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> And all to bring us under <hi>one form,</hi> which either will not be; or, if it were, could be to little purpose; while, in the mean time, this <hi>more excellent way is forgotten of our foot,</hi> and we are far from it. Which shews, it is <hi>God</hi> that must cure us <hi>(the God of love and peace),</hi> and not <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How soon, and easily would a <hi>mutual universal Charity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress all? For being <hi>on one side</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48670:4"/>
               <hi>only,</hi> it could never cement <hi>both.</hi> And <hi>limited only to a party,</hi> it is not <hi>it self,</hi> and acts <hi>against it self, divides</hi> what it should <hi>unite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a <hi>genuine, equally diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Charity,</hi> how would it melt down mens minds, mollifie their rigors, make high things low, crooked straight, and rough places plain?</p>
            <p>It would certainly, either disposemen to agree upon <hi>one way of common order,</hi> or make them feel very little inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, or cause of offence in <hi>some variety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48670:5"/>
But <hi>without it,</hi> how little would the most exquisite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable <hi>form</hi> (universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comply'd with, in every punctilio) contribute to the <hi>Churches</hi> welfare? No more to its quiet, and repose, than an elegant, well shap'd garment, to the ease, and rest of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted, ulcerous body. Nor longer preserve it, than the fair skin of a dead mans body would do <hi>that,</hi> from putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and dissolution.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Piety</hi> is to our union with God, that is <hi>Charity</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:48670:5"/>
our union with one another. But we are too apt, <hi>as to both,</hi> to expect from the <hi>outward form,</hi> what only the <hi>internal living principle</hi> can give; to <hi>covet</hi> the one with a sort of fondness, and <hi>deny</hi> the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One common external form</hi> in the Church of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all good men could agree, were a most amiable thing, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry useful to its <hi>comely, better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the want of it hath <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,</hi> and doth <hi>threaten</hi> evils, much to be <hi>deplor'd,</hi> and <hi>depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</hi> But <hi>this divine principle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48670:6"/>
is most simply necessary <hi>to its very being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsoever violates it, is the <hi>most destructive mortal schism,</hi> as much worse than an unwilling breach of outward order, as the malicious tearing in peices a mans living body, is worse than accidental renting his cloaths</p>
            <p>And indeed, were <hi>our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical contests,</hi> about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that I could think <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> as long as there is such a thing, as distinction of Parties, I should readily choose <hi>that,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48670:6"/>
where were most of <hi>sincere Charity</hi> (if I knew where that were). For since our <hi>Saviour himself</hi> gives it us, as the <hi>cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance</hi> of <hi>Christians (by this shall all men know ye are my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if ye love one another),</hi> I know not how better to judg of <hi>Christianity,</hi> than by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor know I where, among them that profess, there is less of <hi>either,</hi> than with them that would confine, and engross <hi>both</hi> to their own several Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that say, <hi>here is Christ,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:48670:7"/>
               <hi>there he is;</hi> and will have the notions of <hi>Christian,</hi> of <hi>Saint,</hi> of <hi>Church,</hi> to extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their own arbitrarily assigned limits, or than, as they are pleased to describe their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
            <p>We know to whom the doing so, hath been long im puted; and it were well, if they had fewer sorts of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it savour more of <hi>uncharitableness</hi> in any, to think of <hi>enclosing</hi> the <hi>truth, and purity</hi> of Religion, only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:48670:7"/>
their own Precincts, than it doth of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they can exclude thence, every thing of <hi>offensive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are never like to want occasions, <hi>even in in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> of exercising Charity. Not to <hi>palliate</hi> the <hi>sins</hi> of any, but <hi>recover sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God grant we may <hi>use it more,</hi> to this purpose (when the case so requires) and <hi>need it less.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Subject</hi> spoken of, must be suppli'd from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Verses;</hi> where we find the Matter all along, in discourse, is <hi>Charity:</hi> which it is the principal business of the <hi>whole Chapter</hi> to <hi>describe,</hi> and <hi>praise.</hi> And this is one of the <hi>Characters</hi> that serve (as they all do) to do both these at once. For being <hi>in it self</hi> a thing of so great excellency, To shew its true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to praise it. What soever is its <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al property,</hi> is, also, <hi>its commendation.</hi>

Our business here must be,</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To demonstrate the One of the Other; Or (which is all one) to shew the inconsistency between <hi>that divine principle,</hi> and <hi>this horrid pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>

            <p>Upon which the Use of this piece of Christian Doctrine will ensue.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to give some account both of this Principle, the <hi>Charity</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here treats of, and of the <hi>practice</hi> which the Text denies of it, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in iniquity.</hi>

               <hi>love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. <hi>That</hi> of the <hi>latter</hi> is this other <hi>which is like</hi> unto it, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> Upon which two we are told <hi>hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
            <p>The instances which are given in this Chapter, refer to <hi>man</hi> as the object, and shew that it is the <hi>love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> which is meant.</p>
            <p>But tho' it be <hi>so far humane,</hi> it is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever upon other accounts a real part of <hi>divine love;</hi> which we see 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17. that Apostle speaking even of love to <hi>our brother: Whoso hath this worlds goods, and seeth his brother hath need, and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up the bowels of compassion from him,</hi> demands, <hi>How dwelleth the love of God in that man?</hi> And <hi>David</hi> call'd the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he intended the Relicts of <hi>Sauls</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <hi>the kindness of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 9. 3.</p>
            <p>This part of love is divine both in respect of its <hi>original,</hi> and of somewhat considerable in its <hi>object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of its original.</hi> 'Tis a part of the <hi>(communicated) divine nature,</hi> from whence they that partake of it, are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48670:10"/>
said to be <hi>born of God.</hi> It is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with <hi>faith in the Messiah,</hi> and <hi>love to God himself,</hi> which are both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that <hi>birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as it is said in the Gospel of <hi>John,</hi> chap. 1. 12, 13. That <hi>as many as received him,</hi> (viz. Christ) <hi>to them he gave power to be call'd the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> And in his 1 Epist. chap. 5. 1. <hi>Whosoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God.</hi> So it is, in this latter place, immediately added as the double property of this <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine production</hi> (not more separable from one another than from it), <hi>and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon also from the in-being and exercise of <hi>this love,</hi> (tho' towards an object that seems very heterogeneous and of much another kind) we come to bear the name of <hi>Gods children. Love your enemies—that you may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your father which is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 44, 45. The <hi>Law</hi> indeed of <hi>love</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48670:10"/>
               <hi>to other men,</hi> tho' it oblige to love some above others <hi>upon a special reason,</hi> yet in its utmost latitude, comprehends all mankind under the name of <hi>neighbour</hi> or <hi>brother,</hi> as the particular precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it do sufficiently shew. Which surely leave us not at liberty to kill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, rob, slander, or covet from others, than the regenerate (as we count) or our own friends and relatives.</p>
            <p>Now that Principle from which we are called <hi>Gods children,</hi> must be of <hi>divine original;</hi> for it is not spoken of them <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually,</hi> but <hi>as their distinguishing Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</hi> So that, <hi>in this respect,</hi> they are said to be <hi>of God.</hi> It is their very difference from the children of another, and the worst of fathers, 1 Joh. 3. 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifest, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devil; Whosoever doth not righteousness, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which also shews it is not <hi>universilly all love,</hi> unto which this dignity belongs. Some more noble-minded Pagans that were wont to ascribe <hi>divinity</hi> unto love, have also carefully distinguished, and told
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48670:11"/>
us of a love that was genuine, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that was spurious; <hi>the one akin to virtue,</hi> the <hi>other to vice;</hi> and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it as an abusive error of the Vulgar <hi>to give the same name to God and a Disease.</hi> The <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Max. Tyr. Dissert.</note> 
               <hi>of love,</hi> is indeed less than humane; but the <hi>first being,</hi> and <hi>restored rectitude</hi> of it, is of an <hi>original</hi> no less than divine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And even this love, tho' placed upon man, is <hi>divine</hi> too in respect of <hi>its object,</hi> i. e. of somewhat we have to consider in it, which is most <hi>properly and strictly</hi> the object, or the inducement and <hi>formal reason why we love. God is</hi> the <hi>Primum amabile,</hi> the <hi>first Goodness</hi> as well as the <hi>first Being.</hi> As therefore there is <hi>no being,</hi> so nor is there any <hi>goodness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mability,</hi> or <hi>loveliness,</hi> which is not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him. We love any thing more <hi>truly and purely,</hi> the more <hi>explicitely</hi> we acknowledg and love God in it. Upon the view of those stroaks and lineaments of the <hi>divine pulchritude,</hi> and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his Glory, which are discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all his creatures, our love should
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48670:11"/>
be someway commensurate with the Creation, and comprehend the Universe in its large and complacential embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Tho' as any thing is of <hi>higher excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> and hath more lively touches and resemblances of God upon it; or, by the disposition of his Providence, and Law, <hi>more nearly approaches us,</hi> and is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately presented to our <hi>notice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, use,</hi> or <hi>enjoyment,</hi> so our love is to be exercised towards it <hi>more explicitely,</hi> in an <hi>higher degree,</hi> or <hi>with more frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> As <hi>man</hi> therefore hath more in him of divine resemblance, of Gods <hi>natural likeness and image; good m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> of his <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, holy image,</hi> we ought to love <hi>men</hi> more than the inferior creatures; and those that are <hi>good and holy,</hi> more than other men; and those with whom we are more concern'd, with a more <hi>definite love,</hi> and which is required to be <hi>more frequent in its exercise.</hi> But all from the attractive of <hi>somewhat divine</hi> appearing in the object. So that all rational love, or that is capable of being regulated and measured by a Law, is only so far right
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48670:12"/>
in its own kind, as we love God in every thing, and every thing upon his account, and for his sake.</p>
            <p>The nature and spirit of man is, by the apostacy, become disaffected and strange to God, alienated from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life, addicted to a <hi>particular limited good,</hi> to the creature <hi>for it self,</hi> apart from God; whereupon the things men love, are <hi>their</hi> idols, and their love ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. But where, by regeneration, a due propension towards God is restored, The <hi>universal good</hi> draws their minds, they become inclined and enlarged towards it; and as that is diffused, their love fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, and flows towards it every where. They love all things principally in and for God; and therefore such men most, as excel in goodness, and in whom the divine image more brightly shines.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is, most especially, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity</hi> that is here meant, <hi>i. e.</hi> which works towards <hi>Christians as such.</hi> For compare <hi>this</hi> with the <hi>foregoing Chapter,</hi> and it will appear <hi>that Charity</hi> is treated of <hi>in this,</hi> which is the vital bond of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living union in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48670:12"/>
               <hi>supposed in the other.</hi> Whereby <hi>as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that body being many, are one body; so also is Christ,</hi> v. 12.</p>
            <p>This principle refined, rectifi'd, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of its state of degeneracy, and now obtaining in the soul as a part of the <hi>new creature,</hi> or the <hi>new man which is after God,</hi> as it hath man for its object more especially, and more or less accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what there appears <hi>of divine</hi> in him, is the <hi>charity</hi> here spoken of.</p>
            <p>Now of this <hi>Divine Charity</hi> it is said (which we are to consider</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the second place) <hi>it rejoyces not in iniquity.</hi> Hereof it cannot be needful to say much by way of Explication. The thing carries a prodigious appearance with it; and it might even amaze one to think, that on this side Hell, or short of that state, wherein the malignity of wickedness attains its highest pitch, any appearance should be found of it.</p>
            <p>Yet we cannot think, but these <hi>Elogies</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> do imply <hi>reprehensions,</hi> and tacitely insinuate too great a proneness to this worst sort of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48670:13"/>
in evil. The <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (or the Sect afterwards, known by that Name) gave already too great occasion for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more express, and sharp reproofs of this temper; which were not thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, or meant to <hi>no body.</hi> The Scripture saith not in vain, <hi>the spirit which is in us lusteth to envy.</hi> With which, what affinity this disposition hath, we shall have occasion to note anon.</p>
            <p>Rejoycing in iniquity, may be taken (if we abstract from limiting circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) two ways.</p>

               <hi>Other mens;</hi> when 'tis counted a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sight, becomes matter of mirth and sport, to see another stab at once the Christian name, and his own soul.</p>
            <p>The scope and series of the Apostles
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48670:13"/>
discourse, doth here plainly determine it this latter way: For as <hi>Charity</hi> (the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his whole discourse) respects <hi>other men;</hi> so must <hi>this contrary Disposition</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. <hi>De iniquitate procul dubio aliena,</hi> &amp;c. saith <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon this place. 'Tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, unapt to rejoyce in the sins of other men; for neither can it endure ones own.</p>
            <p>And this aptness to rejoice in the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of others, may be upon several ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>It may either proceed<list>
                  <item>From <hi>an affection to their sins.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>From <hi>an undue self love:</hi> Or,</item>
                  <item>From <hi>an excessive dis-affection to the persons offending.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From a great affection, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the same kind of sins, which they observe in others. Whereupon they are glad of their Patronage; and do therefore <hi>not only do such things, but take pleasure in them that do them, Rom.</hi> 1. Men are too prone to justifie themselves by the <hi>example of others,</hi> against their <hi>common</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48670:14"/>
               <hi>rule. Others take their liberty, and why may not I?</hi> And so they go (as <hi>Seneca</hi> says sheep do), <hi>non quà eundum est, sed quà i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> the way which is trodden, not which ought to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From an undue, and over-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent love of themselves. Whence it is, that (as the case may be) they take pleasure to think there are some men, that perhaps outdo them in wickedness, and offend in some grosser kind than they have done: And so they have, they count, a grateful occasion, not only to <hi>justify</hi> themselves, that they are not worse than other men, but to <hi>magnify</hi> themselves, that they are not so bad; as the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi> in his pompous hypocritical devotion, <hi>God, I thank thee</hi> (that attribution to God, being only made a colour of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating more plausibly to himself) <hi>that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. whereby the <hi>hypocrite,</hi> while he would <hi>extol,</hi> doth but the more notoriously <hi>stigmatize</hi> himself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From a dis-affection they bare to the offenders; whence they are glad of an advantage against them: That they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48670:14"/>
have occasion to <hi>glory in their flesh,</hi> and insult over their <hi>weakness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be <hi>that rejoycing in other mens sins,</hi> which is most contrary to <hi>Charity,</hi> that is here more especially meant: And <hi>that</hi> is manifestly the <hi>last</hi> of these; such as proceeds from <hi>ill will</hi> to the person that offends: Whereupon we are glad of his <hi>halting</hi> (which perhaps we <hi>watched for</hi> before), <hi>and when his foot s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Secret,</hi> when only the <hi>heart feels</hi> an inward complacency, and is sensibly grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Open,</hi> when that inward pleasure breaks forth into external expressions of triumph, and insultation, into derision, scoffs, and sarcasms.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And how inconsistent this is with the <hi>Charity</hi> which our <hi>Apostle</hi> so highly magnifies, it is now our next business to shew. And it will appear, by comparing this <hi>rejoycing in other mens sins.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Consider <hi>Charity in its own nature:</hi> And so it is <hi>the loving one another as my self,</hi> so as to desire his welfare and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as my own: Where we must note, that <hi>love to our selves,</hi> is the <hi>measure</hi> of the <hi>love we owe to others.</hi> But yet are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to consider, that this <hi>measure it self,</hi> is to be <hi>measured:</hi> For we are not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our love to others, by the love we bear to our selves, otherwise, than as that also agrees with our <hi>superior rule;</hi> which obliges us so to love our selves, as to design, and seek our own <hi>true felicity,</hi> and <hi>best good:</hi> To <hi>lay hold on eternal life,</hi> to <hi>work out our own salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48670:15"/>
If in other Instances, we were not so to understand the matter (since the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular precepts extend no farther than the general one), any man might, without transgression, destroy another mans goods, when he hath learn't to be prodigal of what he is Master of himself: and might make himself Master of another mans life, whensoever he cares not for his own. And so by how much more profligately wicked any man is, he should be so much the less a transgressor.</p>
            <p>We are not so absolutely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or so much our own, that we may do what we will with our selves. We are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him that made us, for our usage of our selves: And <hi>in making our selves miserable,</hi> make our selves <hi>deeply guilty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</hi> We were made with a possibility of being happy. He that made us with souls capable of a blessed state, will exact an account of us, what we have done with <hi>his creature.</hi> He that commits a <hi>felony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own life,</hi> injures his <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Community</hi> to which he belongs. The <hi>one</hi> is rob'd of a <hi>subject,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of a <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> that might be useful: wherein both
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48670:16"/>
had a right. No man is made for himself. And therefore the fact is animadverted on, and punisht as far as is possible in what remains of the offendor, <hi>in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,</hi> from whom his goods are confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; <hi>in his name,</hi> which bears a mark of infamy, and is made a publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. How unspeakably greater is the wrong done to the common Ruler of the whole world, when a soul destroys it self! loses its possibility of praising and glorifying him eternally in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation and communion of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory! <hi>How great</hi> to the glorious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Saints and Angels! From whom he factiously withdraws himself, and who (tho' that loss be recompenc't to them by their satisfaction in the just venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which the offended God takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the disloyal apostate Wretch) were to have pleas'd and solac't themselves in <hi>his joint felicity</hi> with <hi>their own.</hi> So that he hath done what in him lay, to make them miserable, and even to turn Heaven into a place of mourning and lamentation.</p>
            <p>The Supreme primary Law under which we all are, obliges us to be happy.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48670:16"/>
For it binds us <hi>to take the Lord only for our God. To love him with all our hearts, and minds, and souls, and strength.</hi> And so to <hi>love</hi> him, is to <hi>enjoy him,</hi> to <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>acquiesce</hi> finally, and ultimately in him; and satisfie our selves for ever in his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: So that every man is rebellious in being miserable, and that even against the first, and most deeply fundamental Law of his Creation. Nor can he love God <hi>in obedience to that Law,</hi> without loving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self aright. Which love to himself, is then to be the measure of the love he is to bear to other men: And so most truly it is said, that <hi>Charity begins at home.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ought to seek his own true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and then to desire anothers as his own.</p>
            <p>But now consider, what we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare herewith. <hi>Rejoycing in the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men,</hi> how contrary is it to the most inward nature! to the pure Essence! how directly doth it strike at the very heart and soul, the life and spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!</p>
            <p>For sin is the greatest, and highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity of the Creature; Depraves the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48670:17"/>
soul within it self, vitiates its powers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms its beauty, extinguisheth its light, corrupts its purity, darkens its glory, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs its tranquillity, and peace, violates its harmonious joyful state, and order, and destroys its very life.</p>
            <p>It disaffects it to God, severs it from him, engages his Justice, and inflames his wrath against it.</p>
            <p>What is it now to rejoyce in another man's sin? Think what it is, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it is to be where the love of God hath any place. What? to be glad that such a one is turning a man into a Devil! A reasonable immortal soul, capable of Heaven, into a Fiend of Hell! To be glad that such a soul is tearing it self off from God, is blasting its own eternal hopes, and destroying all its possibilities of a future well-being! Blessed God! How repugnant is this to Charity?</p>

            <p>Which <hi>connexion</hi> of <hi>these now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,</hi> with <hi>Charity,</hi> we shall see as to each of them severally; and, at the same time, their <hi>inconsistency</hi> with this vile temper and practice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Prudence,</hi> it is so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48670:20"/>
nearly ally'd to Charity, that it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the same name, Jam. 3. 17. <hi>The wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaccable, gentle,</hi> &amp;c. The foregoing words, (v. 16.) shew <hi>Love</hi> is meant. <hi>These words</hi> represent the <hi>heavenly descent,</hi> and the <hi>true nature</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> both together. That it is called <hi>Wisdom,</hi> shews <hi>its affinity</hi> with it, and that it partakes of its <hi>nature;</hi> dwells in a calm sedate mind, void of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting passions and perturbations, which it is the work of Wisdom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and expel. Indeed <hi>the name</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly intended to express, generally, the <hi>temper,</hi> the <hi>genius,</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of one that is born from above, and is tending thither. The <hi>contrary temper,</hi> a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>strise, envy,</hi> or <hi>grief</hi> for the good of another (which naturally turns into joy, for his evil, when his case alters) is called <hi>Wisdom</hi> too, but with sufficiently <hi>distinguishing</hi> and <hi>disgracing</hi> additions. It is said, vers. 15. not to be <hi>from above,</hi> but <hi>earthly, sensual, devilish;</hi> And to have the <hi>contrary effects;</hi> where <hi>envying</hi> and <hi>strise</hi> is, there is <hi>confusion</hi> (Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult the word signifies, or <note place="margin">

disorder, unquietness, disagreement of a man with himself, as if his soul were pluckt asunder, torn from it self) <hi>and every evil work,</hi> vers. 16.</p>
            <p>There can be no charity towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (as hath been noted) where there is not first a true love to a mans own soul, which is the immediate measure of it. Nor <hi>that,</hi> where there is not <hi>prudence</hi> to discern his own <hi>best good,</hi> and what means are to be used to attain it. His <hi>true good</hi> he is not to expect <hi>apart by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> but as a <hi>member of the Christian community.</hi> Not of this or that party, but <hi>the whole animated body</hi> of Christ. <hi>In which capacity</hi> he shares in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon felicity of the whole, and affects to draw as many as he can, into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and participation of it. So he enjoys, <hi>as a member of that body,</hi> a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and repose within himself. But is undone <hi>in himself,</hi> while he bears a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected mind to the true interest and welfare of the body.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to rejoyce in what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to it, is contrary to <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> both at once. <hi>Put on,</hi> saith
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48670:21"/>
the Apostle <hi>(as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindness, bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things, put on</hi> Charity, <hi>which is the</hi> bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>And let the</hi> peace of God <hi>rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called</hi> in one body. Implying no true peace or satisfaction can be had, but in vital uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the body.</p>
            <p>Is he a <hi>wise,</hi> or is he not a <hi>mad</hi> man, that rejoyces he hath an unsound hand or foot, or an ulcerated finger, or toe rotting off from him? or that is glad a Fire or the Plague is broken out in the Neighbourhood, that equally endangers his own house and family, yea and his own life?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>devotedness</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> is most conjunct with <hi>true charity. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Joh. 5. 2. For the true reason of our love to the one, is fetcht from the other,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48670:21"/>
as hath been shewn. And how absurd were it to pretend love to a Christian upon Christs account, and for his sake, while there is no love to Christ himself? But can it consist with such love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedness to God, to be glad at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affronted by the sin of any man? Or to Christ, whose design it was <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity,</hi> and <hi>to bless us, in turning us away from our iniquities;</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the iniquity that obstructs, and tends to frustrate his design? Do we not know he was <hi>for this end manifested, to destroy the works of the Devil?</hi> And that the works of wickedness are his works? Do we not know, the great God is, in, and by our Redeemer, maintaining a War against the Devil, and the subjects of his Kingdom; in which Warfare, what are the Weapons, on the Devils part, but sins? Who but sinners his Souldiers? And who is there of us, but professes to be on Gods part in this War? Can it stand with our duty, &amp; fidelity to him, to be glad that any are foiled, who profess to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Banner? What would be thought of him, who, in battel, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48670:22"/>
to see those of his own side <hi>fall,</hi> here one, and there one? He would surely be counted either treacherous, or mad.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Charity</hi> of the right kind, is most certainly connected with <hi>Purity. The end</hi> (or perfection) <hi>of the commandment</hi> (or of all our commanded obedience), is <hi>Charity,</hi> out of a <hi>pure</hi> heart, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Sincere Christians, are such as have purify'd their souls, <hi>in obeying the truth through the spirit,</hi> unto unfeigned love of the brethren; and must see, that they love one another with a pure heart, <hi>fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pagans</hi> have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aught, there is no such thing, as true friendly love, but among good men. But how consists it with such purity, to take pleasure in other mens impurities, or make their sin the matter of jest, and raillery?</p>
            <p n="4">4. A further inseparable concomitant of <hi>Charity,</hi> is deep <hi>humility.</hi> We find them joyn'd, and are required to put them on together, in the already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Context. Put on <hi>kindness, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind; above all put on Charity,</hi> Col. 3. And do find it among these cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48670:22"/>
of Charity, <hi>that it vaunteth not it self, and is not puffed up,</hi> v. 4.</p>
            <p>Nor can we ever, with due Charity, compassionate the wants, and infirmities of others, if we feel not our own. Which if we do, though we are not, ourselves, guilty of hainous wickednesses, we shall so entirely ascribe it to Divine preserving mercy, as to be in little disposition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that others are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE.</hi> We may then, upon the whole, learn hence, how we are to demean our selves in reference to the sins of other men.</p>
            <p>So, no doubt, as <hi>Charity doth command, and require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At least, <hi>so as it doth allow, or not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are manifestly concern'd, not to offer violence to so sacred a thing; and shall be secure from doing it both these ways. We may therefore under these <hi>two Heads,</hi> take direction for our behaviour upon such occasions: <hi>viz.</hi> the actual sins of others, or their more observable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations thereto.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48670:23"/>
1. We should faithfully practice, as to this case, such things as <hi>Charity,</hi> and the <hi>very law of love</hi> doth expresly require, and oblige us to. As we are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To take heed of <hi>tempting their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> and of inducing others to sin, whether by <hi>word</hi> or <hi>example.</hi> We are, <hi>otherwise,</hi> obliged to avoid doing so, and <hi>this</hi> greatly increases the Obligation. What we are not <hi>to rejoyce</hi> in, upon the account of Charity; we are, upon the same account, much less <hi>to procure.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially take heed of contributing to other mens sins, <hi>by the example of your own. The power whereof,</hi> though it be silent and insensible, is most efficacious in all mens Experiencc. A man would perhaps hear the <hi>verbal proposal</hi> of that Wickedness, with horror and detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he is gradually and with little reluctance drawn into, by observing it <hi>in other mens practice. A downright Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> to it, would startle him. But the conversation of such as familiarly practise it, gently insinuates, and by flower degrees alters the Habit of his Mind; secretly conveys and <hi>Infection</hi> like
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48670:23"/>
               <hi>a Pestilential Disease;</hi> so that the man is mortally seized before he feels, and when he suspects no danger.</p>
            <p>Most of all, let them take heed of mischieving others by their Sins, who are men of <hi>more knowledg,</hi> and pretend to <hi>more strictness</hi> than others. Perhaps some such may think of taking their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty more safely: They understand how to take up the business more easily, and compound the matter with God. An horrid Imagination! and <hi>direct Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> against the holy Gospel of our Lord! If it were true, and God should (do, what is so little to be hoped) mercifully give them the <hi>Repentance,</hi> whereof they most wickedly presume, who knows but <hi>others</hi> may, by that example, be hardned in wickedness, and <hi>never repent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, If thy greater knowledg should prompt thee to do, unnecessarily, that which (really, and abstracting from cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) is not a sin; but which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other took to be so, and thence takes a liberty to do other things that are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly sinful; yet <hi>walkest thou not chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably. Through thy Knowledg shall a</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48670:24"/>
               <hi>weak Brother perish and be destroyed, for whom Christ died?</hi> Rom. 14. 15. with 1 Cor. 8. 10, 11. Suppose the process be, as from <hi>sitting in an Idols Temple,</hi> to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> so from <hi>needless sitting in a Tavern,</hi> to <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> or other consequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries.</p>
            <p>But if the thing be, <hi>in its first instance,</hi> unquestionably sinful, of how horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences are the enormities of such as have been taken to be men of sanctity, beyond the common rate? What a <hi>stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block</hi> to multitudes! How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might it have been for many that are of the Christian profession, if <hi>such</hi> had never been Christians! And most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably for themselves also! No doubt it had been more for the honour of the Christian name. How <hi>many</hi> may be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to infidelity and atheism by <hi>one</hi> such instance! And whereas <hi>those scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd persons</hi> do often afterwards, incur <hi>this fearful guilt</hi> of <hi>rejoycing in the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of such,</hi> even <hi>that also,</hi> they have to answer for, with all the rest.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Charity requires,</hi> not only that we do not <hi>procure,</hi> but that we labour, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48670:24"/>
much as is possible, to <hi>prevent</hi> the sin of others. What in this kind, we are not to <hi>rejoyce at,</hi> we should <hi>hinder.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what we do not <hi>hinder,</hi> if it be in our power, we <hi>cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We should not be over-forward to believe ill of others. <hi>Charity</hi> will, while things are doubtful, at least, suspend. See how immediately conjunct these two things are. <hi>It thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not iniquity, v.</hi> 5, 6. It is not <hi>imaginative,</hi> or <hi>surmising.</hi> And in the <hi>following verse</hi> (on the better part, it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood), <hi>it believeth all things, hopeth all things: i. e.</hi> briefly, it is unapt to <hi>believe ill,</hi> without ground, and <hi>hopes, well,</hi> as long as there is any. But it is not so blindly partial, as to shut its eyes against apparent truth (of which more in its place).</p>
            <p n="4">4. Much less should we report thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If the matter <hi>particularly concern</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48670:25"/>
               <hi>our selves,</hi> and circumstances comply, we must have recourse first to the supposed offendor himself, and (as our Saviour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects) <hi>tell him his fault between him and thee alone,</hi> Mat. 18. 15.</p>

            <p n="7">7. We should, as our capacity and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances invite or allow (at least by our prayers) endeavour his recovery.

            <p n="8">8. We must take heed, upon one mans account, of censuring others; for such as we know to be faulty, those, that for ought we know (and therefore ought to hope) are innocent. A practice most absurd and unrighteous, contrary to <hi>common reason</hi> and <hi>justice,</hi> as well as <hi>charity.</hi> Yet that whereto some are apt to assume a license, upon so slender and sensless a pretence, <hi>i. e.</hi> Because some, that have, under a shew of piety, hidden the impurities of a secretly vicious life; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are openly profane, and lead notoriously lewd and flagitious lives (who tho' bad enough, are so far the honester men) do add to all their other wickedness, that folly and madness, as to count all men <hi>hypocrites</hi> that are not as bad as themselves. And reckon there is no such thing as <hi>real Religion</hi> in the World. A like case as if, because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>spectres</hi> have appeared in humane

shape, one should conclude there is, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no such creature on earth, as <hi>a very man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But there are also <hi>other things</hi> that ought to come into practice, in the case of other mens sinning, very <hi>suitable to the case,</hi> and not <hi>unsuitable to charity.</hi> Which, tho' they proceed more directly, rather, from <hi>some other principle,</hi> yet are not inconsistent <hi>with this</hi> (As the graces of Gods Spirit, and the duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians never interfere, so as to obstruct or hinder one another). <hi>Things</hi> which, tho' Charity do not expresly command, yet are otherwise commanded, and which Charity doth not forbid. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we labour to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of their example. That we take not encouragement to sin from their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They are not our rule. <hi>We have not so learned Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That we take warning by it. And endeavour that <hi>their example</hi> may not only not be <hi>tempting</hi> to us, but that it may be <hi>monitory.</hi> We should reckon such things <hi>are our examples, for this purpose,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. and were not only, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48670:26"/>
recorded and written, but they are also, in our own days, permitted to fall out <hi>for our admonition.</hi> We that <hi>think we stand, should</hi> therefore <hi>take heed lest we fall.</hi> And must remember we are to <hi>stand by faith,</hi> and are <hi>not to be high minded, but fear.</hi> 'Tis a costly instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is given us in such instances. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>dolour</hi> and <hi>pangs</hi> that <hi>they</hi> may perhaps endure, who are our Monitors. If they do not cry to us to beware, their case doth. Reckon (as the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 73.) <hi>It is good for you to draw near to God; they that are far from him shall perish.</hi> Labour to be sincere, living Christians. Let me tell you what I have often inculcated. <hi>A meer form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> will one time or other betray you. And that it is not <hi>being of this or that party, conjoined with a formal, lifeless Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that will secure you from being publick scandals on earth, and accursed wretches in hell. Let every one prove his own work,</hi> and make through work of it, so <hi>shall he have rejoycing in himself, and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6. (yea, tho' he may have much cause of mourning for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther):
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48670:27"/>
For every one <hi>must,</hi> at last, <hi>bear his own burden,</hi> and <hi>give an account of himself to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Seriously bless God for being kept from gross and scandalous enormities: Such words savour well, spoken with deep humility, and unfeigned sense of divine favour, not with Pharisaical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation and scorn, <hi>God I thank thee I am not as other men.</hi> If the poor man was so transported, and pour'd out his soul in tears of gratitude to God, upon the sight of a <hi>Toad,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> was not <hi>such a creature;</hi> how much more cause is there for it, upon the sight of a gross sinner!

            <p>There is a <hi>threesold degree</hi> of mercy, in our preservation from more <hi>hainous</hi> and <hi>reproachful</hi> wickedness.

            <p>And surely there is no <hi>small mercy, in being kept out of the way of temptation,</hi> by the dispensation of <hi>a more favourable Providence,</hi> that orders, more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, the circumstances of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, so as they are less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to occasions of sin, than others are.

            <p>Shall I be disquieted, grow weary, and forsake my way, because an unwary person stumbles, and falls in it, and one ten times worse, and more a fool than he, laughs at him for it? We must in such cases <hi>mourn</hi> indeed for both, but not <hi>faint.</hi> And if we mourn, <hi>upon a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> we shall easily apprehend it, in its cause, very separable from <hi>fainting</hi> and <hi>despondency.</hi> It is a discouraging thing for any party to be stigmatiz'd, and have an ill mark put upon them, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this or that person among them, that was, perhaps, what he seemed not, or was little thought to be. But if we be more concern'd <hi>for the honour of</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48670:30"/>
               <hi>the Christian name,</hi> than of <hi>any one party in the world,</hi> our mourning will not be principally, upon <hi>so private an account.</hi> All wise and good men, that understand the matter, will heartily concur with us, and count themselves oblig'd to do so. None <hi>that are such,</hi> or <hi>any man</hi> that hath the least pretence to <hi>reason, justice,</hi> or <hi>common sense,</hi> will ever allow themselves to turn the faults of this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person (that are discountenanc't as soon as they are known) to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a Party.</p>
            <p>For <hi>others,</hi> that are aptest to do so, men of debauch't minds, and manners; With whom, not <hi>being of this, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but <hi>Religion it self,</hi> is a reproach.

And if yet, after all this, any will give themselves the liberty to rejoyce at the sins of other men, and make them the matter of their sport and divertisement, or take any the least pleasure in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, I have but these two things, in the general, to say to them;</p>
            <list>
               <item>You have no reason to rejoyce.</item>
               <item>You have great reason for the contrary.</item>
            </list>
            <p>You have <hi>first</hi> no reason to rejoyce: For produce your cause, let us hear your strong Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it that such are like you, and as bad men as your selves? But</p>
            <p n="1">1. What if they be not like you? Every one, perhaps, is not; at whose sins (real or supposed) you, at a venture, take liberty to rejoyce; What if your guilt be <hi>real,</hi> theirs but <hi>imagined?</hi> Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through your too much haste, it may prove so; and then your Jest is spoiled, and you are found to laugh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at your own shadow. At least, you cannot, many times, so certainly know an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others guilt, as you may your own; and so run the hazard (which a wise man would not) of making your selves the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48670:31"/>
And supposing your guess, in any part, hit right; What if those others sin <hi>by Surprize,</hi> you by <hi>Design?</hi> They in an <hi>act,</hi> you in a <hi>course?</hi> They in <hi>one kind</hi> of lowdness, you <hi>in every kind?</hi> They sin <hi>and are penitent,</hi> you sin and <hi>are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate?</hi> They <hi>return,</hi> you <hi>persevere?</hi> They are <hi>ashamed,</hi> you <hi>glory?</hi> These are great differences, <hi>(if they are really to be found)</hi> in any such case. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If they be not found,</hi> and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be <hi>like you throughout,</hi> every whit as bad as your selves, This is sure no great matter of glorying, That I am not the very worst thing in all the world! the vilest creature that ever God made! Should it be a solace to me also that there are <hi>Devils,</hi> who may perhaps be somewhat worse than <hi>they</hi> or I?</p>
            <p>Nor, tho' they fall in never so intirely with you in all points of wickedness, will that much mend your matter? Can <hi>their wit</hi> added to yours, prove there will be no Judgment-day? Or that there is no God? Or, if that performance fail, can <hi>their power</hi> and yours, defend you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Almighty? <hi>Tho' hand join in</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48670:32"/>
               <hi>hand, the wicked will not go unpunished.</hi> Or again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppose you are not of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't Crew; Is this your reason why you at least think you may indulge your self some inward pleasure, that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (you observe) breaks out among them <hi>who are of a distinct party from you,</hi> which you count may signifie somewhat to the better reputation of <hi>your own?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But are you then of a Party of which you are sure there are no ill men? There are too many faults among all Parties; but God knows it is fitter for us all to <hi>mend,</hi> than to <hi>recriminate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, but the Party we are of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses not so much strictness. No? What Party should you be of, that professes less strictness? What <hi>more lax rule of Morals</hi> have <hi>you</hi> than other <hi>Christians?</hi> Do you not profess subjection to the <hi>known rules of the Bible</hi> concerning <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and civil conversation?</hi> You do not sure profess Rebellion, and hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord that bought you! Doth not your <hi>Baptismal Covenant</hi> (which you are supposed to avow) bind you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48670:32"/>
to as much strictness as any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian? And can there be any other more sacred bond?</p>
            <p>But if <hi>in other things,</hi> than matters of <hi>civil conversation,</hi> such delinquent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were of a stricter profession (suppose it be in matters of Religion, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship), doth <hi>that delinquency</hi> prove, that <hi>in those other things,</hi> you <hi>are in the right,</hi> and they <hi>are in the wrong?</hi> Doth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of any person, against the Rules of the <hi>common,</hi> as well as his <hi>own stricter profession,</hi> prove the profession he is of, to be false? Then, wherein the profession of <hi>Protestants,</hi> is stricter than of <hi>other Christians,</hi> the notorious sins of wicked Protestants, will conclude against the whole profession. And the wickedness of a <hi>Christian,</hi> because <hi>Christianity</hi> is a <hi>stricter profession</hi> than <hi>Paganism,</hi> will prove the Christian Religion to be false. Who doubts, but <hi>there may be found,</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion,</hi> better men than <hi>some Protestants?</hi> And of <hi>Pagans,</hi> better men than <hi>some Christians?</hi> But then, they are <hi>better,</hi> only in respect of <hi>some things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Christians,</hi> or <hi>all men, do agree in their</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48670:33"/>
               <hi>sentiments;</hi> not <hi>in respect of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ.</hi> And the <hi>others</hi> are <hi>worse,</hi> in things that have no connexion with the matter of difference. Enough is to be found to this purpose, in some of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> writing on the behalf of <hi>Christians,</hi> which we need not, in so plain a case.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be thought, that men of any understanding, and sobriety, will make <hi>this</hi> any argument, one way, or other; Or think them at all justifiable, that glory in other mens wickedness, upon this, or any other account.</p>
            <p>For such therefore, as are of so ill a mind, and think, <hi>being of a different party,</hi> gives them license, they ought to know, <hi>they make themselves of the same party;</hi> and that upon a <hi>worse account,</hi> than any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the <hi>Rituals of Religion</hi> can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, your <hi>Reason</hi> then (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg what you will) is <hi>no Reason,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues nothing but shortness of discourse, and want of reason; or that you would fain say something to excuse an ill practice, when you have nothing to say. But I must add,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48670:33"/>
2. That you have much reason to the contrary, both <hi>upon the common account,</hi> and <hi>your own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Upon the common account.</hi> That the <hi>Christian world</hi> should, while it is so barren of <hi>serious Christians,</hi> be so fertile, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of <hi>such Monsters!</hi> made up of the <hi>sacred Christian profession,</hi> conjoyn'd with (even worse than) <hi>Paganish lives!</hi> And the more of <hi>sanctity</hi> any pretend to, the more deplorable is the case, when the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness breaks forth, that was concealed before, under the <hi>vizor</hi> of that pretence? Is this no matter of lamentation to you? Or will you, here, again say, <hi>your unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latedness to their party,</hi> makes you uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd? If it do not justifie your rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, it will sure (you think) excuse your not mourning. Will it so indeed? Who made you of a <hi>distinct party?</hi> Are you not a Christian? Or are you not a Protestant? And what do you account <hi>that</hi> but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd primitive Christianity? And <hi>so,</hi> the more it is reform'd, the more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is <hi>it self.</hi> Who put it into your power to make <hi>distinguishing additions</hi> to the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> by which to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48670:34"/>
your selves from the body of <hi>other Christians in the world,</hi> so as not to be concern'd in the affairs <hi>of the body?</hi> If this or that member say, <hi>I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</hi> Is it not the <hi>Christian Name</hi> that is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the scandalous lives of them that <hi>bear that name?</hi> Whose Laws are they that are broken? the Laws of <hi>this or that party?</hi> or are they not the <hi>laws of Christ?</hi> Will you say you are <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him</hi> too? or have no concern with Him? Can any Party be united within it self, <hi>by so sacred tyes,</hi> as all <hi>true Christians</hi> are with the <hi>whole body of Christ?</hi> I know no way you have to be unconcern'd in such cases, <hi>as the matter of your humiltation</hi> (when they occur within your notice) but <hi>by renouncing your Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, indeed, would that serve the turn. For what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill you do with your <hi>humanity?</hi> Are you not still <hi>a man,</hi> if you would be no longer <hi>a Christian?</hi> And even <hi>that,</hi> methinks, should oblige us to bewail the <hi>depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> &amp; <hi>dishonour,</hi> of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of <hi>humane creatures!</hi> That they who were made
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48670:34"/>
for the <hi>society of Angels,</hi> vea, and of the <hi>blessed God</hi> himself, should be found de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting, and wallowing in worse impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, than those of the <hi>Dog</hi> or <hi>Swine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more strictness <hi>in morals</hi> they have (falsly) pretended to, the greater is your obligation, to lament their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating those <hi>sacred rules</hi> (which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so profess to be subject to) and not the less. Do I need to tell you, that even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Pagans,</hi> where <hi>a profession</hi> of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter strictness had once been entred into, an apostacy to <hi>gross immoralities</hi> hath been the matter of very solemn lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. As in the <hi>School</hi> (or <hi>Church</hi> should I call it?) of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> where, when any that had obliged themselves to the observation of his <hi>vertuous precepts,</hi> did afterwards lapse into a vicious course, a <hi>Funeral,</hi> and <hi>solemn mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jambl. de vit. Pyth.</note> was held for them, as if they were dead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>On your own.</hi> For when our Saviour saith, <hi>Wo to that man, by whom offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> doth he not also say, <hi>Wo to the world because of offences?</hi> And who would not fear, and <hi>lament</hi> his share in that Wo?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48670:35"/>
Are you proof against all hurt by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's sin? What if it encourage you to sin too? What if harden you in it? How many do some mens sin dispose to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism?</hi> and to think there is <hi>nothing in Religion?</hi> And if you felt in your selves <hi>an inclination to rejoyce in them, that,</hi> it self, argues the infection hath caught upon you; seiz'd your spirits, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted your vitals. So that you have cause to lament <hi>even your having rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. To be afficted, and mourn, and weep; to turn your laughter to mourning, and your joy to heaviness,</hi> Jam. 4.</p>
            <p>One would think them indeed but <hi>half men,</hi> and scarce <hi>any Christians,</hi> that can allow themselves so <hi>inhumane,</hi> and <hi>unhallowed</hi> a pleasure, as rejoycing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's sin! 'Tis very unworthy of a <hi>man</hi> to take pleasure in seeing his <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> turning <hi>beast.</hi> There is little in it of the <hi>ingenuity</hi> that belongs to <hi>humane nature,</hi> to delight in the harms of others; much less <hi>of the prudence,</hi> to make sport of a common mischief. And would a <hi>Christian</hi> rejoyce in the disadvantages <hi>of his own cause?</hi> and in the dishonour and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48670:35"/>
reproach of the <hi>very name</hi> which <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bears?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, One would think no more should be needful to repress in any this <hi>ill inclination,</hi> than to consider, <hi>What sin</hi> is, wherein they rejoyce. And <hi>what Charity</hi> is, which is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their doing so.</p>
            <p>What to rejoyce <hi>in sin!</hi> that despites the <hi>Creator,</hi> and hath wrought such Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies in the <hi>Creation!</hi> that turned <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> out of <hi>Heaven! Man</hi> out of <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise!</hi> that hath made the <hi>blessed God</hi> so much a stranger <hi>to our world,</hi> broken off the intercourse, in so great part, between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> obstructed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant commerce, which had, otherwise, probably been between <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men!</hi> So vilely debas't the nature of man, and provok't the displeasure of his Maker a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him! that once over-whelm'd the world in a <hi>deluge of water,</hi> and will again ruin it by as <hi>destructive fire!</hi> To rejoyce <hi>in so hateful a thing,</hi> is to do that mad part, <hi>to cast about firebrands, arrows, and death, and say, Am not I in sport?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to do that which so highly offends
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48670:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>against Charity!</hi> so divine a thing! the off-spring of God! the <hi>birth</hi> of Heaven, as it is <hi>here below,</hi> among us mortals; the <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of it, as it is <hi>there above,</hi> in its natural seat. The <hi>eternal bond</hi> of living union, among the blessed spirits, that inhabit there, and which would make our world, did it universally obtain in it, <hi>another Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider <hi>from whom,</hi> and <hi>from what Region</hi> that must proceed, which is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God and Heaven.</p>
            <p>If any will yet, <hi>in despight of divine love it self,</hi> laugh on, at so foul, and frightful a thing as sin is, 'tis too likely to prove the <hi>Sardonian laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. e.</hi> (as some explain that Proverb) of them that <hi>dye laughing;</hi> Conclude their <hi>lives,</hi> and their <hi>laughter</hi> both together; and only cease to <hi>laugh,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> in the same last breath.</p>
