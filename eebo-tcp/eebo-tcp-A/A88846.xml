            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

charges and trouble (in ſome Courts for <hi>2<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> others for
<hi>3<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> and the higheſt for <hi>10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> without having any Lawyers

conſiſting of ſeveral Mageſtrates, would examine all Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
thereby to finde out the truth; and if any ſhould ſpeak
for his friend, and aver any thing which he did not know to be
true, or could not prove, he would be lookt upon as one that
would diſcredit any buſineſs that ever he ſhould appear in for
time to come, and the very worſt of men there would ſhun
his company:) And now of late coming into my Native
Country, and finding one neerly related unto me to be much
troubled, turmoyled, waſted, and diſ-abled in his Eſtate, by
perplexed and tedious Suites, which I finde have been of 23
years continuance at leaſt, I thought good (after I had looked
into the Cauſes and finding them juſt and conſcionable by
Records and ſeverall Depoſitions of many honeſt credible
Witneſſes, and ſeverall other materiall proofs) to undertake
the proſecution of thoſe Suites to a period; hoping here
(where hath been accounted the beſt Laws in the world to be
made and exerciſed before corruption crept in) and eſpecially
in thoſe times of expectation of the moſt ſpeedy and beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion and Law in the world, I doubt not (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Petitioners Petition by reaſon of ſome defects and
miſtakes is laid aſide) But that after the Petitioner ſhal have
a Petition new drawn (with amendments and Additions of
Matter, in a new Petition to be done by Council Learned
and honeſt) to ſee, or hear of the matter to be again reſumed
and full and ſpeedy juſtice done as anciently hath been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Rubbs by reaſon of any forged falſhoods or cavilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of any long winded Lawyers whatſoever. But after I had
undertaken the ſame and found ſuch windings and turnings
among them far beyond any Foxes or Juglers, that no honeſt
man is able to deal with them in the way of their Trade.
Therefore I have thought it convenient and neceſſary (not
onely for the ſatisfaction of my friends preſent and abſent
when I encountered with ſome ſuch Lawyers, but of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
who be, ſhal, or may be ſo perplexed, and for a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of prevention for them) to publiſh this particular Caſe

to the world, that all may judg whether I have cauſe to
repent of what I have done, in ſtanding againſt ſome of the
great ones of the world in a juſt cauſe, or go on ſtill in my
proſecution, the which by the help of the Lord I am reſolved
to do, except I ſee better reaſon to the contrary then yet I
do; hoping that ſome of the honeſt people of this Nation
will joyn with me in petition to the Supream Authority
(the Fathers of the Commonwealth) for making a Law for
Redreſs of ſuch like Grievances in the future, which to be
effected is the deſire of him, who is a Hater of Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p>And a Gentleman Councel for the Petitioner related tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the courſe of the Court of the Kings Bench as it was.</p>
            <p>Whereupon a Gentleman replyed, and at firſt began with
ſmooth language, but in the end injuriouſly fell foul on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154029:6"/>
Petitioners Counſel, calling him a Gentleman of the Long
Robe (although he himſelf of the ſame Profeſſion,) taxing
him with not knowing the Law, nor the courſe of that Court
of Kings Bench, where the Declaration was ſo filed; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
untruly, that a Copy of it according to the courſe of
that Court ſhould have firſt been delivered to Sir <hi>Jo. Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall;</hi>
whereas in truth there was no ſuch courſe nor cuſtom
in that Court when the Declaration was ſo filed, nor many
years before, nor ſince, as ever I could hear of, nor is the Law
ſo, nor can or will he in writing aver the ſame ſo to be; but
I have heard the contrary affirmed by Practizers in that
Court, ſince the matter was in ſome debate in the Painted
Chamber at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> before that honorable Committee
of Parliament for Petitions; and for any ſuch Order to be
made ſince, there is none to be found; neither if any, were
they of any force as concerning that Declaration being filed
before.</p>
            <p>But the Judges brought one Witneſs who only ſaid (as far
as I remember) that he conceived it to be the practiſe of the
Court, to deliver Declarations or Copies thereof to privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
perſons the ſame Term that they were filed. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Gentleman, being a Practizer in the ſame Court alſo,
being called in and ſworn on the Judges behalf, was demanded
the ſame, or ſome of the queſtions as the firſt Gentleman was,
who did not ſay ſo much as the firſt, but contrary (as I have
been ſince informed,) I having ſo many to oppoſe me, and
none who did or would at all help me or any to teſtifie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
any thing to me in this Cauſe (becauſe againſt ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
perſons) but what they were ſtrictly examined unto, and
brought to anſwer by command; and the Judges having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
coming willingly at the firſt call, or without any ſending
for at all, ſome of which being preſent at that Debate were
called to teſtifie; But (as I have been informed by ſome
ſtanding near them ſince) after ſome whiſpering of ſome of
the Judges party, the taking of their oaths was ſpared: And I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154029:6"/>
have been informed by many ſince the matter in agitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſaid honorable Committee, that many, if they ſhould
be called in upon their oaths, can and muſt teſtifie, that the
courſe of that Court of Kings Bench when the ſaid Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was ſo filed, was, and yet is, that any man who hath cauſe
of Action againſt any priviledged perſon in that Court, may
in his own proper perſon (being the moſt ancient uſage) or
by his Attorney, file, or cauſe to be filed a Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch priviledged perſon within any Term (and as ſome
of them ſay any time before the continuance day, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three or four days next after ſuch Term,) and that the
giving to him, or to his uſual Attorney or Agent in that
Court, a Copy or notice of the filing of ſuch Declaration
any time before the eſſoyn day, being about three or four days
before the next ſubſequent Term, is ſufficient to compel ſuch
perſon priviledged, as aforeſaid, to anſwer to the ſame, that
ſubſequent Term, or elſe to enter Judgment againſt him: And
moſt Practizers, with whom I have confer'd about theſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
have informed me, that the like may be done to enforce
an Anſwer, or obtain Judgment to be entered, if ſuch Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſhould be filed, and no Copy thereof delivered, or any
notice given until another Term, although a year or divers
years after, or the eſſoyn day of the then ſubſequent Term, in
which the Plaintiff ſhall call for and obtain Rules to anſwer
to be entered: And the major part of ancient Practizers ſay,
that it is but in courteſie (ſo that a Declaration be filed) to
give any copy, or ſo much as notice thereof, to any that have
appeared in that Court, but that in Law they (being intended
to be under cuſtody of the Marſhal) or ſome for them, ought
to take notice of, and anſwer to what Declarations be or ſhall
be in the ſame Court filed againſt them, or otherwiſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be entered at the prayer of the Plaintiff or his Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
hath been accuſtomed, and by Law and of right ought
to be entered againſt ſuch Defendant for ſuch Plaintiff, and
in Juſtice not denyed or delayed: And the ſame cuſtom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154029:7"/>
hath been and is, and the Law is ſo againſt ſuch Marſhal upon
and for the ſame reaſon, and much more ſtronger, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
(while the Court is open) there preſent in perſon, or ſo
intended, and ſome of his Agents or Officers are never miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who are to, and do attend upon all his occaſions there.</p>
            <p>And ſome Ancient Clerks are of
opinion,<note place="margin">This the Judges Council allowed &amp; confeſſed, which if I had had time to ſpeak to at large, I ſhold have made appear did contrary and confound a great part of that which he ſpake on the bebalf of the Iudges.</note> that after a Declaration filed
againſt a priviledged perſon in that
Court, the courſe and cuſtome hath
been and the Law is (as I am adviſed
by Council) and doubt not but to
make good, he ought to anſwer from
day to day, or Judgement to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt him at the prayer of the Plaintiff, And ſome of
thoſe that were called on the behalf of the Judges and not
ſworn, and other practizers ſtanding amongſt them if they
had been ſworn and ſtrictly examined on the behalf of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner,
could, and muſt have teſtified ſome of them all, and
the others of them the greateſt part, as I have here ſet forth
on the behalf of the Petitioner.</p>
            <p>And after the Gent. Council for the Judges thought he had
given me a check (ſaying, <hi>He himſelf had ſat in ſuch places as
did the honorable Committee,</hi> and in a frowning manner, <hi>that
he did not uſe to hear ſuch language from ſuch a fellow as I was,</hi>
(as I conceive) to daſh me out of countenance, and cauſe the
Honorable Committee, and the company ſtanding by, to
have an ill opinion of me, ſpining out time in vain, by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and untrue repetitions, until the night drew on, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to weary out the Committee and thoſe that ſtood
about them, and to bring into, and leave the Cauſe in a ſog
raiſed from the mud and Jakes houſes at S. Katherines, that it
might never be found again: all which matters uſed by him
I could and would have anſwered and cleared on the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
behalf, and left his firſt old Chancery Clyents in the
Miſts, Mazes, and Labyrinths into which he imagineth hee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154029:7"/>
hath driven the Petitioner, whom I doubt not but cleerly to
bring out. And as for the Language he ſaid concerning me,
I ſhal ſay but little, but that I ſay ſhall be truth only, and not
any knowing untruth, and I will not willingly take or detain
any thing of any mans againſt his will, which I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
nor diſcloſe any thing of any mans that wil truſt me, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
ſhal prejudice him; but as I have, ſo I hope I ſhal in a conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
way (by the Lords help) maintain my ſelf and family,
without taking any ſuch courſe as to take money of men, and
ſo cauſe them to let the whole weight of their Cauſes lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, and never come to perform that which I was hired to
do (by which it may be, a whole family is ruined) nor keep
the money and papers of a Clyent eight or ten dayes, by
which time I might pick out what I could, and then ſend all
back again the day before Tryall and turn to be council on the
other ſide, neither ever was it my trade to ſtudy how to
daunt all that ſhould ſpeak either as Partee, Friend, or Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
thereby to pervert Juſtice, and cauſe Righteouſneſs to be
carried out of the true channel.</p>
            <p>And after the Gent. had cavilled what he could againſt the
Petitioners proofs and made what he could of the ſlender te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
on his Clyents behalf then to ſtave me off before I
could have time to reply to what untruths were alledged; for
further to any impertinent or flouriſhing cavillations I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then did intend to ſpeak, to trouble the honorable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
or company about them, nor now to ſpend writing
and paper in vain; but becauſe words preſently go into the
ayr, and vaniſh on a ſudden, and ſo may not be remembered by
many of the parties preſent when they were uttered, and ſo to
be accounted of ſome validity againſt the Petitioner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Petition did not take effect (as ſome of the Petitioners
adverſaries have boaſted,) though what they ſaid or urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the equity or lawfulneſs of the Petitioners Cauſe was
of no more force againſt it then a feather in the wind.</p>
            <p>But I finding the Petition ready drawn, and conceiving the
Petitioner had had it viewed by Councel, I obtained it to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154029:8"/>
read before I ſhewed it to any Councel, (ſome of whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
informed me that it was defective,) upon which as
I beleeve the proceedings upon the ſame are ſtayed, yet I
hope upon a new Petition to be well drawn by advice of
Councel (if I can procure any) the matter of the firſt Petition
ſupplyed with other, will be reſumed again, and the Petitioner
have relief therein: But becauſe my Acquaintance ſhould
not think the Cauſe quite loſt until it can be ſet right again,
I ſhall firſt repeat the effect of the worſt that was ſaid againſt
the Equity of the ſame,<note n="*" place="margin">This is a meer fiction, and ſo proved by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proceedings in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</note> which (as I
take it) was, that the Bond of 7000 <hi>l.</hi>
upon which the Judgment was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
was gained by fraud and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention,
by inticing <hi>Wright</hi> into
a room or chamber in St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> having a privy-houſe or
trap-door hanging over the Thames, and there forcing him to
ſeal the Bond without conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The decretal Order then made was grounded upon the oaths of <hi>Wallis</hi> and <hi>Waleworth,</hi> the one indicted and proved a cheat, the other after the oath made fled; no decree ever ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or enrouled, nor colour of proof to ground any ſuch decree upon.</note> And that thereupon
the Lord Keeper, <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
decreed the Bond to
be delivered up to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,
which never was, but
the Bond violently taken
from <hi>More</hi> in open Court.</p>
            <p>The truth of the matter hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-followeth,<note place="margin">It appears by ſome Orders, that the Gentleman was of Councel in the Cauſe, and may be acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and where the infamy and foulneſs lies, I ſhall ſhew immediately.</note>
which Mr <hi>Maynard,</hi>
ſpeaking largely at the Debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Committee, ſeemed to
take notice of, ſaying, That it was
an Infamous Cauſe, and that he
knew it, being acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
all along, and at the beginning, and that it was the fouleſt
Cauſe that ever came under <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Roof; which indeed
had been ſo, if all the lyes which <hi>Wright</hi> put in his Bill, and all
that the Lawyers have ſaid, had been true. A Bill indeed was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154029:8"/>
exhibited againſt Mr <hi>More</hi> (and his only Witneſſes to the
Bond, which were three) by <hi>Wright</hi> in Chancery in the ſixth
year of <hi>Carolus Rex,</hi> and therein was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<note n="*" place="margin">Nothing at all of this proved in the Books, or otherwiſe.</note> That Mr <hi>More</hi> did draw and
entice <hi>Wright</hi> into a Tavern in St <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
into a Room (at the foot of the
ſtairs of which was a Trap-door hanging over the Thames)
and that money being payd to <hi>Wright</hi> by <hi>More,</hi> which <hi>Wright</hi>
pretended <hi>More</hi> owed him, through fear <hi>Wright</hi> ſealed and
executed the Bond in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This poſitively all proved by thoſe three Witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined by order of Court.</note> Mr <hi>More</hi> and his three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
the other Defendants, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
and denyed all practiſe and
circumvention; but ſaid, that the

and freely ſealed and executed, and
that Mr <hi>More</hi> parted from Mr
<hi>Wright</hi> lovingly from the houſe,
where he ſtayed behind above an
hour after, and ſeemed very well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Some Witneſſes were examined on the behalf of <hi>Wright,</hi>
but ſpake nothing to the matters in queſtion: Yet he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a hearing in the Cauſe about two or three Terms after his
Bill exhibited; at which Mr <hi>Noy,</hi> being one of his Councel,
ſaid to the ſaid <hi>Wright,</hi> he could not help him: and the Lord
Ke<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>per <hi>Coventry</hi> ſaid, that he found no cauſe of relief for
<hi>Wright,</hi> but ordered, That Breefs ſhould be made of the
Cauſe on both ſides, the one to avoyd the Bond, and the other
to ſupport it, and then he would hear the Cauſe again upon
the Breefs.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>More</hi> thereupon cauſed Breefs to be made, and feed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Councel about the buſineſs againſt another hearing,
which he expected; But afterwards out of all courſe the L.
Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> ſent for <hi>More</hi> to attend the Court with his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154029:9"/>
Bond, and he attending with it there, the Lord Keeper (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other Judges with him unacquainted with the former
proceedings) heard two <hi>Viva Voce</hi> Witneſſes, the one named
<hi>Robert Wallis,</hi> the other <hi>Francis Waleworth,</hi> one of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
confeſſed, that <hi>Wright</hi> gave him 50<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> to ſwear for him,
and had promiſed to give him 50<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> more; the other ſtood
convicted at <hi>Newgate</hi> for a Cheater, and otherwiſe a grievous
Offender.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This for the moſt part in the decretal Order, of which the Gentleman made ſuch a noiſe, which he would have been aſhamed of, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the whole truth, which I ſhall expreſs by and by.</note> And thereupon in the preſence
of thoſe Judges, ſo unacquainted
as aforeſaid, and ſitting ſtill and

made a decretal Order,<note n="*" place="margin">Of this I can make good proof by <hi>Viva Voce</hi> Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if need be.</note> That the
Bond ſhould be delivered up to be

from him by force, or, as he hath often ſaid, robbed of it:
And an Iſſue (of <hi>per minus</hi>) being entered, and thereupon
<hi>Wright</hi> being informed that he was in danger notwithſtanding
the Bond was taken from Mr <hi>More,</hi> he cauſed the Lord Keeper
ſeveral times to have the decretal Order ſigned, that he might

that the ſubornation and

Offender, the Lord Keeper
never did, but refuſed to ſign the

of: But let the Gentleman conſider of theſe lines, and ſay
what more he pleaſe, and he ſhall hear ſurther from me. And
after the death of the L. Keeper <hi>C.</hi> it was ſeveral times mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

inconvenient; But <hi>Wright</hi> and his Councel were denyed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

upon an attachment of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<note n="*" place="margin">I heard that Sir <hi>J.

            <p>And after that Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> declared againſt Mr <hi>More</hi> for

for above 7000 <hi>l.</hi> and after ſurceaſed proceedings thereupon,
becauſe it appeared that Mr <hi>More</hi> had ſuch a Iudgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him the ſaid Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> and therefore Mr <hi>More</hi> is voyd
of all remedy in the premiſſes, but in the Supream Court of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Iudges, to make themſelves innocent, pretend that they
thought they did Juſtice when they made thoſe Orders, and
that now they do not remember upon what grounds they
made them.</p>
            <p>To this I ſay, That ſo might the forty four Juſtices have
ſaid, which appears in the 239 page of the <hi>Mirror of Iuſtice</hi>
to be condemned by King <hi>Alfred</hi> for their miſdemeanors;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154029:11"/>
but it ſeems that neither could nor would ſerve the turn, for
they did undergo the pains and penalties of the Law: and
thoſe Judges, Sir <hi>Iohn Bramſton</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Malet,</hi> had no
more colour or ground for their judgment in their Orders,
then the old Judges for theirs.</p>
            <p>But the long-winded daring and daunting Lawyer ſaith,
That ſometimes Orders in Court are made upon <hi>Affidavits</hi>
in writing, which after be of late years filed in Court (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
anciently not ſo,) and that the Judges might have
cauſe ſhewn, which now they do not remember, and that
ſome things are beleeved and ſome not beleeved by ſome in
Court.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, I wonder how any ſuch ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
who feign things which they know to be untrue, and
ſet a bold face upon them (as though they were as true as the
Goſpel) to run the other party upon a Lee ſhore. And the
Gentleman cavilleth at the filing of the Declaration, although
he did ſee it under the hand of Mr <hi>Hoddeſdon,</hi> who he ſaid
was accounted as honeſt a man as ever was Secondary of the
Kings Bench Office, that it had been examined and reported
to be filed in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, and the Rules now in queſtion,
and divers other Rules made in the Cauſe, and the ſame was
and can be made appear by Witneſſes, againſt which there
neither is or was any exception taken.</p>
            <p>And further, to make it appear and manifeſt that the
Judges might have been informed upon what grounds they
made the firſt of theſe two Orders in queſtion, Mr <hi>Keeling</hi>
who made, and Sir <hi>Io. Lenthall</hi> who cauſed that firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
to be made, be yet living, and well known to the
Iudges, and ſo is Mr <hi>Edward Harris,</hi> who made the ſecond of
thoſe motions. By thoſe and many Officers of the Court
might the Iudges have been well informed of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in the buſineſs, eſpecially being the Iudges, or at leaſt
one of them have been from year to year and from time to
time called upon, and deſired to afford or help the Petitioner

to relief in the premiſſes, both while they were in Office or
Iudicature, and ſince; but always
hitherto delayed and refuſed,<note place="margin">They might have aſſiſted the Petitioner to procure the Order to be altered, ſeeing that Sir <hi>Jo: Bramſton</hi> many years ſince did ſo much take notice of it, as to ſay, that if he had not been put out of Office, he would have altered it, &amp;c.</note> and
never ſtirred or went about to have
the ſaid Orders altered ſince they
have been out of Office, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the Petitioner hitherto to
groan under this ſad oppreſſion.
There is a ſtrong preſumption,
that there was ſome under-hand
dealing between the Iudges and
Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> for never the like act was known to be done, or ſo
much as heard of before, during all the time that they ſate as
Iudges in that Court, and therefore I think all that they have
ſaid cannot excuſe them; but they are as faulty in this, as the
old Iudges before mentioned of thoſe things for which they
were condemned.</p>
            <p>And further, they endeavor to excuſe themſelves, becauſe
nothing is proved that they took for making thoſe Orders, and
therefore they are not to be queſtioned.</p>
            <p>To this I ſay, Did the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Richardſon,</hi> or
late Juſtice <hi>Bartlet,</hi> excuſe themſelves for taking inſufficient
Bayl, though nothing were proved againſt them for ſo doing?
were they not compelled to pay the Debts themſelves? Or
were the old Iudges before cited excuſed becauſe that it was
not proved, that they gained any thing by what they did?
And were not ſome Iudges queſtioned, and turned out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and fined, and ordered to pay damage, for adjudging the
Ears of ſome perſons to be cut off, and ſentenced to other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries?
And the like for many other offences, though nothing
proved for ſo doing, too long now to enumerate, but much
more may be ſaid when opportunity ſerve.</p>
            <p>And theſe Iudges, Sir <hi>Iohn Bramſton</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho: Malet,</hi>
eſpecially one of them, had continued long enough in that
place of Iudicature to have had more judgment then to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154029:13"/>
that they might make ſuch Orders upon ſuch <hi>Aſſida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits,</hi>
that he had not a copy of that Declaration in time; for
that he only depoſeth in his <hi>Affidavit,</hi> that he did not receive
the Declaration until within <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term; and if he had not
had notice of the filing of it in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term before, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would have depoſed that as well as the other; and
therefore it cannot but be preſumed, but that he had notice of
it in that Term in time; although it were ſufficient for the
Petitioner to have his Declaration ſtand of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term,
without removing, being a Rule was then given, and entered
that Term, of which Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> ought and could not but to
take notice: and yet if he ſhould have had no notice before
the Declaration was given to him, the Iudges could at the
moſt but have given him imparlance until the next Term af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he had notice, without any alteration of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>And the Iudges might as well as make the Orders aforeſaid,
order any Declaration, filed within the time in the Statute of
Limitation, to be filed when the time is out and paſt, when
the Plaintiff ſhould not have the benefit of his Action: And
they may as well, when a Declaration ſhall be filed for mony
due upon a Bond, order, that the Declaration ſhall be filed at
a time before the date of the Bond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when there is no cauſe of
Action: And ſo in all Caſes by ſuch means the Plaintiffs
may loſe their Actions, and totally their debts and demands
therein, lawfully due and owing to them.</p>
            <p>1. This I thought good for ſeveral cauſes to publiſh: Firſt,
That I could not get any body (who could) to ſort my papers
readily out as the Iudges had and did, and alſo to promp their
Councel, and no body to help me at all, nor appear without
compulſion, nor ſpeak any thing but what was drawn from
them by queſtions.</p>
            <p>2. For that it may clearly appear to all unbyaſſed perſons
who ſhall read the ſame, how much the Petitioner hath been
and is dampnified by thoſe Orders; for if Sir <hi>Iohn Lenthall</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:154029:14"/>
had not ſuffered <hi>Wright</hi> to eſcape, the Petitioner had had
2000 <hi>l.</hi> down above eleven years ſince, and ſecurity for the
reſt, which he offered while he was a Priſoner; and after he
had eſcaped flew off, and ſaid he had compounded with Sir
<hi>I. L.</hi> better cheap, and therefore Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> was the cauſe of
the loſs of the debt of <hi>Wright;</hi> and the Iudges for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ſame of Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> by reaſon of the Orders.</p>
            <p>3. To the end that a good cauſe may not be thrown into
the dirt by any decretal Order grounded upon untruths, and
would not abide the light when it was queſtioned, but was
dampned long ſince upon ſolemn debate by many learned
Councel on both ſides, before divers Lords and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Supream Court of Parliament; and the
juſtneſs of the Cauſes of Mr <hi>More</hi> againſt <hi>Wright</hi> made good,
and the Bond queſtioned to be entered into and delivered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good ground and really (and not as in the ſcandalous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal
Order,) all which is manifeſted by the inrollments of
a Decree in the Court of Chancery in one Cauſe, concerning
the ſaid Bond for Mr <hi>More</hi> againſt the widow <hi>Wright,</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtratrix
of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Wright,</hi> and of a diſmiſſion in
another Cauſe, wherein ſhe was Plaintiff againſt Mr
<hi>More.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Becauſe the common report is in the City of <hi>London,</hi>
that the matter in the decretal Order ſtandeth as truth in
many places, by reaſon Mr <hi>More</hi> hath had ſuch multitudes of
adverſaries, which have divulged thoſe falſhoods abroad, and
few of his friends or others yet know the truth of the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
in theſe Cauſes, or take notice of the clearing of the
ſcandals, and manifeſtation of the lawfulneſs and juſtneſs of
the Petitioner his Cauſe in all Courts, I thought good to
publiſh this ſhort Abſtract thereof, hoping that after I have
throughly taken advice about the buſineſs, I ſhall procure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Petition to be drawn (with enlargements and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
againſt the aforeſaid Judges; So at preſent I ſhall
ceaſe to write further of theſe things until the ſaid Petition
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154029:14"/>
ſhall be prepared, unleſs I ſhall hear of ſomething from any
of the adverſe party (which if they pleaſe, and can write any
thing to purpoſe againſt what I have here publiſhed) and
then they ſhall ſoon hear from me again.</p>
            <p>5. That thoſe who be, have been, or may be in danger to
be perplexed in the like kind, may find out and ſeek the ſame
remedy; not doubting but ſome will joyn with me in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to be preſented to the Supream Authority for a Law
to be made, That (in every perplexed or troubleſom Cauſe,
before any Court be puſſled with lying or wrangling Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
which hath been too frequent of late years, they having
been uſually fined for ſuch things in ancient times) after a
Petition or Complaint exhibited &amp; admitted into any Court,
the Defendants may anſwer, and the Complainants or Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
reanſwer or reply the one after the other, as long as any
new matter be or ſhall be introduced (and that to be without
wilful untruths or impertinency under a penalty) until the
matters therein to be in iſſue ſhall be ſtated; and that ſuch
writings may be read in Court, and no perſon conſtrained to
hire many Lawyers to con the matter without Book, as is
now uſed, few or no ſingle Lawyer being either able or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to carry ſo much in memory, and many times by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repeating
or opening, and omiſſions of proceedings in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by Councel, many people have been undone, and others
received much damage.</p>
            <p>And that according to the good and equitable Order
which the honorable Committee for Petitions have made for
Petitioners, for ſetting of the proofs in the margin of Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that the like may be done by the Defendants, or other
parties, of all which they ſhall contend for, or endeavor to
prove, hoping that the Lord will give a bleſſing to the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
of our noble Legiſlators, ſpeedily to do and perform the
neceſſary work of this Nation.</p>

               <head>The principal matters concerning the Cauſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
are;</head>
               <p>1. THat <hi>Thomas Wright</hi> became bound to <hi>Henry More</hi> in a
Bond of 7000 <hi>l.</hi> in the year 1629. and the Bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put in Suit, the ſaid <hi>Tho. Wright</hi> pleaded <hi>per minus</hi> at
Common Law, then immediately fled to the Chancery,
where he put in a Bill ſtuffed full of lyes and ſcandals, one
whereof being, that he was forced to ſeal the Bond, but
proved nothing at all which had any colour of any ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Henry More</hi> did by three Witneſſes prove the
Bond ſealed freely and willingly, all being preſent at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
thereof; and alſo by three more, which ſeveral days
afterwards did hear <hi>Tho. Wright</hi> acknowledg, that he had
ſealed and delivered ſuch a Bond, and if it were to do again
he would do it, and that he did it upon good conſideration.</p>
               <p>3. That <hi>Tho. Wright</hi> did hire two Witneſſes to ſwear [<hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Voce,</hi>] which were accepted of by the Lord Keeper <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
contrary to the courſe of the Court of Chancery, at
which time he made an Order, That <hi>H. More</hi> ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
deliver up his Bond to be cancelled, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
ſome of the ſtanders by were commanded to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
who readily and violently performed the ſame.</p>
               <p>4. That <hi>Tho. Wright</hi> ſeveral times after moved the ſaid
Lord Keeper to have the ſaid decretal Order ſigned, which
was refuſed, becauſe it ſuddenly came to his Lordſhips ear,
that the two Witneſſes were found out to be ſuch as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
the one confeſſing and run away, and the other ſtanding
convicted at <hi>Newgate</hi> for a common Cheat and Swearer for
mony: and that <hi>T. Wright</hi> had made his brags of the ſaid
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154029:15"/>
Order, but ſaid, that it coſt him near 2000 <hi>li.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That when <hi>H. More</hi> had ſpent much mony (at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law and in Chancery) in the proſecution of his Suit for
the ſpace of about eleven or twelve years, he obtained (after a
Verdict before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Bramſton</hi>) a Iudgment
for 7007 <hi>l.</hi> and 12 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That <hi>Tho. Wright</hi> was charged in Execution (in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody
of Sir <hi>J. Lenthall</hi>) and then proffered <hi>H. More 2000 l.</hi>
or more in mony, and ſecurity for the reſt; but before the
mony payd, or the ſecurity given, <hi>T. Wright</hi> met <hi>H. More</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> where he jeered him, and ſaid, that he had made his
compoſition with Sir <hi>J. L.</hi> upon better terms.</p>
               <p>7. That <hi>H. More</hi> then brought his Action againſt Sir
<hi>J. L.</hi> for the eſcape, and filed his Declaration in <hi>Hillary</hi>
Term, 1641. ten days before the end thereof, and Rules were
given and out that Term, and no Plea put in, ſo that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was due; and that a Copy of the Declaration was given
to his uſual Attorney, and notice alſo to him the ſaid Sir
<hi>J. L.</hi> himſelf within the ſaid Term, which was more then
<hi>H. More</hi> need to have done, the filing of a Declaration againſt
an Officer of the Court (chiefly a Marſhal) being ſufficient
(without any notice) and warranted by the Law of this
Nation.</p>
               <p>8. That Sir <hi>J. L.</hi> took the beſt courſe he could to diſable
<hi>H. More,</hi> (beſides his proſecution of unjuſt feigned Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which coſt at leaſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> to defend and clear) Sir <hi>J. L.</hi>
atteſted him at one time in an Action of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> then upon
an attachment of priviledg for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> by which he thought
to have layd him up ſafe.</p>
               <p>9. That Sir <hi>J. L.</hi> endeavored to have <hi>H. More</hi> brought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154029:16"/>
into his own cuſtody, and at his own Suit.</p>
               <p>10. That Sir <hi>J. L.</hi> perceiving that (as he ought to have
done) he was in danger of paying the ſaid 7007 <hi>l.</hi> and 12 <hi>d.</hi>
procured Sir <hi>Io. Bramſton</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Malet</hi> to make an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
That the Declaration filed in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term 1641. ſhould
ſtand filed as of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term 1642. (when the ſaid <hi>T. Wright</hi>
by Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> was brought into priſon again, and two or three
days after dead, and the eſtate made away,) contrary to Law
and the courſe of that Court.</p>
               <p>11. That by the practiſe of Sir <hi>I. L. H. More</hi> was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of having ſatisfaction of <hi>T. Wright,</hi> and then the Judges
made him remedileſs, by taking the cauſe of Action off from
Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> ſo that if the Gaoler may free the Priſoner, and the
Judges the Gaoler, and not to be queſtioned, all Debts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
may be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>12. That the Judges chief end of making the ſaid Order
muſt be to free Sir <hi>I. L.</hi> becauſe if they ſhould not have done
it, he muſt have payd the Debt; for I cannot hear of any body
that can remember, or have heard of any ſuch Order ever
made by any Iudges neither before nor ſince.</p>
               <p>13. That Judges (by the Law) ought to ſatisfie all parties
wronged by reaſon of their doing Injuſtice, whether it can be
proved they got any thing thereby or not.</p>
               <p>14. That Lawyers anciently (in <hi>England</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries)
were fined for affirming any thing (in the face of a
Court) untrue.</p>
