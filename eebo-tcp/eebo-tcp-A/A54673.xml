            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The First Opinion, Is,</head>
               <p>OF <hi>Leonardus Lessius,</hi> who affirmes, That the Motion of Reciprocation or Replication, commonly styl'd, <hi>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea,</hi> Entitles its Primitive and Original Causality, to the Supernaturall Guidance and Managery of an Angel; But if the strength of Man be seen in his Reason, and the strength of Reason evidenced in his Judgment, and the strength of Judgment manifested in his Knowledg, all these Three by this frail Opinion must be destroyed; for, who will ever Attempt by a noble winno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing and Industrious Pursuit and Inquest after the more eminent, but Cloudy and Abstruse Causes of Nature, to unlock the Mysteries of them, which are laid up in her Gloomy Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, when he can affirm, that their Operation owes its Original Emanation, or Efflux, to the Supernatural Conduct of an Angel, and this at last will become the Common Sanctuary to Shelter a Universal Ignorance? Indeed, I do not Deny, but the Hand of Gods speciall Providence is sometimes stretched out and extended to support Nature when she is feeble and faint in her Operations, or else to Knit and Twist Extraordinary Causes with Extraordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, when she is not able to perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this union, and then only when she is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective either in her Strength or in her Light; But to do it always, and Assert that these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60532:4"/>
Efforts of Gods, special Providence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But the Irregularity of this Opinion will further appear by this Question, Why have not the <hi>Baltick, Euxine,</hi> and <hi>Caspian,</hi> Seas this Flux and Reflux of waters, by this Angelical Motion; since they are as Capable of it, as other parts of the Ocean abroad, that daily Receive it? Besides, it is Absurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Seas divided by such vast Intervals, should at one and the same Instant swell into Tides, and fall into Ebbings, by the Transport and Managery of one single Angel, and yet these waters being equally mov'd, should produce such different Fluxes and Refluxes. And now I hope by this time Wise Men will laugh at this Opinion, not in Applause, but Contempt, of the Vanity of it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="opinion">
               <head>The Second Opinion, Is,</head>
               <p>THat of our Country man <hi>Lidiat</hi> who avers, <hi>that the Rlux and Reflux of the Sea,</hi> owes its Primitive Efficiency to Subterraneous Fires, Fed and Fomented by a stock either of Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or else of Bituminous Matter; But this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of his meets with so many Ruinous and Destructive Difficulties, that it is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to Reconcile it to Truth; for it is by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60532:5"/>
all Agreed, <hi>That the Flux and Reflux of the Sea,</hi> is Periodical in its Revolution, and so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, fix'd and certain: But if this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his should be Assented to, where there is not this Collection of Sulphurous and Bituminous Matter (as on the Coast of <hi>Norway,</hi> and other places) there would be no Tydes at all. Besides, where this Stock of Combustible Matter is wholly wasted and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, <hi>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea,</hi> must wholly cease: But then 2<hi>dly.</hi> Why should not the <hi>Dead-Sea</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> or the <hi>Lake As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Phaltites,</hi> that has such an eminent congestion of <hi>Bitumen</hi> transfus'd through the Bowels of it, be Capable of Prodigious Tides? but this we know is Contradicted by all Experience. 3<hi>dly.</hi> Why should not the <hi>Baltick Sea</hi> that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish'd with many <hi>Bituminous</hi> particles (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Generation of <hi>Amber,</hi> which most do Conclude to be a Coagulum or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Salt, Sulphur and Bitumen, and which is frequently found upon the Coast of <hi>Liesland, Curland,</hi> and <hi>Prussia</hi>) have these Tides and Ebbings which every one knows to be contrary to all Observation? 4<hi>thly.</hi> Why do not the Tides upon the Coasts of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> Swell to a very Important Height, since both their Circumambient Shores, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with such a Copious Quantity of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur? But this we know is evidently false, the <hi>Sea</hi> not Swelling upon those Coasts to a Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of above three or four Foot when it is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60532:5"/>
at the Highest. But last of all, if you ask <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat,</hi> what Superior cause Produces these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Fires, he will tell you, that is the Reflexion of the Beams of the Sun upon the Convex Superficies of the Sea? To this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That by the Consent of many eminent Philosophers, the Rays of the Sun never ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by penetration upon that watery Body above Fifteen Cubits, and so Impossible, where the Sea is of any considerable Depth, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these Subterraneous Fires. And thus, I think, I have Sufficiently disarm'd his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="opinion">
               <head>The Third Opinion Is,</head>
               <p>THat <hi>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea,</hi> is caus'd by some prodigious Eddies and Whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools, that suck and transport the Sea from the North to the South; and from the South to the North; That there is such a vast whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool upon the coast of <hi>Norway,</hi> is most certain, which is by Mariners Stiled, <hi>The Navel of the Sea</hi>: But, that there is such an one in the Southern Hemisphere to refund back the Sea by a motion of replication, no Observations either of <hi>Ramusius, Linschoten,</hi> or the more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>De-Leat</hi> have ever discovered to us, whose Searches and Inquisitions into the Mysteries of the <hi>East-Indian</hi> and <hi>West-Indian</hi> Seas, were never yet cavil'd or quarrel'd at: Besides, if there were any such in those parts, upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60532:6"/>
reciprocal return of the Southern waters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, that multitude of angry Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which discompose, by reason of that Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Whirlpoole, the face of the <hi>Norwegian</hi> Sea, would every 24 hours disband, and be smooth, as the aspect of peace, and even as the margent of a Poole, when it is not disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into wrinkles by the rough breath of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tempest. But this is Contradictory to the daily Observation of the Inhabitants that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined upon the Fringes of this stupendous Whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole.</p>
               <p>Thus, I think likewise, this opinion, that is Supported by such feeble Crutches, is at last overturned.</p>

               <head>The Fourth Opinion.</head>
               <p>BUt as some have found out a Navel, so <hi>Kepler</hi> hath found out the Lungs of the Sea: for he asseveres the Terrestrial Globe to be but one great Animal, and that the <hi>Flux and Reflux of the Sea</hi> does proceed from the <hi>Sistole</hi> and <hi>Diastole,</hi> or the Contraction and Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of dits Spatious Lungs: But then I ask; First, Whether does this Motion Result, either from Air, or some Spirit? or Secondly, Does it Issue either from a Sensitive or Rational Soul? And Thirdly, I enquire upon what Coast these prodigious Lungs are Situated? And until the Abettors of this wild Opinion (if there be any such) do give some Satisfactory Answers to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60532:6"/>
these Queries, this Opinion is Demolished by a bare Negation of it.</p>

               <head>The Fifth Opinion, Is,</head>
               <p>OF <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> that this Increase and Decrease of waters, is caused <hi>per Mutuas &amp; Benevolas Aquarnmd Allicientias</hi>; that is, by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Aggregation or Simpathetical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, by which water does vigorously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to unite and Conbince with water. But if this were granted, Streams would seek to entwine with Streams and Lakes twist with Lakes, till at last, long before this the world must have Suffered under the angry Baptisme of a publique Deluge. Secondly; where there is this Motion of Aggregation or Connexion, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des would swell to an Important Height, as in the <hi>Caspian, Euxine</hi> and <hi>Baltick</hi> Seas, where all Geographers that have display'd to us the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography of those places, have discover'd to us that a multitude of huge Rivers do daily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embogue themselves: And on the other side, those Seas that do not swell with the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Supplies of very few or no Rivers, as the <hi>Norwegian</hi> Ocean, and others, would have very little or no Tides at all; Both which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently false, and repugnant to daily Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Therefore this Opinion of His, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd upon such fraile principles, does easily shrink and languish into its own Ruine.</p>

               <p>DOes aver, that the Sea does entitle the Causality of its <hi>Flux and Reflux</hi> to some Currents that either set from East to West, or from North to South: But if this were assented to, the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> the <hi>Euxin-Sea</hi> and the <hi>Baltick</hi>-Sea, would improve themselves to a huge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Tides, considering all three are fed by a Communication of perpetual Currents: but this is manifestly false, for the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and <hi>Euxine</hi> have little or no Tides, and the <hi>Baltick-Sea</hi> none at all; Therefore I wave this Opinion as altogether Erroneous.</p>

               <p>First, That the Earth and Sea have but one Center to render the whole Globe more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and Uniformly Orbicular, and so more apt for that Motion they are designed to receive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They assert, that every part and particle of this Spherical body is so tyed and threaded together by a magneticall union, that it is Impossible that the least Atome should start out of its natural situation, being fastened and fettered to its station by so inexpugnable a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netism.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60532:7"/>Thirdly, that its motion is circular; now the <hi>Flux and Reflux of the Sea,</hi> is <hi>motus Transversus,</hi> or a motion of reciprocation and rejection, like water that is justled and thrown from side to side in a Paile or Bowl: now, if it should move circular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every part would move so evenly &amp; Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that there would be no <hi>Flux or Reflux of the Sea</hi> at all. Secondly, since the <hi>Euxine, Baltick</hi> and <hi>Caspian</hi> Seas are such Considerable parts of this Globous body, they must move equally with it if it move at all; and then why have they not the same <hi>Flux and Reflux</hi> as other Seas have, since they have the same Aptitude, or natural intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique Capacity, to receive this Motion as other Seas have? But that they have not <hi>Flux or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi> at all is Demonstratively true. But whether this Opinion be so or no I refer to the Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Judicious Reader: Indeed, I could wish that those who defend the Motion of the Earth, would produce more vigorous Arguments to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and secure their Thesis, meerly to Subvert the Popes Infallibility; one of whom, not many years since, by a Signal Determination and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> blasted it for Impious, and Heretical, and Condemned the obstinate Assertors of it, to his truest Purgatory, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>

Sun is a partiall, Concurrent or Concomitant cause, I Affirme; But that it is the sole and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, I deny, and that upon these Foundations; for, if it should be, the tides in the vast Wilderness of the Northern Seas, would upon the <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> or Recesse of the Sun, shrink and Contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for want of his Vigorous Excitation to a Considerable Decrease; and again, upon his <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigaeum,</hi> or nearest Approach, swell to an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Magnitude; Both which are evidently false, for it is Generally observ'd, that about the <hi>Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Aequinox,</hi> and sometimes after, the Tides in those Seas abovesaid, are Improv'd and Increast to an Extraordinary Height; &amp; on the Contrary, about the <hi>Summer Solstice,</hi> they suffer a sensible and visible Diminution and Decrease, rather than any Augmentation: both which were absurd to Imagine, if the Sun was the Sole Efficient cause.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why should not the <hi>Caspian, Euxine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baltick</hi> Seas, be Capable of this Motion, since they are also expos'd to the Impressions of the Sun either perpendicular, or by Vibration, when he is in or near his <hi>

and drags along with it, that Heap of waters we stile the <hi>Flux,</hi> (though I do not Deny but that it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aided and assisted in this Operation by an Elater or Spring of Air, that being rescued from its Compression and confinement, ascends up with it,) and upon closing and Contracting its Face upon the Recess of those two great Luminaries, shrinks back again, and with it pulls along, that mass of waters it before had eleuated, and this produces the <hi>Reflux.</hi> And this Opinion is Supported by three Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments: The First is that of <hi>Zuingerus</hi> a modern Chymist cited by <hi>Fremondus</hi> in his Book of Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, who observ'd that some sort of Chymicall oile of vitriol did ascend and descend in Times propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate and adaequate to the <hi>Flux and Reflux of the Sea.</hi> The Second is that of <hi>Athanasius Kircherus</hi> in his <hi>Mundus Subterraneus,</hi> who there discovers to us, that an Infusion of <hi>Sal Armonick</hi> lodg'd in an open Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and plac'd obliquely to receive the Influence of the Moon, when she was in her Sextile, did Increase and Decrease as if it held an equal Correspondence, by an uninterrupted Chain of Atoms, with the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Ebbings of the Marine waters. The Third is that of <hi>Gre atricks,</hi> Glasses, upon whose sides if you beat with Important onsets, they resist their Impression, but break it at the Top, and it flies in pieces with much violence and tumult; And the Reason is, because the <hi>Armoniack</hi> or volatile Salt, that lay impriso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

sallies out, with an impetuous Eagerness, and that Eruption occasions that disorder and concussion.</p>
               <p>But I know it will be objected, why have not the <hi>Euxine, Baltick</hi> and <hi>Caspian</hi> Seas their <hi>Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi> likewise, since it is probable their waters impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as great a stock of vitriolated, volatile, or <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Salt as other Seas are entrusted with that have the same Vicissitudes; To this I answer that it is as probable they have not; But suppose they had, yet its volatile Spirit is check'd &amp; depres'd by that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of vast and deep Rivers, that perpetually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge themselves into those Seas above said; And it is likewise possible, that there is a Considerable Quantity of <hi>Sulphur, Bitumen,</hi> fixed &amp; Nitrous Salt, conducted along with there Currents, whose fixing Quality may improve the Depression of the Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and <hi>Armoniack</hi> particles, and so benum their Volatility that it is almost impossible for the united Influences of the Sun &amp; Moon, to excite their so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Vigour. But if it be enquir'd how it happens, since so many capacious streams disembogue themselves into those Seas, that the neighbouring Territories, doe not suffer under a constant Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation?
