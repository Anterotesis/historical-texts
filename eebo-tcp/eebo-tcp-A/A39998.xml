            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHAT the <hi>Israel</hi> of GOD had to Complain of, <hi>many times from my Youth have they Afflicted me,</hi> hath been the Lot of the Gospel Church from its Infancy, and of GOD's Church in this Nation in special, since the Rising Light of <hi>Reformation (that day-spring from on High)</hi> hath Shined upon her; And as the Gospel Church, so Ours in special, hath been Entitled to that Ancient Ground of Boasting in GOD, <hi>That they have not prevailed against her,</hi> though the Gates of Hell, in order to this prevalency, hath taken Crafty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and Satan hath Acted, both as the Old Serpent, and Roaring Lyon; Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in his Agents and Instruments, Policy and Barbarous Violence, Craft and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, to Compass this Design of her Ruine. Her true <hi>Gospel-Government,</hi> as well as her <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> have been frequently assaulted: But the First, as the Hedge of the other, hath been, in a peculiar way, the Eye sore of the Ungodly and Licentious; and in various and subtile Methods opposed, both in the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> thereof; and notwithstanding that other <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> have shared with her, in this piece of Trial (this Point of <hi>Church Government</hi> having for a Considerable time exercised the Pens of Contending Parties) yet, as our Church hath beyond several others, arrived at Gospel Simplicity and Purity herein, and tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Sweet Fruits of this <hi>Government,</hi> in preservation both of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> in Point of <hi>Doctrin and Worship</hi>; so the Maintaining and Contending for this Point of Truth, appears to have been the work and Testimony, in His Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly wise Providence, in a singular way Assigned to her, by her <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> that Faithful <hi>Witness</hi> and great <hi>Testator</hi>: Which is a Testimony so much the more Honourable, because of its special affinity with his own, singularly attested in his Death and Sufferings, whose Confession of his <hi>Kingly Office,</hi> and consequently his being the Political <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of his Church visible, was his special <hi>Martyr-Witness,</hi> Sealed with his Blood, the ground of his Accusation and Sentence, whereof his Triumphing Cross bore the Honourable Title and Superscription.</p>
            <p>And as all Truths have in all Ages, gained by Opposition, the apparent bruising of them by Debates causing the Savour, like that of Sweet Spices, to be the more Fragrant, so the true Frame of GOD's Tabernacle, in Point of <hi>Government,</hi> the Principles and Rights of a <hi>True Gospel Ministry,</hi> have from the Lively Oracles of GOD's Word Shined more Clearly in the solid Defences thereof, exhibit by many Godly and Learned <hi>Divines,</hi> against opposers on all hands, as is very well known to such as have sincerely inquired into this <hi>Controversy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Reproaches our Churches <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> hath been Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with since the late erection of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and particularly, since the <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> of our Nation, wearied of this heavy and Bloody Yoke, shoke it off, Restoring

and Asserting, together with our <hi>National,</hi> this our <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Church Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is Apparent to all Observers: So that the LORD's Servants, in their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Advance this Building and Restoration of our Churches True <hi>Government,</hi> have been called, as the Builders of <hi>Jerusalems</hi> Walls, to hold the Weapon and the Tool; yet (for which He that Inhabits <hi>Israels</hi> Praises, is to be for ever Blessed) the Defence hath been attended with such Glorious Success, that, in the Iudgment of the truely knowing and impartial, the Adversaries have found that they have been in this opposition, Kicking against the Pricks, and that the Truth and Cause of God, which we own, is such a Burdensome Stone, as hath quite born down and broken their Strength. I do not mean it, as if every one of that Parties lying <hi>Pamphlets</hi> hath had a particular Return; this were an unsuitable and endless Work, and but too much to Honour these empty Squibs and Crackets (as a Learned Man called such Writings) but sure I am, whatever in the Writings of our <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists,</hi> and of our late <hi>Scots Episcopalians</hi> in Special, hath any shew of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against our <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> either from Scripture, from Divine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or History, hath had a full and Evident Confutation.</p>
            <p>That I have thus appeared, while many of our Church are in this Respect silent, of whom, in Point of Ability, it may be truely said, that their Gleaning is beyond my Vintage, hath proceeded from no such Disposition and Inclination this way, as influences some to shew themselves, but as from a sincere Love to Truth, and the Cause of GOD; So by the influence of such a preventing <hi>Series</hi> of Providential Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citments, as have some way cleared my Call, and Issued in this Appearance.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Scots</hi> Writings upon this Head, which I understand to be much Current and Esteemed by disaffected Persons, and those of most considerable note in this Corner of the Nation, having been brought to my Hands; I was moved by the desires of some, to offer <hi>Animadversions</hi> upon the same, which I Judged might have their own use and advantage with such Persons; and while Writing them, I had put into my hand two other later Pieces; the one bearing the Title of <hi>The Fundamental Charter of Presbytrie Examined and disproved</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The other written by <hi>A. M.</hi> D.

The other of a more Arguing Strain, but of such a virulent tincture and Popish Composure, that the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> might seem rather a Person in some of the Popish Orders, than any bearing the Character of a <hi>Protestant</hi> Minister, if the General Designation of <hi>A.

               <pb facs="tcp:58203:5"/>
However, I found, because of the connection of Purposes, some ground to bestow a few spare times in examining his Scripture Arguings in Point of Episcopacy, which after the Finishing my Animadversions upon Dr. <hi>Scott,</hi> I set about; not knowing at that time, of any other so employed (though I much desired it) but shortly after, came out Mr. <hi>Rules</hi> Iudicious and full <hi>Confutation</hi> of this <hi>Piece</hi>; as also a little before, of the <hi>Preface</hi> of the other <hi>Pamphlet</hi> intituled The <hi>Fundamental Charter</hi> &amp;c. And about the same time, Mr. <hi>Jamison</hi>'s Learned and Elaborate Piece entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nazianzeni Querela,</hi> &amp;c. containing a Review and Confutation of what is considerable in both Pamphlets; so, that what I might further attempt upon any of these Pieces appeared Fruitless, and but <hi>actum agere</hi>; yet considering, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Principal</hi>'s Compendious way of Writing, he touched that <hi>Authors</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Arguments, in Point of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> more briefly, I resolved the more to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>large my <hi>Review</hi> of what he had thus presented. After these Sheets had for some time lyen by me, and a motion was made to make them publick, having also seen the <hi>Second part of the Survey of Naphtali,</hi> I resolved, because of the Connection of Purposes, and that this Author appears to have more closely argued this Point, than several other <hi>Episcopalians,</hi> to add to the other two, a <hi>Consideration</hi> of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> which the haste of the Press, together with other urgent duties, obliged me to perform more briefly, yet I hope, with some Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Intelligent.</p>
            <p>That these Authors are presented in such an Order, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Later</hi> before the more <hi>Ancient,</hi> hath proceeded from the Connection of References from the one to the other, and the Method wherein Providence directed the Writing of these <hi>Replys.</hi> For the Point of <hi>Antiquity</hi> (critically Scanned on both sides in this Debate) I found no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eessity here to dip in it; that being performed as to <hi>A.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING about to Examin the Pleadings of this <hi>Doctor,</hi> for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; it is necessary, that we first view how he states the <hi>Question.</hi> All do know that a right Understanding of the State and Terms of the <hi>Question,</hi> is indispensibly needful for the Decision of any Controversy. To give then, the state of the <hi>Question</hi> in the <hi>Drs.</hi> terms, which he represents in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct character <hi>page</hi> 388. He thus exhibits the Claim of both Parties; having told us, that the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> and <hi>Episcopal,</hi> are the two main rival Forms of <hi>Church Government,</hi> pretending to <hi>Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>:
<q>The <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> saith he, is that which is seated in an Equality
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58203:7"/>
or Parity of Church Officers: The <hi>Episcopal,</hi> is that which is placed in a superior Order of Church Officers, called <hi>Bishops,</hi> to whom the other Orders of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> are subject and subordinat. The Latter of which, he undertaks to prove, to be the true form of Government institut by our Saviour: And that 1. from our Saviours Institution. 2. From the Practice of the Holy Apostles. 3. From the punctual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Primitive Church to both. 4. From our Saviours decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Allowance and Approbation of the Primitive Practice in this Matter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to the State of the <hi>Question</hi>: I find the <hi>Dr.</hi> doth pitifully preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricat and mistake his Measures. 1. In representing <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as consisting in a parity of Church Officers; whereas, it is evident, we own &amp; maintain a Beautiful Subordination, both of Officers and Courts in Church Government; that <hi>Parochial Sessions</hi> are subordinate to <hi>Presbytries; Presbytries</hi> to <hi>Provincial Synods; Synods</hi> in a National Church, to <hi>National As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies</hi>: Thus likewise, we hold the <hi>Pastors</hi> Office, to be above that of the <hi>Ruling Elder</hi>; the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> Office, above that of the <hi>Deacon</hi>: Tho upon most solid Grounds, we maintain against <hi>Prelatists,</hi> an Equality in the Pastoral Office: And that among the New Testament Officers, both Ordinary and Extraordinary, there is a Partity, in their own kind, no Apostle above another, no Evangelist above another (both which Offices taken in a proper formal Sense, we hold to be expired) Thus as to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officers, no Pastor above another, nor Elder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. He represents <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, as feated in a Superior Order of Church Officers, called <hi>Bishops,</hi> to whom the Orders of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> are subject; but doth not particularly condescend upon the Nature of that Superiority, which in stating the <hi>question,</hi> should have been premised, and whether he understands it of a Superiority Specifical or Gradual, and in Order or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, or both: However, the <hi>Dr.</hi> in the strain of his Dispute, gives us to understand, that he takes the Superiority of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as importing such an Absolut and Essential Interest in Government, as leaves the <hi>Pastor</hi> nothing but the Doctrinal Key; wherein he disowns Two Points of a Concession, owned by many, if not most <hi>Episcopalians</hi>: (and in so far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Singularity and Unsoundness of his Pleading) First, That the <hi>Bishop,</hi> is no Officer, properly or essentially distinct from the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but only an Officer made distinct for order of Government: Thus K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. in his Conference with Mr. <hi>Henderson,</hi> who certainly had the Sense and Judgment of all the <hi>English Episcopal</hi> Doctors, at that time: And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in his last <hi>Dialogues,</hi> authorized by our <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church, and published in Defence thereof, in K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. Reign, 4<hi>th. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, pag.</hi> 310, 311. tells us, That he is not clear anent the <hi>Notion</hi> (as he calls it) of the distinct Offices of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58203:7"/>
the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to be of the <hi>highest Office</hi> in the Church, telling us, That the <hi>Prelat</hi> is but a different Degree in the same Office: And he gives this Reason of his Judgment,
<q>That since the Sacramental Actions, are the highest of Sacred Performances, he cannot but acknowledg, that such as are impowered for them, must be of the <hi>highest Office</hi> in the Church: And thus expresly disowns the <hi>Drs.</hi> Distinction betwixt a <hi>Bishop</hi> and a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> as a meer groundless Notion, and by consequence the whole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Pleading.</q>
Secondly, Our <hi>Scots Episcopalians,</hi> and many of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> plead for such an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power, as is managed in conjunction with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and profess to own only such a fixed Presidency of the <hi>Bishops</hi> over the <hi>Pastors,</hi> in Government, as allows them a Share and Interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and do consequently disown what the <hi>Dr.</hi> asserts, That the <hi>Bishop</hi> is the <hi>Sole</hi> Subject of Government. Let any peruse <hi>Bp. Honyman, part</hi> 2. <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of Naph. Bp. Burnet</hi> ubi supra, <hi>Bp. Lightons Two Letters,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Accommodation</hi>; yea <hi>Bp. Hall</hi> himself, in the <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi> presented to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> against <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>An.</hi> 1641. And this will be convincingly evident, the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in that <hi>Defence,</hi> is so angry at the Word <hi>Sole,</hi> in the Debate about the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power and Authority in Government, that he desires his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonists, to keep their <hi>Sole,</hi> for the use of their Shoes. It is then clear, that in the State of the <hi>Question,</hi> or Ground of this Debate, the Dr. is not one with his Fellows, which will be further discovered by Examining the Grounds he walks upon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>

                     <hi>See page</hi> 388, 389, 390, 391.</note> he endeavours, First, to prove by the <hi>Institution of our Saviour</hi>:
<q>And his great Argument is, That Christ in His Lifetime, institut two Orders of Ministers, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Apostles, and the Seventy Disciples, whose Office he proves to be subordinat to that of the Apostles, from this Ground, That they are mentioned a part as Distinct, and the Apostles placed first in the Catologue. <hi>Eph:</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. That the Scripture mentions the Twelve, and the other Disciples distinctly, and the Twelve as Chosen out from among the Disciples, and by this Call and Ordination of Christ, separate to distinct Offices from the Disciples; that the Apostles immediate Successors, were chosen out from the seventy Disciples, for most part: Thus sayes he, <hi>Simeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleophas</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem; Philip Paul</hi> at <hi>Caesarea; Clement Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Testimony of <hi>Dorotheus, Eusebius</hi>; And that by the same Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> together with <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Ierem, Matthias</hi> was one of the Seventy, that was Chosen and Ordained by the Apostles, to succeed <hi>Iudas</hi> in the Apostalate, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. And a Succession <hi>saith be,</hi> in Office supposes the superior Power in the Person, in whose place
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58203:8"/>
another succeeds, and that the person succeeding, had not that Power and Office before his Succession. That these Disciples were instructed with Ministerial Authority, he proves from <hi>Luk</hi> 10.16. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 1. where not only we find that our Lord sent them before His Face, but shews that such as heard them, did hear him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As also from this, That <hi>Ananias</hi> one of them, Baptized <hi>Paul. Acts</hi> 9.18. <hi>Philip,</hi> another of them, the <hi>Eunuch Acts</hi> 8. and also preached the Gospel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This Discours and Argument, with reference to the Drs. Scope, with a very ordinary Attention, will appear, to be but a beating of the Air, and to consist of Magisterial Dictates, instead of proof: For <hi>First,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the generality of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, and Churches, yea many <hi>Episcopalians</hi> themselves, do hold that the Office, of <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists</hi> is expired, and died with their Persons, so that neither the one nor the other admitted of a <hi>Succession:</hi> And indeed the thing it self is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and by our Divines proved from the Apostles immediat Mission, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confined Inspection, extraordinary Gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Evangelists Office, did suppose the existant Office of the Apostolate, and did consist in a planetary Motion, to Water where they Planted, and bring Reports of the State of the Churches to the Apostles, and Commissions from the Apostles to the Churches; as they make evident in the many Journies, up and down, of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> in order to this end. So that upon this Supposition, tho a Subordination were granted; yet if both Offices are expired, it can found no Argument for a Subordination among ordinary Officers, or essentially distinct Orders, in the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, which is the Point he has to prove. This will be convincingly clear, upon Two Grounds. (1.) That the body of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, do hold, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostle nor Evangelist, had any fixed Posts or Charges, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the one could not Succeed the other therein, nor could any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officer Succeed either of them, in this their Function. And (2.) That the Office, as well of the one, as the other, was suted to that Infant State and Exigence of the Church; the Apostles Work being to found Churches through the World, to plant the Gospel Government and Officers therein; and the Evangelists Work to Water their Plantations, as is above exprest. And therefore, that State and Exigence of the Church, being gone off, so are these Offices, suted thereunto. And among many other Proofs, I would fain know, what he, or any of his Perswasion, will look upon as the Scope and Intendment of their Gifts recorded in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Gifts of Tongues, Gifts of Healing, raising the Dead, striking with Death, and extraordinary Judgments the Obstinat, as <hi>Peter, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira; Paul, Elim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if not thus to Discriminat their Office. If suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Gifts be the Badg of an Office, as, to be <hi>apt to Teach,</hi> is of the Pastoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58203:8"/>
(it being certain that the Gifts and the Work bears a proportion one to another, and the Office has a relation to both) then certainly, Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts &amp; Works, must be the Badg of that Office, which is Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: So that the <hi>Drs.</hi> Proof of fixed, standing, distinct Orders and Degrees among Ordinary Church Officers, from this Instance, is quite overturned, if the Office, either of the Apostles, or of the Seventy be found Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> the weakness of the <hi>Drs.</hi> Proof, further appears, in that, instead of Proving, he takes for Granted without Proof. <hi>First,</hi> That the Apostles had a Superior distinct Mission, from that of the Seventy; for nothing of his pretended Proofs, give the least shadow of this. The <hi>Dr.</hi> acknowledges they were sent to Preach, as the Apostles themselves were, and for what appears from Scripture, with the same Authoritative Mission, since the Seventy were sent out after the Twelve, and superadded to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 10.1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Point of Succession (of which afterwards) the <hi>Dr.</hi> affords no shadow of Proof, of either of these Two. (1.) That there were Successors to the Apostles, in their formal Office of Apostolate. (2.) That these his supposed Successors, were of the number of the Seventy Disciples, for which he must offer a Divine Scripture Proof, or he says nothing. Again (in the 3d. place) Tho we should grant to the <hi>Dr.</hi> that these Seventy were placed in Inferior order to the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; yet so weak is his Cause and Pleading, that even upon this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, it is utterly lost and ruined, unless he can make it appear, that these Seventy had in their Commission, the Doctrinal Key only, but no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the Government, which is his Supposition all along, as to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal</hi> Office. Now, it is evident, beyond contradiction, that all which the <hi>Dr.</hi> has offered in this Argument, amounts not to the least shadow of a Proof of this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Twelve Apostles were the only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Church Government, had both the Keys committed unto them only, and that therein the 70 Disciples had no interest, having the Doctrinal Key only intrusted unto them: And therefore this is utterly remote from his Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Lord established such ordinary Officers, as are called <hi>Bishops,</hi> in a superior order to <hi>Pastors,</hi> as specifically distinct from them, intrusting the whole Power of Government to the First, as well as the Power of Order, and nothing at all thereof to the Second, but the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Key only.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See pag.</hi> 392.</note> let us hear what the <hi>Dr.</hi> answers to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, taken from the Apostles Extraordinary office: His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is,
<q>That this is a begging of the question, since we allow that Christ institut the Office, but gave no signification, that it was but for a Season.</q>
But <hi>First,</hi> How comes the <hi>Dr.</hi> thus to beg the question,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58203:9"/>
in supposing, that we acknowledg our Lord gave no such Signification? He should know that we own, and can make good the contrary: And the current of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, owning the Apostolick Office, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and expired, must and do by necessary consequence hold, That the Temporary Nature of the Office, hath in the Scripture Accounts thereof, our Lords implicit and consequential Intimation, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was not to Continue, but to Expire with the Persons who carried it. The <hi>Dr.</hi> may thus prove <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> if allowed to draw a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from a Concession, which is not ours, but by him falsly imputed to us. Next, the Office it self, in its Nature and End, being, as is said, Temporary (and owned so, by the Body of all our Divines) It necessarly follows, that our Lords Institution, terminat upon and relative to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was likewise thus Temporary, and determined to a certain Season: As under the Law, Gods Institution of Sacrifices and other <hi>Levitical</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, being to represent Christs Death, the very Nature of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, did determin the Continuance till Christs coming, and offering Himself, and no longer: As likewise the shadowing Typical Priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> being thus limited, did expire at his Death. Nay, our Lord in commanding His Apostles to Preach to all Nations, to every Creature, and instituting them universal Officers of the whole Catholick Church, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> both planted and to be planted, to which they had an immediat Relation, and instructing them, with extraordinary Gifts of Tongues, of Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did thus <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> and from the Nature of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self, discover His design, as to the transient Office, thus institut, and that being suted to that Exigence of the Church, it was to pass off with the same. Sure, should a <hi>Papist</hi> plead for the Perpetuity of <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> because of the Apostles anointing with Oyl, or for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of such Gifts, as the <hi>Dr.</hi> will acknowledg expired, because of our Lords Institution, and giving the Gifts, and no where Intimating that they were to be for a Season, and that these Gifts were joined to the Apostolical Office; he would answer, That the temporary transient Nature of the Gift it self, now comprobat by the Event, discovers the temporary Design thereof, and that it was not to Continue; and that therefore, there was no need, that our Lord should have given such an express Declarator, in the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or Collation of the Gift: Which Answer, he may bestow for us, upon himself, as to the Point in hand.</p>
               <p>Again, to discover further the Inconsistency and Self-contradicting Method of his Reasoning upon this Head, let it be enquired what he means by a Successor to the Apostles. If he mean a Succession to their Office, in its Nature and Extent, as delineat in Scripture, then he runs himself into gross Absurdities: For, 1. He must thus hold that our Lord Institut, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58203:9"/>
that <hi>de facto,</hi> there succeeded Twelve <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> with an universal, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Inspection over the whole Catholick Church, to be continued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with a Collateral and Equal Power. 2. If he say this (as he needs must, if he speak to the Point, and consequentialy) he will contradict what he asserts of their immediat Successors, from among the 70 Disciples, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Simeon</hi> Son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> his succeeding St. <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem; Philip,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Cesarea; Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
For if these Persons succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apostles in their unconfined Inspection over the whole World, where Churches were planted, or to be planted; how comes he to assign them fixed Stations at <hi>Ierusalem, Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>? If their Ministry was confined to these Posts, how could they succeed the Apostles in their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Inspection? And consequently how could they succeed them in the Apostolick Office? To say that a Person fixed at such and such Posts, succeeds the Apostolick Office, which was of this universal Extent, makes as good Sense and Harmony, as to say, that the Person, who is installed <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Canterburry,</hi> succeeds to the <hi>Archiepiscopal</hi> Chair thereof, and the Metropolitick Office of that <hi>Prelat,</hi> and his Primacy over <hi>England.</hi> 3. I would know, whether the <hi>Dr.</hi> in this Argument from Succession, doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiparate and make paralel his adduced illustrating Instances, <hi>viz.</hi> the Succession of <hi>Matthias</hi> in the place of <hi>Iudas,</hi> with these other Instances of <hi>Simeon, Philip</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem, Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>? If he do not, then his paralel Argument, as to the Point of Succession, is by his own Confession, like the Legs of the Lame, not equal; it being palpably absurd to prove the Succession by Instances, while the Persons instanced, as succeeding, are not of the same and equal Power and Authority: If he say, That he understands Successors, in the same Apostolick Power; then I would fain know, how he will paralel the Authority of <hi>Simeon,</hi> with a fixed Post at <hi>Ierusalem, Philip</hi> at <hi>Cesarea, Clement</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Succession of <hi>Matthias,</hi> in the Apostolick Office, by the Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without the least hint of any fixed Station, but with an universal Inspection, as the other Apostles had.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the other Branch of the <hi>Dilemma</hi>: If he mean by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to the Apostles, a Succession in a supposed Superiority over <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in a certain Precinct, not unto their Office and Authority every way, or with reference either to their Gifts, their immediat Mission, their exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Authority in the Planting and Watering of Churches (as some <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians,</hi> who speak more cautiously than the <hi>Dr.</hi> do express and limit this Succession) then it is easy, to make good that the <hi>Dr.</hi> in this Branch of the Answer, is as much in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> and that his Answer may be easily broken with a Wedg of his own setting, and that his Adversary may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily pull his Spear out of his Hand and Kill him with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, 1. His Answer to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58203:10"/>
those who alledg the Apostolick Office and Power, to be Temporary as suted to the Necessity and Exigence of that Time, and Case of the Church, without intention of deriving it into a Succession, is, First, <hi>That this is said without so much as a plausible colour of Reason</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 392.</note> And if there be no plausible colour of Reason, in denying a Succession to the Apostolick Office, the <hi>Dr.</hi> in embracing this Answer, is without all colour of Reason. 2. He tells us,
<q>That we acknowledg our Saviour institut the Apostolick Office, and that in His Institution He gave no Intimation, that it was but for a Season, and that thus in calling the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Office such, we presum to make Christs Institutions Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, without producing the Intimations of His Will, and that upon this Ground, we may repeal all Institutions of Christianity. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
But I pray, whether doth not the <hi>Dr.</hi> in this Answer, make our Lords Institution of the Apostolick Office Temporary, as in its Nature suited to that Exigence of the Time, and Infant State of the Church? And whether, he is not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his own Ground, obliged to produce the Intimation of our Lords Will hereanent? And if he cannot produce it, or rather doth hold it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimat in the Nature of the Office it self, then the <hi>Dr.</hi> must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our Exception and Answer to his premised Argument, about a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Apostles, to be valid and sound, or this his Answer and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion to be nought, and that he is therein contradictory to himself, and liable to that Absurdity, wherewith he charges us, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Of making tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and cassing all our Lords Institutions, and over-ruling the Will of God by arrogant Presumption:</q>
Which is the high-flown Imputation, the <hi>Dr.</hi> puts upon our Answer.</p>
               <p>But to bring this Matter to a short Issue, and to strick out the Bottom of his great Notion and Topick. The Power of the Keys, or the Power of Order and Jurisdiction, lying in authoritative Dispensing of Gospel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <hi>viz.</hi> The Preaching of the Word and Administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, together with the appendent Power of Disciplin and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the substantial &amp; main Piece of the Apostolick Authority and Office, and to be derived in a Succession, as necessary for the Churches Preservation, in all times; we hold to be seated properly in the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which succeeds to that of the Apostles, in the respect, and for the end mentioned, and in point of this Authority and Power, we hold, that any Pastor is equal to an Apostle; which, beside many other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that might be adduced, appears demonstratively, by this Scripture Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is evident in Scripture, that the Apostles in the first Constitution of Churches, planted <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Pastors therein, as the highest Ordinary Officers, to feed with the Word and Government, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. with <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 12. <hi>v.</hi> compared with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58203:10"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And not only so, but left these <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Pastors, as their immediat Successors, committing the whole Government to them, in their last Farewels to the Churches, without the least hint of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>institution of any Officers of an higher Order, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17.18.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. compared with 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it may be thus <hi>Argued,</hi> These, whom the Apostles placed as Chief, in the first Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Churches, and left as their immediat Successors, in their last Farewels, which they gave to the Churches, these have no ordinary Officers, superior to them, in the Church, by Divine or Apostolick War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: But the Apostles placed first, <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Pastors, feeding immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Word, Doctrin and Government, as their proper immediat <hi>Successors,</hi> and to these they committed the Churches, in their last Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels: Therefore, the <hi>Pastor</hi> hath no ordinary <hi>superior</hi> Officer to him, in Church Government, by <hi>Divine</hi> or Apostolick Warrant.</p>
               <p>Thus, we see the utter Insufficiency of the Drs. Proof, from this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, anent the Seventy Disciples, which may save us the labour of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing such Advantages, as the Exact and Critical Disputant might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, in his way of handling this Argument. It is not clear from his Discourse, whether he place these Seventy Disciples in the Office of Evangelists, or of ordinary Ministers: If he suppose and assert the First, the Strength of his Argument, is sufficiently Refuted, by what is said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: it being palpably absurd, to infer different Degrees of the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, from the <hi>Superiority</hi> of Apostles to Evangelists. If the Second, the Consequence is as absurd; the many Prerogatives of Apostles above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pastors, making such an Inference, palpably ridiculous. His Proof of the Succession of these Seventy to Apostles, in their Office, upon which he founds his Assertion of the Subordination of the one to the other, is drawn from the Succession of <hi>Simeon</hi> to <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem; Philip</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Cesarea; Clemens</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>: In which he palpably falls short, as to two essential Points thereof. 1. He offers no Divine, but an Human Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, as to this Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Dorotheus, Eusebius.</hi> 2. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no Proof from Scripture, that the Persons instanced, were of those Seventy, mentioned <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. whom our Lord sent forth after the Twelve Apostles. That the Apostles were chosen from among the Disciples, or that they are first named in the Catalogue of Church Officers <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. is a pitiful hungry Proof: For the Dr. will not say, that the Seventy were not also taken from among the number of Disciples, or that all coming under this general Denomination, were Church Officers. And as to the other point of the Nomination of the Apostles first in the Catalogue of Church Officers, even supposing it will import some special Prerogatives of these Twelve, it is utterly remote from proving either, First, that these
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58203:11"/>
Seventy might not have been in the character of Evangelists, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had a correspondent Authority, <hi>eo nomine</hi>: Or Secondly, That supposing them by their Mission, to have had the same extensive Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Twelve Apostles, that the foresaid Prerogatives of Apostles did enervat this their Authority and Commission, which was immediatly from our Lord, as well as that of the Apostles, and in its Nature and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, never retracted or limited, for any thing can be seen in Scripture.
<q>For what the Dr. objects anent the Superiority of the Apostles over the Seventy, as being in Office, not in Power and Jurisdiction: To which he answers, That the Office including the Power, must import a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in Power.</q>
It is, 1. here impertinent to the Purpose and Point, he has to prove: For upon supposition, that both Offices were Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Ceast, even admitting a Superiority of Apostles to the Disciples, it will never prove essentially different Degrees in the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, as is said. And 2. Admitting some special Prerogatives, in the Apostolick Office, above that of the Seventy, with a special respect to their Gifts, the Jurisdiction and Power, of both the one and the other, with a general Respect to Church Government, and the great and standing Ends thereof, might notwithstanding be of the same Nature and Extent. It is also here very noticeable, how the Dr. prevaricats, <hi>p.</hi> 393. and falls off the Hinges of the Point, when he makes it to ly in this,
<q>That our Lord appointed a Superiority and Subordination between Ecclesiastick Officers:</q>
Which in general, he cannot but know, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do accord unto, since we hold the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, to be above that of the <hi>Elder</hi>; and that of the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> above the <hi>Deacon</hi>: Whereas, the State of the Question, and the Drs. Undertaking therein, is anent a superior Order of Officers called <hi>Bishops,</hi> to whom the Order of <hi>Pastors</hi> is subject and subordinat; or essentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Functions in the Pastoral Office, or Degrees thereof. Now to prove this special, specifical Subordination instanced, from a Subordination of Ecclesiastick Officers in general, is to argue, <hi>a genere ad speciem affirmative. Est animal; Ergo est homo.</hi> By which Reasoning, our poorest <hi>Tyrones</hi> in the <hi>Logicks,</hi> would thus derid their Fellows (I shall not say the Dr. for good Manners sake) <hi>Es animal; Ergo es brutum.</hi> And so, I dismiss the Drs. first Argument.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Drs: <hi>Second</hi> Argument, taken from the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of the Holy Apostles, <hi>Examined.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Second</hi> Argument, whereby the Dr. undertaks to prove the the <hi>Divine Right</hi> and Institution of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> is from the <hi>Practice of the Holy Apostles</hi>: And this he prosecutes at large, from <hi>p.</hi> 393. to <hi>p.</hi> 404. His Proofs, may be thus generally summed up, and run to this issue, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That the <hi>Apostles,</hi> did not only exercise that Superiority in their own Persons, which their Office gave them over the inferiour <hi>Clergy</hi>; but also derived it down, with their Office, to their <hi>Successors</hi>: And that therefore, they look not upon the Institution of their superior Office of Apostolate, as a temporary Expedient only, but as a standing Form of Ecclesiastick Government, to be handed down to all succeeding Generations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Answer</hi> to which, I do observe, that the Dr. holds the <hi>Apostolick Office,</hi> in a Formal Sense, and in its proper Nature, with all its Ingredients, <hi>viz.</hi> immediat Mission, universal, unconfined Inspection, infallible directive Power, their Apostolick Power of Coertion by Judgments, their Gifts of Tongues and Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (all which were included in the Apostolick Office) to be an ordinary standing Function in the Church, and succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, in this its whole Nature and Extent, and as he expresses it, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded down to all succeeding Generations.</hi> Wherein, as the Dr. palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts, not only, clear Experience of all Generations, the body of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, yea all Men of Sense, that have ever bestowed their Thoughts upon this Subject;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Differ: of the time pag.</hi> 14.</note> but also his very Fellow-Pleaders in this Cause: One of their late <hi>Writers</hi> of no small Repute, in answer to this Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles Superiority over the Seventy, was Extraordinary and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, grants,
<q>That in some Things their Priviledges were Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to Cease with themselves, instancing their immediat Calling, their sending to all Nations, their Infallibility, their Gifts of Tongues, or whatever was necessary for the first Founding of the Christian Church.</q>
Clearly contradicting the Drs. absurd Assertion of a Succession to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Office, without all Limitation. But its no strang thing, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites</hi> deal Stroaks among themselves, when encamped against <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By that <hi>Superiority,</hi> which their Office gave them, over the inferior <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> he must needs understand an <hi>Official</hi> Superiority, proper the Apostles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58203:12"/>
as such, and without any Restriction, as is said; since he makes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Office, to be institut by our Lord, as Ordinary and Perpetual, and the Practice of the Apostles, in this pretended Derivation of their Office <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o Successors, to be pursuant to the Institution of our Saviour. He holds, there was nothing of the Office of Apostolate, of a Temporary Nature, or as suted to the Exigence of that Time, that it was the very same Office, without any Restriction or Limitation, which they did transmit unto Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. Thus he expresly <hi>p.</hi> 394. Now to raze this Foundation of the Drs Proof, let these Things be considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That our Divines, do Harmoniously assert the extraordinary Nature of the Apostolick Office as such, and that they could not be Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to, <hi>in idem officium &amp; eundem gradum</hi>: Particularly the Learned <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> in his <hi>Syntag. lib.</hi> 7. Cap. 11. <hi>P. (mihi.)</hi> 537.338.539. reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons up these their Prerogatives, beyond ordinary Church Officers (1) Their immediat Institution by Christ; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was called from Heaven to be an Apostle. (2) Their immediat Mission to Teach. (3.) Their Universal Legation to Plant and Found Churches: through the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. (4.) Its visible Badg, <hi>Viz:</hi> conferring the Spirit by Laying on of Hands. (5.) Immunity from Error in Teaching. (6.) Their singular Right of Spiritual Coercing the Rebellious, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Authority hereanent, and extraordinary Spiritual assistance. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. (7.) The Gift of Fore-telling Things to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26. 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3. (8.) Their extraordinary Authority beyond any Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, as being over the whole Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would consume much Time and Paper to set down the vast number of Testimonies correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this, and the thing were Superfluous: All who are acquaint with our <hi>Writers,</hi> being convinced hereof. From hence, we may thus <hi>Argue</hi>; They whose Call, whose special Work and Duties, whose Qualifications for their Work, are ceased, their Office is ceased, and they are not Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded therein: But the Apostolick Call, special Work, and their proper Qualifications, are ceased: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is evident, it consisting of a sufficient enumeration of ingredients to make up an Office, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undenyably Confirmed by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That our Divines take in these very things, mentioned in the Definition of an extraordinary Office, and as the evidences of it. The <hi>Assumption</hi> is as evident; the Appostles Call was immediat; who will deny that this is ceased? Their special Work and Duty as Apostles, was to Plant Churches, and the Gospel Ordinances and Government among them, throughout the World, and that by a special Commission intrusted to them; of all which Churches they were in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Sense, and <hi>in actu exercito</hi> Officers, And what Church Officer, dare now arrogat that to himself? Their Gifts &amp; Qualifications were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58203:12"/>
such as the working of Miracles, Gifts of Tongues, infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Doctrin: And can any deny that these are ceased?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence, as whatever he would draw the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence from, will necessarly fall within the compass of these expired Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; so, several of the <hi>Prelats</hi> pretended Prerogatives, are contrary and repugnant thereunto; such as their exercising an ordinary Power in fixed Diocesses; the Appostolick Inspection was Unfixed and extraordinary, and they were Officers, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> of the whole Church. Next, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> account themselves sole Pastors of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> tho <hi>Pastors</hi> are therein Ordained and Fixed; For they are the Fountains, from whom the Power of Order and Jurisdiction in the <hi>Diocess</hi> is dierived, and the Exercise of both depends upon their <hi>Lordly</hi> Disposal: And this Preheminency, no Apostle ever claimed, their Office being only a Declarative, Executive Ministry, not a <hi>Lordly</hi> Dominion. Besides, the <hi>Prelats</hi> negative Voice and sole Decisive Power in Judicatories, is point Blank contrair to the Apostles Carriage in that <hi>Synod, Act</hi> 15. In which the Question was stated and debated, in the ordinary way of Disputation, and the Ordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers did concurr and joyn with the Apostles, in Authorizing and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Decrees. And further, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ordinary Officers, yet deny a Subjection to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> in greater or lesser Assemblies of the Church, whereof they are professed Officers, and yet we find <hi>Paul</hi> assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Universally and indefinitly, That <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the Prophets.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. Nay we find himself receiving Imposition of Hands, and sent out by a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> upon a special Gospel legation, which did consist not of Fellow-Apostles, but of <hi>Prophets and Teachers, Act.</hi> 13.1, 2.3. But to what Assembly of <hi>Prophets,</hi> are <hi>Prelats</hi> Subject, either as to their Life or Doctrin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>; As to the perpetual ordinary Power given to the Apostles, and transmitted by them to the Church, They did neither claim, nor exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Superiority over other Ministers, but we find them, accounting them <hi>Brethren, Partners, Fellow-Labourers,</hi> and themselves <hi>Fellow-Elders</hi> with them, and as to the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Charge, their <hi>Equals</hi>; For, that ordinary Power, the Apostolick Office contained <hi>Eminenter,</hi> which they transmitted to others. But it is evident, that as they planted <hi>Elders,</hi> with equal Power in the Churches, so in their last Farewels, they committed (as is above cleared) the Government unto them, without any hint of Imparity in its exercise. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>To which, we may add in the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, that the Apostles Discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lordly,</hi> Dominion and Preheminency amongst Ministers over the Lord's Flocks, or among themselves; And the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> condemning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expresly this in <hi>Diotrophes,</hi> will infallibly prove, that they neither allowed in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58203:13"/>
others, nor exercised themselves, any such power, else their Doctrin would contradict their Practice.</p>
               <p>Hence, its infallibly clear, that to make good the Drs. Proof of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Apostles, by Instances, which he here undertaks, there are two Points, he must clearly prove and make good, as the Affirmer. 1. That these pretended Successors, did <hi>de facto</hi> exercise and hold the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office, in its whole Nature and Extent, as above delineat. 2. That <hi>de jure,</hi> the Apostles, by their Doctrin and Practice, did devolve such an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon them, to be perpetually transmitted to the Church, by Succession. And therefore, if in either, or both these, he fall short in his Instances of a pretended Succession, he but beats the Air, and loses his Design of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>That the Apostles communicated the same Office to Successors, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had communicated to them</hi>; which in <hi>terminis</hi> he asserts <hi>p.</hi> 394.</p>
               <p>This being premised, let us see how the Dr. proves by Instances, the <hi>Succession</hi> of Apostles to Apostles, as an Office still to be continued in the Church. His first Instance of Succession, is that of St. <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whose Succession, in an Apostolick, or <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence there, he labours much in the Proof of, <hi>pag.</hi> 394, 395, 396, 397. But. first, tho this Matter of Fact were granted, that <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle or Evangelist (not to stand here to discuss which) did exercise his Ministry or Apostolate there, how will it prove a Succession to the Apostolick Charge and Office in the Drs. Sense, as above delineat? And where is his Proof of any of the Apostles devolving this Charge upon him? To prove either, or both these, (as the <hi>Dr.</hi> here doth) from any Scripture, or History, which suppose <hi>Iames</hi> to be in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the exercise of his Ministry, requires to make the Reasoning valid, such rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> as hitherto, has not been heard of. What a strang Phantastick Proof is this? Scripture affirms <hi>Iames</hi> to exercise his Ministry at <hi>Ierusalem: Ergo,</hi> he had devolved upon him, by the other Apostles, the Apostolick Office, in the same Nature and Extent, as exercised by them, and committed to them, by our Saviour, and this as a perpetual Function in the Church. This is such Arguing and Rope of Sand-connection, as any may laugh at; and it is evident to common Sense, that tho the exercise of <hi>Iames</hi>'s Ministry in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> be granted, yet the Instance is as far short of being a demonstrative Proof of what the <hi>Dr.</hi> asserts and aims at, and reaching his Conclusion, as the <hi>Pigmey</hi>'s Arm, is to fetch down <hi>Ulysses</hi> Helmet.</p>

                     <hi>See p.</hi> 394.</note>The <hi>Dr.</hi> in handling this instance, endeavours to prove that the <hi>Iames</hi> spoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. and called <hi>the Lords Brother,</hi> was none of the Twelve: Wherein he contradicts good Interpreters, as might be cleard by a multiplicity of Instances, if need were. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, upon the Place, take him to be the same mentioned <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58203:13"/>
upon <hi>Act.</hi> 12.2. They shew, that after <hi>Iames</hi> was killed, this <hi>Iames</hi> spoken of here, is he, who left behind him the Epistle of <hi>Iames,</hi> and is called the Lords Brother: And upon <hi>v.</hi> 17. They affirm, that this was <hi>Iames</hi> the less. The Authors of <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>Pool. Annot.</hi> upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. Do assert, That he was one of the Twelve Apostles, paralelling this passage touching <hi>Iames,</hi> with <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. The <hi>Drs.</hi> Proof, that he was not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, because <hi>Paul</hi> reckons him a part from the Twelve. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5.6.7. is utterly insufficient. The Authors of <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Pool. Annot.</hi> draw no such Conclusion upon that <hi>verse,</hi> but insinuat rather the contrar: And the <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines are peremptor, that the <hi>Iames</hi> mentioned in that Text, was the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> and one of the Two, in the Catalogue of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. The <hi>Drs.</hi> Proof, from his being mentioned a part from the Twelve, is a pitiful lax Conceit: For, if the Apostle saying <hi>v.</hi> 7. That our Lord was seen of <hi>Iames,</hi> then of all the Apostles, will prove that <hi>Iames</hi> was not of the number; his saying <hi>v.</hi> 5. That our Lord was seen of <hi>Cephas,</hi> then of the Twelve, will by the same Reason prove, that <hi>Peter</hi> was none of the number. The <hi>Doctor</hi> would needs have him the Thirteenth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and the first that was made an Apostle, after the Twelve. I had thought, that <hi>Matthias</hi> was the first Person made an Apostle, after our Lords Ascension, to make up the number of Twelve and supply the room of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> was next added by our Lords special Call from Heaven; but when, or where, or by whom, another <hi>Iames,</hi> than either of the two mentioned by the Evangelist, was Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut a Thirteenth Apostle, is a Point, I am sure, far surcharging the <hi>Drs</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to prove, and his proofs here adduced are such, as the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest may Laugh at:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 394.395.</note> Whereof this is one.
<q>That the Scripture makes it evident, that this <hi>Iames</hi> had the great Preheminence in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: And next, That in the Council <hi>Act.</hi> 15. he gave the Decisive Sentence, calling it his Sentence. <hi>v.</hi> 19. and determined the Controversie, after that <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Judgment: Which Argues, <hi>saith</hi> the <hi>Dr.</hi> that he had great Authority and Preheminence in that place.</q>
An odd proof, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. Behold the Visag of this Argument! The Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> spoke last in the Council of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he called the Judgment he delivered upon the Question, his Sentence, after others had spoken, the Controversie came then to an Issue: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was of Special and Eminent Authority in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> beyond any of the Apostles; And this, as a supernumerary Thirteenth Apostle Constitut by the rest to succeed in that Office, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Office of Apostolat to after Generations. It is indeed a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to me, whether this Assertion and Conclusion it self, or the <hi>Dr</hi>'s Method of deducing it, be more absurd; But sure I am, both are, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58203:14"/>
that in an eminent degree. The <hi>Dr.</hi> has so wonderful a value for <hi>Prelacy,</hi> that he will needs have this new supposed <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> preferred upon that account, by all the Apostles, to themselves, and set up in the Chair to presid in the <hi>Council,</hi> as the Worthiest, yea, and that his very Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the account of his high <hi>Prelatick</hi> Office, outweighed all the Apostles Sentiments, <hi>and ended the Controversie,</hi> as he expresses it. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit this is, and Phantastick account of that Scripture, as I dare challenge the <hi>Dr.</hi> to show if it ever came in the mind of any <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers. It would have suted the <hi>Drs.</hi> serious Thoughts to ponder, whether that which was delivered by others, in this meeting, and in special by the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> was not their Sentence, as well as that delivered by <hi>James,</hi> and whether both these Sentences of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> were not the same, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the same Scripture Grounds; and whether the delivering of a Sentence or Judgment in a Judicatory, which the Meeting finds equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and do accord to, upon Grounds offered by him, and some others, speaking before him, can conclud an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority over the Meeting.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But to proceed, the <hi>Dr. (ibid)</hi> Argues further, from the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> his going in to <hi>James,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. Upon the account of his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> altho none of the Twelve, &amp; that he is upon this account preferred to <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>John,</hi> &amp; had the Priority of them both, in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </q>
A conceit sufficiently refuted by a recitation. What! The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> become so high a <hi>Prelatist,</hi> that a New Constitut <hi>Bishop</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is by him preferred to Pillar-Apostles, as having a Priority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them in that Church. I had thought that our Blessed Lord, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and Authorized his Apostles, as the Universal Doctors of the whole Church, before this time, as the Foundation and Pillars thereof; So they are called by the Apostle <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 2.20. And that the Lord, in Sealing them solemnly by the Spirit, the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> from whence the Law was to go forth, had recommended them as his highest Doctors and Apostles, both to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to all the Churches; and that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry had the First and Eminent Seals there; yea and that the Apostleship of the Circumcision, was especially committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and consequently his Apostolical Authority at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> singularly conspicuous, weighty, and acknowledged, where his Ministry was chiefly exercised, and this by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s own acknowledgment <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.7. And that he paid so great deference to this Apostle, that he went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to see and visit him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. Besides that, the <hi>Dr.</hi> supposing this <hi>James</hi> not to be one of the Twelve, is cross to the current of <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers and Commentators, as we have said. As for <hi>Paul</hi>'s going into <hi>James,</hi> with the Elders <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. Which the <hi>Dr.</hi> saith will prove, that <hi>James</hi> was of greatest note and Figure in that Church; If the <hi>Dr.</hi> mean his exercising his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58203:14"/>
Ministry there at that time, and that he was of eminent Note among the Elders, or ordinary Ministers: As who can doubt of this in respect of his Apostolick Office? This is easily accorded; But the Drs. Inference from this, that he was of greatest Note and Figure among the Apostles, yea and, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and moreover, as in the Capacity of a Supernumerary Apostle and <hi>Bishop,</hi> added to the Twelve, he will as soon squeeze Water from a Flint, as draw it from this Scripture.
<q>The <hi>Dr.</hi> tells us <hi>P.</hi> 395.396. That, as what he has said, renders it highly probable, that <hi>Iames</hi> was Apostle at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> peculiarly, and had the Priority of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> therein, so the Testimmonyes of early Antiquity, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this probability to a Demonstration.</q>
Whereupon, he Cites <hi>Hegesip.</hi> and <hi>Euseb. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Clement. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. and some others. That <hi>Iames,</hi> whom the <hi>Dr.</hi> takes not to have been an Apostle, till constitut Apostle and <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> appears to the <hi>Dr.</hi> upon the pretended premised Scripture Grounds, upon this account, preferred to both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> tho Pillars, hath so exposed his Understanding of the Scriptures, as doth much save the Labour of an Adversaries discovering his Nakedness in this Point. Besides, it seems with the <hi>Dr.</hi> that Human Testimonies of Antiquity, and of Human Writers, puts the Cape-stone upon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats Scripture-proof; So that, what was upon the Scripture proof, but probable, upon the high accession of Human Testimonies, is with him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a Demonstration: But the <hi>Dr</hi> must be minded, that if his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Divine Proof, which must be both of the <hi>Factum</hi> and the <hi>Ius,</hi> as to <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> obliges him to draw his Demonstration of both from Scripture, and if by his acknouledgment, all his Scripture Proof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts but to a probability, his pretended Demonstration, made up by the patchment of Human Testimony, added to the Divine, as giving the Demonstrative evidence and Strength thereunto, is a Demonstration like to the Feet of the Image of Clay and Iron, which could never make one intire piece, and cleave together.</p>
               <p>Next, For his <hi>Testimonies,</hi> the <hi>Dr.</hi> cannot but know, that in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Famous <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, this Proof, from the Testimonies of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the Denomination of <hi>Bishops</hi> by them, put upon Eminent Ministers, and even some in the Apostolick times, is a very slippery and uncertain Proof.

And to this purpose he speaks at large, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. making good his Assertion from the unfixed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Nature of their Office, who were to follow the Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, towards all places, wherever they were called.

                  <q>That such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, as they found in the Church Records, more famous, such they cull'd out, to make up their Catalogues, even tho they were contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and those they named <hi>Bishops,</hi> in conformity to their own times; whereas, saith he, there were many <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> at once appointed by the Apostles in the Churches.</q>
Hence has proceeded this Confusion in the Catalogues; for instance. they make <hi>Peter Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Seat there (a Fable contradicted by many of the Learned. and proved by them, to be such) but whether <hi>Clement</hi> was First or Third, and who, or in what Order, next after Succeeded them, whether <hi>Linus,</hi> or <hi>Anacletus</hi> is never yet cleared. Some make <hi>Titus Bishop</hi> of <hi>Crete;</hi> some <hi>Arch-Bishop;</hi> some <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Dalmatia.

The <hi>Dr.</hi> also should have done well, to have considered the important difficulty offered by <hi>Iosephus Scaliger,</hi> about the Succession of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (related by <hi>Didoclav. Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>P.</hi> 123.) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he proves <hi>Eusebius</hi> Relation to be contrary to our Lords Prophesie anent the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and to <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s History. As likewise, what this Learned Author, hath observed and written, to invalidat the Credit of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s History, and the discovery he has made of his many gross Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors therein, as well as in other Points. So that our <hi>Dr.</hi> and his Fellow-pleaders, might have observed this their grand Magazin, to be but a corrupt Treasure, and Poisoned Fountain. How Fabulous is the Epistle of Christ to <hi>Agbarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa,</hi> related by him? That which <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> wrote of the <hi>Esseans,</hi> a Sect among the <hi>Iews, Eusebius</hi> affirms that he Wrote it of Christian <hi>Monks,</hi> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> (in his <hi>Elencho tri Haeresii</hi>) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of falsehood, out of <hi>Philo</hi> himself. He proves <hi>Peters</hi> Crucifixion at <hi>Rome,</hi> by a Tomb-proof. In the Computation of Times, <hi>Scaliger,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves his gross Errors. Nay, which is more considerable, he discovers gross ignorance of Scripture, in saying that the <hi>Cephas</hi> reprehended by <hi>Paul,</hi> was not the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> but another of the Number of the Seventy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. To which might be added, many things in his personal Carriag and Qualities, which doth weaken the Credit of his History, as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in the Council of <hi>Tyre,</hi> against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and standing upon the <hi>Arrian side. Scaliger</hi> in his <hi>Thesaurus temporum (Animad. P.</hi> 268) Sets down the Testimonies of the Ancients, concerning his Errors, and <hi>Arrianism,</hi> wherein some affirm that he died. When he Wrote the History, he was in the Judgment of some an <hi>Arrian.</hi> And even admitting the unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableness of his History, when first Written, yet that it hath been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by some ignorant Impostor, is by <hi>Didoclav. Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>P.</hi> 111. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrat from this, that he makes mention of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who was born an Hundred Years after his time. Had the Doctor also Perused the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Reynolds,</hi> he might have found that in his Epistle to Sir <hi>Francis Knolls,</hi> he proves at large, from <hi>Chrysostom, Ierom, Ambrose, Augustin, Theodoret,</hi> and many others, both Ancient and Modern Authors, that in Scripture <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> are all one. The Epistles of <hi>Clement,</hi> of the first Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, are very pregnant against the Divine Right of <hi>Prelacy</hi>; particularly his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> wherein he makes but Two Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> which he says, the Apostles set up to propogat the Ordinances to Believers. But I am too prolix, in a Matter of it self, clear and plain, and which, we may probably have occasion again to touch:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58203:16"/>
Only before I part with the <hi>Drs.</hi> First Instance, I cannot but in this place observe, and again leave it to the Readers consideration, that the <hi>Dr.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this <hi>Apostleship,</hi> which <hi>Iames</hi> did derive from the Twelve, was only an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Inspection of the Church in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: A strang <hi>Apostleship</hi> indeed! and so very far unlike and disproportioned to the Apostolick Office, that he might as well affirm, that any <hi>Curat</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when set over a Flock or Cure, has an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority committed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Drs.</hi> Second Instance, to prove the Apostles committing their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Authority to Successors, is taken from <hi>Epaphroditus Philip.</hi>

Who shews, that others were Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apostles, as <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>; And <hi>Theodtret,</hi> holding that he was Constitut their <hi>Bishop.</hi>
                  </q>
I answer 1. Tho his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority over this Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi> were granted to the <hi>Dr.</hi> it will never come up to prove his Point and Assertion of devolving the Apostolick Office upon him, but rather proves the contrary; it being evident, both from the Nature of the Thing it self, and in the Judgment of Judicious Divines, that these Two Offices are incompatible and inconsistent, and it is a greater degrading of the Office of Apostolat, as it stands delineat in Scripture, to restrict it to any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, than to make the <hi>Primat</hi> of <hi>England, Curat</hi> of any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. 2. The <hi>Dr.</hi> doth grosly mistake this Denomination of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> while making it Import his being their <hi>Bishop,</hi> as is obvious to any that Reads the Text, and will view Commentators upon the place, as might be easily and at large, made appear, if our intended brevity did permit.
<q>The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines upon the Passage, tells us, That the Word <hi>Apostle</hi> signifies one, who was Called and sent forth by Christ himself, to Preach the Gospel through the whole World (meaning in its Strict and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acceptation) for clearing which they Cite <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</q>
And here the <hi>Dr.</hi> may observe, how they take the Nature and Extent of the Apostolick Office. Then they add.
<q>But here it is taken more largely, in General, for one, who is sent forth by any one to act any Thing in his Name, or for him: He was by the <hi>Philippians</hi> sent unto <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> to carry him that which they had Contribut for his Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinance, Citing <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.18. Where the Apostle shews that he had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what was sent by <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>: Which discovers the Folly of the <hi>Drs.</hi> gloss. They add; That if it be rendered, their <hi>Teacher,</hi> the Word is sometimes taken so, in a General Sense, for any kind of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. Where the Phrase of <hi>Note among the Apostles,</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, among them, who Preached the Gospel here and there, paralelling this with that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. Where the Phrase of <hi>Messengers</hi> or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the Churches, is ascribed to other Brethren, together with <hi>Titus,</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58203:16"/>
and imports only Messengers and Teachers.</q>
So, That altho the Phrase of <hi>your Messenger or Apostle,</hi> were in this place admitted to import a Pastoral Relation to <hi>Philippi,</hi> it is as far from coming up to a Proof of the <hi>Drs.</hi> Gloss, as East from West. <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place shews, that <hi>Graece loquentes <gap reason="foreign">

For what the <hi>Dr.</hi> adds (<hi>ubi supra.</hi>) of <hi>Ierem</hi> and <hi>Theodoret;</hi> It is easily answered, that the Word <hi>Apostle</hi> ot <hi>Bishop,</hi> is by them used in a General Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, as might be cleared from many Passages of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> especially <hi>Ierom,</hi> holding that through the Apostolick times, <hi>communi Concilio Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terorum Ecclesiae gubernabantur;</hi> Thus in his <hi>Comment.</hi> upon <hi>Titus,</hi> where he proves this from <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Drs</hi> Third Instance, (P. 398) is of <hi>Titus,</hi> and some others, whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. Calls <hi>Messengers,</hi> or in the <hi>Greek, Apostles of the Churches,</hi> which the <hi>Dr.</hi> takes to hold out their Apostolick Authority over the same, and will not have the Phrase to Import their Relation to these Churches, whose liberality they carried. Thereafter, he Insists upon the Instance of <hi>Titus,</hi> whose <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority over <hi>Crete,</hi> he endeavours to prove from the Epistle written to him. To the Instance, First in the General, I <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> that the <hi>Drs.</hi> Sense of the Passage Cited, is but his own Imagination, without the least Shaddow of Ground in the Words or Context, especially taking it to Import an Apostolick Authority, in his Sense, as might be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by multiplyed instances, if needful. We heard that the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>The Authors of <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>Pool Annot.</hi> Thus Sense the Passage, <hi>Viz,</hi> That the Apostle calls <hi>Titus</hi> his Fellow-helper in the Business of the Gospel; for the others, he tells them, they were such, as the Churches thought fit to make their Messengers, and had the Credit of the Churches, whose Messengers they were, since the Churches would not have Instructed them, if they had not Judged them Faithful.</q>
Both which Senses stands clearly cross to that which the <hi>Dr.</hi> Grounds upon. And to discover further, the weakness of his Reasoning, even granting that this Text would Import a Fixed <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of <hi>Titus</hi> and these other Messengers, over some Churches, how doth it prove the Apostles devolving upon them, the entire Apostolick Office, in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58203:17"/>
the same Nature and Extent, as it was committed to the Twelve, by our Saviour? The <hi>Dr.</hi> will never be able to knit this Antecedent and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, by Scripture or Divine Reason: And this being the Point, he is all along undertaking to prove, any may see how palpably he mistakes and misses his Mark, in these Instances.</p>
               <p>But now to examin the Drs. proof of <hi>Titus</hi>'s <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> these Things I do in general <hi>premise,</hi> which do cut the Sinews of his, or any others Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings for the pretended <hi>Episcopacy</hi> of <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> over these Churches. 1. In Churches already constitut, this Authority, was not solely seated in them, they were only to go before the Churches, in wholesome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, in relation to the planting of Ministers; not to do as they pleased, excluding others, as judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> expresses it, <hi>Instit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. since <hi>Paul</hi> himself, neither imposed Hands, nor Excommunicat alone in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches constitut: And a whole Colledge of Apostles, had the ordinary El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders going along with them, in a <hi>Synodal</hi> Procedure, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. far less, could <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> assum this <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence, who were inferior to Apostles. 2. After the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was Exedified and Compleated, in its Organick Beeing, and after <hi>Timothy</hi> had gotten his Charge, as to Ordination and Jurisdiction in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in the first Epistle directed to him (wherein the Dr. and his Fellows, hold him to be instructed with <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority) <hi>Paul</hi> committed the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power and Charge to the <hi>Elders,</hi> before <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Face, in his last Farewel to that Church, calling these Elders, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and enjoyning them the Exercise of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as appointed by the Holy Ghost, and this without the least Hint of any Inspection or Authority, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had over them hereanent, or of any relation they had to him in this Matter; thus <hi>Act.</hi> 20. And the same Judgment by necessary consequence, we must make of <hi>Titus,</hi> since the Dr. and his Fellows draw their proofs equally as to both, from these Epistles. 3. In these Epistles themselves, their Power stands so described and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiat as to Ordination and Jurisdiction, over these Churches, as it clearly excluds an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence and Authority: For, <hi>First,</hi> As Diocesan <hi>Bishops,</hi> they ought to have been designedly set and fixed as Officers in these Churches; but the contrary appears in the Text [<hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought thee to abide still at</hi> Ephesus] saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> And again to <hi>Titus,</hi> [<hi>I left thee at</hi> Crete— <hi>and to set in order things that are wanting</hi>] Which words point at an occasional, transient Imployment there, not a fixed Instalment. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In these Epistles, they are both called back, without the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of their returning. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If their Power was <hi>Episcopal</hi> and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, then in the Apostles Prescriptions and Rules, anent their Successors, the Power and Authority of these Successors, ought to have been descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and Rules given, touching the Gifts, Call, Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58203:17"/>
Diocesan <hi>Bishop,</hi> especially, since the Dr. holds, that the Description of, and Authorizing such a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is the great scope of both these Epistles, and he will not say, that this Office was to die with <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>: But so it is, that the Apostle prescribs no Rules for any Church Officer, higher than a <hi>Pastor,</hi> and supposes still that he is the highest Ordinary Church Officer, in all his Rules and Prescriptions, in point of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, delivered either in these Epistles, or any where else in Scripture. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As <hi>Timothy</hi> is expresly called an <hi>Evangelist</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Titus</hi> is supposed to hold the same Office; so this Office in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, is acknowledged and held to be Extraordinary and Expired, as that of the Apostles: The Work and Exercise thereof, consisting in a planetary Motion, to Water, where the Apostles Planted, to bring Instructions from the Apostles to the Churches, touching the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both Pastors and People, and Reports of the Churches State, to the Apostles. So their Office, supposing the Churches, <hi>in fieri,</hi> as to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick Beeing, in a great measure at least, and also the Existence and Exercise of the Apostolick Office, they must needs be, as the Apostles themselves, Extraordinary Officers. And in special, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying <hi>Paul</hi> in his Travels, and continual planetary Motion, being so clearly held out in Scripture, concluds the Impossibility of their being fixed to any Station, and proves that Character given to them by <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as <hi>Evangelists, viz:</hi> That they did <hi>Evangelizare sine Cathedra.</hi> Their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual planetary Motion, is by some largly described from the Apostolick Epistles, and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles: Thus, first <hi>Timothy</hi> is found at <hi>Berea</hi> with <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 17.14. then at <hi>Athens v.</hi> 15. thence <hi>Paul</hi> sends him to <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.1, 2. Then having been at <hi>Macedonia</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> he came to him to <hi>Corinth Act.</hi> 18.5. Then he is with him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and thence sent to <hi>Macedonia Act.</hi> 19.22. whether <hi>Paul</hi> went after him, and was by him accompanied into <hi>Asia Act.</hi> 20. He is with him at <hi>Troas v.</hi> 5. and at <hi>Miletus v.</hi> 17. where <hi>Paul</hi> gave the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> their last Charge, as the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Church: And after this, he is found either in Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or absent from <hi>Ephesus</hi>; For, after he is found a Prisoner with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> being mentioned as his Companion in these Epistles, written while <hi>Paul</hi> was there; as the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians Philip.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Philem. v.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.1. And he is never found again at <hi>Ephesus;</hi> But towards the end of the Apostles Pilgrimage, is sent for to <hi>Rome.</hi> So, <hi>Titus</hi> is found at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> before he came to <hi>Crete, Gal.</hi> 2.1. thence is sent for to <hi>Nicopolis Tit.</hi> 3.12. then to <hi>Corinth</hi>: Then he is expected at <hi>Troas,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, 13. and meets with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6. whence he is again sent to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. And after this, near the time of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Death, is found at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence he went, not to <hi>Crete,</hi> but to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.

10. And after this, is not heard of in Scripture. So that, whether we consider, 1. The various Journies. 2. The order of them. 3. The time spent in them. 4. The nature of their Imployment, which was, as the Apostles Co-adjutors, to negotiat the Affairs of the Churches, where they travelled, and especially the Scripture-silence of their being <hi>Bishops</hi> of any one Church; their supposed <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority in these Churches of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> doth palpably appear to be an Anti-scriptural ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Fiction. This Conclusion upon the premised accurat Search and Scripture account of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> is thus inferred by the reverend and learned Divines, in their Conference at the Isle of <hi>Wight;</hi> The Authors of <hi>Ius divinum minist.

It is Answered. 1<hi>mo.</hi> Tho an <hi>Episcopal</hi> inspection over this Church were granted, the <hi>Dr.</hi> is infinitly behind in his Proof of <hi>Paul</hi>'s devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon <hi>Titus,</hi> an Apostolical Authority, in the Scripture Sense and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as we have often told him. 2<hi>do.</hi> Upon supposition of that, which we have before made good, <hi>Viz</hi>: That both <hi>Paul</hi> as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> had extraordinary Offices, and suted to such a Case and exigence of the Christian Church, as is now gone off, this direction and Command, proper and peculiar to the one and the other, as <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and supposing this Exigence of the Church, can lay no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Duty of Ordinary Officers. 3<hi>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> By what consequence can the <hi>Dr.</hi> infer an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority and Inspection, from these prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Titus,</hi> unless he can prove the absolut seclusion of Ministers from the Work here enjoyned, or any interest therein, in Churches Constitut? For, as for what they did in the Constitution of Churches, <hi>in fieri,</hi> is not to the purpose (I mean in respect of the Organick being) especially, since we find that the laying on of Hands in Ordination, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, is in Scripture held out, to be competent to a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> which they exercised upon <hi>Timothy</hi> himself, one of our <hi>Drs</hi> supposed Apostles or <hi>Bishops,</hi> and that tho <hi>Paul</hi> was present 1 <hi>Tim</hi>: 4.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. So that it is evident, that neither <hi>Timothy</hi> nor <hi>Titus,</hi> were instructed with any singular <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority in this Matter, among Churches Constitut in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58203:18"/>
their Organick Beeing. In the 4<hi>th</hi> place, the <hi>Drs</hi> absurd Assertion of <hi>a Supreme and Absolut Power,</hi> to Reform and Correct, drawn from this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, doth obviously appear to the meanest Reflection: For, 1. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves, arrogat no absolut or supreme Power; <hi>Paul</hi> disowns a Dominion, and asserts a Ministerial Authority only competent unto him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. I had alwise thought, that in the Judgment of all <hi>Protestants,</hi> yea of all Men of Sense, who ever read the Scriptures, there is none hath <hi>a supreme Iudgment, or absolut Power</hi> over the Church of God, but He who is the Churches Head and Husband, there being but one Lord, and all Ministers being <hi>Brethren,</hi> one Master of the House of God, who hath Dominion over the Ordinances, under whom, even Apostles, are but <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> which I suppose, none, if not this Dr. will deny. 2. Its strang, that in reading this Passage, the Drs. Eyes and Thoughts, could not fix upon and ponder the important last Clause of the Words, <hi>viz,</hi> [<hi>As I had appointed thee</hi>] which doth very clearly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and import, both the Apostles superior Authority to <hi>Titus,</hi> and his restricting him to his Rules, and authorizing Information in this Matter: And how these can consist with <hi>Titus</hi>'s <hi>supreme Iudgment herein, and absolut Power,</hi> will sute the Drs. greatest Skill to prove and demonstrat. In a word, this odd Inference of such a supposed Power in <hi>Titus,</hi> is disowned by all sound Interpreters, as might be easily made appear: And in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, tells us, upon this Passage,
<q>That <hi>Titus.</hi> was not to perform this by his own Authority, and good Pleasure only, (as the Dr. holds,) but according to the Order, which the Apostle prescribed, and did observe himself; paralelling this with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>Elders</hi> concurred with <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination: And this last Clause of the <hi>Verse,</hi> they render [<hi>As I commanded thee</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Drs. <hi>Second</hi> Proof of <hi>Titus</hi>'s Apostolick Authority, is, (<hi>P.</hi> 399)
<q>That he is authorized to <hi>ordain Elders in every City</hi>: And there being <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Elders in <hi>Crete,</hi> left by the Apostle, before <hi>Titus</hi> was left there, who yet had no power to Ordain, else <hi>Titus</hi>'s power of Ordination had been in vain, and an invasion of their power as a <hi>Preshytry</hi>: Therefore, this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Ordination, was competent to <hi>Titus</hi> only, not to <hi>Presbyters</hi>; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, since it is extended, not only to Ordination of Elders, but also to Rebuking with Authority, to the Correction of Offenders, with the Rod of Excommunication, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.15. To Admonish Hereticks, and to Reject them from Communion of the Church, if obstinat, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.10. From all which, the Dr. concluds his Apostolat in the Church of <hi>Crete,</hi> to be the same that the first Apostles themselves had, in the several Churches planted by them.</q>
I <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. The Dr. doth nothing but here again beg the Question, and argue <hi>ex ignoratione elenchi,</hi> and this one
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58203:19"/>
point being but supposed, That the Office of Apostles and Evangelists was Extraordinary, (and we may justly suppose it, having above made it good) this Arguing appears mere puerile Sophistry. But 2. To come more closly to the Drs. Arguing: As for the laying on of Hands in Ordination, we have told him, That it is a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Act, competent to mere <hi>Presbyters</hi>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither <hi>Timothy</hi> nor <hi>Titus,</hi> could have a Sole or <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, unless the <hi>Dr.</hi> will make the Scripture inconsistent with it self. Next as for his Authority in his Rebuking and Censures, supposed in these Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. I answer, That neither can this be <hi>Titus</hi>'s sole Prerogative: For, either it is meant of a private Rebuke, and this every Christian hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in, [— <hi>thou shalt in any wise, Rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer Sin upon him. Levit.</hi> 19.17.] or of a Ministerial Rebuke, and this is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to every Minister of the Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. And besides, Institutions and Reproofs of Church Officers, will not prove a fixed <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power. Prophets Rebuked, but had no Jurisdiction over Priests; nor <hi>Paul</hi> over <hi>Peter,</hi> tho he reproved him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we find the Authority, to receive Accusations, and to Correct De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents by Reproofs and Censures, competent to the Juridical Courts and Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12. In which places, a judicial Rebuke and Admonition, is attributed to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridical Court of Pastors, not to one <hi>Prelat,</hi> not, <hi>uni,</hi> but <hi>unitati.</hi> 3.
<q>As for the Drs. Notion, of a supposed existence of Elders in that Church, who had no power of Ordination,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> else this Prescription, which the Apostle gives <hi>Titus</hi> to Ordain, had been fruitless, and an Invasion of their Power, in the Drs. Judgment.</q>
I deny his Consequence as having no twist of a Connection: For (1.) Upon supposition of Apostles or Evangelists extraordinary Offices, <hi>Pauls</hi> instructing <hi>Titus,</hi> and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Ordination thereupon, was a power and Authority, <hi>Cumulative</hi> unto, but not <hi>Privative</hi> of the Ordinary Officers and Elders their standing, and ordinary Authority herein: It being certain, that this Authority of Apostles and Evangelists, as is above described, could not bevoided, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever advance of Gospel Ordinances there was in Churches, these extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers, had still their Authority and Inspection vigent. I suppose the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had in the presence of <hi>Titus</hi> (the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi> in the Drs. sense) ordained Ministers or Elders in this Church, will he own the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that this did nullify <hi>Titus</hi>'s Authority herein, as <hi>Bishop</hi>? Surely not: And thus he must acknowledg our Plea to be clear, as to the reserved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Pastors or Elderships, notwithstanding of the Apostolical Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions instanced. (2.) Elders once ordained, its true, have power to ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; yet the <hi>bene esse,</hi> did call for the Inspection and Direction of such highly gifted and extraordinary Officers as <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and their interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58203:19"/>
Authority in that infant-state of the Church, wherein Apostolick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Rules, in reference to Government, were to be delivered to the Churches, and practised accordingly. And in a word, the Dr. neither hath, nor can prove, that <hi>Titus</hi> did ordain here alone, or solely perform any other authoritative Act, where Elders were present, and the Churches redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an Organick Mould and Form; which is the consentient Judgment of sound <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines. Judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, will tell him, That <hi>Titus</hi> here acted only as a President or Moderator, which is clearly evinced from the Authority and Power of Elderships asserted in Scripture. And we may retort upon the Dr. thus; If neither <hi>Apostles</hi> nor <hi>Evangelists</hi> (extraordinary and highly gifted Officers) did exercise their Power to the prejudice of standing Elderships, or juridical Courts of Pastors, much less ought any ordinary Church Officer, arrogat such a Dominion and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Courts of Christ, and Judicatories of His Church, when the Office of Apostles and Evangelists is ceased.

It should seem the ordinary Rule will take place here, <hi>non est distinguendum, ubi Lex non distinguit</hi>; since the Precepts are equally delivered, and without the least Intimation of such a difference or distinction: The person who makes the distinction, seems Chargable with arrogant Anti-scriptural Boldness.</p>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 401.</note> that the Apostolick Precept. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.

Now, what if any shall lash the <hi>Dr.</hi> with his own Argument, and Plead from the Apostles Solemn Charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.

not to them: What Answer and evasion can he have to save him, from a Contradiction and inconsistency with himself? If his own Argument be good against us, upon the forementioned Ground, why not the very same Argument in this Case against himself? The <hi>Drs.</hi> only Answer and evasion, which he can have, is, That these Commands, as to the Exercise of the Power of Order, or respecting Pastoral Duties in general, tho pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly addressed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet could give him no peculiar or sole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest therein, because <hi>Presbyters</hi> are elsewhere in Scripture Instructed with the same Power. But 1. In this Answer, he breaks his Argument all in pieces, the Strength whereof is drawn from <hi>the peculiar addressing these Precepts to</hi> Timothy; But here he acknowledges that the peculiar Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress will bear no such conclusion of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s sole Interest in the Duty enjoyned. And 2. If he say, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> peculiar Interest and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is elsewhere evident in Scripture, who sees not, that he but pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beggs the Question, and baffls his own General Argument: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should know, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> stand upon an advantagious Ground with him in this Point; For we hold, and can prove that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Jurisdiction is prescribed and competent to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> since the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shews the Power of Ordination, to be seated in a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. with Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.66. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.

                  </gap> that what was prescribed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in Point of Order and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, was confined within the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and not rather to be exercised through all other Churches, as the Apostle enjoined him? And if this last must needs be asserted, upon the Ground of his <hi>Evangelistick</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient imployment through the Churches, as is above, from Scrp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evinced and delineat, it follows by inevitable consequence, that the Addressing of these Prescriptions to him, while at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> can infer no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Relation he had to that Church, but respected the Exercise of his <hi>Evangelistick</hi> Office in other Churches, as well as there; especially since

the Apostle here enjoins him, to do the Work of an <hi>Evangelist. i. e.</hi> of such an unfixed transient Minister, as is above described, not the work of a <hi>Prelat,</hi> over this Church; If the <hi>Dr.</hi> deny this, he will advance him to a <hi>Metrapolitan</hi> over several other Churches; or else must quite his plea.

And if so, as himself doth hold and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, notwithstanding of the Addressing of Precepts to <hi>Timothy</hi> hereanent, why were such Precepts addressed to <hi>Timothy?</hi> Why was not this left to the perfectly Constitut <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> and Precepts only in Point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment addressed to him? (Especially since its known, the <hi>Bishops</hi> do not much concern themselves in Teaching and these other Ministerial Duties, exprest in the Precepts abovementioned) And if the Prior Authority of a Constitut <hi>Presbytrie</hi> hereanent, was no Just Ground to stop the Apostles Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the Power of Order, and such Ministerial Duties, as are contained in the forementioned Precepts, nor can infer <hi>Timothy</hi>'s sole Interest therein, why I pray, shall this Reason be valid in point of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? What will the <hi>Dr.</hi> Answer, if one should improve his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thus? Notwithstanding of <hi>Pauls</hi> great pains in Preaching and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting a perfect <hi>Presbytrie</hi> (to use his own term) and that there were many Pastors, gifted to Preach and admonish, yet the Apostle afterward in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> gave this Commandment to him, not to them: Therefore this is proper and peculiar to the <hi>Bishop</hi> only. And sure I am, whatever Answer he can give to this, which has any Sense or Consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Scripture, will loose and Answer his own Argument against us. In a word, its easie to retort this Argument from a <hi>Priority of time,</hi> and shew that when pertinently improven, it stands upon our side against the <hi>Dr.</hi> and his Fellows. Which retortion, I thus offer; After <hi>Timothy</hi> had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these Instructions in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> (as he speaks) the Apostle Committed the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> Charge to the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as to both Order and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without the least hint of any Interest, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had in or over
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58203:22"/>
them herein, or of any precarious dependence of these <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> upon him, in the exercise of this their Power, notwithstanding that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was present with them, when the Apostle gave this Charge, and that it was his last farewell-Charge, when never to see their Faces more. Now, if the Apostle had given <hi>Timothy</hi> a standing <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority before, and Constitut him their <hi>Bishop,</hi> what a pityful inconsistency, retraction and contradiction was it to his former Doctrin and practice, in the Instalment of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to devolve his whole Authority upon these <hi>Elders,</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> to Feed and Rule?</hi> Surely if the Argument from <hi>Priority of time,</hi> be valid, it must be signally so in this Case, wherein it is strengthened by so many Corroborating Circumstances of the Sacred Text, and (to use the <hi>Drs.</hi> expression, and Address him in his own words) <hi>ibid.</hi> [<hi>this Constitution was to be a Pattern to all Churches, and to be sure, the Government, now at last Established, at</hi> Ephesus <hi>was such as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle intended should continue.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Dr. will needs have this Practice of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to proceed upon the express Institution of our Saviour,<note place="margin">P. 403.</note> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to found a <hi>Divine Right</hi> of a Subordination of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Officers, since the Apostles ordained other Apostles, and <hi>Bishops</hi> to presid over the Churches.</q>
But sure, looking to his Scope and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nothing could be said in a more inconsistent Mould: For, he cannot but acknowledg, That the Institution of our Saviour did relate to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Office, in its whole Nature and Extent, as above delineat, <hi>viz.</hi> To found and plant Churches through the World, to establish the Gospel Government and Ordinances in them, and this with extraordinary Gifts, and infallible directive Authority, as Christs, immediatly sent and first Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors: Yet the Apostles supposed prosecution of this Institution, he maks to consist only in setting some certain <hi>Bishops</hi> over particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with an ordinary and limited Power (for I hope, he will not make them all universal <hi>Patriarchs</hi>) Now, how exactly these <hi>Bishops</hi> are shapen to the Pattern of Christs institut Apostles, any may judg; yet he will have them, not only <hi>Bishops,</hi> but <hi>Apostles,</hi> properly so called, such as were the first <hi>Apostles,</hi> and as succeeding them, in their formal Office: Besides, in speaking of this Divine Right, he tells us,
<q>His Arguments pleads for a Superiority and Subordination of Ecclesiastick Officers: Which is a General, easily accorded by us, as is said, and no way will come home, to prove his supposed distinct Offices in the Pastoral Charge.</q>
The Dr. tells us, (<hi>ibid</hi>)
<q>That if the ordaining of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> be an Argument of the perpetuity of the Office, as we hold, why not the Apostles ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bishops,</hi> as good an Argument, for the perpetuity of that Office?</q>

                  <q>The Dr. enquires, how we can argue a perpetual power of Ordination in the Church,<note place="margin">P. 404.</note> from the Ordination of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> (citing <hi>Ius divinum Minist.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We hold the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation instanced, to examplifie a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordination, as well as in General a Power of Ordination in the Church: <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, having this Scripture account, that it was by <hi>Laying on of the Hands of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie</hi>; which Power and Authority of a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and his Imposition of Hands, tho supposed, doth rather Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en than invalidat, since neither the Eminent Gifts of <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signment for such an Eminent Office, nor <hi>Paul</hi>'s Imposition of Hands, the Great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did Swallow up, or exclud the <hi>Presbytries</hi> Ordinary Power and Authority, but <hi>Timothy</hi> must pass through this Door of a <hi>Presbytries</hi> Authoritative Ordination and Imposition of Hands, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Exercise of his Office; therefore, much more doth this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity belong to the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> now, when the Office of <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> is ceased.

The extraordinary Mission of the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, hath derived from it a Ministry and Ecclesiastick Authority diffused and spread among all the 'Church Officers in the World, none of which doth Succeed them, into the same formal Office; So <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Evangelistick, extraordinary Authority, is derived, handed down into, and seated in a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> tho the Evangelistick Office is extraordinary, and as such, not Succeeded unto.

It being evident by the best searchers of Antiquity, that the Office of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> had not a Being till several Ages after <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  <q>For <hi>Chrysostom</hi> his asserting that <hi>Timothy</hi> was intrusted with a Church or whole Nation:</q>
If we shall assert that this is applicable to his transient or temporary Evangelistick Trust, in correspondence to the extensive Office of Apostleship, it says nothing to our purpose. And the <hi>Dr.</hi> should know that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. makes the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> one and the same, and therein cuts the Sinews of the <hi>Drs.</hi> design and arguing. For other Authors, who do call <hi>Timothy,</hi> together with other <hi>Bishops,</hi> then in being, <hi>Apostles,</hi> which the <hi>Dr.</hi> further Pleads, it doth sufficiently evince, what is said above, of their improper, equivocal acceptation of the Term, since no person of Sense, who ever Read the New Testament, can take the Office of <hi>Apostle,</hi> as delineat in Scripture, to be applicable to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> far less to ordinary <hi>Bishops,</hi> fixed in certain Posts. Nay, the <hi>Dr.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and in contradiction to himself, doth unawares bewray this, in his <hi>Greek</hi> Citation of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who asserts that the Twelve Apostles, were more strictly called so, or rather, according to the Truth of the <hi>Greek</hi>

However, before I engage the <hi>Dr.</hi> upon this head, and examin his Proofs, there are two things, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as that which the <hi>Dr.</hi> is obliged to prove. (1.) That the Office of Apostolat, in its entire Nature, as Institut by our Saviour, and for its proper ends exprest in Scripture, was transmitted, by the Apostles unto the Church, as a standing Office to continue, till the end of Time, And (2) That the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, and in an Universal consent and <hi>Practice,</hi> did homologat this Institution, and Embrace the same. And when the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath proved both these, <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo;</hi> and will far outstrip his Fellows, whoever have pleaded in this Cause. And if he fall short of his proof, of either, or both, he losses his labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Before the <hi>Dr.</hi> come directly to his Proof, he moves an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi>

That the formal Office of Apostolat, in its Nature and ends, as delineat in Scripture, did expire with the Apostles themselves, is the consentient judgment of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines. The <hi>Dr.</hi> says, <hi>this is an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Adversaries,</hi> and indeed, if he account such his Adversaries, as assert this, he has entered the Lists, with a strong party, who probably will

prove too hard for him. Well; What is his Answer to this Objection?
<q>He Tells us; That this Office was not Limited to the Persons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> since he has proved, that they derived, it to others, which had it been appropriat to their Persons, they could not have done, without violating their Trust, and exceeding the bounds of their Commission.</q>
How the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath proved the derivation of the Apostolat, by the Persons of the Apostles to other Succeeding Apostles, we have seen above, and do refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to the premised discoveries of the utter insufficiency of his Proof, this way: And indeed, the derivation of the Apostolat to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, could not have been done without violating their Trust, and exceeding the limits of their Commission; Their Commission being to Disciple and Teach all Nations, to found the Gospel Church, and Plant the Gospel Ordinances therein, and that with an infallible directive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as living Oracles, and immediat Ambassadors of the King of Saints; So, that the attempting to Substitut Successors, in this work and Office, had been both an unfaithful over-stretch of their Commission, as contrar to its Nature and end, and an endeavouring of that which was impossible, unless he will say, that the Work of laying the Churches Foundation, and delivering our Lords mind, as to the Doctrin, Worship, Disciplin and Government thereof, is a work, that could be <hi>twice done</hi>; Which, as it repugns to the common sense of all men, so to the many Precepts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Churches, anent holding fast the received Ordinances, and contending for <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and building upon that Holy Faith and Foundation laid by the Apostles. Nay further, it doth evidently appear, that the Apostles exercising themselves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving to others such an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Primacy, as the Dr pleads for, had been a gross impeachment of their Faithfulness, in the Execution of their Trust. (1.) In their exercising and transmitting a Power, in its very Nature, distinct, from what our Lord allowed and enjoyned them, <hi>Viz. A Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dominion,</hi> not a Ministerial Service and Stewardship only, which, as we have heard, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> disown the one, and assert the other; so we find the express and personal Prescription of our Blessed Lord, in point of this Nature of their Power. The <hi>Dr.</hi> will not disown that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> he pleads for, and, as he pretends, exemplified in the Apostolick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, have both the Name and thing of <hi>a Lordly Dominion,</hi> yea, and that not in <hi>Spirituals</hi> only, in which respect, they own the Designation and Character of <hi>Spiritual Lords,</hi> but likewise, a <hi>Lordship</hi> and <hi>Peerage</hi> in Civil Government, and such a Dominion, as Princes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; And that our Blessed Lord did expresly Discharg this to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; As also, that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in his Masters Name, discharges a Lording over Gods Heritage, or Church, or the <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

word, with some will sound, I suppose the Dr. will not deny, or if he do, the Proof is very easie and evident. (2.) Had the Apostles exercised, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to Successors, such an <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as the <hi>Dr.</hi> pleads for, they should have unfaithfully in their own persons, straitned the Apostolick inspection, and carryed an Office incompatible with it; unless the Dr. will undertake to reconcile contradictions, he cannot deny this: For, as <hi>Apostles,</hi> their Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nistry was of an unfixed, indefinit, Universal Nature; As <hi>Prelats</hi> they behoved to be fixed to such and such Posts, so that thus they should have unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully torn out a part of their Commission, in exercising an ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, in particular <hi>Diocesses,</hi> whereas, their Commission was to exercise an extraordinary unfixed Ministry towards all the Churches, planted and to be planted. Again, in transmitting such a <hi>Prelacy</hi> to others, their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice should have contradicted their Prescriptions, in Point of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Offices and Officers thereof, wherein there is not the least Intimation of such an Officer, nor any Rules given, for either the Qualifications or Ordination, of any higher Officer, than a mere <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Prerbyter.</hi> I shall only add, (3<hi>ly,</hi>) That it is evident in the Apostles Doctrin and Practice, that they own the Ministers of the Word, as to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Pastoral</hi> Charge, and in the ordinary Power of Government, <hi>their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,</hi> as their practice in Ordination and Jurisdiction among Churches Constitut, which is above discribed, doth make evident. And it were strange, that Evangelists should be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>instructed with <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence in such Churches, who were inferior to Apostles; That <hi>Timothy</hi> who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> concurring Authoritatively, tho <hi>Paul</hi> was present, should usurp Preheminence over a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> tho inferior to an Apostle, and that whereas <hi>Presbyters</hi> did concurr, <hi>pari passu,</hi> with a whole <hi>Presbytrie</hi> of Apostles, in every piece of a Judicial Act and Decree, wherein was put forth, both the <hi>Diatactick, Critick, and Dogmatick</hi> Power, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Church Government, yet an Evangelist inferior to any of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, should take <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence over a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> in this Matter.</p>
               <p>For the Drs. proofs from <hi>Antiquity</hi> upon this Head, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, how well he has laid his Measures, for reaching his Scope and End, let it be remembered what it is, he undertaks to prove, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>The Churches universal Reception of the Office of Apostolat in its entire Nature, as a standing necessary Function in the Church, to be transmitted to after Ages, with the same Authority and Commission, as delivered at first to the Twelve: For, this is that which the Dr. directly and designedly pleads for, from that passage of Scripture, where Our Lord said to his Apostles, <hi>As my Father hath sent Me, so send I you.</hi> And according to this Rule, let us examin his Instances. His first proof (P. 406) is from St. <hi>Clement</hi> who mentions, in his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> three Orders of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58203:27"/>
Officers, whom he calls the <hi>High Priest,</hi> the <hi>Priests,</hi> and the <hi>Levits;</hi> which Words saith the Dr. can be no otherwise understood, than of the <hi>Bishop, Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                  </q>
A strange proof, and an odd Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation indeed! How doth the Doctor prove, that <hi>Clement,</hi> did any othere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise express himself, than with this Allusion to the Old Testament Church Officers, signifying that there are diverse Officers, in the New Testament Ministry, as in the Old? Again, How comes the Dr. to explain him, of <hi>Bishop</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in the Singular, and <hi>Deacons</hi> in the Plural? And how does this corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond to <hi>Clements</hi> expresion of <hi>High Priest,</hi> in the singular, and <hi>Priests</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? Will the Dr. owne the <hi>Primacy</hi> of an High Priest, over the Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, as of the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi>? Or be bold to Averr that <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Asserted this? Moreover, the Drs. Explication of <hi>Clement, viz.</hi> That he means by the <hi>High Priest,</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> by the <hi>Priests,</hi> the <hi>Presbyter, &amp;c.</hi> Baffles his Design, and cuts the Throat of his Cause and pleading: For if <hi>Clement</hi> lookt upon the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Pastors, as holding an Office and Authority, corresponding to that of the <hi>Priests,</hi> under the Old Testament, then certainly, he did hold them to have a necessary Essential Interest in Government, such as the <hi>Priests</hi> had: For the Dr. will not be bold to say, that the <hi>Sanehedrin,</hi> made up of Priests, had not a governing Power, or that it was Monopolized in the person of the <hi>High Priest,</hi> as he affirms, it is in the person of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> secluding the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And further, to discover, how the Dr. has abused his Reader, and forefeited his Credit in this Citation, let us take Notice, that <hi>Clement,</hi> to remove the Sedition, raised by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> against their <hi>Presbyters p.</hi> 57.58. tells them, how God hath alwise appointed several Orders in his Church, which must not be confounded. In the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, he appointed an <hi>High Priest, Priests</hi> and <hi>Levits</hi>; and then tells them, that for the times of the Gospel, Jesus Christ, sent his Apostles through Countreys and Cities (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in which he Preacht and constitut the first Fruits (approving them by the Spirit) for <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> to those who should afterward believe. From which Words, the learned Authors of the <hi>Append. Minist. Evang.</hi> Have long since concluded, against the Dr. and his Fellows. 1. That in the first and purest times, the custom was to chuse <hi>Bishops</hi> in Villages <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And how small little <hi>Apostles</hi> these were, I need not tell the Dr. and such for Authority and extent of Power, as are many Pastors now in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. That <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> are the only Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, owned by <hi>Clement,</hi> as planted by the Apostles, the first Primitive Church (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Which shews the Drs. palpable Forgery, in making <hi>Clement</hi> to assert three Orders, of <hi>Bishops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons. Clement</hi> adds <hi>p.</hi> 57. That the Apostles, by Jesus Christ, knowing that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58203:27"/>
contentions would arise about the Name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> and being endu'd with perfect knowledg, they appointed the foresaid Orders, <hi>Viz: Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deaeons.</hi> Upon which, the Learned Authors of the <hi>Apendix,</hi> do further note. (1.) That by <hi>Name,</hi> we are not to understand the bare Name, but the Honour and Dignity, as the word is taken, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. The Controversie among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being about the Dignity of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and the Deposition of their Godly <hi>Presbyters, p.</hi> 57.58. (2.) That the only remedy appinted by the Apostles, for the Cure of all Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons arising about <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> is, by Committing the Care of the Church to <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> in <hi>Clements</hi> Judgement: What ever Remedy of Schism, the Church afterward applyed, in setting up one <hi>Bishop</hi> over another, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> tells us, that the Apostles, endued with perfect knowledg of things, Ordained only <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Whosoever shall Peruse him <hi>p.</hi> 57.62.69.72. will find, he clearly asserts the first and purest Primitive Church, to be Governed by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> without <hi>Bishops.</hi> Besides, that he uses the Names of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> promiscuously, and supposes them to be one and the same, throughout the whole <hi>Epistle.</hi>

                  </q>
Which none will believe, to have fallen from the Pen of so Humble a Martyr; nor can any but acknowledg, that it is as far from the Simplicity of his times, in an arrogant self-boasting, as East from West. And (3<hi>ly,</hi>) His strange and anxious defence of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, wherein he (these forged <hi>Epistles</hi> rather) goes beyond all bounds of Truth and Modesty. The Learned Authors of the foresaid <hi>Appendix,</hi> have given several instances hereof, which do palpably evidence, such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Anti-scriptural <hi>Popish</hi> Strain, as no Man of Sense, can impute to this holy and early <hi>Martyr</hi>: Nay, none, who owns the Scriptures of Truth, but must needs accuse of Error. For instance (among many others) in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> he affirms,
<q>The <hi>Bishop</hi> to be possest of all Principality and Authority, beyond all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
And how will the Dt. make this accord with that of the Apostle? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Who then is</hi> Paul? <hi>and who is</hi> Apollo? <hi>but Ministers, by whom ye believed.</hi>
                  <q>In the same <hi>Epistle,</hi> he enjoins a Reverence to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as to Christ, as the Holy Apostles has commanded:</q>
But where is this commanded?
<q>In the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> he enjoyns, that nothing seems Right, that seems not so to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> For what is contrary to his Judgement, is enmity to God.</q>
The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> spoke with more caution and Modesty, when he enjoyned thus, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ.</hi>
                  <q>In the Epistle to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> he enjoyns the Princes, the Emperour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Clergy, to obey the <hi>Bishop;</hi> and this at such a time, when there was no Christian Emperour or Prince, nor many Years thereafter.</q>
                  <q>In the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Smyrneans,</hi> he saith, The Scripture saith, <hi>Honour God and the King,</hi> but I say Honour God as the Author and Lord of all things,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58203:28"/>
and the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as the Prince of Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He affirms, they are guilty of greater punishment, that do any thing against the <hi>Bishop,</hi> than they that rise up against the King.</q>
Thus preferring them above Kings. Yea, he saith,
<q>That such as do any thing, without consulting with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> is a Worshipper of the Devil.</q>
And what Censure these say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings put upon the Reformed Churches, Govern'd without <hi>Prelats</hi>; yea what repugnancy is therein, to the Holy Scriptures, I think may be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Dr's meanest reflection; So, that he might have been asham'd to bring for his proof, such spurious <hi>Epistles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> Yet he is bold to cite s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me of these Passages, particularly in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Trallians</hi> and <hi>Magnesians,</hi> altho he is forc't (I suppose for very shame) to smooth the expressions, and curtail them:
<q>For instance, in stead of that Expression in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> wherein he asserts the <hi>Bishop</hi> to be Possest of all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie and Authority beyond all, as much, as it is possible for Men to be Possest of (as it is truely translated out of the <hi>Greek</hi>) The Dr. Represents only this.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 407.</note>
                  </q>
                  <q>what is the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but he who hath all Authority and Power?</q>
Which, altho it be much the same, with what is above rehearsed, yet is far short in extent and Expression. But if the Dr. hath so high a veneration for these spurious <hi>Epistles,</hi> I would fain know, how he will reconcile this and such like Expressions, with that one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let every Soul be subject unto the higher Powers,</hi> &amp;c.? Unless the Dr. will deny the <hi>Bishop</hi> to have a Soul, he cannot exeem him from the obligation of this Command. And if he be thus subject, how is <hi>he Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of all Principality and Authority, beyond all, as much, as is possible for Men to be Possest of?</hi> Or how will the Dr. make this accord, with that Interest and Authority of the Civil Magistrat, not only in Civils, over all his Subjects, but also in the Church and Kingdom of Christ, which the Dr. in the same Book, owns and asserts? He also Cites the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> wherein,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>Obedience to the <hi>Bishop</hi> is enjoyned, and contradicting him in any thing discharged:</q>
which the Dr. will not deny to be cross to that limited Obedience, which the Scripture enjoins to be given, even to Parents by Children; Who are Commanded to Obey them in the Lord only.
<q>Moreover, he Cites the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> wherein, it is affirmed, that such as belong to Christ, are united to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> such as are not, are cursed:</q>
And what censure this puts upon the <hi>Reformed</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es, and how it Anathematizes, them, as not United to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> I need not tell the Dr. nor what a black <hi>Theta,</hi> he marks himself with, in the Judgment of the Reformed Churches, if owning such an absurd assertion. I cannot stand upon many things, that might be further noticed, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the impertinency and Fooleries of these Citations: Only, it is very worthy of our observation, that the Dr. in his Citation of his <hi>Epistle</hi> to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58203:29"/>
the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> obliges us, in a piece of Ingenuity, in expressing <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s commending [<hi>Obedience to the Bishop and the Presbytrie,</hi> &amp;c,] which seems to allow the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> a Commanding Authority, together with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> (as several of his Fellow-Pleaders in this Cause, smooth the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) but this I am sure, is cross to the Drs. Scope and pleading, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances all the Power of Government, in the person of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly, all <hi>Presbyters,</hi> from any Interest therein. So, that the Dr. in this unwary Citation, contradicts <hi>Ignatius</hi> and himself, and makes <hi>Ignatius</hi> inconsistent with himself. In his next Citation of his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> wherein,
<q>Reverence is enjoined to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son appointed by the Lord and Master of the Family,<note place="margin">

He hath again Wounded himself; For to be a Steward having a subaltern Service and Ministry, under the Authority of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and tyed up to his Orders, is point blanck, contrare unto, and <hi>toto coelo</hi> different, from that <hi>Principality of the highest Degree,</hi> before ascribed to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> and owned by the Dr. as his, and <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Sense of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Office. Sure, to be a Prince, and a <hi>Steward</hi> in Government, are distinct things, and entirely and wholly opposit, if we will take the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> word for it, who disowns a <hi>Dominion,</hi> and in stead thereof, and in opposition thereunto, owns a <hi>Stewardship</hi> in God's Family, and humble Sevice or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, the Dr. plyes us with <hi>Inferences</hi> from these Citations; Whereof the first is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 408.409.410.411.</note>
                  <q>That these <hi>Epistles</hi> were Written, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Eight or Nine years, after the Decease of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and yet <hi>Bishops</hi> are supposed to be in all Churches, appointed by Christ and his Apostles, and they were lookt upon as no Members of the Church, who were not Subject to them; That they were necessary in the very Constitution of Churches, so that they were not within the Altar, but without it, who were not subject to them: And therefore, it may be concluded, there were no Churches without them.</q>
I <hi>Answer,</hi> that <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrot his <hi>Epistles</hi> early, no body will doubt, but that such trashie stuff and anti-scriptural Fooleries, as are above rehears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was written by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and was his Sense of Church Government, no Man of Sense, or who hath any Respect to the Memory of that Martyr, will believe: And we find the contrair is asserted, and made good by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Godly Learned. Not to stand upon a more critical Answer, and to challenge the Dr. to prove the Universal Sense and Practice of the Primitive Church at that time, from the Sense and Sentiments of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, tho admitted, unless he could prove by some Authentick Acts, the Judgment of the whole Church, to be correspondent thereunto, and that none, who either wrot not, or whose Writings may be lost, were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58203:29"/>
Judgment, which he neither attempts to prove, nor will ever be able.</p>
               <p>The Drs. next <hi>Inference</hi> is,<note place="margin">P. 409.</note>
                  <q>That since, there were <hi>Bishops</hi> so early in this Age, presiding over the Churches, they behoved to receive (several of them, at least) their <hi>Episcopal</hi> Orders from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, since <hi>Ignatius,</hi> at the writing of these <hi>Epistles,</hi> had been Forty Years <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> an eminent Church, planted immediatly by St. <hi>Peter</hi>; It being the constant practice of the Apostles, to ordain Elders in all the Churches they planted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Dr. hath not made good from these Testimonies, that there were, <hi>de facto,</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> such <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,</hi> as he pleads for: Nor can he, from this Ground, perswad any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man of this, unless he could evince two Things, which he will do <hi>ad Calendas Graecas.</hi> 1. Not only, that what is asserted in the Passages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove rehearsed, was the genuine Sense and writing of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Sense and Judgment, as well as the practice of the whole Church at that time. 2. That this supposed Judgment and Practice anent such an Officer, as the <hi>Bishop,</hi> is correspondent to the Scripture Account, and Sense of the Church Officers, mentioned in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Doctrin and Practice in point of Church Government, and the Institution of the Officers thereof, which he will also find another insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Difficulty. Again, his Reason here, is very odd, whereby he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies this Inference, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That the Apostles ordained Elders in all the Churches they planted:</q>
For, if the Dr. hold these Elders to be <hi>Bishops,</hi> (as he needs must, if he speak consequentially) I would fain know, <hi>First,</hi> What shadow of Proof, he can give for this, and how he can suppose that all the Scripture <hi>Elders</hi> were such? For, if this be asserted, then it follows, that <hi>Bishops</hi> were set up, when there were no <hi>Elders</hi> to presid over, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Sense and Pleading of his Fellows, except Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> And next, I would know, how the Dr. upon this Supposition, will keep off the Rock of a Contradiction, and that both to himself, and <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius?</hi> Since he makes <hi>Ignatius</hi> to distinguish the Bishops and the Elders, and himself holds, that the Elders with St. <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> went in to them, were mere <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pastors.</hi> Again, if the Dr. argue from their ordaining <hi>Elders,</hi> to their ordaining <hi>Ignatius</hi> a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> as he thus disowns Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Arguments and Notion (who takes still the <hi>Elders</hi> for <hi>Prelats</hi>) so, he is obliged to prove the super-institution of <hi>Bishops</hi> over these <hi>Elders</hi> in every Church, not to suppose it only, else in his principles, these Churches, where, mere <hi>Elders,</hi> were placed, were manck, and wanted the power of Jurisdiction. And since, he has produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from Scripture, that proves such an institution of <hi>Bishops,</hi> or such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers fixed to certain <hi>Diocesses,</hi> his Dream of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> is as easily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58203:30"/>
rejected by us, as affirmed by him. We read of a Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Paul,</hi> and of an <hi>Eldership</hi> and Company of Teaching Prophets there, who imposed Hands upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when sent out among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and are consequently supposed to be the subject of a Jurisdictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Government: But of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> his planting an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> of the Drs. Mould, in either of the <hi>Antiochs,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is utterly silent: And a Supposition necessarly ensuing hereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles planted Churches with different Moulds of Government, sufficiently discovers the Absurdity of such an Opinion.
<q>As for <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom (Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>edit. Savil. p.</hi> 99.) his admiring of <hi>Ignatius</hi> Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, obtained by the Hands of Apostles,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 409.</note> laid upon him.</q>
It is a very blunt and headless Proof of that <hi>Episcopal</hi> Dignity, which the Dr. alledges: For, doth not the Dr. think, that the Office of the Scripture <hi>Bishop,</hi> is a great Dignity? And he should prove, not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose only, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was by the Apostles installed a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his Mould, or that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> understood this Dignity in his Sense, which, as he offers not to do; so, if attempting it, he could not chuse, but set <hi>Chrysostom</hi> by the Ears with himself, who (as is above cleared) asserts the Identity of the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter.</hi> The same I repone, to what the Dr. alledgeth (P. 410) of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> his supposed <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in <hi>Smyrna</hi>; as also, what is made good by many <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Ancients,</hi> used the Name of <hi>Bishops,</hi> in a general Sense, that the first <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> had no Authority, over the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> tho ordinarly thus termed. And which clears this to Conviction, <hi>Polycarp,</hi> himself, in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> makes but two Orders of Ministry, viz. <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth, in his Epistle to the same Church, and exhorts them to be subject to the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as unto God and unto Christ. And sure the Dr. will not make him cross this in his practice: so that he falls utterly short of proving an <hi>Episcopacy</hi> of his Mould, much more a derived Apostolat, from these blind <hi>Testimonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. adds,
<q>That it cannot be imagined, that all Churches would have universally admitted <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles being alive, had not some of them derived their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Apostles immediatly.</q>
But, 1. The Dr. hath given no sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of proof, for this universal Reception: For I pray, what proof is this? Such and such Authors say, there were <hi>Bishops</hi> in such and such Posts, or rather put this general name upon such Persons; Therefore, the Christian Church received the Hierarchical <hi>Prelat</hi> universally, or the <hi>Prelat</hi> with sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, as an Officer of Divine Institution. For besides, that the Dr. will never prove, from the bare Assertion anent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, that they were of his Cutt and Mould (the contrary being apparent,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58203:30"/>
especially in these early Times) And many <hi>Fathers</hi> asserting the Identity, of the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> he must prove and instruct the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Judgment and Practice of all the Churches, as to the Reception of the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> of his Mould, before this Assertion can be made good. 2. The Dr. cannot deny Scripture Instances, of the very early Reception of Corruptions in the Church, both under the Law, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. As, in the times of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> he knows the early Reception of the Idolatry of the Golden Calf, by the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> together with <hi>Aaron</hi> himself, but Forty Days after the delivery of the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>: And besides, many such Instances in the Old Testament, we have Scripture Instances of the Devils sowing his Tares, early in the Church of the New Testament, such as the Error about the Resurrection, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of Angels, Justification by the works of the Law, the necessity of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and other Ceremonies, the Error of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> &amp;c. And look a little forward, in the early times of the Church, we will find Errors &amp; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions pretended to be received from the Apostles, and owned by some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves, which notwithstanding, the Dr, cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to be Errors; Such as the <hi>Mill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nary</hi> Error, the Error of Children's receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof afterward.
<q>The Dr. thinks it inconsistent with the Churches veneration to the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a new Order of Men, without his Authority.</q>
But this Universal recep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of such an Order, as the Dr. supposes, is not yet proved: Besides, that the Dr's. supposition of this impossibility of such a corruption, early creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, because of some Apostles (or even of <hi>Iohn</hi>) yet alive, he will find not to be solid, when he ponders duely, the working of the Mystrie of iniquity, and the Seeds of a <hi>Papacy,</hi> even in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, and a <hi>Diotrophes</hi> seeking Preheminence, even in <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, yea, and directly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and opposing the Holy Apostle. The Dr. should know, that it is not the slippery Principle of a supposed impossibility of this Nature, while the Apostles were alive, that we must found our Perswasion upon, but the lively Oracles, and living Doctrin of the Apostles, is our Rule; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Doctrin or practice is cross thereunto, tho all the Church should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, yea tho an Angel from Heaven Preach it, we ought to reject it, and might call that Angel accursed.</p>
               <p>For what the Dr. adds out of <hi>Bishop Taylor,</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy, Sect.</hi> 18. That <hi>de facto,</hi> the Apostles with their own Hands, Ordained several <hi>Bishops</hi> over Churches, <hi>Viz: Dion. Areop. Bishop</hi> of <hi>Athens, Caius, of Thessalonica, Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> of <hi>Coloss, Onesimus</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, Epaphroditus</hi> of <hi>Phillippi, Titus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. I Answer, the Dr. does well to add the <hi>Caution [if Credit might be given to Ecclesiastick History]</hi> And truely this History, must be of mighty force, that must be believed against clear Scripture, and the Credit and belief
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58203:31"/>
founded thereupon, must needs be distinct from that Faith which God allows; Nay, the Drs. Credit of such History, must needs set him at odds with himself: For as to the First, we find the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyning the Church of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> Obedience to their <hi>Pastors</hi> jointly, as their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Rulers and Governours, without the least hint of any Super-eminent <hi>Prelat,</hi> and enjoining to these Rulers Authoritative admonition of the Flock. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12.14. And will this <hi>Bishop</hi> and our Dr. Charge such a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, upon the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as to settle a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> in that Church, with Authority to Rule and Govern, while this Authority and Power is entrusted unto one <hi>Bishop,</hi> or to take it afterward from them, and put it in the <hi>Bishops</hi> Hands? How, I pray, shall we believe such History, against such plain Scripture? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I pray, deserves most our Credit, the Apostles Divinly inspired <hi>Epistle,</hi> enjoyning Obedience to the <hi>Pastors</hi> of that Church of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> jointly, as their Spiritual Rulers and Guids, or an after-<hi>Apocryphal</hi> History, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Authority was by the Apostles appointment, monopolized in one <hi>Bishop,</hi> either at that time, or thereafter, set up, and Ordained by <hi>Paul</hi>? Whether, are we to believe the Scripture account of the State and Government of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as entrusted by <hi>Paul,</hi> in his last farewel, to the inspection and Government of the <hi>Elders</hi> jointly, as the <hi>Bishops</hi> thereof, Authorized by the Holy Ghost, or an Historical account of <hi>Onesimus,</hi> as their sole <hi>Bishop,</hi> who had this Power Monopolized in him, in Contradiction to the Apostles last prescriptions unto that Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that time or thereafter: I dare pose this Dr. or any man of Sense and Candor upon it; And whether upon such ground as this, we might not cast off all Divine Institutions, and receive all fopperies and Superstitions, which Mans wicked Heart by Satans influence might suggest? The like might be said of <hi>Philippi,</hi> the Apostle in the Preface of his <hi>Epistle</hi> to that Church, saluting the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as their <hi>Pastors</hi> in common, calling all the Ministers, <hi>Bishops,</hi> and thus applying to them that Name and Office, which the Dr. and his Fellows, will needs appropriat to a <hi>Prelat</hi>: And sure, <hi>Paul,</hi> writing by instinct of the un-erring Spirit of God, gave not empty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Titles to these <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> but supposes them to have a standing joint Authority over that Church, as the Spiritual Guids and Rulers thereof. And it is a fearful and Gross imputation upon the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, to suppose that either now, or afterwards, such a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Prelat,</hi> as the Dr. maintains, either had, or was to have by Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, all this Authority of the <hi>Pastors,</hi> enhansed and monopolized in him: And if we will admit of after suposed Decrees and Fables of this Nature, opposit to Scripture, we may make them, (as some <hi>Papists</hi> blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme them) a Nose of Wax.

Apocryphal History, he crosses his own Pleading from Scripture, and wounds his Cause to Death with his own hands; For, we have heard the great strength of his Scripture Argument, as touching the Apostles set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up succeedanous Apostles and <hi>Bishops,</hi> in correspondence to Christs Institution, lyes in the supposed instalment of <hi>Timothy, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> and that the instructions addrest to them, in Point of Government,<note place="margin">P. 398.399.400 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> are a clear indication yea, and Demonstration, (in the Drs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sense and Pleading) of this supposed instalment of the one and the other, by the Apostles, in these their pretended <hi>Diocesses</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> and we know, how much the Dr. labours to prove the consentient Judgment of the <hi>Fathers</hi> hereanent. Now, if the Dr. will hold with <hi>Bishop Taylor,</hi> that the Apostles with their own hands, installed, not <hi>Timothy,</hi> but <hi>Onesimus, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> not <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> but of <hi>Corinth,</hi> what is become of all his pleadings from Scripture, for their installment elsewhere? The Dr. says,
<q>The supposed Instalment of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Onesinus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 410.</note> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that by the Apostles own Hands, is most certain, if we believe Ecclesiastical History.</q>
And if most certain upon this Ground, then most certain it is. 1. That the Drs. Pleadings for <hi>Timothy</hi>'s and <hi>Titus</hi>'s Instalment at <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> is most false, and all his pretended Scripture Proofs, by his own Confession mere wind and lies. And 2<hi>ly.</hi> That all the Dr's. Testimonies of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and pretended Historical accounts hereanent, are Fabulous Dreams. I know no imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable evasion the Dr. hath, but to alledge their after-instalment in these places, by the Apostles: But the Dr. must give a Scripture-account, as well as Historical, of this matter, ere a door can be opened to him for this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Dr</hi>'s <hi>Third Inference</hi> is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 410.411.</note> that the <hi>Bishops</hi> of this Age were lookt on, as a Superior Order to <hi>Presbyters, Ignatius</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Presbyters</hi> to obey them, according to Christs Institution.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> we have heard what Judgment we are to make of these <hi>Epistles,</hi> and consequently what a sandy Foundation, the Dr. builds this inference upon. Again, if the Dr. will make <hi>Ignatius</hi> consistent with himself, he must needs disown this Inference and Opinion of him; For, in his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> he enjoyns them to be Subject to the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> as the Apostles of Christ, and calls the <hi>Presbytrie <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <q>The Dr. proceeds to his Proofs, from the next Age, further, as he tells us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 411</note> from the Scripture Antiquity: And no doubt the more Dark in this Point. He tells us of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology to the Emperour <hi>Antonius,</hi> who speaks of a <gap reason="foreign">

The Churches had a <hi>President,</hi> or these called by <hi>Iustin</hi> so; Therefore, <hi>Bishops</hi> with sole Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, and holding the entire Apostolick Office: Again, these <hi>Presidents,</hi> are called sometimes <hi>Bishops,</hi> and gets that general Name; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were such <hi>Bishops,</hi> and of such a Mould, as the Dr. pleads for. What Arguing can be more insipid and Vain? But if the Dr. put a due Value upon the Argument drawn from <hi>Epithets,</hi> as Pointing at the Office and Authority of the Persons thereby designed, what thinks he of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD in Scripture, his Denominating <hi>Pasters <gap reason="foreign">

One would think this as strong a Proof of their <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, as this of the supposed <hi>Bishops,</hi> drawn from this Epithet of <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Dionisius.</hi> I might further Argue, and press the Dr. thus; If these Scripture Denominations do prove and argue, an Essential Interest and Authority in Church Government, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to <hi>Pastors,</hi> they do by necessary consequence, overturn the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of a <gap reason="foreign">

Sense; or, that, if they speak according to the Scripture Sense and acceptation of the Word, they must needs mean the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi> only, and not his imaginary <hi>Prelat</hi>: And so, whatever Sense, the Dr. imbraces of <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Dionisius,</hi> his Cause and Pleading here is lost, and falls to the Ground. Moreover, if the Dr. stand to this supposed account of the Bishops Office, offered by <hi>Iustin,</hi> he will make the Administration of the Lords Supper, peculiar to him, against the Dr's. own Sense and Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who acknowledges that Preaching of the Word, and Administration of the Sacraments, are the proper Duties of the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Function, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, here, it is made peculiar to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> to Consecrat the Bread and Wine. Besides, that the Dr. here apparently approves the carrying of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the absent; a seed of gross <hi>Popish</hi> Superstitions.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As for the continuance and derivation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Office, in a Succedaneous <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which the Dr. has been fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, we deny it, and have found his proofs utterly insufficient, and that nothing he has adduced from the <hi>Fathers</hi> or Scripture, can give the least shaddow of a sound Proof of this Point. As for our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> introduced, about the middle of the Second <hi>Century,</hi> the Dr. should know that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we acknowledg that <hi>Beza</hi>'s <hi>Episcopus humanus,</hi> or <hi>Episcopus praeces,</hi> was about this time set up, and obtained in the Churches, and that (as we have heard) the First ordained Minister, in a sort of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,</hi> or fixed Moderatorship had some deference <hi>eo nomine,</hi> and the next in order, was set up to moderat in the Meetings, when he was removed by Death, or otherwise, and had the Tittle of <hi>Bishop</hi> given to him; and this was (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> Phrases it) <hi>multorum Sacerdotum judicio constitutum,</hi> or by the Judgment and appointment of the <hi>Presbytrie; Presbytri</hi> saith he, <hi>unum ex se electum in excelsiore gradu collocatum Episcopum nominabant.</hi> So, that in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>'s. Sense, he had this fixed <hi>Prostasie,</hi> or new Name, as their Mouth and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58203:34"/>
                  <hi>Moderator</hi> for Orders sake, and this by the free choice of the <hi>Presbytrie;</hi> which shews the folly of the Dr's. inference of a supposed existent Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, of his mould, from the nominal distinction of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the Passages of <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and others generally mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or from these <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, being set in a higher Seat than <hi>Presbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> For, upon the Constitution above rehearsed, and confirmed by <hi>Ambrose,</hi> both these might be; Yet without any Impeachment of <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive Authority in Judicatories, unless the Dr. will say, that because the <hi>Moderator</hi> of an Assembly, hath a peculiar Name and seat, and a deference upon that Account, He has therefore an Office and Authority paramount to that of the Assembly, and such as inhances their decisive suffrage. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Dr. odly inferrs from our acknowledgment of this first human <hi>Prostasie,</hi> our granting a derivation, or continuance, or even introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion at that time, of his pretended Office of Apostolat, as he calls it, and in the Nature and extent he pleads for; who sees not, that these are <hi>toto Caelo</hi> different? Tho in the next Passage, the Dr. seems to retract this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> telling his Reader,
<q>That tho we acknowledg an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Superiority, yet we deny that they left any to Succeed them in that Power.</q>
But, since he gives this our acknowledgment of the First <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> as the reason, why he needs not Cite his Authors Particularly, to prove the derivation and continuance of Apostolick Superiority at that time, he clearly supposes this; and therefore, speaks confusedly and inconsistently, in the premised account of our Judgment and concession.</p>
               <p>Well,<note place="margin">P. 414.415.</note> what further aocount gives the Dr. of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Matter? He adds,
<q>We hold that the Church was every where governed by the common Council of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but this form of Government, being found inconvenient, as giving too much occasion for Schisms and divisions, it was at last Universally agreed upon, that one <hi>Presbyter</hi> should be chosen out, to presid over all the rest: and that this was the beginning of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> for which, he says, we Cite the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Testimony of <hi>Ierom, antequam Diaboli instinctu,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
Where I find the Dr. either willfully, or ignorantly misrepresenting our Cause and Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> in alledging, that we hold, that this Form of Government, by common Council of <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> was found inconvenient, or not suited to the ends of Government, because it gave occasion for Schisms and Divisions. A gross and lying imputation: For, all do know, that we hold this Form of Government to be of Divine appointment, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment established by the <hi>Apostles</hi>: And it were a strange inconsistency and contradiction to the Scriptures of Truth, to hold, that this Divine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, appointed by God, in the Scriptures of the New Testament,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58203:35"/>
and enjoined unto the Gospel Church, was not suited to all the times thereof, and to the great ends of Government, and could of it self, give a rise to Schisms and divisions: What a gross imputation were this, upon the Divine Institutions, and opening a Door, to lay them all aside, upon pretence of eventual inconveniencies? I dare challeng this Dr. or any of his mind, to instance any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writer, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver asserted this. For, if he say, we homologat <hi>Ierom,</hi> and approve his Testimony, who affirms, that upon occason of Divisions, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was altered, and <hi>immutata ratio,</hi> as he speaks, it is a pityful and palpably absurd inference, to argue upon this, that either <hi>Ierom,</hi> or we, do impute this providential issue, and Mans sinful abuse and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, to the Divine Institution it self; And if the Dr. own such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, he will justify all such abuses, and <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Plea, for setting up his Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> because he judged it could not consist with the safety of the Kingdom, which God had given him over <hi>Israel,</hi> that the Ten Tribes, should go up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worship, after the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He says,
<q>We hold that upon this occasion, it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally agreed upon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> that one <hi>Presbyter</hi> should preside over all the rest, which was the beginning of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
                  </q>
And this appears as dark and confused an Account as the former: For, 1. As to the Office of a <hi>President</hi> or <hi>Moderator,</hi> whose Work is to be the Mouth of the Meeting, to gather the Votes, and moderat the Procedures, we hold, that the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Government, essentially requires this, and consequently Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that this was alwise and necessarly practised, as in all Church Government, so, since the beginning, and is examplified in that first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Council Act.</hi> 15. wherein we judg it probable, that the Person <hi>presiding,</hi> was the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi>: And therefore, its gross Non-sense to say, we hold this <hi>Presidency,</hi> to have been first introduced upon occasion of Schism. But next, if the Dr. by [<hi>by a President over the rest</hi>] mean such a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as is either <hi>advitam,</hi> or who has such a <hi>Presidency</hi> as encroaches upon, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances the Decisive Votes of <hi>Pastors,</hi> this indeed we acknowledg with <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> came in <hi>Paulatim,</hi> and by peice-meal, tho at first, he was but a mere <hi>President, advitam,</hi> and had some Honour and deference upon this account. And this, we hold was the rise of that <hi>Prelacie,</hi> which in Process of time swallowed up all the decisive Power of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and their exercise of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But the Dr. badly represents the Matter, (<hi>P.</hi> 415.) when he calls this [<hi>a Chusing of one to preside over the rest</hi>] which is applicable to any President of a Judicatory, or mouth of a meeting, or unto a speaker in Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Dr. says we hold [<hi>that this remedy was Universally
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58203:35"/>
agreed upon</hi>] If he means, that upon occasion of Schisms, we hold that this custom of the fixed <hi>President,</hi> with Authority and deference, as a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bove exprest, came in by degrees, and became Universal, in Process of time, (as additional corruptions ordinarly do) this is easily accorded. But if he mean, that we hold, there was a Formal General <hi>Council</hi> decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this (as the Dr. with his Fellow-Pleaders, fasten this gloss upon that Passage of <hi>Ierom</hi> [<hi>prospiciente concilio—&amp;—toto orbe decretum</hi>] he should know, that we disown such an Opinion, and have sufficiently made it appear, that <hi>Ierom</hi> intended no such thing, since in collating his two Testimonies, <hi>viz</hi>: his <hi>Comment</hi> upon the <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> and his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> the contrary is evident; For, <hi>Ierom</hi> makes this a <hi>Consuetudo,</hi> or Custom, and says it came <hi>in Paulatim,</hi> or by Degrees. And no man of Sense, can but distinguish betwixt a gradual reception of any Practice spreading it self, and growing up to a custom, and a practice taking its rise and Original from a formal joint Decree of a General <hi>Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dr.</hi> having set down some part of one of these Testimonies of <hi>Ierom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> alledges, that we hold or <hi>guess</hi> (as he expresses it,) that this Universal Decree, was about the Year 140. We hold indeed with <hi>Blondel,</hi> that about this time, the forementioned <gap reason="foreign">

Evang. (Part.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> P. 56.57.) and the <hi>Appendix</hi> thereto (P. 102. 103.) and this will be convincingly apparent.</p>
               <p>Well,<note place="margin">P. 415.416.</note> what says the Dr. to this Testimony? Having given out our Sense of <hi>Ierom</hi>'s words (wherein he contradicts his former Gloss) his First exception is,
<q>That <hi>Ierom</hi> being Born but about the Year 330, is a Witness far short in Antiquity to these early Witnesses which he has adduced: That he is a Hundred Years after <hi>Origen,</hi> three Hundred after <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have made it appear, that none of the Drs. early Witnesses, give a Relevant Testimony to the Point, and <hi>These,</hi> he undertakes to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> the derivation of the <hi>Apostolick Office,</hi> in its proper formal Sense, to an Order of Ordinary Officers Superior to <hi>Pastors,</hi> and inhancing their whole Authority in Government: We have made appear, that all that his Testimonies amounts to prove, is only a General designation of <hi>Bishops,</hi> made use of by the Ancients, and at most a supposal of some deference, and fixed <hi>Presidency,</hi> which they had in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories: And who sees not, that this is utterly short of proving what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends? So, that his Witnesses are mute in our Cause, and speaks not to the Question and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <q>The Dr. from P. 433. to P. 447. asserts, and endeavours to prove that the <hi>Bishop,</hi> hath for his peculiar prerogative, annexed to his person and Office as <hi>Bishop.</hi> 1. The <hi>Legislative</hi> Power, which he calls the Essence of Government, in the very same manner, as he supposes, the <hi>Apostles</hi> possest and exercised it. 2<hi>dly.</hi> The sole Authority to Consecrat and Ordain. 3<hi>ly.</hi> The whole Authority of Spirituall <hi>Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to Cite, Examin Judg, Censure, and absolve Delinquents. 4<hi>ly.</hi> To <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firm</hi> the Baptized.</q>
From all which, he, as intirly excluds all <hi>Pastors</hi> in Meetings, never so frequent and formal, and allows them no more Interest in any of these, than if they were no Church Officers at all, So, that their medling in the least, with these his supposed sole prerogatives of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> is in his Judgment as gross Antiscriptural encroachment, and stepping beyond the Duties and limits of their Function and Office, as if they should invade the Kings Authority and prerogative. Now, the Office of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> being of this Nature and extent, in the Dr's Judgment, let any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Candor or Conscience, give sentence upon it, what the Witnesses before adduced by him, do say to prove this, and what strength there is in their Testimoneis, to reach this conclusion. Again, 2<hi>ly.</hi> As the Drs. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended early Witnesses, are but general and ambiguous in their Testimonies, and consequently can make no Faith in this Matter, so, they are so far from being unanimous, as he calls them, that upon the contrary, several of them (as is above cleared) do give Witness against him: Particularly, <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> two of his most Ancient Witnesses; <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> imputing also (with <hi>Jerom</hi>) the Episcopal <hi>Presidency,</hi> which obtained in their time, to the Churches Custom, not to Divine Appointment, do thus cast a contradicting blot upon his supposed Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: <hi>Ambrose</hi> acknouledging in special, that <hi>non per omnia conveniunt Apostolorum scripta ordinationi, quae nunc est in Eeclesia Comment. in Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>ad Ephes.</hi> And tho it be controverted, whether this was the true <hi>Ambrose,</hi> yet we must tell him, with the learned Professors of <hi>Saumur</hi> (<hi>De Episcop. &amp; Presb.

All who have seen <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Testimony, do know, that he Reasons this Point of the Identity of the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> from Scripture, least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should take this to be his private Opinion [<hi>Putat aliquis,</hi> saith he, <hi>non Scripturarum, sed nostram esse sententiam, Episcopum &amp; Presbyterum unum esse</hi>] the one Name importing the Age, the other the Office of the <hi>Pastor.</hi> Then he goes through these Scriptures, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.3.

               </p>
               <p>The Dr's <hi>Third Exception</hi> is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>That <hi>Jerom</hi> elsewhere owns the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>'s Superiority, whereof he exhibits, First this Proof, that in his <hi>Dialogue Advers. Luciferians,</hi> he gives this Reason, why one not Baptized by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> received not the Holy Ghost, because the Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles: Which, the Dr. says, makes it plain, that he placed the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the same rank, with the Apostles.</q>
A strange Proof indeed! <hi>First,</hi> we heard, that <hi>Jerom</hi> Reasons the Point from Scripture, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are all one; and therefore, it is odd from <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Naming a <hi>Bishop,</hi> to understand him of his Hierarchical <hi>Bishop.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Jerom</hi> says [<hi>quid facit excepta Ordinatione Episcopus,</hi> &amp;c.] what doth the <hi>Bishop,</hi> except Ordination, which the <hi>Presbyter</hi> doth not? (A Clause
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58203:37"/>
and Passage, we find the Dr. much harping upon) but in his gloss upon this Testimony, he doth in contradiction to himself, and <hi>Jerom</hi> also, appropriat to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the Administration of the Sacrament of Baptism. What if one Reason thus, against the dispisers of this Ordinance? Such a Person is not Sealed by the Spirit, because not Baptized by a <hi>Pastor</hi>; for the Holy Ghost Descended on the Apostles. Will the Dr. disown this Reasoning? Or, will he own the Inference, that therefore, <hi>Pastors,</hi> are equal to <hi>Apostles?</hi> Or, say it were such a Reasoning; such a Person, or Persons, cannot be Converted or Sealed by the Spirit, not having heard the Converting Word Preached by a <hi>Pastor,</hi> since the <hi>Apostles</hi> thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and Ministred the Holy Ghost; Will any (but such as draw Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Illustrations beyond the Moon, as this Dr) inferr that the <hi>Pastor</hi> is thus equal unto <hi>Apostles</hi>? Will the Dr. in good earnest affirm, that the Person who performs such Acts of the Power of Order, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> did perform, and with the saving Blessing of the Spirit, is upon this Ground equalled in Office to the <hi>Apostles</hi>? If so, he must make all Faithful <hi>Pastors</hi> thus equal, and overturn all his Reasoning from a supposed Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Bishops</hi> to the Apostolat.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Dr's next Proof is drawn from <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Heliod.</hi> where he says,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Bishops</hi> are in place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </q>
And so, say we, are all Faithful <hi>Pastors</hi> (whom <hi>Ierom</hi> makes one with <hi>Bishops,</hi> according to the Scripture acceptation, and at large makes it good) in the place of <hi>Apostles,</hi> as to the exercise of an ordinary Ministrie, and the Power of Order and Jurisdiction, Essential and necessar to the Church, else, our Lord had not promised His presence with His <hi>Apostles</hi> to the end of the World, when He sent them out, and Sealed their Patent to Preach the Gospel, and Disciple all Nations to Him.
<q>Of the same Stamp, is that which he Cits of <hi>Ierom</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.16.<note place="margin">

of the Scripture <hi>Bishop.</hi> As for his Epistle <hi>ad Nepot.</hi> asserting that what <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were, that are the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbters. Ierom</hi> in this allusion, in point of Government, asserts only, that God has under the New Testament, as under the Old, fixed a Church Government and Church Officers: And giving the Dr. the advantage of this Sense, that <hi>Ierom,</hi> including the degenerat Custom of his time, insinuats the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised difference betwixt the then <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>; I pray, what says this to the Dr's. scope? <hi>viz</hi>: To prove from <hi>Ierom</hi>'s allusive Phrase, and expressing himself thus, The many Essential differences, which he places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi>: No man of Sense can draw such an inference; For 1. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Judgment, founded upon so many clear Scripture Grounds, as to the identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> when asserting and Disputing this Point, <hi>ex professo,</hi> ought in all Reason to preponderat any such General al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusive Expressions, and as a <hi>Comment.</hi> Expound the same, in a Sense most consentient to his Judgment, if we will but allow him the Common privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of all Men, to be the best Interpreter of his own Sense. 2<hi>ly.</hi> The Dr. himself must acknowledg this, else he will make <hi>Ierom</hi> plead for a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel- <hi>Aaron,</hi> or Universal <hi>Patriarch,</hi> if the Words were taken in a strict Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sense, as tending every way to equiparat the Government of the Church under the Old and New Testament.</p>
               <p>The Dr. inferrs from this Passage,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 417.</note>
                  <q>Therefore, as <hi>Aaron</hi> by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, was Superior to his Sons, so is the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s Sense to his <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  </q>
But he might as well infer; Therefore, as there was one <hi>Aaron,</hi> set over his <hi>Sons,</hi> and all the Priests and Levits of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> so, ought there to be, in <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Sense, one Supreme <hi>President</hi> over al the Christian Church. Besides, 2<hi>ly.</hi> The Dr. dare not say, that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons and the Priests had no Essential interest in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it was inhanced and Monopolized in the person of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as he holds (and insinuats, that <hi>Ierom</hi> also holds) that it is [thus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized in the Person of the <hi>Bishop. Ierom</hi> asserts, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> are all one, <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> consequently, that they have the same Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential interest in Government. So, that whatever <hi>President</hi> he may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose set over them by their Choice, yet it neither doth, nor can enhance, nor seclude this their Power. Thus we see, that the Dr's alledged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in these Passages, to his premised Testimony, anent the identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> is but his own imagnation: Besides, that one of his Degree should know, that no <hi>simile,</hi> is to be strained beyond the Scope of the Author making use of it, else it were not a <hi>simile.</hi>
                  <q>The Dr. asks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> whether <hi>Ierom,</hi> is more to be Credited, when speaking without a Byass, or when speaking partially, and in his own Cause?</q>
I <hi>Answer</hi> by a Counter-query, whether <hi>Ierom</hi>'s full and larg ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58203:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his Judgment, when Disputing a Point, <hi>ex professo,</hi> and from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is more to be believed, and laid hold upon, as expressing his Sense, than a general dark allusive expression, when under no such Circumstances, and prosecuting no such scope and design, and which of the two ought to preponderat? And so I dismiss the Dr's Third Answer.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fourth exception</hi> to the premised Testimonie is,
<q>That the translation of the Government from the common Counsel of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> to one <hi>Bishop,</hi> must be in <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Sense, <hi>Apostolick,</hi> since it was made, when it was said, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollo's; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this Decree, must needs have been made in <hi>Pauls</hi> time.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Dr. might have seen this Phantastick exception long since removed: <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>Junius,</hi> in the passage, forecited (<hi>scil. de Cler. Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Not.</hi> 16.) where, he at large expones this Testimony, and removes this gloss [<hi>tria distinguit tempora, Hieronymus,</hi> saith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>Ierom</hi> distinguisheth Three Periods of time; one, wherein the Church was Governed by common Counsel of <hi>Presbyters</hi>: The second, wherein there were divisions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and it was said among the People, not at <hi>Corinth.</hi> only, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For when these things were said at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church was Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the common Counsel of <hi>Presbyters</hi>; as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. The Third and last, wherein one chosen out from among the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> was set over the rest. And every one of these times, saith he (that I may speak with the Vulgar) had their own latitude. <hi>Iunius</hi> here, informs the Dr. that this was not said at <hi>Corinth.</hi> only, but among the People [<hi>malum non</hi> Corinthi <hi>solum</hi>]— It was. saith he, <hi>a publick evil.</hi>
                  <q>He adds that <hi>Paul</hi> himself prescribed no such remedy to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> And and afterward (<hi>Not.</hi> 17.) he tells us, that <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, That after it was said among the People, this Change was made, but not, that this human <hi>Prostasie</hi> began at that time, <hi>viz</hi>: of the Schism, but after that time.</q>
                  <q>To this Judicious account of the learned <hi>Iunius,</hi> I shall add another of the famous <hi>Whittaker</hi> (<hi>De Eccl. quest.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 29.) where he thus obviats and removes the Drs. Quible upon <hi>Ierom</hi>'s forementioned Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, he saith not, it was Decreed by the Apostles, that one <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> should be set over the rest; This he says was by the Churches cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, not the Apostles Decree —</q>
                  <q>Then <hi>Jerom</hi> adds, let the <hi>Bishops</hi> know, that it is rather by custom, than Divine appointment, that they are set over <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Had the Apostles, saith <hi>Whittaker,</hi> changed the First Order, and set <hi>Bishops</hi> over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and forbidden the Churches to be Governed by their common Counsel, truely, this had been the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ords appointment, because proceeding from the Apostles of Christ, unless we will ascribe to Custom, not to Divine appointment, what they decreed: But the Apostles being alive, there was nothing changed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58203:38"/>
in that Order; For the <hi>Epistle</hi> was written when <hi>Paul,</hi> was in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
The Dr. may in these accounts, see his Error. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Testimonies, proving a Scripture parity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> through all the Apostles times and writings, and even to <hi>John</hi>'s time, the surviver of them all, could not be so bruitishly inconsequent, as to make the Schism at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the occasion of the Change of Government, so long before his Testimony from <hi>John,</hi> yea before <hi>Paul</hi>'s farewel Sermon to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> from which, he draws another of his Proofs, but he speaks of an human Custom coming in <hi>Paulatim postea,</hi> piece and piece, and by degrees, long after these times, and but alluds unto that division. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 (where again the Dr. may see the Error of taking strictly his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Phrases) expressing it, in the Apostles words, not of <hi>their times</hi>; For, as we heard <hi>Whittaker</hi> observe, the Apostles never appointed such accressent Power of <hi>Prelats</hi> over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as a Remedy of Schism, among all their Prescriptions of the Remedies of this evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> also, will tell the Dr. that this was a Remedy worse than the disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Dr. adds, to confirm his Sense of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Words, that <hi>Jerom</hi> (in his Book <hi>De Eccles. Script.</hi>) shews, that after the Lord's Ascension, <hi>James</hi> was Ordained by the Apostles, <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem, Timothy</hi> by <hi>Paul, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete, Polycarp</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> So, that he must either mean an <hi>Apostolick</hi> Decree, or else, he must contradict himself.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Not to detain the Dr. to prove this Book to be <hi>Jerom</hi>'s, which some hold to be spurious, this is easily removed by what we have above offered, and even from <hi>Whittaker,</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> general, improper, ambiguous Speech of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and their various use of this epithet, terming such Persons, who did for some time Officiat in a place, whether extraordinary Officers or ordinary, the <hi>Bishops</hi> thereof, after the Denomination and custom, which had then obtained, whereof instances have been above exhibited. <hi>Jerom</hi> speaking of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Succession, says, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> chused out one to preside [<hi>a Marco Evangelista</hi>] and terming <hi>Mark</hi> thus (not meerly, upon the account of his being a Writer of the Gospel, which is the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est acceptation, but in the Judgment of those, best acquaint with his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> as a transient, unfixed Preacher of the Gospel) he must needs account <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> of the same Office; And therefore, not <hi>Bishops</hi> in a formal Sense, nor set up in such a manner, and for such an end, which were Cross to their Office, as I have above made good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that it seems odd and inconsistent with common Sense, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the Lords Ascension, such Persons were set up, in the Office and Character specified, and cross to this whole Testimony of <hi>Jerom</hi>; For thus, there could be no time for <hi>Presbyters</hi> governing by common counsel, nor the Schism to grow up thereupon, both which, <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Testimonies
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58203:39"/>
does suppose, in distinct Periods of time, as we heard <hi>Iunius</hi> observe; So, that the Dr. speaks very bluntly and inconsideratly, when he tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>That either <hi>Ierom</hi> must mean a Decree Apostolick, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after our Lord's Ascension, or else expresly contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</q>
This Alternative of the Dr's. I say, is pityful inadvertency; For, should <hi>Ierom</hi> speak of such an Apostolick Decree, as he imputes to him, he must needs directly contradict himself, in Asserting the Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to have been for a time [<hi>communi consilio Presbyterorum</hi>] And a Schism growing thereupon: For, in the Dr's Sense, there was never such a Government, or an occasion of Schism existent. Besides, That this Gloss of the Dr's. makes <hi>Ierom</hi> say, that the Apostles changed the Divine appointment, to make way for an human form; For, <hi>Jerom</hi> holds the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by common Council of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to be founded upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, and that which Succeeded, upon human Custom only. The Dr. therefore, and all else, who would accord <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Testimony, with what he here Cites, must understand his words in the sense, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which, as is said, is the Sense and Judgment of famous <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines.</p>
               <p>The Dr's <hi>Fifth exception</hi> is,
<q>That had this change of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from <hi>Presbyterian</hi> to <hi>Episcopal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 417.418.</note> been in very deed; it must either have been made by the Apostles, or thereafter: If we say, by the Apostles, its strange, there is no mention of it in Scripture.</q>But to this, the <hi>Answer</hi> is easie and ready, that we own no such Sense of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s words, nor can they admit the same, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made good. Well, but the Dr. pushes us with the other horn of his <hi>Dilemma, viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>That if we say, it was made after the Apostles, or about the year 140, how comes it, that such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> relative to an Universal Change of the Government from one kind to another, is not mentioned in Ecclesiastick Antiquity? There being no such Decree heard of, and <hi>Clemens, Ignatius, Hegesippus, Irenaeus, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who lived in that Period, are so far from taking notice of this, that they maintain the uninterrupted Succession of <hi>Bishops,</hi> from the Apostles.</q>
I <hi>answer,</hi> this other push and Horn of the Dr's <hi>Dilemma,</hi> is as far from harming us, as the other; For it is grounded upon the Dr's own groundless fancie, and distorted Sense of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s words, as if by [<hi>toto orbe decretum</hi>] he had meant a formal general <hi>Decree</hi> of a <hi>Council</hi>: Which phantastick conceit, several Learned Divines have refuted, from the Tenor and Scope of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s words. <hi>Jerom</hi> says [<hi>prospiciente Concilio — &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to orbe decretum</hi>] not in any formed <hi>Council,</hi> either in the Apostles time, or afterward, but he means, when through the World, it was said among the People, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [<hi>postquam alii</hi> Corinthiorum <hi>more Dementati in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58203:39"/>
discerptae sunt</hi>] (as <hi>Blondel</hi> expresses and expounds it) it was Decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, or in and among particular Churches through the whole World. <hi>Decreed through the whole World,</hi> is all one with <hi>by the whole World,</hi> which is distributively to be taken. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s words evince this; For, the <hi>Council</hi>'s Decree representing the whole World, would have been all at once, but <hi>Jerom</hi> says, this change came not in <hi>simul &amp; semel,</hi> but <hi>paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> by degrees, and that the after <hi>Prostasie</hi> came in <hi>Consuetudine,</hi> or by custom, which points at a gradual comming in. Thus, we have seen the Dr's fancied absurdity evanish. I might add, that the Churches speedy defection from the Apostolick Purity and Institutions in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not appear strange to any, who considers Scripture Instances, of as great and more speedy Defections: Witness, that of <hi>Israel</hi>'s worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Golden Calf, so shortly after the Promulgation of the Law; And the early workings of the Mysterie of iniquity, in the New Testament Church, and affectation of <hi>Episcopal</hi> Primacy, in the Apostle <hi>John</hi>'s time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which already. For what he adds of the Testimonies of Authors, as to the Succession of <hi>Bishops,</hi> from Apostles, at <hi>Rome, Jerusalem,</hi> &amp;c. we have already discovered fully, what a mean and chattered proof this is, and that the pretended Succession is lyable to unanswerable exceptions, and terminating in <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Evangelists,</hi> whose Office is extraordinary, and expired; the fabulous vanity thereof, is in this convincingly apparent.</p>
               <p>The Dr. tells us,
<q>That <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> while at <hi>Rome,</hi> might as well know <hi>Peters</hi> Successors there,<note place="margin">P. 418, 419.</note> as we may know, who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bishop Whitgift,</hi> in the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he being no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distant from the one, than we from the other.</q>
But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were there no greater Certainty of the one, than of the other, I should confidently Challenge that Matter of Fact as Fabulous: And had that Chair, had no other Successors of <hi>Whitgift,</hi> than the first <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it had been an empty Chair. And were there as great Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of an <hi>Arch-Bishop Whitgift</hi> at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and as many famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictors of this Matter of Fact, and of his Successors, as in this case of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Succession would merit no Mans Belief. For the Dr's. Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clearness of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Romes</hi> Successions [which he says is as clear, as any thing in Ecclesiastick History] he therein crosses the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learned <hi>Protestants,</hi> who have made the contrary appear, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove evinced. The Accounts of this supposed Succession, being Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory one to another, and sometimes Persons Contemporary, made Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous therein, yea, and the very Name and Office of Persons design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being of a various and different Nature and Signification, some of these pretended succeeding <hi>Bishops,</hi> being mere <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  <q>But says the Doctor,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> who will question an ancient Monarchy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58203:40"/>
of some Defect of the Historical Accounts of its Succession.</q>
I <hi>answer,</hi> The Original of the Monarchy, being clear in History, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Successors of the first, in Point of an Historical Faith, this will not be questioned: And when the Dr. shal let us see the <hi>Bishops</hi> of his Mould, set up by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and present to us the Scripture Escutchions of their Power, together with clear Historical Accounts of their first Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors accordingly, we shal admit his paralell Argument, else it is a mere <hi>non sequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. in the next place, tells us,
<q>That the Story of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> Universal Decree,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> being Unattested, and Contradictory to all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> it must needs be lookt upon, as a mere Figment of his Fancy.</q>
But from what is said, its evident, that the Dr. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Impugning the Decree, which <hi>Jeroms</hi> Testimony speaks of, has been, in all that is premised, but Fighting with his own Shadow, and a Figment of his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
                  <q>The Dr. demands an Instance of any Church of another Form of Government, than <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
                  </q>
Which Demand he might have found sufficiently answered by <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers, who have made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the first Apostolick Churches were Governed <hi>Presbyterially.</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Jus Divinum Regim.

Besides, the Multitud of <hi>Fathers,</hi> who maintain the Identity of <hi>Bishops and Presbyters,</hi> will go far in this Proof. And if <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> Demonstration from Antiquity, (<hi>Apol. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>P.</hi> 308. &amp;c.) that <hi>Bishops</hi> came not in till the year 140. hold good, surely all the existent Churches in that Period of Time, are so many Instances of such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for this Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we have its first <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, attested by <hi>Iohan. Major. de gest. Scot.

               </p>
               <p>We come now, to the Dr's last <hi>Exception</hi> to this Testimony of <hi>Ierom,</hi>

<q>This Conceit, saith he, reflects odiously upon the Wisdom of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and his Apostles, in Devolving the Government upon <hi>Presbyters common Counsel,</hi> which was the Occasion of sundry Schisms and Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

for Removal of which, the Church found it needful to dissolve those <hi>Presbytries,</hi> and introduce <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in their Room.</q>
But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor might have found this his Conceit and Notion long since removed, and that his supposed Reflection, depends not upon any Words of <hi>Ierom. Ierom</hi> says,
<q>That [<hi>Diaboli Instinctu</hi>] by the Devils Instinct, there fell Divisions and Factions, one saying, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, and another, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollo, and that thereupon, this Remedy of setting up fixed <hi>Presidents,</hi> was fallen upon.</q>
Which the Learned <hi>Whittaker</hi> has told the Dr, was a Remedy worse than the Disease: And <hi>Ierom</hi> himself, distinguishes this <hi>Humane Custom,</hi> from the <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> Now, where is the Dr's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence? Because <hi>Jerom</hi> says, that for preventing Schisms at that time, the Government was changed, doth he therefore charge this, upon the Apostles Government, or Christs Institution? He may as well say, that a Mans asserting Corruptions to be in the Church, will inferr his imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Ordinances. Was there not Discord among the Apostles, under Christs own immediat Government? But did this Discord, or the Record thereof in Scripture, reflect on His Holy Government? <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> divided and parted asunder, but doth <hi>Luke,</hi> in Recording this, charge it upon the Apostolick Government?</p>
               <p>To make the Folly of the Dr's <hi>Inference,</hi> yet further to appear, let these three things be considered. 1.
<q>He confesses that <hi>Jerom</hi> asserts, that the Apostolick Government of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parity, was the <hi>Occasion</hi> only of these Schisms.</q>
Therefore, say I, he makes it not the <hi>Cause</hi>: If the Dr. assert this, he will pitifully expose his Learning, in not distinguishing these things, which are so obviously distinguishable, and reflect upon our Saviour, in saying, he came not to send Peace, but a Sword and Division, to kindle Fire upon the Earth, to set a Man at Variance against his Father, and to make those of a Mans own House, his Enemies; as if His Holy Doctrin, were the <hi>Cause</hi> of these Evils. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that his Corruption and Sin, took <hi>Occasion from the Commandment,</hi> and was irritat by the Law; but prevents so gross a Mistake, as to suppose any Imputation upon the Holy Law thereby. <hi>Is the Law sin</hi>? saith he, <hi>God forbid.</hi> He abhorrs the Consequence as absurd and blasphemous. 2. The Dr. holds, that <hi>Jerom</hi> asserts,
<q>The Church found it necessary upon this Occasion, to change the first Government,<note place="margin">P. 419, 420.</note> by the <hi>Common Counsel of Presbyters,</hi> and (as he expresses it) to <hi>Dissolve Presbytries,</hi> and Introduce <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>
                  </q>
Wherein he abuses <hi>Ierom,</hi> and pitifully Wire-draws his Words, offering a mere Distortion of them: For, [1.] <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks only, as is above cleared, of an Innovating Custom, growing up by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, not of a Government introduced by the whole Church, upon Ground of Necessity. [2.] He makes <hi>Ierom</hi> assert, that upon the first
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58203:41"/>
Introduction of this Custom, <hi>Presbytries</hi> were wholly dissolved, which is most cross to <hi>Ieroms</hi> Meaning; For, even in his own time, long after the first Origine of this Custom, he says [<hi>quid facit, &amp;c.</hi>] what doth the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> except Ordination, which the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> doth not? So, that in the first Introduction of this <hi>Episcopus Praeses, Ierom</hi> could far less suppose a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of <hi>Presbytries,</hi> or total Abolishing of their Authority, as the Dr. foolishly suggests, but only such a fixed <hi>President</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who, as in that Capacity, had a Deference, and the Care committed to him, but not so, as wholly to exclud <hi>Presbyters</hi> Decisive Suffrage. Again, in the 3<hi>d.</hi> place, what ever may be said of this after-Practice and Frame of Government, <hi>Ierom</hi> expresly denies a Divine Right, or <hi>Ius</hi> to it, and distinguishes it, from <hi>the Truth of the Divine Appointment,</hi> which first took place: So, that, tho we should grant to the Dr, that in <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Sense, the whole Church, by joynt Determination, had <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> made this Alteration, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that he charges the Error upon the Church, as a Recess from the Divine Path, but not at all upon the Divine Appointment it self, which he diligently distinguishes from, and sets in Opposition to this Custom and Practice of the Church. So, that the absurd Reflection upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Government, and the Wisdom of our Saviour, the Dr. may see to be lodged nearer home, <hi>viz.</hi> not only upon these, who first brought in this Human <hi>Prostasie,</hi> (especially such, as Scrued it up to an Hierarchical <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> which is so cross to the Apostolick Parity) but also, and in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner, to be chargeable upon these, who uphold it, after its many Evils are discovered. <hi>Ierom</hi> asserts only the Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Imparity, was brought in for Remedy of Schism, but leaves the charg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the Dr. has pointed us to none of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> Writings for Proof of this, so (as we have cleared above) <hi>Ierom</hi> and the <hi>Ancients,</hi> in such Allusive Expressions, intend nothing else, but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Offices in the Gospel Ministry, and to assert the Authority thereof. <hi>Blond.

the Necessity of an Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> with Supreme Authority, and yet the Necessity of a <hi>Divine Appointment</hi> to the contrary.
<q>That which the Dr. calls <hi>the Unavoidable Consequence of</hi> Jerom<hi>'s Hypothesis,</hi> viz. That the Church had gone to Ruine,<note place="margin">

                     </note> if a Wiser Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than that of Apostles, had not been taken up, to supply its Defect.</q>
We have made appear, to be a very easily avoided Consequence, and by no Twist of Reason, to be deducible from <hi>Ierom</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and that the Dr, in drawing such a Consequence, has, in stead of <hi>Ierom,</hi> involved himself, in absurd Deductions.
<q>He calls this Testimony of <hi>Jerom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> the only considerable Objection, against the Universal Conformity of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church to <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government;</q>
And therein discovers his small and slender Reading in this Controversie, since he might have seen in <hi>Blondel, Salmasius,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, many more considerable Objections; And this one, we have found so very considerable, that it hath quit baffled, and born down the Dr's mean and inconsiderable Answers. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the close of this <hi>Section.</hi> (P. 421.) the Dr. flies high in these his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed victorious <hi>Answers</hi> to <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Testimony, telling us, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Superiority of <hi>Bishops,</hi> being handed down by Testimonies, from Age to Age, its as unreasonable to reject the same, as the Canon of the Scriptures, thence derived.</q>
The Dr. here discovers, what Spirit he is of. I had alwise thought, that the Divine Impression of the Scripture Canon, the intrinsick infallible evidences of a Divine inspiration, had been the great ground of the Churches reception, not its being handed down to us, from former generations, or the First receivers; And that our Divines, had alwise distinguished, the Church and former Generations Testimony and recommendation, from the innate, Essential evidences of its Divine Authority, as to the Ground of our Faith and reception. But however, I shall tell him, that he should have exhibited, as full and Divine proof and unanimous recommendation of all the Churches, for his hierarchical <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as there is for the Scripture Canon, before he had offered such an high flown notion.</p>
               <p>Before I part with the Dr. upon this head, I must needs (tho I have a little before, touched it) take notice of two pieces of signal unsoundnness and unfair dealing in this Matter of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Testimony. <hi>First,</hi> That in all his Animadversions, and muster of <hi>Episcopal</hi> strength against it, he doth not in the least, take notice of <hi>Jeroms</hi> Scripture proofs, of the parity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter:</hi> in correspondence to our Sense and Pleading. Upon <hi>Philip</hi> 1.1. He argues,
<q>That many <hi>Bishops</hi> are saluted by <hi>Paul</hi> in that Church; and that it could not have many of the <hi>Diocesian</hi> stamp; That therefore, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks indifferently of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as one and the same.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58203:42"/>
That <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Paul</hi> called the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, Bishops,</hi> set up by the Holy Ghost; and that therefore he owned the <hi>Elders</hi> of that one City, as <hi>Bishops.</hi> That in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the care of the Churches is divided among many — <hi>obey them that have the Rule over you, for they watch for your Souls.</hi> That <hi>Peter,</hi> called so from the firmness of his Faith, exhorts thus <hi>the Elders — the Elders which are among you, I exhort, who am also an Elder, and Witness, of the sufferings of Christ, Feed the Flock of God, which is among you, not by constraint, but willingly,</hi> &amp;c. These things I write, saith <hi>Ierom,</hi> to shew, that among the Ancients, <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> were one and the same, and that by little and little, the care was devolved upon one.</q>
Now, what says the Dr. to these his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the Apostles Doctrin? If they are not found, why doth he not discover his mistake? If they hold good, the Dr's <hi>exceptions</hi> evanish unto Wind. As for instance,
<q>That <hi>Ierom</hi> is too late a Witness; that he is a Witness in his own Cause; that he talks otherwise, when not byassed with partiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
For, if these Reasonings be sound, his Witness, is both a most early and Divine Witness, and in the cause of God and Truth; And whatever other Testimony he may be supposed to give, this Divine Testimony ought to be preferred, wherein there can be no partiality, unless the Dr. will impute partiality to the Divine Oracles, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Holy GOD of Truth, in this Point. This also, answers the Drs quible, about a Decree Apostolick, as the Ground of the Change of Government, and that <hi>Ierom</hi> could mean no such thing, since none can be so brutish, as to impute to the Apostles, a contradictory Decree to their own Doctrin. As also, that other exception of his, evanishes, upon this Ground, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  <q>That no such Decree of the Church was Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And that therefore, there was none such: For, say, it was either a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or gradual Custom, if cross to the Apostolick Doctrin, it ought to be rejected.</q>
Thus, also appears the Folly of his last exception,
<q>That he imputes to the Apostolick Government, that it occasioned Schisms.</q>
For, upon supposal of the soundness of <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Scripture proofs, the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> being the mind of Christ and his Apostles, this Government could never give ground to Schisms, nor could the Church warrantably alter it, upon any such pretence; So that, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and by whomsoever the change was made, it was made contrary to the revealed will of the great Law-giver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Point of unsoundness, the Dr. is Chargable with, is, that in the beginning of his discourse upon <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Testimony, he professes, <hi>that he will not disput with us, the Sense of this Passage, but allow it to bear our Sense</hi>; Yet in several of his Answers, he impugns our Sense: Especially his 4.5. &amp; 6. and not only our Sense, but the Sense of sound <hi>Protestant</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58203:42"/>
as is above evident.
<q>His Conceit about <hi>Ierom</hi>'s making the <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Custom,</hi> he speaks of, to be the Schism at <hi>Corinth</hi> (which is his <hi>Fourth</hi> exception) and his Supposition, That <hi>Jerom</hi> by [<hi>toto orbe decretum</hi>] un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands a formal joint <hi>Decree</hi> of the whole Church, not a gradual <hi>Custom,</hi> and that <hi>Jerom</hi> makes the Church to redress upon necessary grounds, the Government appointed by Christ and his Apostles, and thus to impeach his Divine Wisdom (which are his other exceptions) All these, I say, as they are Distortions of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s sense, so directly opposit to the Sense given by us, and by all sound Divines; yea, and such, as have been long since refuted by <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers, in Answer to <hi>Popish</hi> glosses and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with whom our Dr. and his Fellows does here join Issue:</q>
So that, we may judg of the affinity of both their Causes, by the near cognation of their Pleadings.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. The Dr<hi>'s Fourth</hi> Argument, Examined, taken from <hi>our Saviour's alledged allowance and</hi> Approbation of <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government, in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the Seven <hi>Asian</hi> Churches.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>WE do now proceed to the Dr's last <hi>Argument,</hi> to prove,<note place="margin">P. 421.</note> That the rightful Government of the Church is <hi>Episcopal,</hi> taken from <hi>our Saviours Allowance and Approbation thereof, in his Seven</hi> Epistles <hi>to the Seven Churches of</hi> Asia, directed to the <hi>Seven Angels,</hi> called Seven <hi>Stars in His Right Hand,</hi> or the Seven Lights of the Seven Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. and 2.1. And in every Epistle, owned as his <hi>Angels</hi> and Messengers. The Dr. tells us, that if he can prove them to be Seven <hi>Bishops,</hi> presiding over <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> of these Churches at that time, they are unanswerable instances of Christs Allowance and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Order.</q>
This trite and often Baffled Argument, taken from the supposed <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power of the Seven <hi>Asian</hi> Angels, has been so frequently scanned and tossed by Writers, on this Controversie, that the Dr. since he makes here such a Parade, should either have brought some new Strength upon the Field, or offered an Answer, to the many clear returns, given to this Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58203:43"/>However, to clear our way, in examining what the <hi>Dr.</hi> says upon this head (which is nothing else, but some Old Musty stuff repeated) I <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> two things. 1. That the Collective Sense of the term, <hi>Angel,</hi> is most suitable to Scripture, and the Scope of these <hi>Epistles.</hi> 2. That allowing the <hi>Angels</hi> to be <hi>single Persons,</hi> will nothing help the Drs. design and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> that the collective Sense of the term <hi>Angel,</hi> is most suitable to Scripture, and the Scope of these Epistles, appears thus. 1. This suits best the Stile of this Book, which is by mystick visional Representations, to includ many individuals: As one singular, so all the individuals of the Church, both Members and Officers, are represented by <hi>One Candlestick</hi>; And why not also, <hi>all the Ministers,</hi> by <hi>one Angel</hi>? A term which of it self, and in this place imports no Jurisdiction properly, but is immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Angelical frame and qualities of Ministers. 2. This is also suitable to the style of this Book, as it is <hi>Epistolare</hi>; the Address, may be to <hi>one,</hi> but it will give no Authority to that <hi>one</hi> over the rest; As an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress from the King to a Speaker in Parliament, will give the Speaker no Jurisdiction and Authority over his Fellow-Members. When our Lord said unto <hi>Peter</hi> only expresly, not to the rest of his fellow-Disciples, <hi>I will give unto thee the Keyes,</hi> &amp;c. who but brutish and partially affected <hi>Papists,</hi> will conclud, that he was <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Primate</hi> over the Apostles? And that they had not, and even by this promise, an equal Authority with him, in the use of the Keys? This the Dr. must acknowledg, unless he will justify the <hi>Popes</hi> Pleading from this Text. 3. This is suitable to Scripture Prophetick Writings, and to this Book, as such, to represent many <hi>Individuals,</hi> by one <hi>singular.</hi> The <hi>Four beasts, the Twenty Four Elders,</hi> do not signify so many individual persons: The <hi>singular</hi> Names of <hi>Woman, Beast, Whore, Dragon,</hi> signify a collection of many <hi>individuals.</hi> So the <hi>one,</hi> Spirit of God, is called the <hi>Seven Spirits,</hi> with reference to his manifold operations. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.20. <hi>One Ram,</hi> signifies <hi>many Kings</hi> of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> He that will not hearken to the <hi>Priest, Deut.</hi> 17.12. <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Priests</hi> in the plural. So, the <hi>Priests</hi> Lips should keep knowledg, and the Law sought at <hi>his</hi> Mouth <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. Here also, the <hi>Priest</hi> for <hi>Priests,</hi> in the Plural. Blest is <hi>that Servant,</hi> whom the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. i. e. Those Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> Particularly, as to the term <hi>Angel</hi>; It is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. that the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord encampeth about the Godly. <hi>i. e. many Angels,</hi> since they are all Ministring Spirits to them. 4. It is suitable to Scripture, and this Book, to represent an <hi>indefinit number</hi> by a <hi>definit</hi>: Thus all <hi>Iudahs</hi> Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, are represented by the <hi>Four Horns Zech.</hi> 1.18. All the <hi>Godly</hi> and the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> are represented by the <hi>Five</hi> Wise, and by the <hi>Five</hi> Foolish <hi>Virgins.</hi> The <hi>Seven Angels</hi> standing before God, Represents <hi>all the Angels. Ch.</hi> 8. of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58203:43"/>
this Book; for in <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. mention is made of all the Angels, who do thus stand. And with the same indefinitness, we are to understand the <hi>Septenarie</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, frequently elsewhere; as the <hi>Seven Pillars</hi> which Wisdom Hews out <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. The <hi>Seven Pastors</hi> or <hi>Shepherds, Micah.</hi> 5. The <hi>Seven Eyes Zech.</hi> 3. And in this very Book, <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.5.15. The <hi>Seven Candlesticks, Lamps, Viols.</hi> 5. As we find the Scripture, and this same Apostle, First, Naming a <hi>Multitude,</hi> and then contracting it into a <hi>Singular,</hi> as 2 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. <hi>v. — Many deceivers are entred into the World</hi> — Then — <hi>This is a Deceiver, and an Antichrist.</hi> And sometimes, the <hi>Individual</hi> in one Sentence, turned into a <hi>Multitude,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>She shall be saved i. e.</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> bearing Children, if <hi>they</hi> continue in Faith and Charity, <hi>i. e.</hi> such <hi>Women,</hi> in general. So, this <hi>single Angel,</hi> is turned into many, and spoken to, in the <hi>Plural,</hi> in one and the same Epistle. Thus <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. — <hi>Unto</hi> you, <hi>I say and unto the</hi> rest <hi>in</hi> Thyatira. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.

This, he will grant, belongs to all <hi>Pastors.</hi> Is it the Power of Ordination? The Scripture shews us, that this is Seated in a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. Is it the Ruling Governing Power? All Ministers are such <hi>Angels</hi>; All that Watch for Souls, do Rule over them, and all Labourers in the Word and Doctrin, have an equal joynt Interest in Feeding, Censuring and Ruling in the Churches, over which they are set, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12. And People are accordingly to submit themselves to them. Therefore, this <hi>Prostasie</hi> and Ruling Power, is no sole Prerogative of a <hi>single Angel,</hi> or supposed <hi>Bishop.</hi> Thus, it was with the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Act.</hi> 20. And it is much more suteable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of a <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> to whom, in a plain Scripture, the whole Government is found intrusted, rather than to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that plain Text by a Metaphor, and contrary thereunto, to set up <hi>one Angel,</hi> or Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Praeses,</hi> or the <hi>Moderator Angel,</hi> not the <hi>Angelus Princeps,</hi> or the <hi>Lord Angel</hi> yea, and the <hi>Praeses</hi> or <hi>Moderator</hi> for the time, as a Speaker in Parliament. <hi>Ephesus</hi> had <hi>many Angels</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) of equal Authority, who were made <hi>Bishops</hi> by the Holy Ghost, and set over that Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and they are spoken to, in the <hi>Plural,</hi> though the <hi>Angel</hi> is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>Singular</hi> Number. 2. This <hi>Angel,</hi> is said to have no Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Superiority over the rest of the Ministers, nor can the Dr. shew, where this <hi>Angel</hi> is spoken to, with reference to Ministers as subject to him, which notwithstanding, is his begged Supposition, and <hi>Petitio Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii,</hi> all along in this Argument. 3. The <hi>Parochial</hi> and <hi>Diocesan</hi> Division of the Churches, were long after this, and not until the 260 year after Christ, in the Judgment of best <hi>Antiquaries.</hi> 4. Nothing is required of this <hi>Angel,</hi> but that which is the common Duty of all <hi>Pastors.</hi> Finally, suppose it were granted to him, that a <hi>Superiority</hi> were imported in Naming this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> it may be a <hi>Superiority</hi> of <hi>Order, Dignity,</hi> or <hi>Gifts,</hi> and in such Moral Respects, not of Power and Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>The Dr, in Order to this his Scope, proposes generally the Method of his Proof, shewing,
<q>That he will prove that they were <hi>single Persons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid. &amp;</hi> P. 422.</note> 2<hi>ly,</hi> That they were Persons of <hi>great Authority</hi> in these Churches. 3<hi>ly,</hi> That they were the <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presidents</hi> of these Churches.</q>
Before I examin his Proofs, it is pleasant to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how well this Undertaking of the Dr. answers his Scope, which all along in this Dispute, is, to prove a Succession of ordinary Officers, in the Office of <hi>Apostolat,</hi> as he calls it, and in their whole Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Jurisdiction, excluding <hi>Pastors,</hi> from the least Interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
<q>By his Principles, these supposed Succeeding <hi>Prelats,</hi> are the sole Governours of Churches, have the sole Legislative Power (wherein he says, the Essence of Government consists) the Power of Consecration and Ordination to Ecclesiastick Offices, and that of the same Nature and Extent, as he supposes the Apostles had it, by vertue of their Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mission. The <hi>Bishops</hi> also, have, by his Principles, the sole Executive Spiritual Jurisdiction, Monopolized in them, as their peculiar Prerogative, <hi>viz.</hi> (as the Dr. explains it) to Cite, Examin, Admonish Offenders, Exclud from, or Admit to Church Communion, Censure or Absolve, Bind or Loose.</q>
                  <q>The twelve Thrones to Judg <hi>Israels</hi> Tribes, promised to Apostles, he understands of the Authority of Judging, and of all Spiritual Jurisdiction in the Church Visible, committed to them, and by them to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as their only Successors, in this Authority. To which, we may add, the Confirming of the Baptized, by Imposition of Hands, which he also ascribes to them, as their sole Prerogative.</q>
This the Dr. at large insists upon, from P. 433. to P. 438.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58203:44"/>Now, to prove all these Prerogatives of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and this Extensive Power, so paramount to all Authority, or Interest of <hi>Pastors</hi> in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it renders them mere Cyphers without a Figure, from the seven <hi>Asian Angels</hi>; Because they were <hi>single Persons,</hi> or of <hi>great Authority</hi> in the Churches, or <hi>President-Bishops</hi> in these Churches, is such a Proof, as the Simplest may Laugh at. For 1. Will any Man think, that their being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted as <hi>single Persons,</hi> will prove this Extensive Authority? Why may not a <hi>Senate</hi> be Saluted in the <hi>Consuls,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> Addressed in the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> in an Epistle to the <hi>Speaker</hi>? 2<hi>ly,</hi> Say, that they were <hi>Presidents,</hi> and admit, that they had Deference and Authority as such, as the <hi>Consul</hi> in the <hi>Senate,</hi> will this suppose, or by any Shadow of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or Connection, inferr, that they had such a Power, as is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and such as swallows up wholly and absolutly, all Authority of the Members of Church Judicatories? Nay, the Dr. will as soon joyn the <hi>Poles</hi> together, as unite this Antecedent and Consequent. Besides, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them <hi>Presidents,</hi> he discovers this, and confutes himself, since the Terme, both Name and Thing, in all Languages, and in the Sense of all Men, is appropriat to such, as are set over Juridical Courts, Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick, the Members whereof, are still supposed to have a Decisive Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, and Interest in the Government.
<q>Again 3<hi>ly,</hi> The Dr. says he will prove, that they were Persons of <hi>great Authority</hi> in these Churches.</q>
But, if he speak to the Point, and prosecut his Scope, he must call it <hi>Absolute and Sole Authority,</hi> intirely exclusive of all Interest, which <hi>Pastors,</hi> or any other Church Officers, may claim therein.</p>
               <p>Come we to the Dr's Grand Proofs, <hi>First,</hi> That they were <hi>single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> he proves from this,
<q>That they are mentioned as such — the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi>; And thus all along Addrest in the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> Number—<hi>I know thy Works—I have a few things against thee.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Argument is abundantly removed, by what is <hi>premised,</hi> anent the Collective Sense of the Word <hi>Angel,</hi> which our Lords Addressing the the Epistle to <hi>one Angel,</hi> doth no whit Impugn, in the sense of sound <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Divines. For further clearing this, let us hear the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, upon the Text,
<q>
                     <hi>To the Angel,</hi> i. e. to the Overseer, Inspector, or <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Church — This is set down here in the <hi>Singular</hi> Number, either, in regard of their whole Colledg, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7.</q>
Under the Name of <hi>Angel</hi> in the <hi>Singular,</hi> the whole Colledg of Priests, was to be understood; or because that some one, had the <hi>Presidency</hi> among them, in Order, by whom it was to be communicat to the rest, as appears by <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28.
<q>That there were more <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Overseers,</hi> in this Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> charges in his last Farewel, to take heed to themselves, and to the whole Flock, over which the Holy Ghost had made them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. e. <hi>Overseers,</hi> for to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58203:45"/>
Feed the Flock. So, that it is groundless, from hence to inferr, an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority of one person above the rest: For, the verry matter it self, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten here to the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church, is Written for a warning to the whole Church, as appears by <hi>v.</hi> 7. here, and above <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.11. The <hi>English</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the Authors of <hi>Part Second, Annot.</hi> going under the Name of <hi>Pool,</hi> thus sense that Passage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>To the Angel,</hi> it appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. That there were more Ministers there than one, but they were <hi>all Angels,</hi> and from the oneness of their business, they are called <hi>one Angel.</hi>
                  </q>
And upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.20. they tell us,
<q>That certain it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies no more, than is commmon to all Ministers, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Gods <hi>Messengers,</hi> and move upon his errands.</q>
That we are to understand here, the <hi>Doctors, Pastors</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church, is the sense and Judgment of <hi>Cluverus, Dr. Lightfoot. Cluverus</hi> takes notice, that the Change of the Number, <hi>v.</hi> 10.19. Argues, that the Epistle is not directed to <hi>one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> shews, that this Tittle, is with allusion, to that of the Minister of the Synagogue, whose Office was publickly to read and expound the Prophets, unto the People, as these Ministers were to Read these Epistles, in the publick Congregation. Thus also <hi>Piscator,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the whole <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church. From whence, and from many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which might be added, it is evident. 1. That the collective Sense of the word <hi>Angel,</hi> is Judged by them consonant to Scripture, and to the Scope of the Epistles. 2<hi>ly,</hi> That even supposing some speciality, in the Address to <hi>one person,</hi> this doth import a simple <hi>Presidency</hi> only (especially in the sense of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines) and that they do intirely join with us, in the Grounds, we have offered, against the Dr's supposition of an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical <hi>Bishop</hi>; and particularly from this, that the <hi>Angel,</hi> is sometimes addressed in the <hi>Plural.</hi> That Ground which the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers insist upon, taken from the Matter of the Epistles, is important; and that our Lord addresses to all the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Church, as concerning them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Write,</hi> saith he, <hi>to the Churches</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. And at the close of every Epistle — <hi>Hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches</hi>: And therefore, when it is said, <hi>I know</hi> thy <hi>Works,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>this</hi> thou <hi>hast,</hi> &amp;c. We must understand the whole Company of Ministers, and the whole Church; because the punishment or reward, is proposed to the whole: And the Dr. will not say, that for the sin of <hi>one Bishop,</hi> the Gospel is to be removed, when other Ministers, and the Church it self is free from his evils.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Dr. alledges, That the <hi>Angel</hi> is alwise addrest in the <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> number.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> And to that which is adduced to prove his being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest in the <hi>Plural</hi>; he Answers, That in these Passages, he writes, not only to the <hi>Bishops</hi> personally, but to the People, under their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58203:45"/>
Government and inspection; so he understands that of <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.10. — <hi>The Devil shall cast some of</hi> you <hi>into Prison,</hi> paralelling it, with <hi>v.</hi> 13. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipas <hi>slain among</hi> you, and <hi>v.</hi> 23.— <hi>And all the Churches shall know,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
But, first, (not to stand upon the Drs. begging the Question, in a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position cross to his scope) the paralells, are not every way alike. When the Lord says — <hi>all the Churches</hi> — and <hi>slain among</hi> you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Scope and Mould of these expressions, makes it evident, that both Ministers and People, are spoken of: But when immediatly after, addressing the <hi>Angel,</hi> in the <hi>Singular,</hi> he adds — <hi>the Devil shall cast some of</hi> you, <hi>into Prison,</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Singular Angel</hi> into <hi>a Plural,</hi> it appears, that the Ministers are more directly included, as the adduced paralel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. Discovers. But not to insist upon this.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the folly and inconsistency of his gloss and discourse, in this Answer, is several ways apparent: For <hi>First,</hi> He will have these Passages — <hi>I know</hi> thy <hi>works — I have some what against</hi> thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> addrest <hi>Singlely</hi> to the <hi>Angel</hi>; From the <hi>singularity</hi> of which <hi>Adress,</hi> he collects, the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s single and absolute Authority over these Churches. But I pray, what Sense will the Dr. make of this? Will he say, our Lord knew the Works only, of <hi>one</hi> single <hi>Bishop,</hi> of no Ministers else? That <hi>one Bishop</hi> Laboured at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> none else? That <hi>one Bishop</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> fell from his first Love, no Church Officers else? (A pityful imputation, the Dr. puts thus upon <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> the supposed <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in staging him, as the only Apostat of the Church) The same may be applyed to his other Instances. — <hi>I have a few things against</hi> thee, <hi>Viz, one Bishop, no</hi> Ministers else. — <hi>Remember, whence</hi> thou <hi>art fallen, viz.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> fallen only, <hi>none</hi> else. — <hi>Repent and do</hi> thy <hi>First Works</hi>; this only addrest to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> none else concerned in this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but his <hi>Lordship.</hi> If he say, that these things are spoken to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as chiefly concerned and interested; Then, besides his begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, he losses his Plea, and quite ruins all his Pleading from a supposed <hi>singularity of the Address,</hi> to conclud the <hi>singularity of the person Addressed</hi>: And thus including Ministers, as concerned and interested in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, in point of Government, he cuts the Wind-Pipe of his grand Topick and notion here.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> we see, when he is forc't to acknowledg from the <hi>Plural</hi> Mould of the <hi>Address,</hi> that more than the <hi>Bishop,</hi> are spoken to, he gives us a fair acknowledgment, in these terms,
<q>That the <hi>Bishops,</hi> are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written to, Personally, but also the People under their Government and inspection.</q>
But I pray, why not also Ministers and <hi>Pastors</hi> also bespoken, as well as the <hi>People</hi>? The Dr. asserting,
<q>That both <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> are under the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s inspection.</q>
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d it being supposible, that in these Churches, especially at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> there was at this time, a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58203:46"/>
Colledge of <hi>Pastors.</hi>
                  <q>How come the Dr. when he supposes the <hi>Address</hi> to overstretch the person of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and to includ more, to assert That it reaches the <hi>People only,</hi> and not to the <hi>Pastors</hi> also?</q>
This, I must confess, is odd Sense in Divinity; in these great <hi>Evangelistick</hi> Precepts and Reprensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Lord Addresses not solely the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but the <hi>People</hi> under him, yet not one word to <hi>Pastors.</hi> I had thought, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> being distinguished by the Dr. P. 421. and both the one and the other, in his Sense, under the <hi>Bishops</hi> Government and inspection, when he makes the <hi>Plural</hi> Address, to go beyond the <hi>Bishop,</hi> he would have cast an Eye, upon the <hi>under-Clergy,</hi> or Ministry, before the People, as concerned before them, in these important duties, or supposed Transgressions. But, we may easily discover the knack of the Dr's policy in this; For Pleading in his Second Argument,<note place="margin">P. 423.</note>
                  <q>That an Authority, in reference to Church Government, is clearly imported, in several of these directions or reprehensions, particularly, those addressed, to the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> in reference to Juridical Tryal, conviction and Censures:</q>
He was afraid, least by this means, he should have opened a door for Ministers claim, to the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s incommunicable prerogatives, had he extended the <hi>plural</hi> Address to <hi>them,</hi> as well as to the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Dr. having told us,
<q>That in such <hi>plural</hi> Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the people under the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Government,<note place="margin">P. 422.</note> are included, gives for instance, that Passage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Devil shall cast some of</hi> you <hi>into prison.</hi>
                  </q>
I should verrily think, he was here concerned to specifie the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> and include both: For, it seems in his Sense, all the <hi>Pastors</hi> were safe, from the Thunder-clap of this warning (I know not by what shield, except that of the Drs. fancy) and there were no prisons there for <hi>Pastors,</hi> this being only spoke to the <hi>People.</hi> This charge of gross folly, upon his Mould of Reasoning (and it is gross enough, at all will) is the more evident, in that Answer to the Objection, taken from that phrase, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.25. — <hi>unto</hi> you, <hi>and unto the</hi> rest <hi>in</hi> Thyatira; from which passage, we plead for a <hi>plural</hi> diversifying Ministers and people, under distinct <hi>Comma</hi>'s.
<q>The Dr. will admit it by no means, to to be meant of any,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> but the <hi>People,</hi> making the term, <hi>you</hi> and the <hi>rest</hi> in <hi>Thyatria,</hi> one and the same, as distinguishing only the sound from the unsound part. in that Church.</q>
So, that it is evident, the D,. appropriats the <hi>Plural</hi> Phrases to the <hi>People</hi> only, and consequently, is exposed to the forementioned absurdities, in his way and method of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That, that Passage <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.10. doth reach the <hi>Pastors,</hi> is upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral important grounds, made good by Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> upon the place, as 1. from the remarkable change of the <hi>singular</hi> number, to the <hi>Plural.</hi> 2<hi>ly.</hi> That his was a searching tryal to the Church, whereof, it was her concern
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58203:46"/>
to be warned. 3<hi>ly.</hi> That the preservation of Some, was as signal a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation in such a Tryal, as <hi>Isai.</hi> 30.20.21. See others cited by <hi>Pool Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</hi> upon the place.</p>
               <p>The Dr. enquires,
<q>If <hi>Angels</hi> had not been <hi>single Persons,</hi> why are they not mentioned <hi>Plurally,</hi> as well as the <hi>People</hi>?</q>
This Querie, confirms what is now imputed to him: That they are mentioned <hi>Plurally,</hi> we have already made good, in the premised Instances.
<q>Yea the Dr. himself, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers himself, acknowledging that there is a <hi>Plurality,</hi> bespoken, in the Person of the <hi>Angels,</hi> so, that he is not, only Personally Addressed.</q>
But the Dr's strange Fetch, is, that he will allow a <hi>Plurality</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> to be Addrest and spoken to, in <hi>one</hi> singular <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> but none of the <hi>Pastors</hi> at all: For which Notion (I had almost said Non-sense) no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ground can be given, but the Dr's good Will to his Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> whom he would fain shape out of this Scripture, which we see, so rejects and baffles his Endeavours, that instead of any evident ground of Answer from the Text, he must needs embrace an Airy Notion of his own Brain.</p>
               <p>Thus to that pregnant Passage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.24. which we adduce to prove the <hi>Angel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> to be Addrest <hi>Plurally,</hi> viz. <hi>To</hi> you, <hi>I say, and unto</hi> the rest <hi>in Thyatira</hi>: Where there is a clear Distinction made betwixt the <hi>Plural</hi> you, viz. the <hi>Pastors, and</hi> the rest <hi>in Thyatira,</hi> viz. the <hi>People.</hi> The Dr. has no other Shift, but that pitiful one, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Greek</hi> Manuscripts, leave out the Conjunction <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and Read it, <hi>To you the rest in</hi> Thyatira, distinguishing the Seduced, from the not Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; And therefore, cannot be meant of the <hi>Angel,</hi> who is always Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest in the <hi>Singular</hi> Number.</q>
But, 1. This Shift baffles most of all the old <hi>Greek</hi> Copies; the Reading he embraces, being supposed <hi>Mantytecla's</hi> Manuscript, baffles all the <hi>Episcopal English</hi> Clergy, concerned in our last Translation, who, notwithstanding all their Zeal for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as appears in their various and unsound Translation of the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet durst not make this Adventure with the Dr, but with the Current of Ancient Copies, Read the Text, with the Conjunction: Notwithstanding, that in their Preface to the Reader, they assert their Diligence, in Searching the <hi>Original</hi> Text. I need not stand here to recount, the large Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Cloud of Witnesses, the Body of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, Translators and Interpreters, all concurring in this our Sense and Reading, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Dr's Conceit and Exception. See <hi>Paraeus, Arethas, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> who expresly taketh the <hi>you,</hi> to import the <hi>Pastors; Beza,</hi> &amp;c. But, 2<hi>ly,</hi> This Conjecture and Answer, is clearly Cross to the Text: For, (1.) The Adversative, <hi>but,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>v.</hi> 24. clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limits the <hi>you</hi> here, and distinguishes it from the <hi>you,</hi> meant of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58203:47"/>
in the close of <hi>v.</hi> 23. (2.) The Conclusion of this <hi>verse,</hi> clears this to Conviction — <hi>I will put upon</hi> you, <hi>none other burden</hi> — <hi>hold fast</hi> — Pray, by what Logick, will the Dr. exclud <hi>Ministers,</hi> and includ the <hi>People</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this <hi>Plural</hi> Phrase? Were no <hi>Ministers</hi> kept unpolluted? Or, were there some other <hi>burdens,</hi> to be put upon them, than what they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? And are they excluded from <hi>holding fast</hi>' till Christ come, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, and only the <hi>People</hi> concerned herein, as contradistinct from the <hi>Bishop</hi>? Sure I am, such absurd Consequeuces, might cover with Blushes, the Asserters of this Opinion. I might add, that even granting the Dr, the Advantage of this Gloss, and leaving out the Conjunction, and admitting with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that thus the Sound are distinguished from the Unsound in this Church, the Dr. would be pitifully puzzl'd to prove, that none of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as he calls them, is in both these Classes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that the <hi>Plural</hi> Phrase, doth not stand for us, even in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating Sense: But this, we insist not upon.</p>
               <p>To proceed to the Dr's second Proof, (p. 423.) of <hi>our Lords Allowance and Approbation of</hi> Episcopal <hi>Government in these Epistles,</hi> viz.
<q>That they were <hi>Persons of great Authority</hi>: This he proves from the Title of <hi>Angel,</hi> shewing them to be Persons of Office and Eminency; Christ also, Directing to them the Epistles, to be communicat to their Churches.</q>
To which, he adds another Proof, taken from the Authority, which is supposed to be exercised by some of these <hi>Angels,</hi> and competent to others;
<q>He gives In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> trying the false Apostles, which imports a Juridical Tryal; the Blame laid upon the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them that held the Doctrin of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> which shews his Power to have cast him out; upon the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> for suffering <hi>Iezabel</hi> to Teach, which shews, that it was in his Power, and that he had Authority to eject her and her Followers.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Dr's Proofs of Authority in these <hi>Angels</hi> and Churches, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Government, are good and sound, and accorded to by all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. But he has left behind him two Points of his Proof, in reference to his Scope, which are (to use our <hi>Scottish</hi> Proverb) the <hi>Tongue of the Trump,</hi> and without which, all his Discourse, is but like Sand without Lime. 1. He says, "They were <hi>single Persons</hi> of great Authority: But he has not yet made good, that they were <hi>single Persons,</hi> nor offered to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the pregnant Grounds pleaded by our Divines, to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that the Collective Sense of the Term <hi>Angel,</hi> is most suteable to the Scripture, and the Tenor and Scope of these Epistles. 2<hi>ly,</hi> Supposing them <hi>single Persons,</hi> he has not proved, either from the Title of <hi>Angel,</hi> or their Authority imported in these Epistles, that it reached any further, than that of <hi>Presidents</hi>; or that the Authority here Instanced, was Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58203:47"/>
and so inhanced in them, as to exclud intirely, all the <hi>Pastors</hi> therefrom. The contrary whereof (besides the Proofs we offered in the beginning) we heard the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines make out, and give Instance, particularly, with reference to <hi>Ephesus</hi>; to the Elders or Ministers of which Church, <hi>Paul</hi> committed the whole Government, as the propper Governours and <hi>Bishops</hi> thereof, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And therefore, even suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Angel,</hi> a <hi>single Person,</hi> he cannot be supposed, in Contradiction to that Scripture, to have had such Authority and Power, as did Inhance, or Exclud that of the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> so clearly therein as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted and held out.
<q>The Dr. acknowledges, That what our Lord writes, is not to this <hi>Angel</hi> personally, but also to the <hi>People,</hi> P. 422.</q>
But I pray, how will the Dr. set up his March-stone, and shew us the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of these Instructions, in Point of Government, distinguishing the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> from the <hi>Pastors,</hi> since, neither the Supposition, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> is a <hi>single Person,</hi> will prove this, nor the Honourable Title of <hi>Angel,</hi> (as the Dr. calls it) a Title suteable to all <hi>Pastors,</hi> who are <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> and Messengers of the Lord of Hosts, by their Office; Nor, can the Dr. flee to the Refuge of the Authority supposed in these Prescriptions, without a palpable begging of the Question. And as for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of the Epistles to the Churches, as Directed to them; This is so suteable to the <hi>Angelus Praeses,</hi> or to any <hi>President,</hi> or Mouth of a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it hath no imaginable Strength, to bear the Weight of the Dr's Conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Dr's. <hi>Third</hi> and last proof, of <hi>our Lords approbation of</hi> Episcopal <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in these Epistles,</hi> and that the <hi>Angels,</hi> were <hi>Bishops</hi> of these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and <hi>Presidents</hi> thereof, is drawn from the Testimony of <hi>most Primitive Antiquity</hi> (as he calls it) for which he Cites the anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tract of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Martyrdom mentioned,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 424.</note> 
                     <hi>Bibleotheca pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum, N.</hi> 244. Shewing that <hi>Iohn,</hi> Two or Three years after his return from <hi>Patmos,</hi> assisted with the seven <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Province, he assumed to himself; the Government of it; which Seven, were the <hi>Angels</hi> here here Addrest; these Churches lying within the <hi>Lydian</hi> or Proconsular <hi>Asia,</hi> of which <hi>Ephesus</hi> was Metropolis: And therefore, these Seven <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> by whom he Governed the Province of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> are the Seven <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> all within that Province. He adds; That <hi>Austin</hi> call the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, praepositos Ecclesiae, Epist.</hi> 162. and the Seven <hi>Angels, praepositi Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiarum,</hi> Comment. in <hi>Rev.</hi> That <hi>Ambrose</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. referring to these <hi>Angels,</hi> tells us, that by <hi>Angels,</hi> are meant the <hi>Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Since the Dr. calls these <hi>Angels, Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presidents</hi> over these Churches, in propounding this Proof, if he intend only <hi>Presidents,</hi> he will fall utterly short of his design and scope of evincing that <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power, which he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58203:48"/>
to them; a <hi>President,</hi> and <hi>one, who has all Authority, Monopolized in him,</hi> being quite distinct things: If he intend by <hi>Presidents</hi> of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, such as are set over it in a general Sense; Are not all <hi>Pastors</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, called such, as are set over God's People, and have the Tittles of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> If the Dr. will have them such <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> over the Churches, as had monopolised and enhanced in their persons, all Authority of Government, a <hi>President</hi> being of far larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and surely with a relation to a Church, it is not all one, to say, such a person is <hi>President</hi> of a Church, and <hi>a Sole President</hi>: As it it is not all one to say, such a man, is <hi>Minister</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Sole Minister.</hi> For, all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Scripture Sense, are <hi>Presidents</hi> over the Churches. But 2<hi>ly.</hi> since the Dr. draws his supposed demonstrative evidence of the power and Authority of these Seven <hi>Angels,</hi> addrest by our Lord, in these Epistles, and of the nature and extent of that Office, which is indigitat by the term <hi>Angel,</hi> and consequently the meaning of the prescriptions, given to them, from <hi>Primitive Antiquity</hi> (as he calls it) I would know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether the Dr. will own this Principle, that <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or even that which he calls <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> (or the First human Testimony, secluding the Scriptures, or of the First Ages, after the Canon of the Scriptures) <hi>is the infallible Rule and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, for understanding the Nature and Office of Church Officers, mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> If the Dr. will not own this Principle, his evidence by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; is no evidence; For, an evidence, which will fail and not reach the conclusion, is no evidence at all; and in the best construction, no proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence without restriction,s and limitations added. If the Dr. hold the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative,</hi> then I would urge him thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> If Mens Testimony, or the Churches <hi>Primitive</hi> practice, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so early, must be the Key and <hi>Comment</hi> in this Case, of the Scripture Sense, of the Character and description of <hi>Church Officers,</hi> and able solely to found our Faith and persuasion hereanent, why may not also, human practice and profession of the Church, simply considered, determin our Faith and prectice, as to every Scripture Truth, and duty therein held out? For, the Dr. can assign no difference, nor upon admitting the antecedent, shew the least shaddow of a ground, which will limit and enervat the consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this be admitted, I would know, whether he will not thus set up an higher tribunal, than the Scriptures, as to the ground and Rule of our Faith and practice, and in opposition to the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. make our Faith stand in mans Wisdom, not in the Wisdom of God and his Power; and in contradiction to the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.20.21. make the Scriptures of a privat Interpretation, as if the Prophesie had come by the will of Man: For, if I must believe no otherwise, anent the Office of these
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58203:48"/>
                  <hi>Angels,</hi> and the Scriptures pointing out the same, than according to the <hi>human</hi> Testimony of after-Writers, or the Testimony and Practice of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Bishops,</hi> their pretended Successors; then the <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Men, becomes the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>ratio,</hi> and demonstration, <hi>a priori,</hi> the great and chief ground, why I believe Scriptures, to have such a Sense, and no other. And thus we will give Men, a Dominion over our Faith, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves ultimatly into an <hi>human practice</hi> and Testimony of fallible Men: A Principle, which no sound <hi>Protestant</hi> will own. Besides, that the proof of the <hi>Assumption</hi> of the Argument, and to instruct this Matter of Fact, and that all <hi>Primitive Antiquity,</hi> (as he calls it) doth testify for the <hi>Bishop,</hi> which he has shapen out, would inextricably baffle his indeavours, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cleared: It being evident, that as, the Writings of many of the First Writers, are lost, and not a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w corrupted; So, many, Eminent for Piety and Learning, have written nothing in the First Ages, which are therefore generally acknowledged, to be very dark, in the Matter of Fact. The <hi>Affirmative</hi> proof, lying upon the Dr. he is obliged to make it appear, that neither the one, nor the other, has contradicted his supposed Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, else he but beats the Air, and has said nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scripture (as hath been proved) ascribing to <hi>Pastors,</hi> the Power of Order and Jurisdiction, and even to the <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> (the <hi>Angel</hi> whereof, is First here addrest,) <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. Compared with 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.5. When this Scripture account of the Office and Authority of <hi>Pastors</hi> (which, surely is <hi>Antiquity,</hi> prior to the Dr's <hi>most Primitive Antiquity,</hi> and of far greater veneration) stands cross to his pretended Primitive Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Bishops</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Power, and both are laid in even Ballances together, which of the two, will preponderat? The Dr. for shame, will not say the Second; Hence I inferr, that he must either accord his <hi>Human</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with Scripture, or quite this Plea. And next, he must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that he stands obliged to Answer the premised Scripture accounts of the <hi>Pastors</hi> Office, and our Arguments drawn therefrom, before his <hi>Human</hi> Testimonies deserve the least value or notice.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may here ply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Dr, with a Notion and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Mould,
<q>The Dr. thinks it strange, how we can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Church, to have so suddenly altered the Government, from <hi>Presbytrie</hi> to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> if <hi>Presbytrie</hi> was her first Government.</q>
But I would ask the Dr, since its evident in Scripture, that <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> have both the Name and Thing of the Scripture <hi>Bishop,</hi> and consequently <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority ascribed to them, yea, and in the premised Scriptures, several such paralells, its actual Exercise supposed to be inherent in, and competent to them: And in special, since the Elders and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58203:49"/>
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> are enjoyned by <hi>Paul,</hi> in his last Farewel, to exercise <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority joyntly over that Church, without the least Hint of any <hi>Episcopal President</hi> over them, and this after all his Prescriptions to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and the Exercise of his Evangelistick Office there; whence came all this sudden Universal Change in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, that all this <hi>Episcopal</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, competent before, to <hi>Pastors</hi> of Churches, and particularly of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> is Monopolized in the Person of one <hi>Bishop</hi>? How came all the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> to be so suddenly cast in this Mould? And to press the Querie a little further, if there was such an Universal Authority of <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, and thus acknowledged and attested by all the Primitive <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as the Dr. pretends, yea and acknowledged by <hi>Ierom</hi> himself, as well as by <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> how comes <hi>Ierom</hi> to say, that even in his time, the <hi>Elders</hi> were subject to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> by <hi>Custom,</hi> not <hi>Divine Dispensation</hi> (Comment on <hi>Tit.</hi>) and on <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. that they had in his time <hi>[Caetus Presbyterorum) a Meeting</hi> or <hi>Court of Presbyters,</hi> which he calls an <hi>Apostolick Senat?</hi> How comes a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> to be mentioned in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> Canon 18? How comes <hi>Ambrose</hi> (or, a Father, Coetaneous to him) upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. to assert, that after the Church was enlarged <hi>[caepit alio modo gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernari] it began to be Governed after another manner; than at first</hi>; and — that [<hi>non per omnia conveniunt, &amp;c.</hi>] the Government of the Church, in his time, was not every way suteable and square, to the Apostolick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment? How comes <hi>Augustin</hi> (<hi>Epist.</hi> 10.) to assert with <hi>Ierom,</hi> that by <hi>Custom</hi> of the Church, <hi>Episcopatus</hi> was <hi>major Presbyterio</hi>? How comes <hi>Firmili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nus</hi> (<hi>apud Cyprian. Epist.</hi> 78.) to assert, that the <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters [possident ordinandi potestatem) possesses the Power of Ordination</hi>; And these <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> he calls [<hi>Praepositi</hi>] Presidents or Rulers, using that very Term, from which the Dr. draws the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority of these <hi>Angels</hi>? Yea <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> asserts, that <hi>[inter Presbyterum &amp; Episcopum inter est ferme nihil] there is almost no difference betwixt the Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi>; and that which is spoken by <hi>Paul</hi> to the one, agrees also to the other. Now, if there be such Harmony in the Testimony of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> in point of the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power, as the Dr. pretends, I would fain know, what means this immusical Jarring, and palpable Contradiction to his Assertion, and even by these very <hi>Fathers,</hi> whom he brings for his Vouchers?</p>
               <p>Hence, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it appears that the Dr's Proofs from these Testimonies, and his pretended Argument, from all Primitive <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is pitifully Lame, and short of his Design, upon two important Grounds. 1. That his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, are not Harmonious, several of them, giving a palpably Cross Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to him. 2. In that they do not assert that sole Authority of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and that absolute Inhanced Power, which he alledges: For, no Man of Sense, can draw this Consequence, from the general Name of <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:58203:49"/>
used by him, or from a simple calling of them <hi>Presidents,</hi> will conclud them to be such, as he pretends, yea, and not such <hi>de Facto,</hi> far less <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> since in other places, they are found clear and positive in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Assertion: And therefore, unless the Dr. will Stage these <hi>Fathers,</hi> whom he mentions, as the most Arrant, Self-contradicting, Non-sensical Fools, that ever Spoke or Wrote, he must needs acknowledg, with us, that they use the Term <hi>Bishop,</hi> in a <hi>general Sense,</hi> and as common both to such <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Presidents,</hi> as had then obtained, and to other <hi>Pastors.</hi> So that in such Characters, appropriat to such Persons, they could neither understand, an Episcopal <hi>Presidency,</hi> founded upon a Divine Right, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Institution, as the Dr. pretends, nor such an absolute Power, as swallows up and Inhances all Authority of <hi>Pastors</hi> in Government, which he also asserts.</p>
               <p>This considered, with what is above offered, doth so fully cut off the Dr's third Argument, which he prosecutes, <hi>P.</hi> 424, 425, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing needs be further added, as there might be with Advantage, if a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Examen,</hi> were made of his Citations. The Folly of his first Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Testimony appears, in that it makes the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> to assume a new <hi>Archiepiscopal</hi> Chair, or Primacy over the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches; The Sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which Conceit, and the Contrariety thereof to the Scripture Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Apostolick Office, is evident to any of common Sense, since the Apostles, by vertue of their Office, which extended to all Churches, planted and to be planted, were Ministers thereof, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> and yet this Apostle must be assisted with seven <hi>Bishops,</hi> forsooth, to support his new <hi>Archiepiscopal</hi> Chair over that Province. The Citation speaks of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in general, which the Dr. will needs have, to be that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the seven <hi>Angels,</hi> must be these seven <hi>Bishops,</hi> by whom he governed that Province. Again, the <hi>Angel</hi> is called by <hi>Augustin,</hi> the <hi>Praepositus</hi> or <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>; therefore, he was an Hierarchical <hi>President,</hi> as the Dr. has shapen out: What Consequence is this? As to what He adds out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in reference to <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s Episcopacy over <hi>Smyrna,</hi> from <hi>Eusebius</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.) and <hi>Polycrates</hi>'s Episcopacy over <hi>Ephesus</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 24.) we have spoken to it already, and to the Credit to be given to these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Epistles, as likeways to <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s History. Besides, that in <hi>Eusebius</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23.) <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls <hi>Anycetus, Pius, Heginus, Telesphorus, Xistus, Presbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome [Presbyteri illi qui te praecesserunt]</hi> We also, did shew, that he thus expresses himself further [<hi>Nec</hi> Polycarpus, Anyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>suasit, ut servaret qui sibi Presbyterorum quibus successerat, consuetudinem servan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam esse diceret</hi>]
<q>We have also already made appear, that <hi>Polycarp</hi> his supposed <hi>Bishop,</hi> disownes the Office and Doctrin imputed to him by the Dr, since, Writing to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he ownes only <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58203:50"/>
two Orders of Ministry, and perswades the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be subject to their <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as to God and Christ.</q>
To which we may add, that <hi>Bishop Bilson</hi> himself, acknowledges (<hi>Perpet. Gov. P.</hi> 158, 159.) that <hi>Elders</hi> at first did govern by <hi>common Counsel.</hi> For what he adds of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>'s Testimonies, anent the existent <hi>Bishops</hi> in several of these Churches, when <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote to them, it is abundantly removed by what is said above, in reference to the Sense and Acceptation of the Term <hi>Bishop,</hi> by Ancient Writers, as likewise by that which we have often observed of <hi>Eusebius</hi> himself.
<q>The Dr. adds a Passage of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> which we shall take notice of, he tells us, that <hi>Paraeus</hi> proves out of <hi>Aretas Caesariensis,</hi> that <hi>Antipas</hi> the Faithful Martyr, mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Patmos,</hi> immediatly before the <hi>Angel</hi> of that Church,<note place="margin">P. 426.</note> to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, and that that <hi>Angel,</hi> was one <hi>Gaius</hi> who (as he proves out of <hi>Clement</hi>) succeeded to <hi>Antipas,</hi> in the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Chair.</q>
                  <hi>Paraeus,</hi> says indeed, that these of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> had cruelly slain <hi>Antipas,</hi> but adds [<hi>quis fuerat, ex Historia parum constat</hi>] that there is no Light from History, who he was. He adds [Aretas <hi>Pastorem ejus Ecclesiae fuisse sensit sub</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiano <hi>fortem fidei assertorem, &amp;c.</hi>] that <hi>Aretas</hi> thinks he was <hi>Pastor</hi> of that Church, and under <hi>Domitian,</hi> a Strenuous Asserter of the Faith, and Burnt in a Brazen Bull.
<q>He adds, that he to whom our Lord wrote, might be tempted to lay aside his Office, for fear of the like Punishment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
But what the Dr. adds of an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Chair, and of his Name, <hi>Paraeus</hi> says nothing, neither doth he ascribe to <hi>Antipas</hi> any other <hi>Office,</hi> than that of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> seeming to take these Churches for Congregational. And if the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to which the <hi>Angel</hi> succeeded, was that of a <hi>Pastor</hi> only, where is our Dr's <hi>Episcopal</hi> Chair, which he here assigns him? Besides, <hi>Paraeus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the History to give no certain sound, touching the Office and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Antipas</hi>: Neither doth he mention any thing of <hi>Clement.</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the second part of <hi>Annot.</hi> under the Name of <hi>Pool,</hi> do affirm,
<q>That no Ecclesiastick History, makes mention of <hi>Antipas,</hi> and that he seems to have been a Person of obscure Note; And that no History giving Account of him, has inclined some to think this Epistle, is wholly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, and that <hi>Antipas</hi> signifies all such, as oppose the <hi>Pope,</hi> as if it were the same with, <hi>Antipapa.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr's <hi>Conclusion</hi> upon the whole of this his discourse and Argument from the Seven <hi>Asian Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 426.</note> is,
<q>That it being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that there were <hi>Bishops,</hi> presiding in each of these Churches, when <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, consequently they had the Government of these Churches committed to them, since he Writes to them as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Overseers of these Respective Churches; So, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bishops,</hi> our Saviour, in these Epithets, allows and approves of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58203:50"/>
                     <hi>Episcopal</hi> Order.</q>
But, by what is above replyed, it is evident, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the Dr. has adduced, amounts to prove the existence of any such <hi>Bishops,</hi> as he has shapen out, in one, or all of these Churches: And therefore, our Lords writing to these <hi>Angels,</hi> gives not the least shaddow of <hi>allowance</hi> or <hi>approbation</hi> of that <hi>Episcopal</hi> order, which he asserts. And so,<note place="margin">P. 427.</note> to the Dr's <hi>Summ of all</hi> (as he expresses it) <hi>viz:</hi>
                  <q>That the <hi>Episcopal</hi> form, is of <hi>Divine</hi> Right; upon Ground of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>Institution,</hi> Seconded by the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Apostles, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> of the Primitive Churches; and our Lords express <hi>approbation</hi> We may confidently repone, from what is above replyed, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that the high-flown <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> he pleads for, has no Foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either in our Lords <hi>Institution,</hi> or the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Apostles, is noways Authorised by the <hi>Conformity</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, or our Saviours <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> in his Epistles to the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, but as opposit to all these, is by the Churches of Christ, to be rejected and disowned.</q>

                  <q>THE <hi>First</hi> Prerogative of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as contradistinct from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 433.</note> is (with the Dr.) to make Laws and Canons, which is the Essence of Government, and supposes a Legislative Power, else, faith he, Christs Wisdom is impeached, if he left a Governed Society, without a Legislative Power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I need not stand to tell the Dr, That by consent of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, the Churches <hi>Power,</hi> is not properly, <hi>Nomothetick, Architectonick, Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but <hi>Ministerial, and declarative of Christs Institution, in reference to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the Doctrin, Worship, Disciplin and Government of his House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. proves this Authority (P. 433.434.) from the Apostles Power, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. Determining the Controversie anent Circumcision — And says,
<q>That in their Decree, they exercise a <hi>Legislative</hi> Power, laying upon the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to abstain from what was not prohibited by any standing Law of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58203:51"/>
Christianity: That, as the Apostles and Primitive <hi>Bishops,</hi> made Laws by common consent, for the good of the Church in general, so, by their own Authority, for particular Churches, to which they were more particularly related.</q>
Here is, I must say, odd and confused stuff. <hi>First,</hi> The Dr. supposes, that the Decree, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>had no previous Scripture Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> contrar to the express tenor and scope of the place, where it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident 1. That in this Disquisition, there are Grounds of the Sentence laid down, yea and Scripture Grounds. 2<hi>ly.</hi> The Sentence runs in these terms, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> speaking in the Scripture) <hi>and to us.</hi> 3<hi>ly.</hi> Upon these previous Scripture Grounds of Charity and Union-and the esehewing the Offence of the weak <hi>Iews</hi> (apparent in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and disquisition) the things enjoined; are termed, <hi>necessary things,</hi> and thus supposed materially such, antecedaneously to the Decree. Hence 4<hi>ly.</hi> The Dr. in saying,
<q>That this Abstinence (he must understand it in the present Case and circumstances of time, place and persons) was never prohibited by any standing Law of Christianity;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugns from being Laws of Christianity, all our Lords Precepts, in point of Love and Unity, and the eschewing the Offence of the little Ones:</q>
For, these Rules did clearly found this Abstinence, and ground the necessity thereof, in the present Case and exigence.</p>
               <p>Again, in the nexplace, The great point, the Dr. has to prove, is
<q>That this supposed Legislative power is the <hi>Bishops</hi> sole prerogative, secluding <hi>Pastors</hi>:</q>
This he proves by the Apostles, together with the Elders and Brethren, their comming together, and determining this matter. One would think, this makes fair to prove the contrary. The Apostles here, meeting with, and taking into the disquisition and Decree, and into every step of the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the ordinary Ministers, and Elders, as persons interested and concerned, and who are found to concur with them in enacting and enjoining the thing Decreed, in order to the Churches Obedience. Ay, but the Dr. tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>That by consent of all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> by these <hi>Elders,</hi> we are to understand the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Iudea</hi>; for which he Cites Dr <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 11. A Dr. no doubt, of a like soundness with himself.</q>
But 1. If the Dr. adhere to Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> notion of <hi>Elders,</hi> he must E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem them <hi>Bishops,</hi> where ever mentioned, and deny the existence of any <hi>Pastors</hi> (the true Scripture <hi>Bishops</hi>) at this time; wherein our Dr. will, and must needs justle and deal stroaks with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>: For (to omit other instances) he holds the <hi>Elders</hi> present with <hi>Iames,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> went into him, to be <hi>Pastors,</hi> over which, <hi>Iames,</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> did preside. 2<hi>ly,</hi> None can imagin these <hi>Elders</hi> to be <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the most ridiculous Forgery imaginable: For, in the context, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that at this time, the Apostles were but founding and gathering
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58203:51"/>
Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> settling Churches therein, and taking inspection of them, by their Apostolick Authority; And therefore, it is a strange phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick conceit to imagine Churches by this time grown up to a <hi>Diocess</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and of such a bulk and number, as to have <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> set over them, yea and <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> of so considerable a Number, as the <hi>Elders</hi> may be rationally supposed to be at this time, and in this meeting; yea, and these, besides the far greater Number of Ordinary Teachers and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> which this Man will not deny, the Apostles, to have ordained, where Churches were planted. Again, why, I pray, the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> only gathered here, in order to this general Decree for all the Churches, and no <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, which, he will say, were by this time set up? Besides, that looking to the occasion of this debate, anent the Circumcision, which had its rise from some of them that went from <hi>Judea,</hi> as from the Apostles, and thus troubled the Churches, the design of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> appears evidently to be, to send <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Apostles and <hi>Elders,</hi> residing at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> without the least hint, of any more enlarged Advertisement of others, than such, as were there, at that time. Again, the Dr. says,
<q>That <hi>Apostles</hi> and Primitive <hi>Bishops,</hi> made general Laws, for the whole Church, and <hi>Bishops,</hi> particular Laws, for their particular Churches:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> Thus (saith he) <hi>Paul</hi> gave Rules to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for more decent communication of the Lords Supper.</q>
Strong reasoning indeed, and hanging well together! First, he supposes the Apostles made by their Apostolical Authority, the general Rules for the whole Church, as proper to them, with concurrence of ordinary Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; the ordering of particular Churches, being peculiar to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or Primitive <hi>Bishops</hi>: And presently, to prove this, he puts the great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> into the class of <hi>Ordinary Bishops,</hi> in giving Rules to this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and wisely supposes, that <hi>Pauls</hi> Apostolick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions about Right and decent Communicating, concerned only this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and were Authorized and enacted by no Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Authority, nor by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as in that capacity. To this scope, the Dr. with as much Sense and soundness, instances <hi>Paul</hi>'s giving Laws and Canons, to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> contradicting therein, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of these Canons, to particular Churches, since they did respect both the Churches of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Galatia.</hi> Of the same nature. is that which he here mentions of <hi>Pauls</hi> Charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.) touching the redressing disorders, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying defects in these Churches. For, besides, that <hi>Paul</hi> exerced an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Authority in these Directions to the Evangelists (extraordinary Officers, as <hi>Paul</hi> himself) which clearly excludes, Director, and Directed, from the compass of the Dr's Argument he will not deny, several of these
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58203:52"/>
directions, at least, to have been of universal concern and necessity, and in this respect also, as remote from his Design.
<q>The Dr. adds, That what the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Primitive <hi>Bishops</hi> did, to be sure, they had Authority to do,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 435.</note> and whatsoever, Authority they had, they derived it down to their Successors.</q>
That <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,</hi> exercised a Lawful Authority, is indeed very sure, and no less sure, than the Dr's Argument here, is loose and unsure, from Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal directions to Evangelists, to conclud the Nature and Mould of the supposed <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority of <hi>Prelats,</hi> in reference to making Laws (as is above evinced) since the Dr. cannot shape out, nor by any twist of reason and sound consequence, inferr his supposed Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> with sole Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, from the Office of either Apostles or Evangelists.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Dr will not have any <hi>Officer</hi> beneath a <hi>Bishop,</hi> to have been allowed <hi>suffrage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 435.436.</note> in any of the First <hi>Four General Councils</hi>; yet immediatly after (some way retracting and correcting himself) he allows them a place in <hi>General Councils,</hi> but tell us, it was only for debate, and preparing the Matter of Laws; but the form of Laws, he says, proceeded from the <hi>Bishops</hi> suffrage.</q>
This is pretty. First, The Dr. will never prove, that in the First <hi>Councils,</hi> there were <hi>Prelats</hi> of his stamp and Mould. Next, its strange, that in <hi>Councils, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> were sitting for Conference, and as no members. I would fain know, if the Dr. will say, that these <hi>Elders</hi> meeting with the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. (which he will, no doubt, acknowledg, was one of the best Moulded <hi>Councils,</hi> yea, and a Standart for after-Councils) were no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but called and meeting for conference only, since in the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and three fold Partition of those that mett, <hi>Viz: Apostles, Elders Brethren,</hi> there is an intire joint concurrence, with the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, <hi>viz</hi>: both in the Disquisition, the Sentence, the decretal Epistle and Appointment, in reference to the Churches obedience. It does also sute the Dr's consideration, to shew, how it can consist with reason, and the Nature of a Church Judicatory, that such persons, as are no Members, nor fit to be Members, are, <hi>in tuto,</hi> to prepare Matter for Laws, and take share in debates. But the Dr's Forgery here is evident. For 1. If <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> concurrence in <hi>Ordination,</hi> was Authoritative, not by consent only, and they imposed hands as proper Ordainers, even when <hi>Bishops</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Power in Judicatories, by confession of <hi>Episcopalians</hi> themselves (see Dr. <hi>Forbes Iraen. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.) I would fain know, why such Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks or Church <hi>Officers,</hi> as had Authority, to Ordain, which is one of the greatest Acts of Ministerial Authority, had <hi>no Authority</hi> in <hi>enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws in Councils,</hi> but sat as Cyphers. 2<hi>ly.</hi> The Dr. will find <hi>Antiquity</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:58203:52"/>
against this deputed kind of conferring or consulting Power, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to <hi>Presbyters</hi> in <hi>Councils,</hi> without Authority, in enacting Laws. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom (hom.</hi> 17. on <hi>Matth.</hi>) calls <hi>Presbyters</hi> expresly [<hi>Christi vicarios</hi>] Christs Vicars or Deputes: And its strange, that such to whom Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted this Vicarious Power, had no interest and Authority in enacting Laws in his Church, and in the Government thereof. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 8.) shews, that [<hi>Dominus Sacerdotes in Ecclesia,</hi> &amp;c,] the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to elect to himself, Priests or Ministers in the Church (the Dr. will not say, that he put this designation only upon <hi>Prelats.</hi>) And did he elect and constitute them for no interest in the Government thereof? Nay, on the contrary, the Judgment of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> is clear in this, that the Power of external Jurisdiction, and consequently, the Authority of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Laws or Canons, was common to <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters. Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> called the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> [<hi>Senatum Dei</hi>] Gods Court or Senat [<hi>&amp; non consiliarios solum</hi>] (as our Dr. makes them) [<hi>sed &amp; assessores Episcopi</hi>] not his Advisers only, but his Authoritative fellow-Counsellors; And I hope, such (he will grant) as are in this Character, have interest, not only, in preparing matter for Laws, but an essential Official Right, in the Authoritative enacting of them. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 44.) calls them [<hi>Principes</hi>] Princes or Chief: And if such, in his Judgment, the forementioned Authority is clearly by him, attributed to them. <hi>Augustin</hi> (<hi>Serm.</hi> 6.) calls the Brethren in <hi>Eremo</hi> [<hi>Patronos, Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Terrae</hi>] And what pitiful Patrons or Rectors are they, who have no Authority in enacting Laws? <hi>Chrysostom</hi> asserts expresly (on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>hom.</hi> 11)
<q>That they presided over the Churches, as <hi>Bishops,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived together with them, the Office of Teaching and Governing the Church.</q>
And if this, with the preceeding Testimonies, give not the Lie to the Dr's forementioned distinction, anent <hi>Presbyters</hi> sole consulting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in <hi>Councils,</hi> and upon the <hi>Bishops</hi> Call allennarly, without any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in enacting Laws, let any Judg. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> moreover, in the beginning of that <hi>Homily,</hi> stating the Question, wherefore the Apostle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had spoken to the Office and Duty of <hi>Bishops,</hi> passes over to <hi>Deacons,</hi> omitting the order of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> returns this Answer and Reason,
<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, betwixt the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> there is almost no difference, and because, that unto <hi>Presbyters</hi> also, the care of the Church is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And what he said concerning <hi>Bishops,</hi> the same things also do agree to <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  </q>
And if, with the Dr's good leave, I might draw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s assertion, I would thus subsume; But so it is, that the Authority of Government, and the enacting of Laws in Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, is by the Apostle ascribed to the Scripture-<hi>Bishop,</hi> whom he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the same Authority and Power is by the Apostle, ascibed to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58203:53"/>
                  <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Sense. <hi>Gratian (in Decret. Caus.</hi> 16. <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.)</hi> shews, that [<hi>Ecclesia habet senatum Presbyterorum</hi>] A Senat of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> without whose Counsel, the <hi>Bishop</hi> can do nothing. They were not then called at the <hi>Bishops</hi> pleasure for debate only, and preparing matters (as the Dr. pretends) but were the [<hi>sine quibus non</hi>] in the enacting of the Laws themselves. The Dr. makes <hi>Prelats</hi> to enhance all decisive suffrage, in Judicatories, yet <hi>Cyprian</hi> (<hi>Ep.</hi> 6. and 28.) professes,
<q>He neither could nor would do any thing without the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
                  </q>
And the Fourth <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> condemns the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Decision, unless Fortified by their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. So far was it, that the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s sole Suffrage, gave the Strength and Formality to Laws, that they were null, without <hi>Presbyters</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Concurrence. This is clear, by so full a consent of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that we will find; That neither in Censuring of <hi>Presbyters</hi>: Nor 2<hi>ly,</hi> In Judging the conversation, or Crimes of Church Members: Nor 3<hi>ly,</hi> In Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating or Receiving of Penitents, <hi>Bishops</hi> could do any thing without <hi>Presbyters. Tertulian (Apolog. Advers. Gentes)</hi> shews vs,
<q>That the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Exhortations, Castigations, and Divine Censures, were put forth by the [<hi>Probati quique Seniores</hi>] who did preside; the accused Person being brought into the Congregation.</q>
And this Authoritative Sentence of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> was more approved, than when passed by one Man: As when <hi>Sya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> passed Sentence in the same Case; The Church was unsatisfied with the Sentence of <hi>Syagrius,</hi> because he passed it [<hi>sine alicujus Fratris Consilio</hi>] without the consent of any of his Brethren: But were pacified with the Sentence of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> because saith he [<hi>hoc judicium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum cum Fratribus &amp; consacerdotibus participatum processerat</hi>] This his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence proceeded jointly from him and his Fellow-<hi>Presbyters</hi> or Ministers. Yea, the very Admonition of Offenders, were not given by the <hi>Bishops</hi> alone, but by the <hi>Elders</hi> (<hi>August. De verb. Apost. Serm.</hi> 19.) Thus also, <hi>Origen contra Celsum lib.</hi> 3. Excommunication it self, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, was vibrated by those that laboured in the Word and Doctrin; and the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie,</hi> that delivered unto Satan, as <hi>Jerom</hi> shews, (<hi>Epist. ad Heliod.</hi>) So (<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Demet.</hi>) they also Received and Absolved the Penitents. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (<hi>Epist.</hi> 12) shews that this was the custom [<hi>nec ad communicationem veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quis possit, nisi prius ab Episcopo &amp; clero manus illi fuerit imposita</hi>] such as were Excommunicat, returned, not to Church Fellowship, before hands were laid upon him by the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Clergy.</hi> And writing to his Charge, anent lapsed Christians, he tells them [<hi>exomologesi facta, &amp; manu iis a vobis in poenitentiam imposita</hi>] After Confession, and laying on of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> hands, they might be commended to God. And such as returned from Heresie, and were to be Received in the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Cornelius, Cyprian</hi> tells us (<hi>Epist.</hi> 6. compared with 46.) they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58203:53"/>
the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> and Confessing their Sins, were Received. Now, if <hi>Presbyters</hi> had such Authority, and the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power was of this Nature, and thus Limited, let any Judg, how the Dr's Assertion can subsist, <hi>viz:</hi> "That in Judicatories, <hi>Pastors</hi> had no decisive suffrage.</p>
               <p>For the Dr's after-discourse, (P. 436.) anent the Civil Soveraigns Decrees, in case of a supposed interfeiring with the <hi>Churches Legislative Power</hi> (as he calls it) I shall not (it being some what out of our way) much digress in examining the same, tho I judg it very lax and liable to considerable exceptions, yea, and hardly reconcilable with it self, or sound sense and Divinity. The Dr. holds,
<q>That the Churches Legislative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, cannot reach to controll the Civil Decrees.</q>
                  <q>And yet holds, That these Decrees cannot countermand Gods Laws.</q>
Now, the Dr. will not say, that the Churches Legislative Power, is not founded upon, and Authorised by Gods Laws; nay, he positively asserts, that it is. He adds, "That next to the Laws of God, the Soveraigns Laws; are to be obeyed. And thus makes the Law of God, the overruling Law, the <hi>Regula Regulans,</hi> and paramount to those of the Soveraign: And therefore, by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, from this Assertion, the Churches Legislative Power, in exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and declaring Gods Laws, must likewise be thus Paramount there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and first obeyed; Especially, if he stand to that instance of his, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. as exhibiting the Plat-form and Standart of Church Laws, wherein, the enacted Canon and Decree, is said to be, <hi>the mind of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and thus a Divine Law, the Authority of God, being thereto interponed. Yet, in the very next Words, he lays down this Assertion,
<q>That next to the Laws of the Soveraign, the Laws of the Church, are to be obeyed:</q>
And so here, these Civil Laws, are set in an higher Sphere, and made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to all Church Laws, and this without any exception or Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether they be consonant to the Divine Law or not, or any Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Consonancy to the Divine Law, in the Laws of the Church. The person, who will reconcile and soudder these, must in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, be better skill'd, than all <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Gimmerers, and no doubt, better seen in logical Rules and subtilties, than I. So much for the Dr's. First <hi>Prerogative</hi> of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as distinct from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in the <hi>Power Legislative,</hi> and of making Canons.</p>

<q>To <hi>Consecrat</hi> and <hi>Ordain</hi> to <hi>Ecclesiastick Offices.</hi> Thereafter, the Dr. spends much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon Christs Mission of the Twelve Apostles, <hi>as the Father sent him,</hi> including a Power of Ordination of others, which he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58203:54"/>
Confirms by <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.33.36. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.16. Which Commission, he tells us, was transferred Originally upon the Apostolick Order; So, that Ecclesiastick Commissions, were either given by the hands of these First Apostles, or by such Secondary Apostles, as were by them admitted into Apostolick Orders, and these Secondary Apostles, were the same with <hi>Bishops.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We need not spend time in resuming what is said already, in Answer to this. There's no doubt, but our Lord gave a Power of Mission, and of Ordaining Ministers, to <hi>His Twelve Apostles</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Power to Plant Churches, through the World, and a Gospel Ministry, and Ordinances in them: But, that by vertue of this their Mission, they were to transferr their Apostolick Office and Authority, to ordinary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Officers, is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Quaesitum,</hi> or Question, which the Dr. still beggs and supposes, but will never be able to prove, from either the Nature and intendment of their Mission, or the Power and Authority of Succeeding Officers, whom they Ordained, as we have above evinced. The Dr's Proofs are pitifully claudicant; he tells us,
<q>That tho the whole Disciples were present, the Apostles only Imposed hands upon the Seven Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.</q>
And why not? The Authoritative Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands in Ordination, is no doubt proper to Ecclesiastick Officers; not to the People; but where were the Succedaneous <hi>Bishops</hi> here, who had solely this Power, tho Ministers were present?
<q>The Dr. has let us see no shaddow of this, from the Text. He next tells us of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> Ordaining <hi>Elders</hi> in <hi>Antioch, Iconium</hi> and <hi>Lystra.</hi>
                  </q>
A mighty proof! The Apostles in planting Churches, ordained Ministers in them: <hi>Ergo</hi> Suceedaneous <hi>Bishops,</hi> have an Apostolick Authority of <hi>Ordaining,</hi> derived to them solely, as their <hi>peculiar</hi> Prerogative above <hi>Pastors</hi>: This Consequence is denyed. If the Dr. own these <hi>Elders</hi> for <hi>Pastors,</hi> it should seem, they had an <hi>Ordaining</hi> Power, else the Apostles settled these Churches in a very mank frame, and lame posture, and wanting the Essentials of an Organick Church. If the Dr. allow them an <hi>Ordaining</hi> Power, he crosses the Scope of a proof of Succeedaneous <hi>Bishops,</hi> with Power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> set up by the Apostles, since thus he ascribes it unto <hi>Pastors:</hi> And if he deny it, he is liable also to the same absurdity, and that mentioned above, and will cross his Notion of the <hi>Bishops</hi> Office ascribed to the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who mett with the Apostles in that <hi>Council Act.</hi> 15. Besides, if the Dr. put an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Mitre, upon these <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> and make them <hi>Bishops</hi> in his Sense, it is very odd, that among these little new gathered Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, such highly Authorized <hi>Diocesan Prelats</hi> were set up, before any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> for Feeding with the Word and Doctrin. For discovering the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of which Gloss and Assertion, I dare appeal to the Current of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Or, if the Dr. imagin the strength of his Proof, to ly in this, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58203:54"/>
these Officers were Ordained by Apostles, <hi>solely,</hi> he should know, that as we all allow an extraordinary Power in Apostles, in Churches, not yet Constitut, not competent to Ordinary Officers, so, his Assertion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent an ordinary Power of Succeedaneous or <hi>Secondary Apostles</hi> (as he calls them) as sole and singular in <hi>Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Dr. finds a Difficulty in his Way, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were <hi>ordained Apostles</hi> of the Gentiles by certain <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> in <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 438.</note> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1, 2.</q>
To which he makes this Return,
<q>That these Prophets and Teachers had, no doubt, received the Apostolick Character, being ordained by the Apostles <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>: For otherwise, saith he, how could they have derived it?</q>
And this Notion, the Dr. reposes such Confidence in, that he tells us,
<q>There is no doubt, but they had this Character.</q>
But truly, whether the Insipid Folly of the Objection, or of the Return here made unto it, be greater, is a Question to me. <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were at this time, and in this Action, <hi>ordained</hi> Apostles of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I believe few (if ever any) except the Dr, did imagin. I had always thought, that it is evident to any, who reads the Account and Story of <hi>Pauls</hi> Conversion, and Call to the Apostleship, by the Lord from Heaven, that when thus called, he was called, in a special manner, to the <hi>Apostleship of the Gentiles — I have appeared unto thee,</hi> saith our Lord — <hi>to make thee a Minister, and a Witness — delivering thee from the People, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, to open their Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which, the Apostle immediatly set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Work of Preaching to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17, 18, 19. The Apostle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so tells us, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.) that when it <hi>pleased God, who separated me from my Mothers Womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach among the Heathen,</hi> or Gentiles; <hi>immediatly I conferred not with Flesh and Blood: Neither went I up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to them, which were Apostles before me.</hi> Compare this with <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.8. Hence, its odd to suppose, that either he or <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were at this time <hi>ordained</hi> Apostles. For, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> that he was an Apostle, looking strictly to the Description of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, some may doubt; but supposing him such (he being joyned with <hi>Paul,</hi> under that Character, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.14.) we read of his Officiating, and for what can be understood from Scripture, in the same manner, and by virtue of the same Office, as the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> before this time: For (<hi>Act.</hi> 11.22.) he is sent to <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the Church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> for Confirming and Watering the Church gathered there; And <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. he goes to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> to seek <hi>Paul,</hi> and brings him to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and Taught there a year with <hi>Paul,</hi> where the Christian Name first took place. <hi>Next,</hi> the Dr. finding himself puzzled, with his Notion of a supposed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to their Apostolick Office, by mere <hi>Prophets</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58203:55"/>
and <hi>Teachers,</hi> has no Shift, but to alledge, they were by the Apostles <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Bishops</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Syria,</hi> since they could not else, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the Office of Apostolat. A pretty Evasion indeed, from a Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Objection! First, these <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> are taken to be such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Teachers, who had also the Gift of Prophecy, Vigent at that time. So, <hi>Pool.</hi> 2 <hi>Vol. Annot. Diodat.</hi> upon the place, says, they were such, as had the Gift of Expounding publickly the Resolutions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, by infallible Conduct and Inspiration of the Holy Ghost; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelling them with the Prophets spoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29, 32. who, the Dr. will not doubt, are enjoyned Subjection to the Prophets there established: And with these, spoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. He adds, that it was an extraordinary Degree of Ecclesiastick Office, and singular for these times, <hi>yet inferior to that of Apostles,</hi> and in many, accompanied with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Predictions. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines upon the place, do shew,
<q>That some, take the two Words, <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> for one and the same thing: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, distinguish them thus, that <hi>Prophets</hi> were those, who by Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, had extraordinary Gifts, to foretell things to come, and to expound the Holy Scriptures: But <hi>Teachers,</hi> were such, who had an ordinary Calling and Gifts, to Instruct and Govern the Church, in the Worship of God.</q>
And this place also they paralell with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And the Command of the Holy Ghost, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>Separat me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul] they Paraphrase thus,
<q>That they were separat from the Service of this Church, where there were other Teachers enough, to send them to the Gentiles, <hi>whereunto the Holy Ghost ordained them from the beginning,</hi> citing <hi>Act.</hi> 26.16.</q>
And <hi>v.</hi> 3. which mentions the Laying of the Prophets Hands upon them, they Paraphrase thus,
<q>Not thereby, to chuse them to be <hi>Apostles,</hi> whereunto they were before cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15. but to strengthen them in this sending to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Prayer and Imposition of Hands.</q>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> takes them to be such Prophets as <hi>Agabus.</hi>
                  <q>So <hi>Cornel. a Lapide,</hi> to be such as had the Gift of Prophecy; paralelling this place with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. They were such, as by the Influence of the Spirit, foretold things to come: So <hi>Menochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> That they were Expounders of the Scripture, by the Spirits Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: So <hi>Lorinus, A Lapide, Piscator</hi>: The last of whom, takes them to be the same with <hi>Teachers.</hi>
                  </q>
All which, how Cross they are to the Dr's Character of these Imposers, and the Persons, upon whom Hands were Imposed, together with the end of this Action, is obvious to the meanest Reflection. In Correspondence to the foresaid Account of <hi>Diodat.</hi> and the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, we may further notice this particular Account of <hi>Pool. Annot.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> being called to be Apostles already, the Laying on of Hands did signify, 1. Their being set apart to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58203:55"/>
Imploymentt, hey were now sent about. 2<hi>ly,</hi> The Approbation of the Church to their Heavenly Call they had. 3<hi>ly,</hi> Their Praying for Gods Blessing upon them, and Success upon the Work they went for. But these <hi>Prophets ordaining</hi> them to be <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that, as in the Capacity of <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Syria,</hi> is a Dream, much, if not, only beholden to the Dr. himself. Again, the Dr. doth no way eschew his supposed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by this Answer; For, if these his supposed <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> were only of the ordinary Succedaneous lesser Size, how could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive an Apostolat, of the Primary and first Order, as he calls it? unless the Dr. make them intirely one, which he sometimes (tho in this, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with himself) disownes, as we heard above, when he ascribes to the Apostles a Power, to make general Canons to the whole Church, to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> only to their particular <hi>Diocesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Dr. finds another Objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That those Officers, who Imposed Hands on <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> are called <hi>Prophets,</hi> not <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Bishops.</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> saith the Dr. <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                  </q>
I commend the Dr's Invention and Sagacious Scent: Wherever a Word sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of Rule is found, appropriat to any Church Officer, straight he claps an Episcopal Mitre upon his Head. But this Term being appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at to such Persons, and in such Circumstances, as will not admit this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Character, but are supposed mere <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the Dr's Consecrating Skill fails him. His Friends, the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Translators of our <hi>English</hi> Bible, smell'd out no <hi>Prelacy,</hi> nor <hi>Ruling</hi> in this Term, but Translat the Word, <hi>Chief Men, Primarios, Praecipuos, Estimatos, &amp; Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi>; thus <hi>Erasmus, Vatablus, Beza, Piscator, Camerarius, Drusius.</hi> Or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastico munere fungentes</hi>; so <hi>Beza. Chief Men,</hi> then, may be understood thus, that they were persons, as, in Ecclesiastick Offices, so, of Moral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency for Parts and Piety; which the Dr. will not deny to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to Men of the same Office, and that such discriminating terms of one from another, will infer no distinction therein. Besides, some might alledg, that if he will allow Members of the Church visible, the Scripture epithet of <hi>Brethren,</hi> and of the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> which Denomination, we find applyed unto them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. That upon this ground, <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> who have a <hi>Rule</hi> appropriat unto them, and are termed as in that capacity <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> both the one and the other, may very well come under the Character of <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> and by consequence, that the Relation of the one to the other, may well come under this complex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phrase of <hi>Rulers among the Brethren,</hi> especially, since in the <hi>Council, Act</hi> 15. the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> are distinguished, as Church Officers from privat Church
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58203:56"/>
Officers from privat Church Members. Again, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and even <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Brethren,</hi> doth evidently and frequently in Scripture, reject the Dr's Mitr'd Notion: Particularly <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. where they are spoken of, in the <hi>Plural,</hi> as over that Church, both in <hi>Ruling</hi> and Feeding by Doctrin: And <hi>v.</hi> 17. they are in a <hi>Plurality,</hi> supposed both to <hi>Rule</hi> and watch for Souls; And <hi>v.</hi> 24, they are distinguished from the <hi>Saints,</hi> under this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination: And consequently, in all the Three Passages, put under the Character of, <hi>Rulers among the Brethren,</hi> but as having all a Relation to this Church, and actually and jointly <hi>Ruling</hi> and Feeding by Doctrin: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, they are such <hi>Rulers among the Brethren,</hi> as are all Faithful <hi>Pastors</hi>; And therefore, of a quite distinct Character, from his supposed <hi>Ruling Prelats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. affirms,
<q>That <hi>Ordination</hi> was confined to such as were admitted to the Apostolat;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> as the laying on of Hands in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was by <hi>Paul</hi> committed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> upon whom, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self imposed Hands;</q>
And unto <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> whom he left to <hi>Ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. To this we have spoken at large, and need not here stand upon a prolix resuming of what hath been offered in <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> thereunto. Only in a word, we may see, that the Dr. Shoots short of his proofs, which is obviously evident to any that considers, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves, nor can prove, these his groundless <hi>Postulata</hi> and suppositions (without which he misses his mark, and his Argument has no imaginable Foundation) such as 1.
<q>That, the Offices of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were ordinary, and the same with his described Hierarchical <hi>Prelat.</hi>
                  </q>
This, we have already disproved, and by clear Scripture evidence, made the contrary appear. 2<hi>ly.</hi>
                  <q>That the Apostles Precepts, in point of <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> did import their sole Authority therein, in Churches constitut, so, as to seclud all Authority of <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in the same, even where they were settled, and could concurr.</q>
The contrary whereof, we have also made evident. Again, whereas the Dr. thinks to strengthen his Plea, in telling us,
<q>That the Apostle by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> Ordained him, an Apostle or <hi>Bishop</hi> of that Church.</q>
We have evinced the folly of this alledgeance, and that the Apostles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Hands upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> rather strengthens, than impugns the <hi>Presbyterian Cause.</hi> Since, 1. It is evident, that the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> (and consequently, Ordinary <hi>Pastors,</hi> whom the Dr. wholly excluds from <hi>Ordination</hi>) laid Hands upon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and had an Authoritative interest therein. And 2<hi>ly.</hi> That the Text mentions <hi>Paul</hi>'s Laying on of Hands, in order to Gifts; but the laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> in another Mould and Phrase. Hence, its easie, to cut the Sinews of the Dr's Arguing with a Notion of hii own, set down, but a few Lines above.
<q>He enquires, how could the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58203:56"/>
                     <hi>Prophets</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> derive an Apostolat to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> if they had not been of that Character?</q>
Now, I would ply the Dr. with this Counter-query, how could Imposition of Hands, and Authoritative Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, be performed by <hi>Pastors,</hi> and Ministerial or Evangelistick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be derived by them, together with <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> if <hi>Pastors</hi> were not of such a Character, as had an <hi>Ordaining</hi> Power? Here is a Query, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Dr's own <hi>medium,</hi> and his Answering satisfyingly the second, will clear him in Answering the First.
<q>Hence, what he adds, (P. 438, 439.) <hi>viz.</hi> That through the whole Scripture History, <hi>Ordination</hi> is performed by those of the Apostolick Order, or by secondary Apostles, as he calls them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> doth in this appear groundless:</q>
For, here we find the Power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> seated in, and exercised by a <hi>Presbytrie.</hi> And we have told him and above evinced, that tho we suppose <hi>Paul</hi> present, and imposing Hands with them, it rather confirms, than invalidats our Argument from this place, for <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> Power in <hi>Ordination.</hi> Not to insist upon the Dr's recent instance of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> Authoritatively Imposing Hands upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>; which (tho not importing a formal <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>) yet, considering the circumstances and context, <hi>viz.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Imposing hands, <hi>scil. Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> the Persons upon whom they imposed Hands, <hi>scil. Apostles,</hi> together with the end and design, <hi>i. e.</hi> their being solemnly set a part and Blest, and thus sent out upon a special Legation, its an Instance strongly pleading (and as we use to say <hi>a majori ad minus</hi>) for a Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> in <hi>Pastors,</hi> in relation to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Church Officers. And whatever may be said of instances, as to Ordinary <hi>Pastors,</hi> in these Infant-times of the Church, rare, when extrao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rdinary Officers, such as Apostles and Evangelists, were existent, and their Offices vigent, the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, so clearly and frequently, (as we have proved) ascribed and apropriat to <hi>Pastors,</hi> doth certainly includ this Authority of <hi>Ordination,</hi> as essential thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Dr. adds,
<q>That if we Consult Primitive <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the best Interpreters of Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>

I need not much digress to tell him, that the after-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Churches, is acknowledged in matters of Fact (and even by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> himself) in a great measure dark and uncertain, and is also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and found much opposit to Scripture: And therefore, a slippery and unsound ground and Comment, as to Scripture Matter of Fact, and in order to such a conclusion. I might add, that if the Dr's Reasoning hold good, it is in point of <hi>Right,</hi> as well as in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> the sure and sole Comment upon Scripture. But for this bold and Universal assertion of the Dr's, it is easily convict of falsehood, by what is above offered. The
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58203:57"/>
4<hi>th. Council</hi> of <hi>Carth. Canon</hi> 22. Decrees,
<q>That the <hi>Bishops Ordain</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
                  </q>
And if we suppose this Canon obeyed, there wanted not abundance of conformable instances. In <hi>Cyprians</hi> time. the <hi>Pastors</hi> had the Power [<hi>manum imponendi</hi>] of Ordaining, <hi>Ep.</hi> 78. And in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in absence of the <hi>Bishop, Ordained</hi> alone, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> on <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. asserts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what is at large made out to this scope, by our Writers, in reference to the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> and this for a very considerable extent, both of time and place. <hi>Cyprian Ep.</hi> 33. Writing to his Charge, certifies them,
<q>That <hi>Aurelius</hi> was <hi>Ordained</hi> by him and his <hi>Collegues,</hi> who were present with him.</q>
And least the Dr. start at a supposition, that <hi>Cyprian,</hi> called <hi>Presbyters</hi> his <hi>Collegues,</hi> let any peruse <hi>Ep.</hi> 33. and this will convincingly appear. We have told him before, that <hi>Firmilianus</hi> saith of them, that Rule in the Church [<hi>quod Baptisandi, manum imponendi &amp; Ordinandi possident potestatem</hi>] and who these are, he shews a little before, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>Seniores &amp; praepositi,</hi>] We have also told him, that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> himself, was found accused (in <hi>Synod ad Quaercum Ann.</hi> 403.) that he had made <hi>Ordinations,</hi> with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and company of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And in the forecited <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> (<hi>Canon</hi> 21.) it is enacted, "That the <hi>Bishop Ordain</hi> not without the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And <hi>Canon.</hi> 2. <hi>Presbyters</hi> are enjoined to <hi>Impose</hi> hands with the <hi>Bishop.</hi> The Authors of <hi>Ius Divinum Minist.

In the close of his discourse, upon this point, he tells us,
<q>That this is so undenyable, that tho <hi>Ierom</hi> equalize <hi>Presbyters</hi> with <hi>Bishops,</hi> yet he is forc't to do it with an [<hi>excepta Ordinatione</hi>] <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  </q>
If we should suppose <hi>Ierom</hi> to speak of the general custom of that time and place, and neither absolutely nor Universally, as to the practice or Matter of Fact, far less of of a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> the Dr's. undenyable proof is soon overturned; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially its Razed, when we tell him, that <hi>Ierom</hi>'s [<hi>excepta Ordinatione</hi>] is well enough understood of the <hi>Bishops</hi> ordinarly assumed Chief interest, in the <hi>rituals of Ordination,</hi> tho <hi>Presbyters</hi> (as is above cleared) did intrust this to him, as having a joint and essential interest in <hi>the thing it self.</hi>
               </p>

All this is easily accorded.</p>
               <p>But now comes the main Point,<note place="margin">P. 442</note> and the <hi>Cardo questionis,</hi>
                  <q>This Power, saith the Dr, is wholly deposited, in the <hi>Episcopal Order.</hi>
                  </q>
This is soon said, but to prove it, <hi>hoc opus, hic labor est.</hi> It were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, here, to remind the Reader, how the Dr. understands <hi>the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Order,</hi> or how far, in a sound Scripture Sense, of <hi>the Episcopal</hi> order, this assertion might be admitted. But to the Point, the Dr. proves his Assertion, from this ground, that in all the forecited places, it was only to Apostles, that our Lord derived this <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> they alone being the Stewards, to whom he committed the Keyes and Government of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to whom, alone he promised Twelve Thrones, to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Spiritual <hi>Israel,</hi> as the Chief of the Trib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Governed the Natural <hi>Israel, Math.</hi> 19.28.
<q>Upon which ground he tells us, that the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> has the Names of the Twelve Apostles upon its Gates, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Twelve pretious Stones, <hi>v.</hi> 19.20. Do in his Sense, denote the Power and dignity of the Church. As also, the 144 Cubits of the Walls Measure, amounting to Twelve times twelve, he takes to denote the Apostles equal Government of the Church. From all which, the Dr. thrusts out, as his project of the whole, his former No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Topick of [<hi>our Lords lodging this Jurisdiction, in those of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoliek Order, derived, from the Apostles</hi>] which, saith he, was administrat accordingly, either by the Apostles immediatly, or by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the several Churches, to whom they communicat their Order.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> All this (in so far, as relates to the Dr's scope) is nothing but a repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is already Answered. I shall easily accord with him in this, that, as our Lord placed and left in his Church, a <hi>Spiritual Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> so, his Apostles, were the First and immediat <hi>Recipients</hi> of this, from himself. I do likewise consent to the Dr. in this, that this <hi>Spiritual Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> was to be continued in the Church, and Transmitted to fit Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators, and was not to die with the Apostles. As also, there is no doubt, that they were to deliver our Lords mind, and the Standart, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing measures and Rules of all the Ordinances of the House of God, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58203:58"/>
Doctrin, Worship, Disciplin and Government thereof, in which Respect, they are called the Churches Foundation.</p>
               <p>But in all this, the Dr. has not laid one Ground-Stone of his proof, which (as we have often told him) lyes Chiefly in these two Points. 1. That the Office of Apostolat, in its entire na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and extent, and as exercised by the Twelve, was by our Lord, intended for <hi>an ordinary Function and Office,</hi> to be thus continued in, and transmitted to the Church, and devolved on Successors, who were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to exercise the same Office and Power. 2<hi>ly.</hi> That these Successors were so invested with this Apostolick Power and Office, as they had the whole Government, the Power of Order and Jurisdiction, monopolized in them, in so far as the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> appointed and set up by Apostles, in the Churches, had only the <hi>Doctrinal Key,</hi> entrusted to them, but not that <hi>of Government</hi>; whereas, both the one and the other, were committed to these supposed succedaneous Apostles. Now, its evident, that if the Dr. prove not these, he says nothing; And that both these, are unsound and Antiscriptural Suppositions, we have already made appear. (1.) From the many evidences, and clear Scripture discoveries, of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie expired nature of the Apostolick, and Evangelistick Office. And (2.) From the Apostles intrusting and transmitting to <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and devolving upon them, both the <hi>Keyes</hi> of Doctrin and Government, as their proper and imediat Successors; as also from clear Scripture Grounds and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which do evince their actual exercise of the same.</p>
               <p>But next, to examin a little more closely, the Dr's Proofs, I would gladly know of him, or any of his Perswasion, whether they do not look upon, and understand that Text, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. as containing a <hi>constant Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law and Rule, given to the Christian Church, to prescrib the Method of removing Scandals,</hi> as also, <hi>the proper Subject of the Keyes, and Iurisdictional Power,</hi> and of that Power in special, which is called <hi>Critick</hi>? The Dr. holds,
<q>That Christ here, established <hi>a Iurisdiction in the Church</hi>; he also acknowledges, That the Church here meant, hath Power of <hi>Authoritative Admonition,</hi> and <hi>the Binding and Loosing Power,</hi> since he holds it to be the same with that Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Loosing Authority, which our Lord promises to Ratifie in Heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19.</q>
He understands by this Jurisdiction, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Exercise of the Keyes, pointed at, in these Paralells: Nay, he acknowledges, P. 443.
<q>That in the Forecited Passage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. our Lord institut the Power of Censuring:</q>
And I need not tell him, that Words of <hi>Institution,</hi> of any Ordinance, are the proper Standart and Measure thereof, and the Pattern shewed upon the Mount. Now, what is meant by the <hi>Church,</hi> the proper Subject of the Keyes, in the Dr's Sense and Pleading, is the Question. The Dr. will not say, it is the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58203:58"/>
Magistrat, as some have alledged; for he holds,
<q>That our Lord spoke this to his Church, as a distinct Society, and having distinct Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, from the Kingdoms of the World.</q>
And whereas, some have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that we are to understand this <hi>Church,</hi> of a <hi>Iewish Sanehedrin,</hi> the Dr, in the whole Strain and Scope of his Discourse, disownes this, for he asserts,
<q>That in this Text, our Lord is speaking to <hi>the Christian Church,</hi> and establishing a <hi>Spiritual Jurisdiction</hi> therein.</q>
Neither, can he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, by the <hi>Church,</hi> the whole Collective Body, according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion of the Word; for, the Dr, in the Strain of his Discourse, makes this Power and Authority, peculiar and proper to Church Officers, as is evident in his Paralells above-rehearsed, and <hi>the Church Representative,</hi> to be the proper Subject of that Jurisdictional Power, here enjoyned.</p>
               <p>Now, all this being evident in his own Pleading; since the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Power, is, by our Lord exprest (who knew best how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it) by the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Church,</hi> I would fain know, by what Warrand, the Dr. can can make this Term, peculiar to <hi>one single Person, viz.</hi> a <hi>Bishop,</hi> so, as it must be holden to express his sole Prerogative? Or, where will he shew, or make it appear, that, in any <hi>Greek</hi> Author, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or Prophane, the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denotes <hi>one single Person?</hi> If he say, that by the <hi>Church,</hi> the Community of <hi>Church Rulers</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>viz.</hi> that all <hi>Bishops</hi> in common, and every <hi>Bishop</hi> apart, hath this Power and Authority. I <hi>Answer,</hi> this, understood of Scripture <hi>Bishops,</hi> or Church Officers in general, and of such Church Officers of particular Collegiat Churches, is easily accorded; But, if he mean of his Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Bishops</hi> in Bulk, and of every one of such a part, he both Beggs the Question, and Crosses the Scope of the Place. For, 1. Howsoever we take the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Church,</hi> whether for the Church Universal, to whom Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and a Government, is given immediatly, or for particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to whom, in a mediat Sense, the same Government and Charge is given, we must, of necessity, understand it to be given to such parts of this whole, as do come under the Denomination, and partake of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Church,</hi> and according to the Dr's Sense above-evinced, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied Society, or Juridical Court, must, in that Statute, be understood, which can never be applicable to a <hi>single Person.</hi> And besides, this would invert our Lords Method of Procedure, and the Gradation here held out and enjoyned, which is (as the Dr. himself acknowledges) from one to two, or more, and the last Result, and ultimat Appeal, is to the <hi>Church,</hi> or the Imbodied <hi>Court of Officers,</hi> with whom the Jurisdictional and Critical Power is lodged. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Granting that this Jurisdictional Power, in Order to the first Planting of Churches, was, for this end, at first lodged with the Apostles, yet the fore-mentioned great Rule and Fundamental Law (as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58203:59"/>
above Sensed, and in a great Measure, by the Dr. himself) will still e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that the Apostles were not to Exercise it, to the prejudice of the Authority given thereby to the standing Officers, and ordinary Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Courts of the Christian Church, unless they can be supposed to have had a Power Paramount thereunto: For, wherever a Christian Organick Chuch was gathered, by vertue of this Precept, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals were to be delated to the Officers thereof, who consequently, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature and Tenor of the foresaid Law, are supposed to have the Binding and Loosing Power, whatever Apostolical Authority might reach in Churches not Constitut, or in way of Apostolical Direction to Churches Constitut, as in the Case of the Incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> yet this was not <hi>Privative of,</hi> but <hi>Cumulative to,</hi> the ordinary Power of Collegiat Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Churches, as is often told him.</p>
               <p>I might further urge the Dr. with this, that that Passage, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23 cannot but be extended to a <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> as well as <hi>Iurisdictional</hi> Remitting or Retaining, Binding or Loosing, the Doctrinal Key, as well as Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictional, being Primarly given to Apostles, to be by them, derived to Successors. Our Lord, in his Gift to Apostles, divided them not; And therefore, neither were the Apostles to divide them, in Devolving this Power upon, and Committing this Authority to Successors: And since the Dr. acknowledges, that the Apostles, by virtue of our Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, Devolved upon <hi>Pastors</hi> the Doctrinal Authority, and Committed to them that Key, (thus P. 427, 428.) why not, I pray, the Jurisdictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal also, both being inseparably tyed together? Nay, the Dr. himself, upon the Matter yields this, for he tells us, (<hi>ubi supra</hi>)
<q>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Go Teach all Nations, Math.</hi> 28.19. did reach <hi>Pastors,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Successors in this Ministerial Duty, and that Preaching, was one of <hi>the principal Imployments, belonging to the Apostolical Office.</hi>
                  </q>
And if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were to commit to <hi>Pastors,</hi> one principal part of their Office, why not also the less principal? Besides, that the Command [<hi>Go Teach,</hi> or Disciple <hi>all Nations</hi>] will clearly includ the <hi>Jurisdictional,</hi> as well as <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Key.<note place="margin">P. 428.</note> The Dr. adds, (<hi>ibid.</hi>)
<q>That yet this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Preaching, was not restrained to their Office, since inferior Officers Preacht, as the seventy:</q>
Yet he adds,
<q>That none Preacht, but either by immediat Commission from Christ, or Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordination.</q>
But, I pray, were any in his Sense, otherwise allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exercise Disciplin, but in this method? Why will not the Dr. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the exercise of Disciplin to the Seventy, and such a Mission of Rulers, consequently? For <hi>Timothy</hi> (whom, together with the Seventy, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably Judges, to have held, an Evangelistick Office) he pleads, had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, both to Teach and Rule: And the Teachers, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58203:59"/>
holds to be <hi>Bishops</hi>; So, that in his Sense, Government being annexed in these instances thereunto, the Lord did extraordinarly call, in these times of the Church, some persons, who were not Apostles. Therefore, his Reason is insufficient to prove, that the Power of Government and Preaching, being <hi>Eminenter,</hi> contained in the Apostolick Office, they did not commit the <hi>Ruling</hi> Authority to such, to whom the <hi>Preaching</hi> work was intrusted. Once more to reflect upon the Passage, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> we will find our Sense and Pleading, correspondent to judicious Interpreters <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> is, <hi>coram multis, inquit liber Musar. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But to proceed with the Dr, he tells us next,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 442.443,</note>
                  <q>That none, but such as are of the Aopostolick Order, can pretend to the <hi>Jurisdictional</hi> Power, since it was First lodged in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and by them immediatly exercised, or by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches, to whom they communicat their Authority and Order.</q>
But one should think, that such to whom they committed the <hi>Chief and principal part</hi> of their Office, as they did to <hi>Pastors,</hi> by the Dr's Confession, to such they did commit their Order, in so far, as unto ordinary succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers, and that together with this, the other subservient part of <hi>Ruling,</hi> was also committed; both Keyes, being in their Nature, as above hinted, so inseparably connected: And he cannot give one instance of the Apostles giving the First to Successors, without the Second: Nay, the instances are clear of their committing both to Pastors.

                  <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Ruling.</hi> So, that the Dr. may here see, in this Scripture-Glass, the Portraiture, the clear Image of the Scripture-<hi>Bishop,</hi> and the Authentick and Original Character of the Office of these <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Churches, to whom the Apostles committed the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Work, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preaching <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Shall I add a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and acknowledg to the Dr, they were not the <hi>Bishops</hi> of his supposed Order, since the Apostle discharged them to be <hi>Lords</hi>; because, in these simple times of Christianity, the Apostles themselves, were rude, and not yet acquaint with the Grandure of <hi>Spiritual Lords and Lordships,</hi> in the House of God. But least the Dr, do think this odd, that I do hold the Work of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and Administration of the Sacraments, an higher Point of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Authority, than <hi>Ruling,</hi> at least, if I may add, <hi>only Ruling,</hi> which he knows, the <hi>Bishops</hi> arrogat to themselves solely, not medling much with the first, and that I hold the <hi>Governing</hi> Power, to be appendant upon, and consequent unto the Power of <hi>Order,</hi> in Preaching and Administrating the Seals of the Covenant; I must tell him, that if this be an Errour, A great one has led me into it, and one of the Dr's most eminent <hi>Primary Bishops,</hi> who, I am sure, had a Divine Authority for his Office, and an Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Teaching besides; It is even the great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who gives to <hi>Timothy</hi> this Precept, [<hi>The Elders that Rule well, count them worthy of double Honour, especially they that Labour in the Word and Doctrin</hi>] wherein, it is evident, the Apostle allows the Labouring in the Word and Doctrin, the higher Honour, above <hi>Ruling,</hi> yea and <hi>Ruling well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But to prove, that the Apostles committed this <hi>Iurisdictional</hi> Power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of their Order, the Dr. brings the Instance of <hi>Pauls</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncing the Sentence of Excommunication against the Incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person,<note place="margin">P. 443.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. shewing that he, as present in Spirit, had Judged, <hi>i. e.</hi> saith the Dr, <hi>pronunced Sentence,</hi> concerning him who had done that Deed: And <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. he orders them, to declare and and execute his Sentence.</q>
But, that the Current of the Context runs Cross to the Dr's Pleading, is several ways evident. For, 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle blames this Church, that this Sentence was not passed before, and that they saved him not the Labour of this Prescription or Appointment, in performing their Duty, Antecedaneously thereunto. It is evident, he checks them, that this Person, was not by an Ecclesiastick Censure, of such a Nature, as is here intimat, <hi>put away, and taken from among them, v.</hi> 2. 2<hi>ly,</hi> He writes to them to do it, and this, as an Act of their ordinary Authority, proper to them, as Church Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Authoritatively to deliver to Satan, and that, when by the Authority of our Lord, they were mett together; the Body of Professo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, being also concerned in a Consent to this Ejection. And therefore, they were not to meet merely
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58203:60"/>
to Declare or Witness, what the Apostle had done before. 3<hi>ly,</hi> He thus expostulats, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Do not ye Iudg them that are within?</hi> A convincing Proof, that they had Power to Censure all, that were within that Church, by an Intrinsick Authority, proper to them, as Officers thereof. 4<hi>ly.</hi> He calls this Act or Sentence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. A <hi>Censure or Punishment, inflicted of many, viz.</hi> the Church Officers, not a Declaration of his previously passed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. I hope the Dr. will not fall into such a blunt Conceit, as to make one and the same, <hi>the Declaration of a Sentence, passed by another,</hi> and <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Passing of a Sentence, or Inflicting of a Censure or Punishment,</hi> which if done warrantably, as is here supposed, doth necessarly import Authority in the Persons Acting. <hi>Inflicted of many,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>i. e.</hi> Not by all the Multitude, as <hi>Independents</hi> Judge, nor by one Person or <hi>Bishop,</hi> as the Dr. Dreams. As for his Expounding <hi>Pauls</hi> Judging this Person Censureable, to be his <hi>Pronuncing Sentence,</hi> it is a very gross Distortion; For, <hi>Paul,</hi> as an Apostle, infallibly Inspired by virtue of his Apostolical Directive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and in special, as having the Care of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches upon him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. had Power to Direct and Prescribe Duty to either Members or Officers of any Churches. And therefore, if the Dr. will draw this Act to Exemplifie <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, he draws upon himself two gross Absurdities, 1. That <hi>Paul</hi> had, and Exemplified a standing lawful <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, wherever such Prescriptions were exercised, and to whomsoever they could reach; And this Reaching over all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his Care being thus extended (as is above cleared) the Dr. makes him a standing Primat, and Patriarch over them, Exemplifying a sort of Patriarchal Primacy, to be Transmitted in the Church. 2<hi>ly,</hi> That his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Prescription, of the Duties of Church Officers, was not Cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative unto, but Privative of whatever Authority and Interest in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they might acclaim, or in the Exercise of the Power of Order. And thus, suppose the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Dr's Mould, set over the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had neglected his Duty (as these Officers, are here found faulty in this point) <hi>Pauls</hi> Apostolick Direction, in the Dr's Sense and Pleading, nullifies his Power, and proves he had none: Or, supposing an <hi>Archippus,</hi> or negligent Minister, had needed his Apostolical Direction, to perform such Acts of the Power of <hi>Order</hi>; as were proper to his Function, <hi>Pauls</hi> Prescription of Duty, by the same Reason, swallows it up, and makes it null. Certain it is, that neither could the Apostles divest themselves of this directing Power, of Judging upon neglect of Duty, which had been a divesting themselves of their Office, nor can they be supposed, without the grossest Consequences, striking at the Root of all Church Authority, to have, by their directing or judging Power, exauctorat such, to whom the Direction was given, of their Power and Interest, in their respective

Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delivering to Satan, of Excommunication and casting out of the Church; They give this Reason, [<hi>because the Apostle speaks of an Action, which might be, and ought to have been done, by the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>when they mett together, and for not doing of which, the Apostle blames them</hi>] Thus clearly Asserting the Intrinsick Authority of the Church Officers of <hi>Corinth</hi> herein, and upon the same Grounds, which we have Asigned. To the same Scope, do the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, Expound this whole Passage, paralel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with the great Precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. Both upon <hi>v.</hi> 4, &amp; 5. and upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. touching the Subject of this Jurisdictional Act, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was <hi>Inflicted of many,</hi> they Expound of Church Governours or Officers. <hi>Diodat.</hi> upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 4. thus Senses the Words,
<q>That they were to perform this, as the Lords Ministers, by Authority received from Christ, and that the Command is directed to the <hi>Pastors</hi> and Conductors of the Church, being gathered together in Ecclesiastical Judgment, having the Apostles Declaration, instead of his Voice and Vote.</q>
And to obviat such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fancy, as that of our Dr. upon this, he adds,
<q>That this was, without doing any prejudice, to the ordinary Ministry of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>: And that <hi>Paul</hi> uses his Apostolical Power Modestly, only to excite the other, (<hi>viz.</hi> the ordinary Power of <hi>Pastors</hi>) and to strengthen it. And he Expounds <hi>v.</hi> 7. not only of Purging out this Incestuous Man, but all such Scandalous Kind of People, who by their Infection, might plunge again into the Ancient Corruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
And upon. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Do not ye Iudg them, that are within?</hi> He says,
<q>That it is certain, that a Judge cannot exercise his Jurisdiction, but only over those, that are within his Precinct, and <hi>subject to his Tribunal</hi> — Clearly Asserting a Spiritual Tribunal, in this Representative Church.</q>
To the same Scope, he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the last <hi>verse.</hi> The <hi>English Annot.</hi> upon <hi>v.</hi> 2. of this <hi>Chap.</hi> in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence to the Exposition and Answer premised, and in Opposition to the Dr's Reasoning, do shew,
<q>That the Apostle finds fault with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for that they had not Excommunicat this Incestuous Person, before he had Wrote unto them, and Charged them so to do, because the Fact was Notorious, and the Church Scandalized.</q>
And upon <hi>v.</hi> 4. (which mentions the Power of Christ) they shew,
<q>That the Power of Excommunication and Absolving is Christs, and the Ministry thereof only Committed to the Governours of the Church.</q>
And the delivering to Satan, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 5. they Expound by that Paralel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. We need not spend time, in multiplying Instances of Sound Expositors, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Dr's Sense of this place. That there is here, an Allusion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58203:61"/>
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Synagogue, is the Consentient Judgment of the learned, <hi>viz.</hi> in their Way of Excluding and casting out the Scandalous: Thus <hi>Grotius, Estius, Hammond, Simplicius, Piscotor, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pareus,</hi> Paralelling, <hi>v.</hi> 5. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. shews, that the same Persons, are Authorized to Comfort and forgive him, who inflicted the Censure, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church Officers. What we have said, might be further improven, from the end of the Action, which was the purging out the Old Leaven, and taking the Scandalous Person from among them, and the Character of the Censure it self, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Punishment inflicted of Many,</hi> in Opposition to the Dr's Design and Argument. But the thing it self is obvious; And therefore we proceed.</p>
               <p>The Dr. Adduces next, <hi>Paul</hi>'s Threatning <hi>not to spare.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">

And <hi>v.</hi> 10. of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Threatning Severity, according to the Power given him, to Edification; And to come <hi>with a Rod</hi>: He must needs, saith the Dr, mean Apostolical Censures and Excommunication, to be Execute, and Performed in his own Person; in which Respect, he delivered Hereticks of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to Satan, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. It is <hi>Answered,</hi> First, all this is easily removed, by the often Adduced Distinction, of the Apostles ordinary and extraordinary Authority, and of a <hi>Cumulative</hi> and <hi>Privative</hi> Exercise thereof. Altho the extraordinary Power, upon fit Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, such as, either the supine Negligence of Ordinary Church Officers, or the more endangering spread of Offences, or obstinacy of Offenders, or a defect of the ordinary Church Officers, in whom this Power was Lodged and Seated, was alwise in readiness, and to be Exercised for the Churches good and Edification; yet nevertheless, this Exercise (as we have often told him) was never exclusive of, nor derogatory unto the Churches ordinary Intrinsick Authority, nor, (except in Cases mentioned) or Extraordinary Emergents, without the actual Concurrence of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Church Officers. And if, as the Dr. says, the Apostle here insinuats a method of procedure, suitable to our Lords Institution. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. It could not be otherwise. Besides, he Threatens this severity, as a proof of his Apostolick Power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. which some understand of his Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power, to inflict Bodily Afflictions: Others, of his Power to cut off, from the Communion of the Gospel Churches; thus <hi>Pool. Annot.</hi> And if the Dr. will allow, that by mentioning Two or Three Witnesses, he ties him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Method of procedure, which our Lord Institute, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. he must by Parity of Reason, allow the other part of the Institution, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Juridical or Censuring Church, to have its own place therein: And that Consequently, the Apostle was to take along the Authoritative
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58203:62"/>
concurrence of the Church Officers of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in this procedure. But the truth is, he quite mistakes the Passage; For, in that Clause of <hi>Two or Three Witnesses,</hi> the Apostle Intimats only, the certainty of his coming <hi>the Third time</hi>: He had taken up thoughts of, and was preparing for his Journey, and giving them previous warning of his coming, he alludes to that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. to ascertain them thereof accordingly; Thus <hi>Pool Annot.</hi> and Interpreters generally: He had been at <hi>Corinth</hi> once <hi>Act.</hi> 18. Afterward, he had twice purposed and promised to come; once, in the 1 <hi>Ep. Chap.</hi> 16.5. And now again here; And then he adds, <hi>in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Belgick Annot. Diodat.</hi> thus senses this Clause, <hi>in the Mouth of Two or Three Witnesses,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning is, saith he, these
<q>Three warnings of my coming shal be, as so many Witnesses, by which (if ye do not amend,) you shall be sufficiently convinced of incorrigible Rebellion, to proceed to a sentence, already penned 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. [<hi>cum jam bis terve id dixerim, tandem ratum erit</hi>] thus <hi>Grotius.</hi>
                  </q>
As for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles threatning sharpness of Censure, <hi>v.</hi> 10. And his Apostolical <hi>Rod</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. It receives the same Answer, by the forementioned distinction of the Apostles ordinary and Extraordinary Power, and the cumulative and privative exercise thereof. And if the Dr. will not take this from me, may I hope, he will from a far greater:
<q>The Learned <hi>Iunius,</hi> in Answer to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> pleading much to the Dr's Scope and Sense, from this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Apostle — <hi>Shall I come unto you with a Rod?</hi> offers the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction (<hi>De Concil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16.) of the Ordinary and Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rod [<hi>secundum illam, &amp;c.</hi>] According to the common ordinary <hi>Rod,</hi> saith he, <hi>Peter</hi> was a fellow <hi>Presbyter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. but according to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and extraordinary, he stroke dead <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> He adds, in respect of this common <hi>Rod, Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>You being gathered together, and my Spirit, in the Name of the Lord Iesus</hi>; But, as to this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular one, he saith, <hi>Shall I come unto you with a Rod</hi>? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. This common <hi>Rod,</hi> he denyes, to have been, in the Hand of any one Man, whether Apostle or other, or that they had any sole or singular Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in Churches constitute. <hi>Grotius</hi> and others, do here take in the same, which <hi>Iunius</hi> mentions of the extraordinary stroke, either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of Death, as upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> or Blindness, as upon <hi>Elymas</hi>; or Diseases. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, joyn together, the Exercise of punishment and Discipline, in this Clause.</q>
While I have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Iunius,</hi> I must upon this occasion, shew, that in opposition to the Dr's. Pleading, in Relation to Successor-<hi>Bishops</hi> to Apostles, by Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Fathers, Iunius</hi> will tell him (<hi>De Clericis Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Not.</hi> 15.) that this is not to be understood of a Succession from Christs Institution [<hi>quia nunquam instituit Christus ut Apostolis secundum gradum in Ecclesia Succederetur</hi>]
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58203:62"/>
Christ never appointed Successors to the Apostles, according to Degree: And that the Fathers understood it of a Succession [<hi>ex simili, non ex pari</hi>] of similitud, not Parity; And a similitud <hi>Secundum quid,</hi> or imaginary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Bishops,</hi> were then Moulded.

As for the 38 Epistle, which the Dr. Cites, I find nothing in it, that will conclud what he asserts, having perused that Epistle: That which he seems to take hold of, is, that expression of <hi>Cyprian</hi> [<hi>accipiat sententiam quam prior dixit, ut abstentum se a nobis sciat</hi>] upon which Passage, the Annotator upon <hi>Cyprian,</hi> doubts whether he means Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication properly and strictly so called, or not; or rather, that which we term the Lesser, of a Suspension from Ordinances for some little time [<hi>quo elapso,</hi> saith he, <hi>Presbyterium de Contumacia vel Paenitentia eorundum judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabat, &amp;c.</hi>] Moreover, speaking of <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> he says to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> [<hi>cum post haec omnia — nec vestra autoritate &amp; presentia fractus, &amp;c.</hi>] clearly pointing at the <hi>Authoritative</hi> Interposing of the <hi>Pastors,</hi> in this Matter.

               <p>The Dr. will needs have the fifth <hi>Canon</hi> of the first <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi>

Sect.</hi> 8. and <hi>Ruffin. Hist. Lib.</hi> 10.) See <hi>Council Antioch, Canon</hi> 10. <hi>Council An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyr. Canon</hi> 13. And determined against this sole Usurped Authority of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> either in Censuring <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or in Judging the Conversation and Crimes of Church Members, or in Excommunication or Receiving Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. We have also heard, that the fourth <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage, Canon</hi> 23. condemns the <hi>Bishops</hi> Decision, unless fortified by the Sentence of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> This is so evident, that the Dr. is forc'd to clap his Wings closer, and Correct himself, adding, <hi>That afterward, to prevent Abuses, in the fourth</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Carthage, <hi>it was Decreed, that the</hi> Bishop, <hi>should hear no Mans Cause, but in Presence of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>and that his</hi> Sentence <hi>should</hi> be void, <hi>unless Confirmed by their Presence.</hi> Well then, to Correct Abuses, issuing from his supposed <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> here is, by his own Confession, a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-canon,</hi> Decreeing the contrary: And where is now his bold Assertion, of the Universal Practice of the Church, founded upon a Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Patronizes this supposed Power, of the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop</hi>? And if we may ply the Dr, with his own Weapon and Argument, and present to him, a Dish of his own Preparing, how doth he here make a Divine Institution Comprobat by the Churches Universal Practice, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of such Abuses, as this <hi>Council</hi> found necessary to remove? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, how doth this <hi>Council,</hi> by its Censure, Lash the supposed Practice of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and puts among the fore-mentioned Abuses, to be necessarly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58203:64"/>
removed? Ay, but says the Dr, <hi>The Sentence in this Case, was the</hi> Bishops, <hi>not the</hi> Clergies. I <hi>Answer,</hi> if they were <hi>sine quibus non,</hi> in the Sentence, by what Shadow of Ground, can he assert, that it was <hi>solely</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi>? And we heard above, <hi>Cyprian</hi> in Express Contradiction to the Dr, Assert, that not the <hi>Concurrence</hi> only, but the <hi>Sentence,</hi> is properly the <hi>Clergies,</hi> as well as <hi>his.</hi> Moreover, if a Paralel Argument, in Point of <hi>Ordination,</hi> which the Dr. also doth appropriat to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> may be Judged valid in this Case, as no doubt it is, we have made appear from <hi>Canon</hi> 2. of the Fourth <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that they Decree in this Case, that (<hi>omnes Presbyteri presentes manus suas Iuxta manus Episcopi super caput teneant cum Presbyter ordinatur</hi>) And the Dr. cannot deny, that <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> and in the Scripture Sense, <hi>Imposition</hi> of Hands, in this Action of <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is <hi>Authoritative,</hi> not Consentient only, and supposes the <hi>Actors</hi> to have this Badge of the <hi>Ordaining</hi> Power, I mean it, in a Ministerial Sense, as it is competent to all Church Officers.
<q>We have also told him, that Dr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> as Learned an <hi>Episcopalian,</hi> as our Dr. in his <hi>Iraen. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. holds, that (<hi>Non tantum duntaxat ut consentientes (ad consensum enim sufficiunt suffragia, &amp; plebs etiam consentit nec tamen est ejus manum imponere) sed tanquam ordinantes, seu ordinem conferentes, &amp; ex potestate ordinandi divinitus accepta gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ordinato hoc adhibito ritu apprecantes</hi>) That not only as Consenting, which is proper to the Vulgar, who cannot Impose Hands, but as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining or Conferring Orders, and by a Divine Authority, they do in this Action or Rite, pray for Grace to the Ordained.</q>
Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Testimony of our <hi>Scottish</hi> Episcopalian, not only, in Point of Fact, contradicts the Dr, but from this Rite of <hi>Imposing</hi> of Hands, concludes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon solid Grounds, <hi>Presbyters Authoritative</hi> Concurrence in <hi>Ordination.</hi> So that, comparing our Dr's Concession, with Dr. <hi>Forbes</hi> his Sense, in Point of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> and with what we have evinced of <hi>Presbyters</hi> Authoritative Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>Government,</hi> in the Sense of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, the Dr's Pleadings for the <hi>Prelates</hi> sole Interest therein, is sufficiently overturned, yea, and the Inconsistency thereof, with it self, discovered. For what he adds of <hi>Cyprian</hi> his Asserting, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his Metropolitick Church, might (<hi>pro Episcopatus vigore &amp; Cathedrae autoritate</hi>) have Chastised a Deacon, without Appealing to the Synod: The Dr. has pointed us to no particular place of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where this is found: And upon Supposition of what is clearly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posible in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, anent the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> their Deference, and Entrusting the Execution of some Censures, to the <hi>President-Bishop,</hi> who had then obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, such a Minut-Matter, as the Chastising of a Deacon, might well fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compass of the then <hi>Bishops</hi> Deputed Authority, which will abundantly Salve this Expression, from Wounding <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> Essential Interest, in Censures and Government. Besides, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> owning so clearly,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58203:64"/>
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi> Essential Interest. both in <hi>Ordination</hi> and Censures, in the above-mentioned Epistles, <hi>viz.</hi> 33.58.75. compared with 12. and 46. doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince, he owned no such <hi>sole Authority</hi> of the <hi>Prelat,</hi> as the Dr. alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; Which is correspondent to the Testimony cited of <hi>Tert. Apol. advers. Gentes, cap.</hi> 39. <hi>Ambrose Epistola ad Siagrium.</hi> Considering further, the Smallness of the Charge of <hi>Prelats,</hi> in the first Rise of the <hi>Episcopus Praeses,</hi> who had their Charge, confined oft to little <hi>Dorps</hi> or <hi>Villages,</hi> and that the Pronunciation, or Execution of Censures or Sentences, was, in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the then <hi>Bishops,</hi> appropriat unto them, by the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> who still retained an Essential Interest in Cognoscing upon the Cause. The forementioned fifth <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> which mentions the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Communion by <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Province, and by the <hi>Bishop</hi> from the Congregation, and the Convention of <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Province, for Cognoscing upon the Cause, if Dubious, doth no Whit favour the Dr's Conclusion, of a Spiritual <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> wholly Seated in the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Radical Authority, being still, in the Presbyters, or Consistorial Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Pastors.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Peculiar</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as distinct from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the Dr. tells us, is;
<q>
                     <hi>To Confirm the Baptized,</hi> which, after their Instruction in Christian Faith, was always performed by Prayer, and Laying on of Hands,<note place="margin">P. 446.</note> upon which, the Party Confirmed, received the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Tho, upon the first Institution of this Imposition, extraordinary Gifts followed, as of Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet, <hi>saith he,</hi> it was not therefore intended as an extraordinary Ministry, to cease with those extraordinary Gifts, no more than Preaching, attended with those extraordinary Miraculous Operations. The Function it self, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cease, no more than that of Preaching; Because the extraordinary Gifts and Effects are gone, and Christ promising a continual Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit to his Church, he must be supposed to continue it, by this Ministry of Prayer, and Imposition of Hands, and the ordinary Operations, the same way, that extraordinary were. Hence the Apostle puts the <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> in the same Class, with <hi>Baptism, Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. and makes it one of the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it must be intended for a standing Ministry in the Church.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall easily grant to the Dr, that in the beginning of the Gospel, and in the first Apostolical Times of the Christian Church, there were sometimes extraordinary Effects, and Efficacy of Gifts, attending the standing Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Functions, which are to be continued in the Church, and the Duties of Prayer and Preaching: As also, that we have in Scripture, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified the Gifts of the Spirit, attending the Imposition of Hands; As likewise, that there is an ordinary Communication of the Spirits Gifts
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58203:65"/>
and Graces, in and by Christs Instituted Ordinances. But all this is far remote from the Point in Question, and reaching the Dr's Assertion and Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That Christ hath Institute <hi>Confirmation of the Baptized,</hi> after Instruction, by Imposition of the Hands of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as his <hi>sole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi> and in the Capacity of an Officer, superior to a <hi>Pastor,</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Persons further Confirmation in the Faith.</q>
Any, with half an Eye, may discover, that this has no imaginable Connection, with what the Dr. here offers.</p>
               <p>As for that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. it hath no Shadow of a Proof of what he brings it for. Its true, there has been several Comments given of that Clause of [<hi>Imposition of Hands</hi>] but none of them, favours the Dr's Fancy and imagined Sense. Some have taken it, to be meant of a Ceremony ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to Baptism it self, for a Sign of Blessing and Consecration to God. Some have taken it, saith <hi>Diodat,</hi> for Laying Hands on such <hi>Catechumeni</hi> as had been Baptized, for Confirmation of their Faith, or as a Badge of Renewing their Covenant, in Order to Partaking of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: See <hi>Pool.</hi> 2. <hi>Vol.</hi> on the place. Certain it is, the Laying on of Hands, was either for Healing Diseases, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.8. Or Communication of Blessings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13, 15. Or Communication of the Gifts of the Spirit, to such, as were separat to Gods Service, in the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6. and 17.6. and 13.3. So 19.5, 6. Hence, some under this Expression, take in all the Spirits Gifts, whereby we are Renewed, Increased, Strengthned and Built up to Life Eternal. See <hi>Pool. Annot.</hi> The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, understand it of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, in the Primitive Church, imparted to Believers in general, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16, 17. And especially, in the Institution of Ministers, in the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. Where this <hi>Laying on of Hands</hi> is attribute to the <hi>Presbytrie.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> takes this Clause of <hi>Imposing Hands,</hi> to import a Description of Persons, to be instructed, in the other Fundamental Principles, but to be no Principle it self. He also holds, that in those days, it did commonly accompany, or immediatly follow Baptism, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.14, 15, 16. and 19.6. Withal, he shews, that when Baptized Children, gave an Account of their Faith and Repentance, which others had done before they were Baptized, they were admitted to the Communion of the Church, <hi>the Elders thereof, Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hands on them, in Token of their Acceptation, and Praying for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the Faith.</hi> (An Account of this Matter, given also, by many of the Learned) He distinguishes a fourfold <hi>Imposition of Hands.</hi> The 1. Peculiar to our Lord, in Way of Authoritative Benediction, as when he owned little Children, to belong to his Covenant, he laid his Hands on them. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16. The 2<hi>d.</hi> In Healing of Diseases Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously, <hi>Luke</hi>

Now, that none of all these, comes home to the Dr's Strained Exposition of such a Ceremony or Ordinance, peculiar to a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in the Sense he has offered, is evident beyond all contradiction: For, taking it to import the Spirits Work, in a Figurative Allusion to this <hi>Imposition,</hi> or for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Imposition, I mean in the Ordination of Pastors; In both Senses, it quite rejects the Dr's Gloss; And even taking it in the most favourable Sense to his Scope, <hi>viz.</hi> To import an <hi>Imposing Hands</hi> upon, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Baptized, either at Baptism it self generally, or upon the Adult, who were Baptized, it is beyond all contradiction, that in this case, it was joyned with that Sacrament, and consequently performed by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator of that Ordinance: Or admit, that it was an <hi>Imposing of Hands</hi> upon Baptized Children, sometime after their Baptism, when grown up, to give an Account of their Faith, before their Admission to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the very Nature of the Action it self, doth evince, that in its purer and Primitive Practice, and before Clogged with Additional Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the thing was performed, by the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church: And the Dr. cannot shew, either from Scripture, or pure Antiquity, that this was peculiar to a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his Cut and Mould. Again, it is a strange and most unaccountable Notion, to assert, that such as have Authority to Preach the Word, and Administrat the Sacraments and Seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in special Baptism, whereby Persons are to be Discipled and brought to Christ, (which was the great Commission of the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) should notwithstanding have no Authority to Administrat such an <hi>Appendix</hi> of Baptism, and Confirming Rite, as this is supposed to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That such, as have Authority to lay the Foundation, can put no Hand to such a supposed Superstructure: Nay, that such as have Authority to dispense the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that great Sealing, Faith-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Ordinance, have no Interest in the Administration of such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming <hi>Ritual,</hi> as this is.</p>
               <p>Besides, in the 3<hi>d.</hi> place, it is easie to destroy the Dr's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his own Notion and Pleading:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> He pleads,
<q>That tho the extraordinary effects of Gospel Administrations be ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet such Functions and administrations continue, as are means of the Spirits ordinary influences, Gifts, and Graces; since our Saviour has promised to the Church, a continual Communication of his Spirit.</q>
Now, dare the Dr. deny a continual Communication of the Spirit, in and by the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments? If these be to continue, and for the great ends of Conversion, Confirmation, and grouth in Grace, and in the Hands of <hi>Pastors,</hi> as the proper Authorized Dispensers of these
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58203:66"/>
Ordinances, which are the Ministration of the Spirit, by what Shadow of Ground, can the Dr. seclud them from any interest in this his Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit?
<q>He tells us, that Christ now Communicats ordinary Operations in the same way, that he did the extraordinary:</q>
And he will not deny, that he did Communicat the Extraordinary, by the Word and Sacraments, concredited to all Ministers, I mean in the external Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and why not also the ordinary by the same Persons and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers?</p>
               <p>Again 4<hi>ly.</hi>
                  <q>The Dr. adds this his supposed strong proof, and corroborating Argument,<note place="margin">P 447</note> especially (saith he) considering, that this laying on of Hands is placed by the Apostle, in the same Class with Baptism.</q>
Hence I subsume, if in the same Class, it must be so, as a Principle of the Doctrin of Christ, as Baptism is (so he calls it) and as having the same Authority with Baptism, as an Ordinance of Christ, and a mean of dispensing the same influence of the Spirit; And if so, how will the Dr. Assign a Shadow of Distinction, as to the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrators,</hi> and make it appear, that two Ordinances of so near a Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and both Acts of the Power of Order, of such an Affinity in their nature and scope, should so vastly differ in <hi>the Instruments of Administration,</hi> that the one is peculiar to the Office of Apostolat, and a Succeedaneous <hi>Prelat,</hi> Forsooth, the other not, but may be Administat by a <hi>Pastor.</hi> He tells us, "The Apostle put both Ordinances in one Class; but the Dr. in this, crosses the Apostle, and sets up, in this respect, <hi>Confirmation</hi> in the higher Class.</p>
               <p>Here, I would offer to the Dr. or those of his Perswasion, <hi>Amesius</hi>'s Answer to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Argument, for this Right of <hi>Bishops:</hi> One of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for the Divine Right of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and of <hi>Bishops,</hi> above <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> is— [<hi>Soli Episcopi, ut Ordinarii Ministri,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Bishops</hi> only, as Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers, can Confirm the Baptized, as also Consecrat Temples and Altars, Citing, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Amesius</hi> returns him thus the <hi>Protestant</hi> Answer — [<hi>De Consecratione Templorum — non laboramus,</hi> &amp;c] We value not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of Temples and Altars, whited Walls, may be the sole Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craters of Walls and stones; but for Confirmation of the Baptized, in so far as it seems to have any thing of Divine Right in it, and is thus lookt upon, it doth equally agree to <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>: This saith he, may be sufficiently proved from the Canon Law it self (<hi>Dist.</hi> 95.) and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by this Reason of <hi>Ierom,</hi> what is greater than Christ, or what may be preferred to his Body and Blood? He adds in Answer to that of <hi>Act.</hi> 8. that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58203:66"/>
of this Answer, with what is above offered. We may adduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Venerable Countryman of his, <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Answering the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> Pleading for this Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> from this Text, tells the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>That the Apostle means no Sacrament, much less Confirmation after Baptism, but by a <hi>Trope</hi> or borrowed Speech (a <hi>Metonymia adjunctis,</hi> as he calls it) the Ministry of the Church, upon which, Hands were laid; which appears, <hi>saith he,</hi> in that, whosoever believes not, that there ought to be a Ministry, by Order,, to Teach and Govern the Church, overthrows Christianity, whereas if <hi>Confirmation</hi> of Children, were a Sacrament, as it is not; yet a Man holding the rest, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of it, might notwithstanding, be saved.</q>
Upon this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Cartwright,</hi> we may very probably Conceive, that the Sense, he gives of that Passage, is the General Sentiment and Judgment of <hi>Protestant</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in his Day: And to this Scope, we find many of the later <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Divines expound it, as might be easily made appear. I need not add, how obvious it is, that the Drs. Opinion and Gloss, hath no small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the hardning the <hi>Papists,</hi> who make <hi>Confirmation</hi> a Sacrament.

From whence he inferrs, that therefore this Ministry of <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> appertained to Apostles, since <hi>Philip</hi> a Preacher, a worker of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, a prime Deacon, and if we may believe <hi>Cyprian,</hi> an Evangelist, and one of the Seventy Two, would not presume to assume it, but left it to the Apostles.</q>
I <hi>Answer</hi> in general, these Texts are, by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines and Interpreters, understood of the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts of the Spirit, and the apparent extraordinary signs thereof, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the imposing of the Apostles Hands, which in that time and Case of the Church, was a proper Badge of the Apostolick Office; and therefore, can have no force, to prove an ordinary standing Ordinance, appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at to ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi>; Since in this Case, the proper sole end of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the forementioned special effect, which is not now to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and also the persons acting, did therein exercise an extraordinary fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Authority, as Apostles. Hence this singular Gift, at this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, can no more be pleaded, as laying a ground for the standing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58203:67"/>
duty of ordinary Officers, than Anointing with Oil, by the Apostles, which had the Miraculous effect of healing, at that time.
<q>Upon the First Text mentioned by him, the <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines do shew, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Holy Ghost, upon the laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghost, presently after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest.</q>
And their Prophecying, is by <hi>Diodat.</hi> exponed accordingly, of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural evident Divine inspiration. To the same Scope, it is exponed, by the <hi>English</hi> Annotators. And indeed, the Text it self, makes it so evident, that none can call it into question, and considerable it is, that they all paralel this place with that <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place, tells us, that [<hi>Baptizati erant ab alio Christiano, sed Deus ad commendandum munus Apostolicum, non ante iis Spiritus sui dona communicare voluit quam Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica manus eos tetigisset</hi>] Thus also <hi>Simplicius, Camero,</hi> and <hi>Piscator</hi> Epones this effect of the Imposing of the Apostles Hands, with reference to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary influences of the Spirit. Again, in the fourfold premised Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> mentioned in the New Testiment, we find only, that the <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Pastors,</hi> is that which hath a clear standing Warrand and design; the other three mentioned, having an extraordinary end, not to be now expected.</p>
               <p>But further to urge this, the Dr. says,
<q>That tho the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary effects are ceased,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 446.</note> yet the ordinary institut means of the Spirits influences remain.</q>
Now, as to this Point of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles imposing Hands upon the <hi>Samaritans</hi> (the Passage, which the Dr. mainly insists upon, and improves) I would fain know, if he will deny, that these <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> upon their professed Faith and Conversion, which in many of them, no doubt, was real, had not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit, in his ordinary gracious influences? If they had, then, the the Apostles imposing Hands thereafter, he must grant, was either, with a special respect to the forementioned Miraculous evidences of the Spirits Seal, or it was useless, and to no purpose at all. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>v.</hi> 14. of this <hi>Chap.</hi> Do shew,
<q>That the Apostles were sent to settle convenient Order in this Infant Church, and strengthen them;</q>
And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not merely, for the end of Imposing Hands, as the Dr. alledges; and upon <hi>v.</hi> 15. mentioning the Apostles praying that they might receive the Holy Ghost, they do thus Paraphrase it, <hi>namely in a visible and Miraculous manner, as often happened in this Church, Act.</hi> 10.45. and 19.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.27. <hi>for otherwise they had already received the Holy Ghost, seeing no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, without the Holy Ghost, Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Diodat.</hi> to the same Sense, understands the Holy Ghost here, of the <hi>external and Miraculous evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his Grace. Pool Annot. vol.</hi> 2. thus Paraphrases <hi>v.</hi> 14. as pointing out the Apostles Confirming the Doctrin, and constituting a Church, in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58203:67"/>
                  <hi>Samaria,</hi> by Apostolical Authority. And the Clause of <hi>receiving the Holy Ghost. v.</hi> 15. they expound of these extraordinary Gifts of Tongues, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, working of Miracles, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.45. And upon that Clause, <hi>v.</hi> 16. [<hi>for as yet he was fallen upon none of them</hi>]
<q>They shew, that it is plain, the Holy Ghost, is not here meant, as the Author of saving Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; For so, he was fallen upon all that did believe, Faith being the Gift of God, but he was not yet bestowed, as the Author of <hi>these extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts,</hi> mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Piscator</hi> upon this 15. <hi>v.</hi> Shews, That the Spirit given here, does not denote Sanctification, or Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Grace, but the extraordinary Gifts of Tongues and Prophesie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as appears from the use of this Phrase, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.45. and 19.6. As also from this, that these Gifts were conspicuous to <hi>Simon.</hi>
                  </q>
The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Hands, mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 17. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> understands in the same Sense [<hi>non Denatat,</hi> saith he, <hi>dona interna Gratiae Sanctificantis atque confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantis, omnibus piis collata, sed dona extraordinaria aliquibus duntaxat exhibita</hi>] And <hi>v.</hi> 18. which mentions <hi>Simons</hi> seeing this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Holy Ghost, is Interpreted of his seeing by this visible sign of the Gift of Tongues, pointing out the Spirits inward Operation. So <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi> and out of him, <hi>Corn. a Lapide.</hi> From all which, it is evident, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Dr's Pleading. 1. That this <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was not the sole end, for which the Apostles were sent to <hi>Samaria.</hi> 2<hi>ly.</hi> that there was no need of it, in order to common Gifts of the Spirit, or an ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the Faith thereby. 3<hi>ly,</hi> That this Action of Imposing Hands, was a special Badg of the Apostolick Office, and that therein was put forth, an extraordinary Apostolick Official Power, competent to no Ordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer. 4<hi>ly.</hi> That it was put forth, and exerced at this time, in order to such a transient <hi>extraordinary effect,</hi> as is not now to be expected, since, in that Infant state of the Church, it did respect the Confirmation of the Doctrin of the Gospel, the Confirmation of Believers, and was to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attestation of the Apostles Mission and Authority, in this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner. All which, cuts off the Dr's design and Pleadings from this Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And whereas he alledges, that an Extraordinary effect, at that time, will not prove the Ordinance it self, to be ceased, no more, than Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sometimes attended with such effects.</q>
I <hi>Answer,</hi> when the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or mean, is in Scripture held out, with respect to ordinary standing Effects, as Preaching has for its great end, the Faith, Conversion and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Hearers, till all the Elect are brought in, this is true; But when the mean or Action, is in its Circumstances, found to be solely, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to an extraordinary end, not to be now expected, and to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by persons in an extraordinary Office, as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Badg thereof,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58203:68"/>
this doth cast the scales, and shews the Action, not to be imitable, nor to found, warrand, or exemplifie an ordinary standing Duty.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Dr. adds,
<q>That tho <hi>Philip,</hi> was a Worker of Miracles,<note place="margin">P. 447.</note> yet this Action of Imposing Hands upon these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, was not performed by him.</q>
It is <hi>Answered,</hi> Suppose he did Work Miracles, yet in this Case and Time, for the greater Honour of the Apostolick Office, and the Glorious Confirmation of the Gospel Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by them, who were Honoured to be its first Heraulds, and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sealed with the Spirit, for this great End, God would, upon these grounds, have this reserved to them, who (as we have heard above) were sent to settle convenient Order in this Infant Church, further to strengthen Believers, and to give this Church its fit Organick Frame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel Rules.</p>
               <p>I shall not stand to improve an Argument, some would be apt to bring against the Dr's Pleading, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Ceremony, as described by him, seems to encroach upon the Rights and Nature of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptism: Only, it is worthy of our Observation, which <hi>Cartwright</hi> brings against the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> upon <hi>Act.</hi> 8.17. Pleading for the Sacrament of Confirmation, he tells them,
<q>That they are justly Charged with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the Possession of the Holy Sacrament of Baptism, which Sealing up unto us, not only the Forgiveness of Sins, but also, both the Burial and Mortification of the Old Man, and the Resurrection and Quickning again of the New Man; And in a Word, the whole Putting on of Christ: It is manifest, that this Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which Vaunts it self of Strength and Courage given thereby, to the Vanquishing of the Devil, makes Forcible Entry upon the Due and Right of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament of Baptism.</q>
He adds,
<q>That our Lord, in his Care, to bring the Gospel Sacraments, to as small a number, as might be, must be supposed, rather to Seal many Promises with one Seal, than one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, with many Seals, or one and the same Promise with two Seals.</q>
How far this Pleading of Judicious <hi>Cartwright,</hi> strikes at the Sinews of the Dr's Argument, upon this Head, is obvious enough. To this I shall add a Testimony, or two, which fully confirms our Pleadings, in Opposition to the Dr. on this Head: The one is, of the Professors of <hi>Saumer (De</hi> 5. <hi>Fals. Dict. Sacrat. Thes.</hi> 7. P. (<hi>mihi</hi>) 242. [<hi>Si impositio manuum in eum finem instituta fuit, ut Donorum miraculosorum collationem comitaretur, cessantibus illis Donis cessa re ipsa debuit. Et si soli Apostoli ea virtute praediti fuerunt, ut Spiritum illum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculosorum Donorum autorem fidelibus communicarent, debuit in eorum personis sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistere manuum imponendarum potestas</hi>] Thus they, in Impugning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Confirmation</hi>: Adding,
<q>That as the Apostles had no Command in this Point (as is most probable) so, if they had, the Scripture is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58203:68"/>
purposely silent of it.</q>
For which they, give this Reason [<hi>ne ritum istum cum Sacramentis, quorum institutionem nobis disertissime tradidit, perperam confun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deremus</hi>] The next Testimony, is of <hi>Turretin,</hi> (<hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>quaest.</hi> 31. <hi>De</hi> 5. <hi>fals. Sacram. P. (mihi</hi>) 615. <hi>Par.</hi> 5.6.) When he is offering Reasons against this Bastard Sacrament; his First, touches the Action or Ceremony it self, thus [<hi>primo,</hi> saith he, <hi>quia non habet institutionem Divinam, ne— quidem ut sit, nedum ut Sacramentum dici possit</hi>] that there is no Divine warrand for the Action and Ceremony it self, <hi>Viz</hi>: of Imposing Hands, upon the Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a Bishop, as he has formerly discribed it, far less, that it ought to be esteemed a Sacrament. His Fifth Reason is thus. [<hi>Derogat Baptismo: quia juxta Doctrinam Pontificiorum, sequitur Baptismum non efficere nos plane Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianos, cum tamen jam ante Baptizati in nomine Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti, in communionem ejus admissi simus, &amp; per Baptismum Christo inseramur— sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in baptismo non dari Spiritum Sanctum ad robur &amp; augumentum gratiae; quasi baptismo non obsignetur nobis gratia Spiritus Sancti corroborans, aeque ac sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>] Which is in Summ, that Justifying, Sanctifying, corroborating Grace, being Sealed up in Baptism, this Ceremony encroaches upon its Nature, when obtruded as a Sacrament. And thereafter (<hi>Par.</hi> 6.) As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting, that the very Rite it self, cannot be shown from Scripture, he thus Answers the Objections taken from <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15. and 19.6. which are our Dr's grand proofs [<hi>Apostoli quidem adhibuerunt <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> seu manuum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positionem</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 8.15. &amp; 19.6.) <hi>Sed cum id factum constet invisibili dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satione Spiritus Sancti pro Ecclesiae nascentis conditione, &amp; quidem ex promisso Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ali, clarum est ritum extraordinarium, eoque temporarium solum fuisse, cujus usus una cum aliis miraculis desiit</hi>] Adding upon the Text further, in Confirmation of this.
<q>1. That the Spirit, in this extraordinary manner, to those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Baptized, consequently such as were made partakers of his common operations, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16. 2<hi>ly.</hi> That the Spirit is said <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>illabi &amp; irruere. v.</hi> 9. Which is proper to the Spirit of Prophesie, not of Sanctification; as also, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44.46. He is said to fall upon them, so that they spoke with Tongues: Adding, that it is not unusual in Scripture to represent extraordinar and invisible Gifts, by the name of the <hi>Spirit</hi> simplely, as <hi>Act.</hi> 19. doth prove against <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Spalatensis (de Repub. Lib</hi> 5. <hi>bap.</hi> 5. <hi>Num.</hi> 10.) proves from a multiplicity of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, that for several Ages, the Ceremony of Confirming, was a Ceremonial Rite of Baptism it self, not distinct from it.</q>
Remarkable is that of <hi>Ierom adversus Luciferianus,</hi>
                  <q>That <hi>Confirmation</hi> by the Hands of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> is a Ceremony belonging to Baptism [<hi>Ita tamen,</hi> saith he, <hi>ut ne que necessaria sit, neque quicquam illa per se spiritualiter efficiat, sed quod ei a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam tribui solet ut det Spiritum Sanctum, id totum perfectissime haberi in solo Baptismo, lege tamen Ecclesiastica eam adhibére propter solum honorem quendam
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58203:69"/>
externum Episcopalis Dignitatis</hi>] So, that in stead of any Spiritual use, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> makes it an empty Badg of <hi>Episcopal</hi> vanity.</q>
The Learned <hi>Bucer,</hi> in his Censure of the Book of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, doth at Large shew, the unsuitableness of this Ceremony, to the ends for which it is pretended, or the supposed Primitive Patterns. And we find it largely paralelled, by <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> with the <hi>Popish</hi> Confirmation, both in respect of the supposed Grace which it gives, the Sign, and the Words adhibit therein, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrator thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> (<hi>mihi</hi>) 358.359.360.361. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) who also gives proofs from Antiquity, that this was not alwise reserved to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> even when this Ceremony had obtained in the Church; Thus P. 363. <hi>Cyprian Epist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Iubajanum,</hi> asserts the Custom of offering such, as were Baptized, to such, as he terms <hi>Praepositi,</hi> in order to their Prayers, and laying on of Hands with Prayer: That by <hi>Praepositi,</hi> he means in general, the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church, and not the <hi>Bishop,</hi> is clear by many Passages of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> particularly <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. and <hi>Epist.</hi> 69. <hi>Par.</hi> 4. where he calls the Successors of the Seventy Disciples, <hi>Praepositos,</hi> as well, as these of the Apostles: So, likewise <hi>Epist.</hi> 62. <hi>Par.</hi> 1. and <hi>Epist.</hi> 65. <hi>Par.</hi> 4. Thus also <hi>Epist.</hi> 21. <hi>Par.</hi> 3. The <hi>Confirmation</hi> he speaks of, in the First Passage Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that used in the Apostolick Church, for the giving of the Holy Ghost, for which, he Cites <hi>Act.</hi> 8.14. This is further noticeable of Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, viz.</hi> That he shews, that <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was not given, but only to such, as were <hi>ad Ministerium Ordinandi,</hi> and was not given <hi>ad Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem, sed ad Dona extraordinaria.</hi> See <hi>Answer</hi> to the Principles of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prianick Age, P.</hi> 53. who also Cites <hi>Piscator, Beza, Grotius,</hi> as thus Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Passage Controverted. <hi>Festus Hommius, Disput. Theolog.</hi> 46. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. Having shown, that the Apostles used this Ceremony of <hi>Imposing Hands,</hi> for Confirming their Doctrin, by visible and Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit, adds. [<hi>Haec Dona, quia ad tempus tantum in Ecclesia viguerunt, bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eque ut Ecclesiae non amplius hoc modo necessaria, cessarunt, etiam ritus ille eum in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>debet servari, nec potest adhiberi</hi>] And <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. speaking of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable custom of the Primitive Church, that the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Youths, and <hi>ineunte adolescentia,</hi> were presented to be <hi>Confirmed,</hi> it was by Exhortation and Prayer; and for this end, they were presented, says he, <hi>Ecclesiae Pastoribus,</hi> and dismissed with a Blessing.</p>
               <p>The Dr. holds this Ministry of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> (P. 446.) to be performed by Prayer, and laying on of Hands; <hi>The Party Confirmed, receiving the Gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And what Gifts, I pray, were they, which the Dr. Asserts, were alwise conferred by this Ceremony, and (as he expresses it) <hi>received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>? Sure, not the ordinary Gifts: For, he will acknowledge these receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the Sacrament of Baptism; The Extraordinary, he Acknowledges are ceased: And if neither Ordinary, nor extraordinary Gifts, are thereby
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58203:69"/>
conferred, I know not what the Dr. can make of it, unless he make it, a sort of adjutory, further Confirming, Symbolical, ritual Accessory to the Sacrament of Baptism, and a renewed Representation and Seal of the same priviledges, as are Sealed thereby; And then it should seem, it is brought within the stroak and reach of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Arguments and Reasons against the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> above rehearsed; and that it falls within the compass of such a vain and ludicrous sign of <hi>Episeopal</hi> vanity, as is above expressed. <hi>Ierom,</hi> in the forementioned Epistle, <hi>adversus Luciferianus,</hi> thus lashes this supposed prerogative of the <hi>Prelat,</hi>
                  <q>That if not by a necessity of Law, but for the Honour of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Office, the Spirit is given, their Case is to be Lamented, who in little Villages, or remote places from the <hi>Diocess,</hi> have been Baptized by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and prevented by Death, before the <hi>Bishops</hi> visit. <hi>Beda,</hi> expresly upon <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. ascribs this to vanity.</q>
And <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> (<hi>Instit. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19.) thus lashes the <hi>Papists,</hi> that so many of their Flocks, being deprived of this supposed necessary <hi>Confirmation</hi> [<hi>patiuntur in suo grege Semi-Christianos, quorum imperfectionem mederi facile erat</hi>] they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many of their people, to be but half Christians, whose imperfection, they may easily remedy. And how far this is applicable to the Dr's Case, I need not stand to subsum.</p>
               <p>Its true, the Dr. doth not in express terms, call it a Sacrament, yet seeing P. 447. he holds it is by Divine warrand, <hi>placed in the same Class with Baptism,</hi> and made one of <hi>the Principles of the Doctrin of Christ,</hi> and in his sense, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed still to continue, as a standing Ministry, for Communication of the necessary influences of the Spirit; Its left to the judicious to consider, whether it fall not clearly, within the compass of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Reasons, and of others above rehearsed, as inferring its unlawfulness, and in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, an appeal is made to the Judicious, to ponder, how the appropriating of this Ceremony to a <hi>Bishop,</hi> for the great ends mentioned, can come within the compass of these <hi>Fundamental Principles of the Doctrin of Christ,</hi> without the Knowledge and Belief whereof, there can be no Salvation. The Dr. I must needs say, advances not only <hi>Prelacy</hi> it self, but this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed priviledge of <hi>Prelats,</hi> to an high pitch, in this Reasoning.</p>
               <p>For what he adds of the Character and Quality of <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> and of <hi>Cyprians</hi> Opinion, of his being one of the Seventy two <hi>Disciples</hi>: Whether he he was Deacon or Evangelist, it is all one in this Case, since the Action here performed by the Apostles, was proper to them, upon the Grounds already Assigned; and the account of their approach to <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> after this begun Ministry of <hi>Philip,</hi> is so represented by <hi>Protestant</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as wholly overthrows his pleading, and Razes it to the Foundation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For, What the Dr. alledges, anent the constant Exercise of this supposed priviledge of <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </note> in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church.</q>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:58203:70"/>
As he has produced no Testimony of either <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> in proof of this, but only wraps up the Matter in a Confident general; So, he is forc't immediatly in the next words, to make a sort of Retraction, telling us,
<q>That in later Ages, there are Instances produced, of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that <hi>Confirmed.</hi>
                  </q>
But least he should seem to fall foul upon his large Assertion immediatly premised, he must needs lenify this, and mix Water with his Wine, adding,
<q>That they <hi>Confirmed</hi> only in the <hi>Bishops</hi> absence, and by his delegation; and that it was in the later Ages.</q>
We see these Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable <hi>Lords,</hi> became at last, Liberal, in parting with some Prerogatives, admitting such as could only perform the mean Service of Baptizing, to the High <hi>Episcopal</hi> Dignity of <hi>Confirming.</hi> But the Account we have given of this Matter, sufficiently discovers his unsoundness, and prevarication in this Point, and that as the Practice he pleads for, had never any warrand from Scripture, or prime Antiquity, so, what <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> might have been practised in a supposed conformity to the Apostles Pattern, was performed by the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Church.
<q>And therefore, in opposition to the Dr's <hi>fair Conclusion</hi> (as he calls it P. 448.) that this <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> or <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was Peculiar to the Apostles in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and their Successors, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the continuation of it.</q>
We may in the Confidence of Truth, oppose this <hi>Antithesis,</hi> or Counter-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; That the Apostolick <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which he instances, was so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Apostolick Office, and so appropriat to extraordinary expired effects, as therein the Apostles could have no Successors: And that their Successors, in all the necessary duties and Offices of a Gospel Ministry, are the Faithful <hi>Pastors,</hi> labouring in the Word and Doctrin, to whom, as the Apostles committed, what was in their Office, ordinary and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be continued in the Church, So, upon such Principles and grounds, in such a manner, and for such an end, in their Doctrin, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Churches, as does quite overthrow, the Hierarchical <hi>Prelat</hi> he Pleads for, as no Plant of the Lords Plantation.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Examin in the better Method, what this Dr. produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, against us, it is fit, that we First view, what he represents as our <hi>Assertion,</hi> and which he boldly Charges with <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Novelty,</hi> and as one of <hi>those Opinions never heard of, for</hi> 1400 <hi>Years after our Saviours Incarnation</hi>: It is thus, <hi>That we affirm our Saviour hath appointed his Church, under the New Testament</hi> (<hi>whether</hi> Provincial, National, <hi>or</hi> Oecumenick) <hi>to be Governed by the several Classes of Presbyters, acting in a perfect</hi> Parity, <hi>and owning no Subordination to

                     </gap>lesiastick Senate, above a</hi> Presbyter, <hi>in the modern and current Notion of the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I mainly desiderat here, is. 1. The term of [<hi>several Classes</hi>] appears obscure, not pointing at the Beautyful Order and Subordination of Judicatories, which we maintain according to the Nature of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, consequently of Church Government. The <hi>Classes</hi> and <hi>excerp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Classes,</hi> is an invidious, independent term: We own the <hi>Congregational</hi> Church represented by the <hi>Pastors</hi> one or more, with the Congregational <hi>Eldership</hi>: The <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> a Judicatory Superior to this, made up the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Congregations,</hi> together with <hi>Ruling Elders</hi>: The <hi>Provincial Synod,</hi> superior thereunto, consisting of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Several Presbytries,</hi> with <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> in the Precincts of the <hi>Province,</hi> to which the proportioned number of <hi>Presbytries</hi> are <hi>subordinat,</hi> and wherein they are represented: The <hi>National Church,</hi> made up of a convenient number of <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> from every <hi>Presbytrie</hi> therein, to which the <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> are subordinat. Which <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> has been so fully Cleared from Scripture, by many Learned Pens, that he cannot stand before the evidence of Divine Authority, and Reason, offered for the same; And which any, who have Read, may see the vanity of his empty <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> 2 When he tells us of <hi>Presbyters, Acting in a perfect parity,</hi> he insinuats, as if We held no other <hi>Presbyter,</hi> than the <hi>Pastor,</hi> and that all who come under this general Name or Character, have by our Principles, the same interest in Church <hi>Government</hi>; which, if he mean of <hi>Government in its whole Extent, viz,</hi> that Power, which is called the <hi>Diatactick, Critick</hi> and <hi>Dogmatick,</hi> its a gross Falsehood: For, we distinguish an interest in the last, which is proper to <hi>Pastors,</hi> from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the first two, which we allow to <hi>Ruling Elders.</hi> 3. When he tells us, <hi>We own no higher Officer, in the Ecclesiastick</hi> Senate, <hi>above a</hi> Presbyter <hi>in the modern Current Notion of the Word,</hi> he speaks in the Clouds, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, not specifying, what is that <hi>Notion of the Word,</hi> which he calls <hi>Modern and current,</hi> and which we own as of the Divine Appointment and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We hold, that the <hi>Pastor,</hi> labouring in the Word and Doctrin, and to whom is Committed the Doctrinal and Jurisdictional Key, is termed also in Scripture, the <hi>Elder</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and that he is the highest ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church Officer of Divine Appointment; and this with the Body of <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches and Divines. We also hold, that the Scripture points out an <hi>Elder</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that <hi>Rules only,</hi> and is inferior to the <hi>Labourer in the Word and Doctrin,</hi> as having no interest therein; and <hi>this Notion of the Word</hi> we hold, and can make good to be the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as well as <hi>Modern Notion.</hi> If this Dr. in calling it the <hi>Current Notion of the Word,</hi> intend that which is the general Sense of Divines, he seems here to Charge them all with <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> and <hi>Singularity,</hi> since all, who hold this Notion of the Word, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58203:71"/>
understand the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in the Sense above exprest, must needs own him to have such interest in Government, and the same Authority, which we Assert: And therefore, Cross to the Dr's Notion, which he is not pleased directly to specifie.</p>
               <p>The Dr. without distinction, or setting up his discriminating March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones, as to the extension of time, calls the days, wherein this <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Presbyter</hi> is become current, <hi>dayes of Separation and Singularity, differing in this from the Uniform Testimony of Antiquity;</hi> And the Critick has here much to say, in proof of his Charging with <hi>Singularity</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> and <hi>a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Separation from the Uniform Testimony of Antiquity,</hi> the whole Body of Reformed Churches and Divines, since in their Confessions, and the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent usage of their Writers, they thus understand and make use of the term <hi>Presbyter.</hi> As also, that upon other grounds, he Charges them, with <hi>Singularity</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> since he calls these dayes such, absolutely, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from this particular Cause: And what dangerous Consequence, this Doctrin is of, and how highly reflecting upon the Churches, will sute his serious, second, and more sedat Thoughts, when in a better frame and humour.</p>
               <p>The Dr. adds, That, <hi>in this we differ from the first</hi> Presbyterians <hi>among our selves, who Declare in their</hi> Confession <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>that all Church Policy is Variable, so far were they from Asserting an Indispensible and Unalterable Right of</hi> Parity. But, in this, he has Abused his Reader, and any that but reads that Confession, may easily discover his Impudent Forgery and Imposings: For, <hi>First,</hi> In the ninteenth <hi>Article</hi> of that <hi>Confession,</hi> Assigning the Notes of the True Church, they present these three, (1.)
<q>The true Preaching of the Word of God, as he has revealed himself, in the Writings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. (2.) The right Administration of the Sacraments, annexed to the Word and Promise, to confirm it to our Hearts. (3.) <hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline, uprightly Ministred, as Gods Word prescribes,</hi> whereby Vice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and Vertue nourished.</q>
And giving Instance of this in particular Gospel Churches, they add,
<q>Such were in <hi>Corinthus, Galatia, Ephesus,</hi> and other places, wherein the Ministry was planted by <hi>Paul,</hi> and were of himself named the <hi>Churches of God,</hi> citing on the Margine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.1. where <hi>Paul</hi> ownes them, and names them as Churches; and to prove they had a Ministry and Ecclesiastick Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline planted therein, they further cite, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.9, 10. and 20.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pointing us to <hi>Pauls</hi> last and farewel Charge to the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi> wherein he entrusted the Government thereof to them, as the <hi>only Bishops</hi> thereof, set up and Authorized by the Holy Ghost: And such a Church, they profess the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church in this Realm to be.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this Account of the <hi>Confession,</hi> it is evident, 1. That in the Sense
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58203:72"/>
of our first <hi>Reformers,</hi> Church Government and Disciplin, rightly Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, is an Essential Mark of the Church. 2. That it must not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mens Invention, or Rules of Worldly Policy, but according to the Prescription of the Word of God: Thus, clearly asserting, that the Word of God, prescribes the <hi>Rules and Measures</hi> of it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently determines, <hi>what Government and Disciplin</hi> it is, else there could be no Appeal to that Rule. And look, as, they make the Word of God, the Standart and Rule of the <hi>true Doctrine,</hi> in the first Note, so, of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government,</hi> in this third: Hence, as, none can, without extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest Impudence assert, that the Word leaves us to Waver, and at an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, as to the true or false Doctrine, or that it is not perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles, Appealed to, in that first Note, so, without the same Impudence, neither can this be alledged of the <hi>Discipline or Government</hi>; anent the Rectitude whereof, and its Divine Measures, the same Appeal is made. 3. When exhibiting Scripture In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, they mention a <hi>Ministry established by</hi> Paul <hi>in the Churches,</hi> and <hi>in special, such a Ministry</hi> or Eldership, as had <hi>the Government established and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them, in a Parity of Pastors,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> gave them his last Charge, to Feed and Govern joyntly, as the <hi>Bishops</hi> set up by the Holy Ghost, they clearly assert the Divine Warrands of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Parity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> for that Passage, which the Dr. takes hold of, in <hi>Art.</hi> 21. (which he durst not point his Reader to, as knowing that the very Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would discover his Forgery) that which they affirm, is thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<q>Not, that we think any policy or Order in Ceremonies, can be appointed for all Ages, times and places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Its evident, that it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejects his absurd gloss, and impertinent groundless inference: For, 1. They are not speaking of the <hi>Species and form of Government,</hi> but of these things, <hi>which Councils has a Power to determin in,</hi> yea, peremptorly affirm, <hi>that they have no Power or Authority to make that to be Gods Word, or the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation thereof, which was not so before, by his Holy Will,</hi> and by clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that no <hi>Councils</hi> can alter or change that Ministry and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in</hi> Art. 19. <hi>They affirm the Apostles established.</hi> 2. Having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Confutation of Heresies, and giving a publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, according to the Word, as one great. design of General <hi>Councils,</hi> they assign the Second, which <hi>is to Constitut good Order and Policy, to be observed in the Kirk,</hi> that all things be done decently, and in Order, citing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order</hi>: Wherein <hi>Paul</hi> prescribs this general Rule to be applyed to the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of that Church— Then they add,
<q>Not that we think any Policy and order in Ceremonies, can be appointed for all Ages, Times,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58203:72"/>
and places</q>— Adding,
<q>That when Ceremonies foster Superstition, they ought to be removed:</q>
Wherein, it is evident, as the Meridian Light, that that <hi>Policy,</hi> which they hold <hi>alterable,</hi> is not the <hi>Government of the Church, appointed by the Apostles in the Word,</hi> or that Ecclesiastick Disciplin, therein prescribed: For, <hi>this they make a Note of the true Church</hi>; and to call this <hi>alterable according to the difference of Times and Places,</hi> were so gross a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as no Men of Sense, could fall into, much less the Godly and Learned Compilers of that <hi>Confession.</hi> But, by this <hi>alterable Policy,</hi> they mean, such as Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes to the variable Circumstances of particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and such appointments thereanent, as God has left to the Regulation of the Christian Prudence of Church Governours, according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules of the Word; of which Rules, that instance they exhibit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. hath the prime place. So, that the Dr's Inference, that <hi>therefore, the Authors of the</hi> Confession, <hi>held not an indispensible Divine Right of Parity of Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> has no dependence upon that Passage, which he Cites, nor has any Subsistence, but in his own imagination.</p>
               <p>The Dr. adds (P. 13) <hi>That the First</hi> Presbyterians <hi>pleaded only, that their New Form, was not repugnant to the Oeconomy of the New Testament Church, and Primitive Institution; that it came nearer to the Original Model of Churches</hi>: But never affirmed, <hi>that the Christian Church, by the Original Authority of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and his Apostles, ought to be Governed by</hi> a Parity of Presbyters, <hi>and that no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the Church, higher than a Presbyter, could pretend, to any share in Ecclesiastick Government.</hi> I <hi>Answer,</hi> the Dr. hath not exhibit to us, these <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whom he calls <hi>First,</hi> and who thus pleaded. We heard, that our very First Reformers, Pleads for that Government, they were settling, as a Divine Ministry and Government, according to the Word, and deriving its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Pattern from the Apostles Plantation of Churches, such as <hi>Ephesus</hi> had, when <hi>Paul</hi> gave his last directions to that Church. To which Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Pattern, they hold, that all Churches ought to be squared and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat. And if we advance a step further, to our <hi>Books of Disciplin,</hi> we will find the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of our <hi>Government</hi> Asserted, in most Material Points thereof.</p>
               <p>The Peoples interest in the Election of <hi>Pastors,</hi> in their Call, and in their Admission, is Asserted in the First <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Disciplin, Head</hi> 1. with the Explication.</p>
               <p>In the 7 <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastick Disciplin,</hi> the highest Censure of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, is attributed to the Ministry, as their Duty and Priviledge (not to the <hi>Prelat</hi>) and all Preachers, without exception, are declared Subject to Disciplin; and the Subjection of all Preachers to the Prophets, in their Doctrin, is Asserted in the 9. <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Church Policy,</hi> upon that special Point of Propesying and interpreting the Scriptures. All which, cutts the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58203:73"/>
of the <hi>Prelats</hi> Exercising Power over <hi>Pastors,</hi> Establishing their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Divine Right of Government.</p>
               <p>In 2 <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Discipl. Chap.</hi> 1. The Divine Right of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Policy, is Asserted, and its distinction from the Civil. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness of Ministers, assuming Name or Thing of <hi>Lordship.</hi> Again, The extraordinary expired Function of <hi>Apostles, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> is Asserted. The identity of the <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> Office, as the highest ordinary Function, together with the Relation thereof to a particular Flock, is As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Moreover- <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>initio,</hi> the <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> Office, and Congregational Eldership, are Asserted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> Our Church Judicatories, <hi>Congregational, Provincial,</hi> and <hi>National,</hi> are Asserted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. The Unwarrantableness of the Office of <hi>Bishops Assuming Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over Pastors,</hi> and a Lordship over them, and over Christs Inheritance, is Asserted: And such <hi>Bishops,</hi> as refuse Subjection to the Established Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin and Government of <hi>Pastors,</hi> are appointed to be <hi>deposed from all Function in this Kirk.</hi> Likewise, <hi>Patronages,</hi> as crossing the Peoples Right, in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pastors,</hi> are condemned as a <hi>Corruption of Popery, Chap</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Now, the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> we own, in opposition to <hi>Prelacy,</hi> being thus Asserted in these <hi>Books of Policy,</hi> and in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Compilers thereof, drawn forth from the <hi>Fountain of the Word;</hi> the Model also, presented and described in these Books, amounting to a specifick form of Government, and eversive of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the Compilers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as is said, presenting it as the Divine and Scripture Pattern; they must needs hold it to be a standing Form, appointed by our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Again, if the Dr. hold, that the New Testament Oeconomy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a <hi>specifick standing Form of Government,</hi> and a Standart for all Churches, while time lasts, then such a Form, as with Respect to the main, is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be consonant thereunto, is asserted in so far, to be, not only <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> but <hi>necessary</hi>: And this, the Dr. must needs admit, unless with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> he will make Scriptures themselves, a Nose of Wax, and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments Prescriptions, in Point of Government, and its Oeconomy, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satile, and so Lax and General, that it discovers no Species of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Besides, if these Reformers affirm, the <hi>Pastor,</hi> to be the highest Church Officer, <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and that he is all one with the Preaching <hi>Presbyter,</hi> then by necessary Consequence, they must needs hold, that by Original Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christ and his Apostles, all Churches ought to be Governed, by <hi>a Parity of Presbyters or Pastors,</hi> and that no Ecclesiastick Officer, above a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> can pretend, to a share in Ecclesiastick Government. These Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are of so close and clear a connection, that if the Dr. attempt to cut
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58203:73"/>
this <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot, he will fall into such a shameful Assertion, as to affirm, that an Officer, not allowed by Christ, but condemned by his own Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Authority, and that of his Apostles, has notwithstanding, a share in Ecclesiastick Government. Besides, the dull inadvertency of this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, appears in this, that he holds our <hi>Reformers</hi> did plead, that <hi>their Form was allowable, and not repugnant to the New Testament Oeconomy, and yet not such, as was recommended by our Lords Original Authority to all Churches</hi>: For, if he hold, that the New Testament Oeconomy, is a clear fixed Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart and Model for all the Churches, then, whatever Frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not <hi>Dissonant</hi> or <hi>Repugnant,</hi> is <hi>conform and consonant</hi> thereunto, and consequently, not only <hi>allowable,</hi> but <hi>necessary.</hi> And if our Lords Original Authority prescribed this Oeconomy, as a Standart and Rule for Church Government, in all Ages, that Model that comes up to this First Standart, in so far as it comes up to it, is that which the Church is to imitat in all Ages, unless he will say, that all Ages are not to imitat this <hi>Pattern, shewed upon the Mount.</hi> And in special, our <hi>Reformers</hi> hold, that our Saviour in the Original Prescription of this Pattern, presents the <hi>Pastor</hi> or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as <hi>the highest ordinary Church Officer.</hi> And therefore, it is no rashness to affirm, that in all times of the Church, such an Officer as a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, Superior to Pastors,</hi> is forbidden and Condemned. The Dr. says, <hi>That; tho our Reformers affirm, their Government was not repugnant to the New Testament Oeconomy, they were not so rash as to affirm the Church ought to be thus Governed in all Ages.</hi> So, its with this Grave cautelous Dr, rashness to affirm, that a Government suted to the Divine Pattern, is for all Ages, consequently a precipitant Assertion to affirm, that our Lords Pattern is <hi>the just Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart for all Ages.</hi> The Dr. will be satisfied, <hi>That we plead for our Iudgment in Government (which he calls a</hi> New Notion) <hi>as probable, but cannot endure, that we plead for an absolut infallible Right, and require obedience to it, as due to infallible Authority; This,</hi> he says, <hi>is worse, , than speculative Enthusiasm.</hi> I <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> if we can produce no Scripture Warrand for that Government we own, we shall be satisfied it come under the Character of a <hi>New Notion</hi>; But, if we can make it appear, to be the Government recommended in the Scripture-Oeconomy and Pattern, then, as being founded upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority, we justly challenge Obedience to it; and while this Light is shut out and rejected by the Dr. and his Fellows, they are justly Chargeable, in so far, with <hi>Speculative,</hi> yea, and Practical <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> The Dr's. pretended Rhetorical Florish, whereby he would set off this Charge upon <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> taken from the similitud and allusion to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who should threaten to knock him on the Head, unless he wil affirm, against his Reason and Senses, that he sees such Armies in the Air, as are pointed out to him; Is but a phantastick Flash of his own Airy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58203:74"/>
for we impose nothing Arbitrarly or Imperiously upon his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or any of his way, but challenge the utmost attention, and best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Sense and Reason, to that Scripture-Light and demonstration of our Government, which we offer from the Word, which, had he seriously searched and pondered, with an Eye to God, the Father of Lights, he had been otherwise, and better imployed, than in flinging out such Squibs and Crackets into this Countrey, and in writing his folly and ignorance, in such an Airy Childish <hi>Pamphlet</hi> as this is. He adds (<hi>P.</hi> 14.) "<hi>That it were better to fall into High-way-Mens hands, than amongst such Spiritual Robbers.</hi> But he commits this Robbery upon himself, while shutting his Eyes against that Scripture-Light, which has been offered upon this Point. And he knows, by what numerous cruel Laws, and Barbarous execution thereof, in the late Reigns, he and his Masters, our <hi>Scots Prelats,</hi> endeavoured to knock down the reason and Conscience of many Thousands of this Nation, both Godly and knowing, in an Imperious obtrusion of their ungodly Hierarchy upon them, and many wicked Vows and Oaths for upholding it.</p>
               <p>The Dr. next alledges; <hi>That we vainly boast of a Divine Institution of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and unanswered Writers in its defence, but when put to produce Arguments for it, we have have nothing but perplexed Probabilities, intricat consequences from wrested Scriptures, to offer, contrary to the Uniform suffrage of the</hi> Ancients, <hi>&amp;c. Ans.</hi> what Divine Warrand we plead for the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of the Courts and Officers we own, is so well known to such as are acquaint with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and how solid our Scripture-proofs are, and consonant to the Sense, both of Ancient and Modern Writers, that this Mans flanting boast, can make no other impression upon them, than of his procacious vanity. Had he intended as a Champion indeed for his Cause, to Fight, not to bragg, in this Pamphleting Bragadocio, which any may see to be <hi>ad pompam, non ad pugnam,</hi> he should have fairly and formally encountred <hi>Ius Divin. Reg. Eccles. Ius Divin. Minist. Evang. Smectym.</hi> with its <hi>Vindication.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baynes Diocesan Tryal,</hi> in Answer to <hi>Dounham. Didoclav. Cap.</hi> 4.

               <p>But now, that we are come to the Point, the Dr. (P. 15.) tells his Friend, <hi>That he can give but a short History of our Arguments, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Parity</hi>: And good Reason; since he is for little slight Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, not for the Shock of more close and dangerous Encounters.

Presbyterian <hi>Government and</hi> Parity <hi>of</hi> Pastors, he should have done well, to name the <hi>Authors,</hi> who assert this, ere he had so confidently ascribed this Assertion to <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> No doubt, had he dealt fairly, in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Condescendance upon our Arguments drawn from Scripture, for <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and offered clear Scripture Replies to them, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would have thanked him, for his Diligence, in endeavouring their further Light and Conviction on this Head. But to prevent his Mistake, or any else of his Perswasion, I must further add, that, as for <hi>the Argument from Antiquity,</hi> however he and his Party do magnifie it, stuffing their Books and Pamphlets therewith, instead of more solid Scripture Reasoning: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, we are not afraid to try their Strength, in this Method of Arguing, yet <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or the <hi>Testimony of Humane Writers,</hi> is none of the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon which we do build the <hi>Ius</hi> and <hi>Divine Right</hi> of the Government we maintain, but the Lively <hi>Oracles,</hi> the Scriptures of Truth allenarly: And we look upon the Testimony of Antiquity, or of Ancient Writers, as an Accessory Humane Illustration, in some Matters of Fact, but no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proof, or to be ranked <hi>in eodem genere,</hi> with the first, and as tending to refute the Charge of <hi>Novellism,</hi> wherewith the Dr. and his Fellows, are bold to asperse our Principles in this point.</p>
               <p>The Dr. now falls upon the first <hi>Head</hi> of Arguments, taken from a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>express Command of our Saviour, anent the Parity of Pastors, exclusive of the Iurisdiction of a Bishop</hi> (I heartily wish, he had here, specified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined this Jurisdic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> It is apparent in the premised paralell Texts, that the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Ambitious Emulation among the Disciples, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rulers, to Exercise Lordship and Dominion one over another, in Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto, Commending Humble Ministerial Service, and Spiritual Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in their Stewardship; both which he enforces from his own Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Humility. Hence, we infer, 1. That our Lord discharged Superiority and Inferiority among Officers of the same kind, so, that none are greater than another in their Office, no Apostle, no Evangelist above another; that a compleat <hi>Parity</hi> in their Official Power, is commanded: And therefore, by clear Consequence, a compleat and entire <hi>Parity</hi> among <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>; And by further clear evidence, we argue, that superior and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Degrees among them are discharged. 2. That whatever <hi>Priority of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> be allowed among Officers of different kinds, we conclude, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in these places, discharged <hi>Dominion and Principality,</hi> in any of them, of whatever kind, <hi>all Masterly Power,</hi> such as Civil Governours Exercise; There being <hi>one Master</hi> of his Family only, whereof all <hi>Ministers</hi> are <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Servants</hi>: Because, in Exemplifying what he dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, our Saviour gives the Instance, in such Rulers, as are called <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> or <hi>Gracious Lords,</hi> and in Opposition thereunto, Commands an <hi>Humble Ministerial Service,</hi> not a sort of warrantable Dominion, as the paralell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. makes it evident. So, that, he gives here, the <hi>Lord-Prelat,</hi> two Deadly Wounds, (1.) In that he makes himself an Officer of an higher Order and Degree, than the <hi>Pastor,</hi> holding himself, to be a <hi>Pastor,</hi> speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically distinct from the Preaching <hi>Presbyter</hi>: Thus Dividing and Cutting out the Pastoral Office, into Antiscriptural, Distin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In that he Lords over his Brethren and Fellow-Pastors, and that both, in a pretended Spiritual Capacity, arrogating a sole Power in Ordination and Jurisdiction, a Masterly Power and Principality over Church Judicatories, and likewise, in assuming the Earthly Lordship, Place and Grandure, which is expresly here discharged. Now, if from what is said, it be evident, that such an Office and Officer is discharged, the <hi>Prelats</hi> Office is unlawful. and an Official <hi>Parity</hi> in the <hi>Pastoral Office,</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded. And that it may appear, that this is no Novel or distorted Exposition, let us</p>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place, view what Patrons it hath. To begin with the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Divines upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.21. they shew, that the Occasion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, was the Apostles Ignorance of <hi>the Condition of Christs Kingdom,</hi> to which they were called <hi>viz.</hi> Not to <hi>a Worldly Rule,</hi> but to <hi>Serve</hi> and <hi>Suffer.</hi> And upon <hi>v.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they shew, that all who are called to the Ministry of the Church, are discharged a Worldly Rule. Upon <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. they assert a Lordship and Worldly Power to be forbidden; paralelling this with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. which discharges a Lordship over Gods Heritage. The <hi>English
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58203:75"/>
Annot.</hi> on the place of <hi>Matth.</hi> shew,
<q>That the Lord, to appease their Contention, told them, they were not to expect <hi>Worldly Greatness and Dominion</hi> in following him, and whoever usurps this, affects that which God has not given — that they were to look after a Life of <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Labouring,</hi> not <hi>Lording,</hi> citing 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.</q>
And though, in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sense, they assert, there are Orders among Ministers, generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, <hi>viz.</hi> Apostles above Evangelists, Pastors above Elders, yet the Prohibition of all Worldly Power to Ministers, they do here assert, and whatever Power is opposit to a <hi>Laborious Service and Ministry.

<q>That our Saviour bespeaks the Apostles, as Ministers, shewing, that they ought to place their Dignity, not in <hi>Worldly Lordships,</hi> but <hi>Humble Faithful Serving</hi> for the Salvation of Souls.</q>
And that our Lord discharges Worldly Greatness, as inconsistent with his Spiritual Kingdom, in that passage of <hi>Matth.</hi> is asserted by the Authors of <hi>Pool's Annot. part.</hi> 2. who also, upon <hi>Luke</hi> 22. do assert,
<q>That our Lord discharges Ministers to Exercise a Dominion or Lordship, such as is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Not as being Lords over Gods Heritage,</hi> citing also 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. where <hi>Paul</hi> disownes a Dominion.</q>
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> upon that place of <hi>Mat.</hi> shews,
<q>That it is not a <hi>Civil</hi> only, but <hi>Ecclesiastick Dominion,</hi> which is here forbidden, or a Lording over the Church, as <hi>Peter, saith he,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> not to Lord over the Flocks committed to them: Joyning as paralell to this 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. where <hi>Paul</hi> useth the simple <hi>Verb</hi>

He shews, that our Lord Reasons from the Condition of the Apostles, who were not to be <hi>Lords,</hi> but to <hi>Teach,</hi> to be Subject, to Serve the Church. 2.

Whittaker</hi> Answering <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Glossings upon this Text, to save the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, tells him,
<q>That comparing <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> together, and considering that <hi>Luke</hi> uses the Simple, not the Compound Word, in expressing the Dominion, which is dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, would have his Disciples understand, that they have nothing to do with Dominion:</q>

                  </q>
                  <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. he shews,
<q>It was not the <hi>Ambitious Affectation,</hi> but the <hi>Power and Dominion it self,</hi> which the Lord discharged, opposing to it, and commending in its place a <hi>Simple Service and Ministry.</hi>
                  </q>
And <hi>Thes.</hi> 6. He shews,
<q>That the Question among the Disciples, was not about a <hi>violent Domination,</hi> or <hi>violent Ways of obtaining it,</hi> but the <hi>Lordship</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> it self, which he simplely dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; proving it from <hi>Lukes</hi> using the simple <hi>Verb.</hi> And that passage, <hi>he

that will be great,</hi> he shews, is to be understood, not of a <hi>Real,</hi> but <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Affected Greatness.</hi>
                  </q>
He also shews, that Christs Reasoning from his own Example, <hi>Non argumentatur a pari, sed a majore ad minus,</hi> argues not from a sameness, but from the greater to the less — <hi>If I your Lord, do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and serve, much more ought you, who are indeed Servants, who have no Iurisdiction over one another, to lay aside all Thoughts of Domination,</hi> as when he said, <hi>if I your Lord, have washed your feet, you much more, Ioh.</hi> 13.14. He after, reasons this same point, from Christs discharging them to assume <hi>Masterly Imperious Titles,</hi> shewing them, that there is but one Master in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shall I add, what <hi>Iunius</hi> has upon this Text against <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> Glosses, <hi>de Pontificat. Lib.</hi> 1. Our Lord said of <hi>the thing it self, they Exercised Dominion</hi> — He spoke not of the manner, after this or that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner — but <hi>not so ye,</hi> saith he, its a simple denyal of the thing proposed. <hi>Bernard</hi> Writing to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> expones this passage, and of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. as strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against all <hi>Dominion,</hi> and enjoyning a <hi>Ministerial</hi> Care in Opposition thereunto. And <hi>Whittaker</hi> on the passage, tells <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that its not <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in Dominion,</hi> that is here enjoyned, but <hi>Dominion it self,</hi> is forbidden. Let us add <hi>Cartwright</hi> against the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> upon these passages, who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at large, that its not Ambition nor Tyranny, but the Dominion of great Ones over their Vassals and Inferiors, which is here forbidden, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in this, the <hi>Ecclesiastick Office,</hi> differs from the <hi>Civil,</hi> that it admits not of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Principality,</hi> as the Civil Government, nor the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pomp and Superiority thereof. And the Argument from Christs Example, he thus expones, in Opposition to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Glossings and Scope, <hi>It doth not follow,</hi> saith he, <hi>that because Christ their Lord and Master, had Rule over them, therefore, they being Fellow-Servants, should have Rule one over another, but it follows rather, that for as much, as he their Lord and Master humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the basest Service, therefore, they should be ashamed to be Lords and Masters over one another</hi>: Thus, saith he. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alledged by <hi>Gratian (Distinct.</hi> 10, <hi>quoniam id vid.)</hi> expones this place, <hi>Not of Pride and Ambition — but of the several Acts and distinct Honours betwixt both the Powers.</hi> And upon the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.24. he asserts against the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> that <hi>Majority and Superiority among the Apostles was reproved simplely, not a Tyrannous Affectation of Rule.</hi> We might multiply <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers to a Voluminous Bulk, upon this Head. For <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>'s Sense upon the place, I need not mention them, these are the Dr's Adversaries; Only I must notice their Correspondence with the Body of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, in this Sense and Account of the place exhibit. Yet I must add one <hi>Novelist</hi> more, <hi>Chamier de Oecum.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58203:76"/>
as <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Whittaker.</hi> But now it is time, to return to the Dr.</p>
               <p>From what is premised, it is no hard Matter to discover the Vanity of his Evasions. <hi>First,</hi> He tells us, p. 17. <hi>That our Lord supposes Degrees of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination among his own Disciples, as in other Societies; And therefore, directs Ecclesiasticks, who would climb to the highest places o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Church, to take other Methods than these used by the Grandees of the World; he that deserves Preferment in the Church, is to be Servants of all; So that this refers to the Method of Promotion, not to the Extirpation of their Iurisdiction: They were not to aspire to Dignity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by Force and Violence, and the Arts fashionable in Secular Courts, but by Acts of Modesty, Humility and Self-Denyal. Ans.</hi> 1. For what he says of Christs supposing Degrees of <hi>Subordination;</hi> If he mean it in general, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Church Officers, its admitted; If among the Disciples, or these here Addrest, in this Speech of our Saviour, he Beggs the Question, and Contradicts the Sense and Pleading of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, upon this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, who (as we have heard) do hold that Majority and Superiority among them, was here discharged, and a compleat Parity of Official Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enjoyned. The Clause, <hi>Not so among you,</hi> we heard that <hi>Turretin,</hi> with others, do hold absolutly to discharge this supposed Inequality of Power and Dominion, which he proves from the Nature of the Phrase, collated with Paralells: And we have also found, that <hi>Pareus</hi> (as might be cleared in others) do extend this, even to an <hi>Ecclesiastick Superiority.</hi> 2. If the Dr. draw this Supposition of degrees of Subordination, from that Clause, <hi>He that will be great and chief,</hi> as is evident he doth; Then I Charge him First, With Crossing the Sense of Sound Divines, upon that Text, who in Pleading against the <hi>Papists,</hi> tell them, that our Lord said not, He that <hi>by my Allowance is great,</hi> but he that <hi>will be great.</hi> I confess, some do understand here a true Greatness, <hi>viz.</hi> in Vertue and Reward, a true Ministerial Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; And this Sense also baffles the Dr's Gloss of an <hi>External Greatness,</hi> the Unsoundness whereof, further appears, when we ponder what our Saviour enjoyned, in Opposition to the Worldly Grandure discharged, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>their Servant,</hi> over whom this is affected, which is further evident in the Alternative Branch of the Paralell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. whereby Sound Divines do clear and expone this Text: For, that which the Apostle opposes to, <hi>being Lords</hi> (the thing prohibited) he expresses by, <hi>being Examples to the Flock,</hi> importing an Holy, Humble, Ministerial Service. Again, I do Appeal to all Men of Sense, who understand this Controversy, whether the Dr. doth not in this Answer, stand upon the same ground with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, (de Pontif. cap</hi> 1.) in Defence of the <hi>Papacy</hi>: His Answer is, that a <hi>Primacy</hi> is not here discharged, but rather supposed, since our Lord says, <hi>he that will be chief, &amp;c.</hi> And that therefore, an Ambitious Lust of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling, is here only prohibited, such as is among the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58203:77"/>
Whittaker</hi> Answering <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> quarrels him, as Abusing and Wresting the Text, since, instead of admitting <hi>Dominion it self,</hi> to be discharged (as he makes evident, and even out of <hi>Bernard</hi>) the <hi>Iesuit</hi> holds, that Ambitious Affectation only is forbidden, the <hi>Modus Rei,</hi> not the Object, the Manner of Seeking, not the Thing it self, and that he admits the prohibited Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, with the supposed or pretended Qualification of <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>: And if the Dr. sayes not here the same, let any Judge by his Words; For, he tells us, that such as would <hi>climb up to the highest places in the Church,</hi> (and who knows, how high these <hi>highest places</hi> mounts in the Dr's Fancy; None will doubt, to a <hi>Metropolitan</hi>'s Office at least, over a whole Nation: For this he ownes) <hi>must not take Methods of Force and Violence, as usually Worldly Grandees, but advance by Acts of Modesty,</hi> &amp;c. So, that in the Dr's Sense, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s, the <hi>Popes</hi> Mitre is never touched by this Text, it being the <hi>Modus Rei,</hi> the Manner of Seeking and Affecting, not the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>highest Places and greatest Dignities,</hi> which our Saviour here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. Nay, the Dr. in this Pleading, stands so Antipode to <hi>Protestant</hi> Arguments, that he fixes the <hi>Popes</hi> Mitre faster, which I prove thus; If that which the Contest was about, and the desire of it was Lawful <hi>in the Object,</hi> then a <hi>Primacy</hi> was Lawful in the Object, and only the Method of Seeking Discharged. The debate among the Disciples, was, who should be the <hi>Chief,</hi> and have the highest place in the Church under Christ; And the Dr. says, <hi>This Climbing up to highest places in the Church, is in it self a Lawful practice, flowing from a Lawful desire and emulation, so that a Man set his Steps right, and climb regularly</hi>: And will any <hi>Papist</hi> deny this? who knows not that their Writers Condemn many <hi>Popes</hi> violent and bad Methods to get into the Chair? The Dr. tells us expresly (P. 17) that the Text refers only to the <hi>Method of Promotion:</hi> And if so, then by infallible consequence not to the <hi>Promotion it self,</hi> tho even extended to a National, yea or Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick <hi>Primacy</hi> (as is said) If any object, that the Dr. holds, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment was to be in the Church, and that the person aspiring is enjoined to be <hi>Servant of all,</hi> so, that it is neither a Civil, nor Ambitious Grandure, which he allows: I Answer, <hi>Papists</hi> will allow the First, and <hi>Popes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Second, even to be <hi>Servus servorum Dei,</hi> while he Possesses his <hi>Primacy</hi>: And the Dr. holds, its such a Service of all, as can consist with the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> Mitre, or a National <hi>Primacy</hi> overall; And upon this supposition, I would whisper the Dr in the Ear, what if in the disposal of Supreme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the whole Christian Church should be confined to that Nation, or the Nation extended to the Limits of the whole Church, what is then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of poor simple <hi>Protestants</hi> Pleadings from this Text, against an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Patriarch,</hi> or <hi>Primacy,</hi> over the Christian Church? The Dr must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and disown these, as Novel Glosses and New Opinions of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58203:77"/>
One reflection more, I add upon the Dr's Answer, and do Charge him with Sophistical Shuffling and Confounding the Terms and State of the Question. When the Controversie was Stated among the Apostles, which of them, should be <hi>Chief and greatest,</hi> and have a <hi>Primacy</hi> over all the rest, in Christs Church and Kingdom, and when our Saviour bespoke them, in the terms above exprest; the Question is, what that was, which our Lord in this reprehension did Discharge, and what in the positive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, he allowed? In Answer to this, the Dr. holds, that that which the Lord Discharged and prohibit, referrs only to the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Seeking</hi> and affecting, not to the <hi>Object it self:</hi> For, he tells us, <hi>The Text referrs to the Method of Promoti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, even to the highest places.</hi> Now, this is exclusive, it referrs not then to the Object: And what was that Object, I pray? The Text says, it was, who should be <hi>Chief</hi>: But when the Dr. Represents, what this prohibition reaches not unto, and is allowed, (for he holds, that our Lords words, contain a negative Prohibition, and positive Precept) he thus Represents it; <hi>That our Lords words, refers not to the extirpation of their Iurisdiction;</hi> which is as far a leap from the Point, as any can be. Their Apostolick Jurisdiction was never the Question, but an absolute <hi>Primacy</hi>; and none were ever so brutish, as to imagin, that the Prohibition, did in the least reach, far less, tended to extirpat the same. But the Dr. behoved to hide the other Branch of the Question in the Clouds, and was ashamed to speak it out, which yet the sequel of his reasoning doth, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Negative precept, reaches only to the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Promotion</hi> to a <hi>Primacy</hi> or <hi>Supremacy</hi> over the Church, not to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> or <hi>Supremacy</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>The Dr's next <hi>Answer (P.</hi> 18.) resolves in a Question: <hi>If the Apostles understood the Lords Precept in our sense, how came they to exercise Iurisdiction over all subordinat Ecclesiasticks, during their Life, in all the Churches, they planted? Did they cross our Lords Institution, who perfectly understood his meaning? Ans.</hi> I might here retort his Question and Answer, in a Counter-query. If the Apostles understood our Lords Precept, in his Sense, as prohibiting only, an <hi>ambitious violent manner of aspiring</hi> to Principality or Chief places in the Church, but not the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> how came it, that none of them, in such <hi>Modest Method,</hi> as he prescribs, sought that <hi>Greatness</hi> or <hi>Chief Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>? Were they Frighted from the Lawful use of their Jurisdiction, which the Lords prohibition touched not? Were they so Brutish, as not to reach his meaning? yea, whence was it, that in their Doctrin and Practice they disown all dominion, and Prelatical Principality in the Church, and all outward grandure and greatness, as inconsistent with their Office, and the Office of all Gospel Ministers? But to the Topick and ground of the Dr's Argument, I <hi>Answer</hi> directly, that the Apostles, as they understood,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58203:78"/>
so they practised our Lords Precept, in the sense we owne. 1. In that they practised a compleat <hi>equality</hi> of <hi>Official Power</hi> among themselves. This I hope, he will not deny, or if he do, its easie to set all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines in pursuit of him. 2 In that they never exercised, nor attempted to seek any <hi>Civil Greatness</hi> or Dominion, such as the <hi>Prelats</hi> he pleads for, do own as competent to their Office. They knew, that their Lord, when but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to give advice in a Civil Cause, gave this return, <hi>who made me a Iudg?</hi> And declined the Imployment. And that therefore, neither they, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Successors, were to be <hi>Civil Counsellors,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Peers,</hi> in Parliaments and Princes Courts. 3. They disown all <hi>Dominion</hi> in one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi> over <hi>another,</hi> and discharged it earnestly: Thus the Apostle <hi>Peter, to be Lords over Gods Heritage,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. Thus also <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> affecting a Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, is rebuked by the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi>: And <hi>Paul</hi> owns himself, and other Apostles, as <hi>Stewards only</hi> in the House of God, and disowns a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> as we have heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> As for <hi>their Iurisdiction over subordinat Ecclesiasticks,</hi> which is the <hi>Substratum</hi> of the Dr's great Answer and Question, I do deny: <hi>First,</hi> that they exercised any <hi>Episcopal</hi> Jurisdiction, properly taken, over them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> such a Jurisdiction as did Cross this Precept: The Proof of both these, will fully discover the vanity of the Dr's Second <hi>Reply</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>First,</hi> that the Apostles exercised no such <hi>Episcopal Authority</hi> over Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks, or Churches planted, as the Dr. pleads for, is evident thus. 1. Their Apostolick Authority connected with their Infallibility in Teaching, reached to prescrib Duty to the Members and Officers of Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently was <hi>cumulative</hi> thereto, not <hi>privative</hi> thereof, which appears in their enjoyning the exercise of Spiritual <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> as inherent in Church Officers, as Excommunication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And their owning a Spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction and Authority in <hi>Pastors,</hi> both in the designations of <hi>Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, Overseers, Bishops,</hi> attribut to them; As also, in their frequent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the Peoples obedience and subjection to them, as in that capacity <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.3. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12.2. The Apostles did not as the <hi>Prelats,</hi> invade the decisive Power of <hi>Pastors</hi> in Government, but took along their decisive Votes and concurrence, as we find in that <hi>Council Act.</hi> 15. where its evident, that in every Point, the Elders or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, conccurred with the Apostles, in the Disquisition, Sentence, and decretal Letter. 3. As the Apostles planted Churches with <hi>Pastors</hi> or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Presbyters,</hi> instructing them with Authority to Feed and Rule, as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> or <hi>Rulers,</hi> set up by the Holy Ghost, so they committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches to them, in their last farewells, without the least hint of <hi>Super-institut Officers</hi> of an <hi>higher Order:</hi> So, that the Apostles instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <hi>Pastors</hi> with such Authority, commanding its exercise, enjoyning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58203:78"/>
the Churches obedience to them, exemplifying and Authorizing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in highest Judicatories, yea, making even Evangelists, as <hi>Timothy,</hi> pass through the Door of <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Ordination, in order to the exercise of his Office; Not to insist upon, even Apostles submission to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative Imposition of the Hands of Prophets and Teachers, when sent out upon a special Gospel Legation: To which we may add, the Apostles owning <hi>Pastors,</hi> as <hi>Brethren, Fellow-helpers, Fellow-Labourers, Co-Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders.</hi> It follows inevitably. (1.) That as to the <hi>Perpetual Pastoral</hi> Charge, the Authority of Preaching the Gospel, the Administration of the Sacraments and the appendent Jurisdictional Power (which by the Apostles Doctrin, is a Lower Step to this, and connected therewith) they own the <hi>Pastors</hi> or Preaching <hi>Presbyters,</hi> their <hi>Equals,</hi> and their proper <hi>Successors</hi> in this <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Authority,</hi> consequently the ordinary Church Officers of the <hi>highest Order,</hi> to whom they committed the Keys of Doctrin and Disciplin. (2.) That the Exercise of their extraordinary Apostolick directive Power and Authority, which they could not divest themselves of, while alive, did no whit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the standing Authority of <hi>Pastors,</hi> nor did it includ any Jurisdiction properly over Churches, constitut and Moulded in their Organick being. By [<hi>Iurisdiction properly</hi>] I mean such as is of a standing necessity, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Churches Edification, in all times, or such a Jurisdiction over Churches, as may be supposed paramount unto, or privative of the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictional Authority of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and of Organick Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Apostles exercised no such Authority over the Churches, as did cross our Lords Precept and Prohibition, is evident, in that. 1. Our Saviour discharged <hi>Imparity</hi> among Church Officers of the same kind, and therefore, this could not impeach the Apostles Authority over ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers. 2. Our Lords instructing them with such a measure of the Spirit, as was sutable to the First founding of the Churches, and with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as his living and infallibly inspired Oracles, to plant Churches, and the Gospel Ordinances and Government therein: Unless the Dr. will say, that our Lords Precept did cross and contradict his design, he must needs ackdowledg, that the Apostles in exercising this directive Power and extraordinary Authority, over ordinary inferior Officers, could not cross this his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and Prohibition, they being our Lords immediatly called, infallibly inspired, and extraordinarly Gifted First Messengers, in order to this end. Thus we have seen the vanity and insufficiency of the Dr's <hi>Second Answer.</hi> But there is no end of Vanities.</p>
               <p>The Dr's <hi>Third</hi> Answer, is Prefaced with a very big and high Flown swelling boast. <hi>That which,</hi> he says, <hi>baffles and exposes our Argument to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purposes, is, that our Lord did that himself among them, which now he Commanded them to do one to another; And the doing of this, one to another, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58203:79"/>
to his Command, could not infer a</hi> Parity, <hi>unless we Blasphemously infer that Christ and his Apostles were equal: For, our Lord recommends, what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins from his own constant and visible Practice among them, that he their Lord and Master was their Servant: And therefore, it became the greatest among them, to be Modest, calm and humble toward their Brethren, which would qualify them for Ecclesiastick Promotions.</hi> This poor and mean <hi>Answer</hi> and Reason of the Dr's, is a notion, for which he is beholden to his <hi>Popish</hi> Masters; And being here subjoyned to such big words, brings to mind, some Poetick Phrases.

                  </q>
There's no doubt, that the Dr. has as much exposed and baffled his own Judgment and Reputation, in this thrasonick weak Answer, as in any thing else. But to the point, First I must tell him, that if this Argument tending to prove from this Text, our Saviours discharging <hi>Lordly Dominion</hi> in his Church, and inferred from his own exemplary Humility, be bad and fallacious, it has long since deceived the best &amp; ablest of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, in Reasoning against the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Papacy</hi>? And if this his pretended Baffl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Answer be so Mighty and Invincible, as he pretends, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the <hi>Popish</hi> Adversaries, have long since Baffled our Divines Arguments with it; For all know, it is the very same with theirs; And I must add, that it seems, the Dr. is so highly in Love with this <hi>Popish</hi> Notion and evasion, that he has not concerned himself to notice what Baffling Replyes, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Divines have returned to it, wherein they have discovered, what an insipid impertinent evasion it is, to save the <hi>Popes</hi> Mitre, from the stroak of this our Lords Prohibition and Precept; and consequently that of <hi>Prelats,</hi> whereof we have already exhibit some instances. I have told him, that <hi>Turretin</hi> (no doubt, one of our Dr's new Minted <hi>Novelists</hi>) makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Argument from our Lords Example, is an Argument, <hi>non a pari, sed a majore ad minus.</hi> If I your Master, be as one that serves, much more you the Servants, ought to eshew <hi>all Lordly Dominion</hi>: As when he wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Disciples Feet, and thus recommended Love and Humility towards one another, since he their Lord and Master had done so. I know not if it be true, that this Man rode in the <hi>Popes</hi> Guards, but sure I am, he fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fiercely for his <hi>Mitre.</hi> He says, our Saviour did that himself among them, meaning his Exercising a <hi>Principality and Supremacy</hi> over his Church: For, in the Sentence, he puts the Words [<hi>He</hi>] and [<hi>Them</hi>] in Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick distinct Characters, and consequently holds, that what our Lord thus Exemplified, is still to be imitat in his Church. Thus, his Answer and Reasoning, runs clearly to this Issue; <hi>That which I command you, I have done; And therefore, that which I command you, is consistent with a</hi> Supremacy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58203:79"/>
                  <hi>over my Church, which I have Exercised and Exemplified.</hi> And here the <hi>Popes</hi> Holiness, has a fair Plea from the Venerable Dr. If Christ did that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which he enjoyned his Disciples here, then the doing of what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, was consistent with a <hi>Supremacy</hi>: The Connection is clear; Christ as Supreme Head, and in that Capacity, Exercised the same Humility, Self-Denyal, and Meekness, which he here enjoyned. But for more direct <hi>Answer,</hi> I do again tell him, that our Lords Scope, in proposing his own Example, is to Antidote their inward Pride, the Root of this Desire of Unlawful Dominion, and powerfully to recommend Humility and Self-Denyal, as the most excellent Remedies thereof. So, that his first Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment runs <hi>a fortiori,</hi> thus, If I your Lord and Master be as one that serves, and am such a Pattern of Self-Denyal and Humility among you, much more ought you to Study Humility, and to Guard against all Usurped Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Authority, one over another, who are Fellow Disciples and Servants: As he Reasoned, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. If I your Lord, have washen your Feet, much more ought ye to wash one anothers Feet.</p>
               <p>Again, in the Dr's Mould of Answer, I find two gross Points of Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, which hardly any ordinary Capacity, could fall into, if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Person serious, and attending to the Matter in hand, and very ill beseeming one, who sets to his Name, a D. D. and Chartells this whole Church. 1. In that he will needs have our Lords Precept and Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be levelled against an <hi>Ambitious Principle or Design,</hi> but not at all to reach (rather to allow) that <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Expression</hi> thereof, which our blessed Lord, in down right Terms doth prohibit, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Dominion</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Text, and which they were contending about: Thus setting in Opposition, things which are Subordinat, as if the Dr. had forgot the common Maxim, <hi>Subordinata non Pugnant</hi>; And, as if a <hi>bad Principle,</hi> could fall under a Prohibition, and not the <hi>bad Practice,</hi> the Issue thereof. What a Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Conception and Weakness is this? 2. He imagines, that our Lords Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Humility (while Pressing his Apostles, to eshew Unlawful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion one over another) drawn from his Practice, will inferr his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a pari,</hi> and a Supposition of his Equality with them, if we shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Dr's <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of a Warrantable <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi>; An Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination than which, nothing can be more Sottish; the Argument running clearly <hi>a majore ad minus,</hi> from the greater to the less, and the very Basis and Topick of it, supposing and inferring the quite contrary Conclusion and Assertion. So, that the Dr's. Arguing that upon this Ground, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Sensed, we would make Christ and his Apostles equal, has no more Twist of Reason in it, than if one should infer, from our being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted from Strife and Vain Glory, and enjoyned Humility and Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ made himself of no Reputation, and humbled himself to Death,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58203:80"/>
the absurd Conclusion of the <hi>Equality of his Disciples and Members with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> The Dr. gives this Sense of our Lords Words and Argument, in the premised Scriptures; <hi>If I your Lord and Master was your Servant, it becomes the greatest among you, to be Humble towards Subordinat Brethren, which will Qualify you, for Ecclesiastick Promotion.</hi> This carries with it, such a clear Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Warrantableness of <hi>a Greatest or Chief among them,</hi> as I dare promise him, the <hi>Popes</hi> Approbation of his Commentary, it being the very same, with that of his great Champion, <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who tells our Divines, that a <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> is here rather supposed than forbidden, and only Humility in it's Exercise enjoyned. But the Dr's petty <hi>Novelists, Protestant</hi> Divines, have told him, that if this Gloss were true, then our Lord ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inflamed than Quenched their Ambitious Desire of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> one over another, since, Reprehending only the Unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Method of Seeking, he thus Tacitly Recommended the Thing it self, as Lawful and Desireable. But once more, I would fain know of this Dr, whether our Lord did not command an <hi>Equality</hi> or <hi>Official Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Authority Apostolical among the Apostles</hi>? Or, if he thinks indeed, that <hi>one</hi> was allowed to be in this Respect, Prince and <hi>Supreme</hi> over the rest? If he hold this last, then I dare Appeal to all <hi>Protestants,</hi> whether he has not left our Camp, and is in the Tents of the <hi>Papists.</hi> If he owne, that our Lord here enjoyned an <hi>Authoritative Official Equality of Power,</hi> among the Apostles, then I would know, what his Sense is, of our Lords Argument, Pressing and Recommending this Equality, from his own Example; And whether his Assigning this Sense, and giving this Account of our Lords Reasoning, will <hi>Blasphemously inferr, that Christ and his Apostles were equal.</hi> So, that the Dr, must either quite this Sense of our Lords Words, and consequently the Sense exhibit by <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, or acknowledg the Absurdity and Futility of his own Argument and Answer, and that he falls by the Rebound of his own Blow and Weapon. But I am tedious in a Matter of it self plain.</p>
               <p>To proceed therefore: The Dr. (P. 19.) is so taken with the Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Strength of this his Answer, that he falls into a Compassionat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, for his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren, telling his Reader, <hi>That its very sad, that any should be so infatuated, with their new Schemes of Parity, as to alledge such Texts, which if understood, in their Sense, degrades our blessed Saviour, to the Degree of one of his Disciples; For, what he Commanded to the Apostles, he Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed among them himself.</hi> If I were to give Way to such a Retaliating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, as this would tempt some unto, I would Echo it back, in telling him, that its very sad, that a Man, who is bold to Chartell this whole Church, and sets his Name with a D. D. to such a bold <hi>Pamphlet</hi> as this, should (in a pretended Pleading for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and Answering a <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58203:80"/>
Argument against it, in the premised Scriptures,) so betray his Cause, and Proclaim his Folly, as to Charge with infatuation the Body of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Divines, in their Pleadings against the <hi>Pope,</hi> and Support his Mitre, in pretending to plead for <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> As to our Lords practising himself, what was Commanded to them; I have already demonstrat the futility of this Notion, and what an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Reed it is, to support his Conclusion. Our Saviour practised Humility, and called the Apostles to such an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it, as did sute that Humble Ministry he enjoyned them, and was opposit to that Proud Dominion and inequality they were affecting. And this wise Critical Dr. with this his new Sword, will needs cut the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot of the Argument, here made use of by our Lord, when exciting to Humility and Parity, such persons, as are of unquestionable equality, in point of Official Power, denying the Strength of all such reasoning. He tells us, <hi>that what our Lord enjoyned, was</hi> toto coelo, <hi>different from Parity.</hi> And thus, must be antipode, and in the highest Line of opposition thereunto, and consequently a <hi>Primacy</hi>: And this Confirms that which before I Charged upon him, anent his owning a <hi>Primacy</hi> among the Apostles. He says, <hi>They were not to exercise their Iurisdiction, as Lords of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>by a Spirit of Pride and Domination, but in an ingaging behaviour of Charity and Humility.</hi> Yet still the Dr. supposes, their Jurisdiction included a <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Power, one over another; And so here is good sound <hi>Popish</hi> Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines have long since Taught his Reverence, that all Earthly Dominion it self, and worldly Pomp is forbidden, all Greatness and Grandure, whether Civil, or pretendedly <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> and this as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit to the Nature of their Power and vocation, which is a <hi>Spiritual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Service and Ministry,</hi> for the Salvation of Souls; And thus stands in contradiction to all sort of Domination and Lordship. Moreover, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently falls into a pityful inadvertancy, in identifying <hi>Civil Dominion,</hi> with a <hi>Spirit of Pride,</hi> there being a Lawful Commanded Civil Dominion, appointed of God: And if he Object, that the Princes of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> whom our Lord instanceth in, thus exercised it: As the Mould of his Phrase, will not admit of that defence, so, our Saviours instancing such Gentile Princes, as were called <hi>Benefactors,</hi> or <hi>Gracious Lords,</hi> and in <hi>Luke,</hi> using the simple, not the Compound verb, which points at a <hi>Civil Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion simplely considered,</hi> intirely excludes this his subterfuge, and shuts up this postern: <hi>Whittaker</hi> hath long since told him (<hi>De pontif. quest.</hi> 1.) that the word, which <hi>Luke</hi> makes use of, is applyed to denote <hi>Lawful Rule,</hi> and that all the Princes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not such, as did Tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Overrule, or Reign unjustly, and that the Clemency and Justice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, is Celebrat. And both he, and <hi>Iunius (ubi sup.)</hi> does shew, that it is the <hi>Dominion</hi> or <hi>Lordship</hi> it self, not the unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58203:81"/>
                  <hi>Exercise,</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of attaining, which our Lord here Condemns.</p>
               <p>For that which the Dr. adds <hi>(ibid.) of Pauls answering his</hi> Episcopal <hi>Character, when the Care of all the Churches was upon him, in employing his</hi> Episcopal <hi>Power to Edification</hi>: I have already told him of what Nature that Care was, and how it differed from the pretended Inspection and Dominion of <hi>Prelats.</hi> His care of the Churches, was an Apostolick dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Inspection, suted to his Extraordinary Office and Gifts, which no ordinary Officer can pretend unto, and in its exercise, so far from Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying a <hi>Prelatical Dominion,</hi> that both in Doctrin and Practice, he baffles it out of the World, in enjoyning the highest Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi>; as these of <hi>Corinth</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note>, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority to the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in his last farewel to that Church <note n="b" place="margin">

And, if in all these, <hi>he answered his Episcopal Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> (as who will doubt, but he did) and obeyed this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of our Saviour, by consequence, he condemned <hi>the Prelatical Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> so many ways opposit thereto. Besides, he pronounced a woe upon himself, if he Preached not the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. and Preached it in Season and out of Season: Thus enjoyning <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2. And therefore, pronounced a woe upon non-Preaching <hi>Prelats,</hi> who look upon this as no part of their work.

Work, but no exercise of their <hi>Prelatick,</hi> Office and but <hi>obiter</hi> to the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their supposed Grandure. He enjoyned Christs Minister and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, to beware of ingadging in Worldy affairs, if they would please Christ, who has Chosen them to be his Souldiers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. And thus condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Prelats</hi> holding Stat Offices, as pleasers of men, of Princes, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and not of Christ.</p>
               <p>He tells us next (<hi>P.</hi> 20) <hi>That the Fathers of the Church advanced above their Brethren to Ecclesiastick Power, had this Notion of their dignity, that they were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58203:81"/>
the Servants of others.</hi> As for the advancement of Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> we say, that, as the <hi>equality of Pastors,</hi> is Christs Pattern upon the Mount, and that (as <hi>Ierom</hi> expresses it) the Apostolick Churches, were Governed <hi>communi Presbyterorum consilio,</hi> so the First <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> were fixed <hi>Moderators</hi> only, and had no Jurisdiction above their Brethren, and even when this Usurping Jurisdiction above <hi>Pastors</hi> was Gradually Advancing, some of the best <hi>Bishops,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> particularly, owned the <hi>Pastors</hi> as their <hi>Collegues in Government,</hi> and were far from the fastuous Pomp and absolut Dominion of the <hi>Prelats,</hi> whom the Dr. pleads for. And if any of them held this Notion of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dignity, when their Power came to the length of incroaching upon that of <hi>Pastors</hi> in Government, they held but an empty Chimerical Notion, Contradictory to their <hi>Practice</hi>; As the <hi>Popes</hi> Notion of his being <hi>Servus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. (<hi>ibid.</hi>) returns again to his Post, telling us, <hi>That it appears, from what he has said, we have no Shadow of Argument for our new Doctrine, from the Texts above instanced.</hi> Thus the <hi>Protestant</hi> Pleadings therefrom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Papacy,</hi> has no Shadow of Argument with him. But whether our Arguments, or his Answers, be most Substantial, is left to the Reader to Judge, from what is said. He tells us, That <hi>Wallo Missalinus,</hi> Glances at this Text, but lays no great Stress upon it. But the Dr. has not exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit either his Words or Argument; as neither <hi>Beza</hi>'s Reflection upon the Passage, in his larger Notes: Tho he tells us, (as some great Discovery forsooth) that <hi>Beza</hi> holds, That <hi>all kind of Iurisdiction is not here forbidden, but such as is joyned with Imperious Bitterness and Domination.</hi> And what he would make of this, I would fain know. Did ever any imagine, that all kind of Jurisdiction is here forbidden? Did our Lord discharge all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his Church, by this Precept and Prohibition? As for <hi>Beza</hi>'s expressing thus, that which is forbidden, it is evident to any, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with his Writings, that he holds all pretended Spiritual Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is joyned with Domination, or <hi>Lordly Rule,</hi> of <hi>one Pastor</hi> over another, to be a Sinful Abuse of Jurisdiction, and consequently to fall within the Compass of what is prohibited in these Texts.</p>
               <p>I proceed to another Notion and Answer of the Dr's: We are told next, <hi>(ibid.) That the Hierarchy and Subordination of Priests, was establisht by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church: If our Saviour had pulled down that Ancient Policy, and commanded Equality among Presbyters of the New Testament, he would not have stated the Opposition betwixt his Disciples and the Lords of the Gentiles, but between the</hi> Mosaick <hi>Oeconomy and the Disciples of the New Testament.</hi> Here the Dr. obliges us, in affording still more Light, in taking up his Judgment and Principles in Point of Church Government, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Sense, the <hi>Iewish</hi> Policy, by our Lords Warrand, was at this time standing, as the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58203:82"/>
exact Standart and Plat-Form for the Gospel Church Government; And therefore, we need not doubt what he means by <hi>Chief Places,</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> in the Church, and that he holds, that our Saviour did not forbid, but supposed the Lawfulness of a <hi>Chief Rule</hi> and <hi>Principality,</hi> of one Disciple over the rest in the Church. Nay, (P. 27.) he is clear and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive in this, <hi>That that Hierarchy, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whereof was divided in a Supreme and Subordinat Priests, was never abrogated</hi> (consequently stands imitable and imitated) <hi>in the New Testament.</hi> I think the Dr. will find the clearest Pattern at <hi>Rome</hi> of this his Holy Standing Hierarchy. In Answer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I need only say, <hi>That the standing Policy of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abrogat; but continuing as the Measure and Standart of the New Testament Church Government,</hi> is so notoriously known, to be the great <hi>Popish</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the <hi>Papal</hi> Hierarchy, pleaded by all the Antichristian Rabble and Locusts, who stand up for this Monster and Mystery of Iniquity, and so Universally condemned by all <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches and Divines, that there needs no more to Stigmatize a Man, as of that Number, in their Judgment, than such an Assertion. That all our Divines, do hold the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church Policy, is so clear, that it would Load much Paper, but to Recite their Names.

The Extent of the Christian, beyond that of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church. 2. That the High Priest had no absolute Authority over that Church, being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Jurisdiction of the great <hi>Sanhedrin, Deut.</hi> 17.11. 3. That what Authority he had, was Typical of Christs, the High Priest of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. <hi>Wallaeus de Function.

<q>That these things were partly, Typical, partly Political; that there was a Priority of Order here, not an Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

Difference of Power and Authority; that they all Governed the Church by Common Counsel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Abrogation</hi> of this <hi>Ministry,</hi> and that it was to be no Standart for the Gospel Church, I will produce and offer again to the Dr's Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that one Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. — <hi>The Priesthood being changed, there is made of Necessity a Change of the Law, viz.</hi> The Policy suted to the State of that Church, must be changed also. The Text asserts, that the Priesthood, or their particular Frame of Church Officers being changed, or abrogat, there is therefore, a Change or Abrogation of the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Legal Ordinances, respecting both their Worship and Government. <hi>Pool. Part.</hi> 2. tells us,
<q>That this Change referrs to the Expiration of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Order, to which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were not bound; for that a better Priesthood and Law, were to fill up its Room — That the Mutation of the Priesthood, required a Change of the Law — That God determined that both Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Law should expire together.</q>

<q>That the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, was many ways involved with the Legal Dispensation of the Covenant; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Diodate</hi> shews,
<q>That the Priesthood, and all the Ceremonial Worship of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> was to give place to Christs, in whom was accomplished all the Reality and Truth, and he is now both Priest and Law-Giver.</q>
                  <hi>Bilson</hi> (an <hi>English Bishop</hi>) shews the Reason, why that Policy cannot stand under the New Testament (<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Gov. Chap.</hi> 2.) <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was not subject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had its special Governours — That the Books <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus, we have seen, what good Harmony, our Dr. keeps in this his Notion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>But now, to come more closely to his Argument, <hi>If that Policy had bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pulled down, our Lord would, in Commending Parity to Presbyters, have stated the Opposition betwixt the</hi> Jewish <hi>Oeconomy, and that of the New Testament Church, not betwixt his Disciples, and that of the</hi> Gentile <hi>Princes. Ans.</hi> 1. That this Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58203:83"/>
was to end as Typical, with other Typical Ordinances, is made good; And if the Dr. admit, that it was to be removed in any Measure, and as Typical, he stands in so far, upon the same Grounds with us, and is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Answer this Notion, or acknowledge it nought. 2. The Dr. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in his Way of Arguing, Answers himself; He says, <hi>That our Saviour designed to discharge and prohibit, a</hi> Violent Secular Way of Aspiring to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>such as is Fashionable in Secular Courts, and that the Disciples were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to Exercise their Power by a Spirit of Pride and Domination.</hi> And the Dr. will not say, that this was the Method of Attaining Offices in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Policy, or their allowed Practice, God having subjected the same to his own Holy Rules and Measures: And that consequently, what our Lord prohibited, and even according to the Dr's Sense and Expressions, was only and fitly represented by the Dominion of the Princes of the Gentiles, which he holds to be of this Nature, and thus Exercised, and who did not understand Gods Law or Measures, either as to the Attaining or Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Government. But 3. I must tell him, that in Commanding <hi>Parity</hi> among Ministers, (for otherwise, we owne an Imparity and Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, among Church Officers in general) our Lord could not state an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position betwixt them, and the Priests of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such Dominion among them, as he here discharged; As we heard <hi>Wallaeus</hi> assert; None of them had an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Dominion, or a sole Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Suffrage in Ecclesiastick Courts, or such a Negative Voice therein, as the Gentile Princes Dominion did import, and <hi>Prelats</hi> assume and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise. The Learned <hi>Iunius</hi> (<hi>de Cler. Cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Not.</hi> 13.) makes evident, and will inform the Dr, That <hi>par Consortium fuit Honoris, &amp; Potestatis inter Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, sed Ordine impari, qua Familiarum, qua Temporis suspectu, penes concessum Sacerdotem, ex Lege fuit ordinaria Iurisdictio Ecclesiastica.</hi> — That there was a like Share of Honour and Power among Priests, though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Order, partly, in respect of Families, partly, in respect of Times: The ordinary Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction, belonged to the Assembly of the Priests, according to the Law. Hence, we may, by clear Consequence, inferr, that it belonged not (in the Sense of <hi>Iunius</hi>) to the <hi>High Priest,</hi> nor to any of them <hi>solely.</hi> Now, where there was such a well ordered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of Power and Government, among these several Orders of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, it was very unsuteable to Exemplifie such an Arbitrary Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereby, as the Dr. here supposeth, and such a Civil Greatness and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, as the Apostles affected. Besides, the Dr. and we, doth both hold, a Subordination of Courts and Officers, under the New Testament, wherein both Oeconomies were alike, and there being under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Oeconomy, no such Headship and Soveraignity, as is said, the stated Opposition betwixt the two Governments, could not so well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond to our Lords Scope in this Precept and Prohibition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58203:83"/>But finally, the Dr. cannot but acknowledge, that the Distemper, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles now Laboured under, was their Fancy of a Temporal and Earthly Kingdom of our Lord, admitting of Worldly Dignities, and Degrees of State and Honour, as the Kingdoms of the World; which is the Notion, that the <hi>Iews</hi> to this day, entertain of the <hi>Messias</hi> Kingdom, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Literal Sense, the Magnificent discriptions thereof, exhibit by the Prophets. Hence, the People came to make our Saviour a King, and were mainly Stumbled at his Humble and low Estate, and (which is to this purpose very considerable) we find the Disciples themselves propose that Question to him, after his Resurrection, <hi>wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to</hi> Israel? So, that its clear, that the Ambitious affectation of Earthly Grandure, Pomp, and the greatness of this Worlds Potentats, was the distempering Principle, leavening the two Brethren, and which promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to propose to our Saviour the Sute, which excited their Fellow-Disciples emulation against them, and gave occasion to the Precept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate. And hence, the opposition was most fitly stated betwixt the Honour and Offices of Christs Kingdom, and that of the Kingdoms of the World, and Earthly Potentats, and it was needful, that our Saviour, should thus shew the Disciples, the Distinction betwixt his Kingdom, and the Kingdoms of this World, as himself asserted to <hi>Pilate, Ioh.</hi> 18. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Pomp and Corruptions of the Kingdoms of the World, being to continue in after-Generations, and consequently, the tentation thereof, endangering the inflaming of this Ambition in Church Officers: But not the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, now to be abolished; the opposition, which our Lord stated, was most fit, and sutable to his Scope.</p>
               <p>Upon what is here offered, we may see the inconsequence and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of what the Dr further adds, in Confirmation of this his Notion, <hi>P.</hi> 21. <hi>viz: That our Lord did state the opposition betwixt the current Doctrin and his own, when he would direct in better Morals; And therefore, if he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Subordination, and Degrees of Priests, and Established Equality, he would have Stated the opposition, betwixt the Model of the Temple, and that of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</hi> This is no Reason. For 1. We deny that our Lord enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an absolute Parity of Church officers, but among those only of the same kind; he did not forbid all Imparity and Jurisdiction among Church Officers. 2 The opposition betwixt the Tmple-Model, and that of the New Testament, could neither so well sute the Apostles distemper and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor our Lords design in this prohibition and Precept. There was (1) A Subordination and jurisdiction required therein, so in the New-Testament dispensation. (2) Ministers therein, were to attend their Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es diligently, so also, in the New Testament Church. (3) None of them had an Imperious, arbitrary or Civil Rule over their fellow-Priests,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58203:84"/>
and thus it is with Ministers of the New Testament Church. The Moral Law being the constant Standart of Truth and Duty in all Ages, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who came to fulfill all Righteousness, and establish the Law, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerned to vindicat the same from corrupt glosses; but this bears no proportion to his Scope in the Case of the Disciples, that old Ministry and Policy, being now ready to evanish.</p>
               <p>The Dr. proceeds to another Text, and tells his Reader, that we Cite 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.3. to serve the same design. We have made appear, that our design in pleading this and the preceeding Texts, is the same with that of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, and that the design, the Dr. serves in his Glosses and Answers, is <hi>Popish</hi> (as to the <hi>intentio operis,</hi> at least) a design to support the <hi>Popes</hi> Triple Crown, with <hi>Bellamin</hi> and his other pleaders and Advocats. Our Argument from this Text, against the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, is this: Looking to the Apostles scope, he, first, dehorts Ministers (and none will doubt all ordinary Church Officers) from the evils they are constantly tempted to, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetousness, Lordship, usurpation and Dominion over Gods Heritage (evils of a close connection and cognati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that they do not Act the <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> seeking Preheminence over their Brethren, or affect a Masterly Dominion over the People; for that both comes under the Denomination of Gods Heretage, none will doubt. He like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise dehorts from Reluctancy, at their Laborious imployment. Next, there is a positive exhortation presented to Ministers, <hi>viz,</hi> that they be <hi>examples to the Flock,</hi> that is, that the Graces they Preach to others, shine in their Walk, and in special that of Meekness and Humility, which most nearly Resembles their Glorious Master, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, that this appear in their conduct and Government, as that of his, who leadeth Gently, and would not have Ministers to Rule with Rigor, as those Reprehended <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4. Hence from the Scope and contexture, it appears. 1. That the <hi>Pastor,</hi> Labouring in the Word and Doctrin, being here addressed as the Apostles <hi>Co-presbyter</hi> and <hi>Fellow-elder,</hi> is owned by him as the highest ordinary Church Officer, and that this Apostle now shortly to put off his Tabernacle, doth <hi>Aaron</hi>-like, invest him, in his Robe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or highest Sphere of an Ordinary Minister. 2 He enjoyns them to exercise <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority; As also <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ephesus. Act.</hi> 20. which must respect Ordination and Jurisdiction, in the full extent thereof, and their equal interest therein. 3. All of them are discharged to <hi>Lord it,</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise a Dominion over one another, or over the Flock, but to exercise a humble exemplary Ministry. Hence we further inferr against the Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical <hi>Prelat.</hi> (1.) That the Apostle ascribing this comprehensive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>Pastors,</hi> which comprehends both the Doctrinal Key, and that of Jurisdiction; For, I hope, our <hi>Episcopal</hi> Brethren, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58203:84"/>
that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Episcopal Authority</hi> and inspection, includs both, he cuts off the Hierarchical <hi>Prelats</hi> pretended super-Inspection, paramount thereunto. Hence (2) The Pastor being found thus discribed, and installed in this comprehensive Scriptural <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, the Hierarchical <hi>Prelats</hi> Office, which swallows up this Power and Authority of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogats to it self solely, the Name and thing of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is discharged as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. (3) We argue <hi>a minore ad Majus,</hi> against that Office from the Text thus; All Masterly power of <hi>Pastors</hi> over their Flock is discharged, <hi>Ergola Fortiori,</hi> much more that of <hi>Prelats</hi> over <hi>Pastors</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>Now, for the Judgment of <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers, in corespondence to this our Sense, we might exhibit a great cloud of Witnesses, but of the whole, we offer only these few instances. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines make this, 2. <hi>v.</hi> paralel with that which is enjoined <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi>; as to the Authority and exercise of a joynt <hi>Episcopal</hi> inspection, competent to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>: And the 3. <hi>v.</hi> they Translate [<hi>not Exercising Dominion</hi>] the very same thing which our Lord prohibit to his Apostles. <hi>Pool.

               <p>But now, What is the Dr's. great Answer to this Text? He says, <hi>Its the Apostles Commentary upon our Saviours Words and Commandment.</hi> This is very true: He next adds, <hi>That it forbids the Spirit of Pride and Insolence, as a thing very unsutable to all Power and Authority in the Church.</hi> To which I <hi>Answer,</hi> it is certain the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is Paralel with <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. where <hi>Peter</hi> learned the prohibition, and imports Dominion, but not Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical Dominion properly; It being made use of by the LXX. to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Lawful Dominion. 2. We have told him, that the positive part of the Precept, refuts his gloss, which the Apostle doth not thus express in the Dr's. Sense [<hi>not proudly or insolently Domineering</hi>] but <hi>using Dominion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly,</hi> as the Apostle would have presented the Precept, if a Lawful Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship had been allowed, but he adds in the other Branch, in expressing what is enjoyned [<hi>being examples to the Flock</hi>] enjoining thus to Feed by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and an Humble Ministry; And this is opposit to all Dominion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, and doth not discriminat one Dominion from another; as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so evident in the positive part of the Paralel Precepts abovementioned. We have also told him, that the instance and Illustration, drawn from such Princes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as were accounted <hi>Gracious Lords,</hi> and the simple word of Rule used by <hi>Luke,</hi> in the paralel, confutes this Gloss, and doth demonstrat, that it is not <hi>proud insolent Dominion,</hi> or a <hi>Dominion secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid,</hi> and thus qualified, which is only here forbidden, but <hi>Lordship</hi> and <hi>Dominion, simpliciter,</hi> the desire whereof did notwithstanding proceed in the Apostles, from some remainders of Pride, and in their Case, could not be exercised or assumed without a fastuous <hi>insolency,</hi> it being Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposit to the Nature of their Holy Office and Function. So then, I argue against the Dr. from his own Principle and Gloss; If <hi>Peter</hi> thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood our Lords Precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. in this Sense, that Pride was the Principle of their desire, and of that greatness they sought, and that the exercise of this greatness was prohibit, as the very emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>insolent Pride,</hi> and if with all, he coppied out this his Precept to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, from that great Command of his Lord, and took his Measures therefrom, he could not but look upon <hi>Pastors</hi> Lording over the Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cks, as proceeding from <hi>Pride,</hi> and the very practice and exercise of a <hi>Domineering</hi> Tyranny; yea, he could not but put under this Character, whatever exercise of pretended Ministerial Authority, goes beyond the Limits of that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exemplary Ministry, that Ministerial diligence and service of the Lords
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58203:85"/>
Flocks, which is enjoyned in the positive part of his Masters Command, exactly coppied out in this his Apostolick Precept. I further remark, that the Dr. holding out the Sense of the Apostle, as terminating only in this General, discharging Pride and Insolency in Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condescending upon the extent of the Negative and positive explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Precept, and the Nature of that Power, here specified and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, as Flowing from this Pride and Insolent Disposition, and but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewing, that it is a Pride <hi>unsutable to all Power and Authority in the Church,</hi> leaves room for even a Monarchy and <hi>Patriarchat,</hi> and the setting up of such a <hi>Dominion in the Church,</hi> as may be supposed in an abstracted Sense, and in its general Nature, Lawful; and thus still saves the <hi>Popes</hi> Mitre, from the Touch of this prohibition. The Dr. holds, <hi>That our exposition of those Texts, was never heard of, till these latter days.</hi> Thus with him, the <hi>Papists</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have hit upon the true Ancient Exposition, and <hi>Protestants</hi> have missed it. Amongst many other confuting Instances, he might have minded the abovementioned Passages of <hi>Bernard</hi> to <hi>Eugenius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Apostolis interdicitur Dominatus; Ergo tu tibi usurpare aude ut Dominans Apostolatum, aut Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Dominatum.</hi>

               <p>THe Dr. by this time, has finisht his first easie Task of Discussing our Argument from <hi>Christs Institution.</hi> He will next fall upon our Argument from <hi>Scripture Consequences.</hi> And, that his Work here, may be as easie as the first, and least, he should break his Word to his <hi>Friend,</hi> in giving him <hi>a large History of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> on this Head. Of them all, he is pleased to Single out one, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Identity of Bishop and Presbyter</hi>; which he says, fills all our Books: Citing <hi>Smectym. Ius Divin. Minist. Ang. Unbishopping Tim. and Tit. Altare Damasc. Durh. Dissert.</hi> But surely, any who have Seriously and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58203:86"/>
perused these Authors, and compares what they have written, with that which this Man pretends to Answer, may Laugh at his Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Folly, in Boasting of an Answer to Books, which he appears never to have read or understood. It were good for him, that the Authors, he paints his Margine with, were out of the World, that the Ignorant, or such as never saw them, might believe, that this Personat <hi>Champion,</hi> had made a mighty Baffling Assault upon them; But, all such as are acquaint with their Writings, will easily discover, that he is here, Acting a Pedantick <hi>Nomenclator</hi> of these Authors, and no more. The Argument from the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity of Bishop and Presbyter,</hi> (I mean <hi>an Official Identity</hi>) I acknowledge, is improven by these Authors, and other <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to try Issue with him upon this Head, but the Dr, I find, is so Loose and Perverse a Disputer, that he doth not so much as offer to propose one of their <hi>Mediums</hi> and Arguments to the Scope.</p>
               <p>He alledges, <hi>We Argue from the</hi> Homonomy <hi>of Names of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, <hi>in the New Testament, to prove the Sameness of the Office, and that the</hi> Clergy <hi>of the New Testament, are</hi> Dichotomised <hi>into</hi> Bishops <hi>and</hi> Deacons <hi>only, in some Texts: And thus in some Ancient Writers. That we thus exclude the Authority of a</hi> Bishop <hi>above a</hi> Presbyter, <hi>tho the Offices themselves be as much distinguished, in several Texts of the New Testament, as is possible.</hi> He holds, (P. 22, 23.) <hi>That we found the Solidity of our Demonstration of the</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity <hi>of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter, <hi>merely upon the</hi> Confusio Nominum, <hi>which he represents</hi> in a distinct Character, as our only Topick; To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he tells us we cite <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6, 7. and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. There needs no more, than the Reciting of this, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Mans Precarious Vanity, and Ignorance of this Controversie, since, all that are acquaint with it do know, that it is not <hi>the Sameness ef Names simplely, and in its self considered,</hi> which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho this have its own Secondary Weight, but the <hi>Sameness</hi> and <hi>Identity</hi> of the <hi>Qualifications, Ordination, Work, Duties, and every other Essential of the Office</hi>; Which is an Argument, with more Demonstrative Nerves, than that of the <hi>Sameness</hi> of <hi>Names. Presbyters,</hi> being in Scripture, called and owned, as <hi>Rulers, Governors, Overseers, Bishops</hi>; And both <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> appropriat to them, without the least Hint of <hi>Imparity</hi> among them, in the Exercise thereof, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.2. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. Now, if it be thus, sure the Conclusion of the <hi>Identity of the Office,</hi> clearly follows: And had this Man perused these Authors, he might have discovered, that their Arguments run to this Issue, and are not merely Bottomed upon so slight a Ground, as he would make such believe, whose Knowledge is of a like Size and Measure with his own: Yet, so weak is his Cause, that his Answer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58203:86"/>
stand before this very Argument, as he propounds it, at least with a due Respect to the Scope of the Places Cited; which will be evident to any, who will compare their Writings, with his Reasoning in this <hi>Pamphlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give a Summary and Brief Account of our Arguments, from these Scriptures, cited by him, and consequently of this Dr's Phantastick Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Trifflings in this Matter. From <hi>Act.</hi> 20. We thus Argue, <hi>First,</hi> That the Apostles solemnly declares to the Elders or <hi>Pastors</hi> of that Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that <hi>the Holy Ghost had constituted them Bishops over the Flock.</hi> Whence we collect, (1.) That the <hi>Pastor</hi> is the true Scripture-<hi>Bishop.</hi> (2.) That by his Office, he Feeds and Rules the Flock, and hath the Doctrinal and Jurisdictional Key committed to him by the Holy Ghost. Next, it hence follows, that whatever Authority, Power and Jurisdiction is imported, in the Name, <hi>Bishop,</hi> falls within the Compass of this Solemn Command, given to these <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Pastors,</hi> who are enjoyned <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> So, that this being essentially and intirely included in the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, the Diocesan <hi>Bishops</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Paramount Inspection over them, evanisheth as a mere <hi>Chimaera,</hi> especially, since it excludes and inhaunces this Authority of <hi>Pastors.</hi> (3.) It is evident that this Charge was given to the <hi>Elders</hi> before <hi>Timothy,</hi> now present with <hi>Paul,</hi> and was posterior to the first Epistle directed to him, for at Writing thereof, the Apostle was at <hi>Macedonia</hi>; And the Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story informs us, that he came thereafter to <hi>Miletum</hi> with <hi>Timothy,</hi> and gave the <hi>Elders</hi> this Charge. In a Word, this Charge and Command was <hi>Paul's last Solemn Charge,</hi> for, after this, they were to <hi>see his Face no more</hi>: So, that these being the Apostles last Thoughts (to speak so) and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Instructions, in Point of Church Government, we have here the the Samplare and Pattern, shewed by this great Apostle, upon the Mount, of this Divinely Inspired Model and Instructions. And since, the <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians,</hi> will not call the Gospel-Church, a Speckled Bird, and her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of diverse Cuts, they must acknowledge, that the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles gave the same Directions; As 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. doth furher clear.</p>
               <p>From hence, we further Argue, <hi>First:</hi> These <hi>Bishops who Feed and Rule the Flock immediatly,</hi> are the <hi>Apostolick Bishops,</hi> and these only: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> is no Apostolick <hi>Bishop,</hi> 1. Because his pretended <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> is over the <hi>Pastors,</hi> he is <hi>Pastor Pastorum.</hi> 2. He hath a Relation to no Flock, as such. We Argue, <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the Text thus: These Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick <hi>Bishops,</hi> have both the immediat and intire <hi>Episcopal</hi> Inspection and Power over Christs Flocks committed to them, by God, both the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Jurisdictional Key: And therefore, the Hierarchical <hi>Prelat</hi> stands Condemned upon a double Ground, 1. As Snatching away the last from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58203:87"/>
                  <hi>Pastors,</hi> and Arrogating it solely to himself. 2. In Tearing and Breaking asunder the Bond. wherewith Christ hath Tyed these Keyes; And this in a double Respect, (1.) In the Case of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> to whom he leaveth only the Doctrinal Key. (2.) With Respect to himself, who is obliged, <hi>ex Natura &amp; Ratione Officii,</hi> or from the Nature of his Office, to Preach the Gospel to no Flock, but to Govern only. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All this Scriptural, <hi>Episcopal</hi> Jurisdiction, is by the Apostle, ascribed to these <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Holy Ghost, in Presence of <hi>Timothy,</hi> while there is <hi>Altum Silentium,</hi> of any Interest he had over them in this Matter; Whence, it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, 1. They are declared and supposed the <hi>Highest Ordinary Officers</hi> of that Church, having a Collegiat joynt Authority therein. And 2. By clear Consequence, it follows, that nothing here enjoyned them, inferrs or doth include a Precarious Dependence upon him, in these Duties, or his Supereminent Inspection over them. 3. By further necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, this Authority being thus declared by the Apostle, and recognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after all the Precepts delivered to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the first <hi>Epistle</hi> written to him, it cannot be supposed to contain any Super-eminent <hi>Episcopal</hi> Charge over these <hi>Pastors,</hi> but a Transient Evangelistick Inspection only, to pass off, with that Exigent: It being infallibly clear, that there can be no Inconsistency or Contradiction, betwixt this last Farewel Charge to the <hi>Pastors</hi> of that Church, and his Directions to <hi>Timothy,</hi> while residing therein. <hi>Finally,</hi> It is hence infallibly concluded, 1. That the Apostles themselves Exercised no such Jurisdiction over Churches constitute in their Organick Beeing, as is properly and formally <hi>Episcopal,</hi> or of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Mould: This <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority being committed to the Colledge of <hi>Elders,</hi> as their Essential Right and Priviledge. 2. That the Apostles did not Substitute the Hierarchical <hi>Prelats,</hi> or <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> as their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous Substitutes, upon their withdrawing, unless we will make the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> to Model this Church, in a Mould Hetrogeneous to other Churches. And in a Word, it hence follows, that whatever may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as to Matter of Fact, neither this, nor any Church else, could ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Iure,</hi> divest themselves of this Authority, (I mean the Church Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, or Officers thereof) in setting up such a <hi>Proestos</hi> or <hi>Prelat,</hi> whose Power did encroach upon this their Authority allowed them by God.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 7. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Argue, not merely from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous Use, or <hi>Identity</hi> of the Name <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but from the Nature and Mould of the Apostles Reasoning, and the Connecting Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle and Illative <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which points at the very Topick and Ground, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Apostle concludeth that which is his Scope; which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarly inferrs an <hi>Official Identity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> not a <hi>Nominal only</hi>: For, thus his Argument lyes; The <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Elder,</hi> must be so and so
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58203:87"/>
Qualified, for such must the <hi>Bishop</hi> be: So, that the Stating of an Official Distinction betwixt the two, as different Orders of Ministers, breaks the Force of the Apostles Argument, there being no Soundness in such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning as this, <hi>Inferior Officers must have such Qualifications, because such are proper to the Superior Office.</hi> No doubt, the Holy Ghost, who thus Reasons, ascribes to them, not only <hi>the same Name,</hi> (and he knew best, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Nature of the Things by fit Words) but likewise the <hi>same Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, Work,</hi> and <hi>Office. Episcopalians</hi> will not disowne it, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> hath distinct Qualifications and Work, from that of the <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi>; So that, they must either acquiesce in this our Sense of his Words, while purposely describing the <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> Qualifications, Office, and Duties, or Blasphemously impute unto him Incongruity of Speech, and Unsoundness in Reasoning; And therefore, the Office of the one, and the other, is clearly supposed one and the same.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. Where the Apostle salutes a <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Church: We inferr, 1. Their proper <hi>Episcopal</hi> Relation thereunto. 2. That they could not be <hi>Diocesans,</hi> (1.) Because the <hi>Deacons,</hi> the lowest Officers, are immediatly subjoyned to them; And <hi>Prelatists</hi> will not say, that there were no <hi>Pastors</hi> in that Church, but only <hi>Diocesans.</hi> (2.) It is impossible there could be a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Hierarchical <hi>Bishops</hi> therein, and by clear Consequence, the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are supposed the <hi>Highest Ordinary Officers</hi> of that Church, Exercising a joynt Collegiat Power in the Government thereof.</p>
               <p>If I should adduce the Judgment and Testimonies of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, upon these Passages, correspondent to our Sense and Pleading, it were a large Work. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Divines, upon <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. from that Clause [<hi>the Holy Ghost has made you Overseers</hi>] do plead as above; For, having told us, that in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <hi>Bishops,</hi> and that from this the Word <hi>Bishop</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; they add,
<q>That these are <hi>v.</hi> 17. called <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church; from whence it appears, that in the Holy Scriptures, there is no Difference made betwixt <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> pointing to <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. upon which Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, they shew, that this Term is common to all Governours and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers in the Church; referring again to <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. together with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.</q>
Where they shew,
<q>That <hi>Timothy</hi> was appointed to continue at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi> not as <hi>Bishop,</hi> but as <hi>Evangelist</hi> for a time, to Confirm the Church. Upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. they shew,</q>
                  <q>That the Word <hi>Bishop,</hi> is to be understood of all <hi>Overseers</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the Church without Difference, as appears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the following Description, compared with other places, citing <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28.</q>
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Diodat.</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. shews,

&amp;c. And represents the Duty of a true <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Church, without any absolute Dominion, only for the Profit and Good of the Flock, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. he paralells with <hi>Act.</hi> 20:17, 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.

And upon <hi>v.</hi> 28. they shew,</q>
                  <q>That the <hi>Overseers</hi> there mentioned, are the same, who are called <hi>Elders, v.</hi> 17. and were certainly such as had <hi>the Government and care of the Church committed to them.</hi> Upon <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. By <hi>Bishops,</hi> they understand <hi>Pastors</hi> and Teachers, asserting that the Name and Office of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> was all one, in the Apostles days; and do Cite for Confirmation of this <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.2. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12.13. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.14, 3 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.

Upon the last Clause of <hi>v.</hi> 2. where the <hi>Bishop</hi> is injoyned to be apt to Teach, they shew, "That he must be neither an Ignorant nor lazie Person. <hi>Eng. Annot.</hi> upon <hi>Act.</hi> 20. understand the <hi>Elders, v.</hi> 17. of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and <hi>Pastors,</hi> paralelling it with these <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 11, 30.
<q>Upon <hi>v.</hi> 28. they shew, That the term <hi>Episcopus</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> is here to be understood of the <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Church, and Minister of the Word, as elsewhere:</q>
Also upon <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. on that Clause, [<hi>the Bishops and Deacons</hi>] they shew,
<q>That the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> did forbid Two or more <hi>Bishops,</hi> to have their Seats in one City: And before that, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> upbraids <hi>Novatus</hi> with Ignorance (as <hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 6. Writes) that he knew not, there ought to be but one <hi>Bishop</hi> in that Church, in which he could no be Ignorant, there were Forty Six <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi> And <hi>Oecumenius</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> affirm this of <hi>Philippi</hi>: In one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it cannot be supposed (say they) there were more <hi>Bishops</hi> in that restrained Sense, as the word was afterward taken. Here therefore, by <hi>Episcopi</hi> and <hi>Diaconi,</hi> we are to understand.</q>
                  <q>the <hi>whole</hi> Ministry at <hi>Philippi,</hi> consisting of <hi>Presbyters, to whom the Government of the Church was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58203:88"/>
Committed</hi>: And <hi>Deacons,</hi> who not only had the Care of the Poor, but also Assisted Ministers, in their Ecclesiastical Function.</q>
Upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. they shew,
<q>That the Term <hi>Bishop,</hi> doth properly relate to the Flock; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. And having shewed, that Antiquity did appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat this Term to <hi>Diocesan Prelats,</hi> and consequently, as it relates to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>; But that they Disowne this, as not being the Scripture Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is evident, not only, from that Reference to <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. but also, from this, that the Clause of [<hi>Desiring a good Work</hi>] they paralell with 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.13. where, after the Apostle has <hi>v.</hi> 12. enjoyned a due Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Subjection to such, as Laboured among them, (<hi>viz.</hi> In the Word and Doctrine) he enjoyns to Esteem them Highly in Love for their Works sake, asserting thus the <hi>Bishops</hi> [<hi>good Work</hi>] to be one and the same with that of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> and consequently the Office. By the <hi>Elders,</hi> mentioned <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. to be Ordained in every Church, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Pastors</hi> to be Ordained, where there was a convenient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Faithful: And the Apostles Reason <hi>v.</hi> 7. [<hi>For a Bishop must be Blameless,</hi> &amp;c.] they paralell with <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2.</q>
Thus clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Corresponding our Sense and Pleading for the Identity of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> Office, from these places.</p>

From <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. they shew, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Bishops,</hi> set up by the Holy Ghost, paralelling this with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. where (they tell us) the <hi>Bishop</hi> is described from such Qualities and Effects, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyns and ascribes to his <hi>Fellow Presbyters,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. Adding, that in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Philippians, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. under the Name of <hi>Bishops,</hi> for whom the Apostle prays for Grace, he understands such [<hi>qui</hi> Philippi <hi>Verbo &amp; Gubernationi praeerant</hi>] who had Inspection of the Doctrine and Government, distinguishing them from the <hi>Deacons,</hi> who were set over the Churches Treasure.

but to the Church committed to their Vigilant Care, in which Respect alone, they have that Title in Scripture, but not upon the Account of any Prerogative or Authority, which one Minister has over another.</q>

Here is a bold new <hi>Novelist,</hi> with a whole Congeries of New Notions upon Texts pleaded by the <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> suting, no doubt, the Consideration of our Profound <hi>Antiquary.</hi> I am verily of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this grave <hi>Inquirer</hi> into the new dangerous Notions of the <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> should either have perused the premised grounds of their New Opinion, or Written to his Friend at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to make inquiry in his behalf, for some more of these dangerous Books, that they might be sent up to him, in order to his <hi>Doctorships</hi> perusal and confutation: For, it seems, he has never seen them. I need not mention <hi>Chamier,</hi> and other conceited <hi>Novelists,</hi> who has fallen into the same dottage (<hi>De aecumenico Pont. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnoldus</hi> in his <hi>Lux in tenebris,</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. (<hi>he called the Elders</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Orthodox opinion thus,
<q>That <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are not Names of diverse Gifts in the Church, but <hi>of one and the same Office,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who are called <hi>Presbyters v.</hi> 17. are called <hi>Bishops. v.</hi> 28.</q>
This Man it seems, had got the new <hi>Notion</hi> in his Head too. He adds, The

                  <hi>Papists</hi> Object (had he enjoyed the time and opportunity of seeing our Antique Drs <hi>Enquiry</hi> into the New dangerous <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> he had not been so ill manner'd, as to term the Reasons of our Venerable Dr. an Objection of <hi>Papists</hi>) Well, what do they Object? 'That in these times, the Names were Common, but yet the Offices of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> diverse. Now, let us hear <hi>Arnoldus</hi> answers to our profound <hi>Enquirers</hi> great argument, wherewith he has filled up so great a part of his <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> 1.
<q>This is, saith he, to affirm, not to prove. 2. When Offices are distinct, there also the Names are diverse. 3. There was one Office, both of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters, viz.</hi> the Office of Teaching. 4. Saith he, upon the <hi>Papists</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (beware of the Venerable Dr. again; what! could this Blind Novelist see none who maintained this Ancient Doctrin but <hi>Papists</hi>?) there can and ought to be only one <hi>Bishop</hi> in one City; but so it is, that there were here many: Therefore <hi>Bishops</hi> signify <hi>Presbyters.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After the premised account of these <hi>doting Presbyterians,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are judged by many, to be men of very Venerable Name, may I presume to trouble our profound enquiring Dr, in giving him a view of some bigot <hi>Confessions</hi> of the Reformed <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, who, its like, have asserted this <hi>New Notion</hi> and Opinion of <hi>Scots Presbyterians.</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Church, upon this head, runs thus (<hi>credimus veram Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam,</hi> &amp;c.)
<q>We believe, that the true Church ought to be Governed, by that Policy, which Christ hath ordained.</q>
Mr. Dr. will no doubt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this is sound. Well, what next? They add,
<q>That there be <hi>Pastors, Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                  </q>
This is fair. But is there no distinction of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> in their Sense? The enquiring Dr. will tell them; that the two Classes of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> admits of a subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the unmannerly froward <hi>Confession,</hi> is bold to contradict his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, proceeding thus:
<q>And again, we believe, that all true <hi>Pastors,</hi> wherever they be, are indued with <hi>equal and the same Power,</hi> under one Head and Bishop, Christ Jesus.</q>
Here is the <hi>Scots Presbyterians New Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in grain. Shall we try the Dr's. Patience with another such Instance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Belgick Confession,</hi> is no better natur'd to our Dr. but are as bold to contradict him in this point, and it seems do hold the same <hi>New Scots Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>: For, thus they assert, <hi>Art.</hi> 30.
<q>All Christs Ministers of the Word of God, have <hi>the same and equal Power and Authority,</hi> as being all Ministers of that only Universal Head and <hi>Bishop,</hi> Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Point of <hi>Ordination,</hi> which the Dr. appropriats to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Helvetia</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Harm. Confes. Chap.</hi> 11.

<q>Therefore, let no Man forbid, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the old Appointment of God (so they call the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way of <hi>Ordination,</hi>) and rather receive it, than the custom devised by Men (so they call the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Method.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus the <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Boheme, Cha.</hi> 9. (<hi>Harm. Confes. Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>P.</hi> 246.247.) after setting down the qualifications of Ministers, as to <hi>Ordination,</hi> they say, that after Prayer and Fasting, they are to be Confirmed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the <hi>Elders,</hi> by the laying one of their Hands.</q>
So The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of <hi>Saxony, Chap.</hi> 12. (<hi>Harm. Confes. Part.</hi> 2.) affirms,
<q>That it belongs to the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Word to <hi>Ordain Ministers,</hi> Lawfully Elected and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</q>
Where, we have asserted at once, both the <hi>Presbyters</hi> Power in <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples</hi> Interest, in the <hi>Call</hi> of <hi>Pastors,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</hi> But as to this Point of the <hi>Equality of Pastors,</hi> and their joint Interest in <hi>Ordination,</hi> it is long since Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> hath told the Dr. and his Fellows that this is the Common Judgment of the Reformed Churches; <hi>Viz.

               </p>
               <p>Well, Whoever own these <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and their <hi>joynt Interest in Government,</hi> The Dr. tells his Friend, he Charges them with <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>Novelty,</hi> tho a Current <hi>Opinion</hi> among his Country-Men, whom the enquiring Dr. Labours to undeceive, and he assures his Friend (a sure Demonstration no doubt, if it admit no other Measures, but his Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>That they are altogether New, and were never propagat in any part of the Christian Church, till these last days of Separation and Singularity.</hi> I could wish, he had Condescended upon the measures of these <hi>last days,</hi> wherein this <hi>Separation</hi> Reigns, as also, of these <hi>New Opinions.</hi> We know, the Scripture calls the whole Gospel times, <hi>last times</hi> and <hi>latter dayes</hi>; And some will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there has been <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Singularity,</hi> Old enough in years: But, if we may draw Conjectures from the Drs.

But that I be not tedious, and may hasten to consider the Dr's grave <hi>Enquiry</hi> and <hi>Answer</hi> to the premised Scriptures; and the <hi>New Protestant</hi> Glosses upon them, which moves his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58203:92"/>
Spleen to such declamatory anger against his Poor pur-blind Countreymen; one thing I would suggest to him (if I may do it without putting him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chaff) which is this; 'Tis known, that there is a certain <hi>English</hi> Dr. of as great Figure and Reputation (almost) in <hi>England,</hi> as he is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of a great Name to this day, who having got this <hi>New</hi> Scots <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> into his unwarry head, was bold to exhibit a great many Testimonies of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Fathers,</hi> for this <hi>New Opinion</hi>; his Name is Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in his Epistle to Sir <hi>Francis Knolls</hi>; the Dr. would do well to enlarge his <hi>Enquiring</hi> Charity, and undeceive his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen and others, in the Point of this <hi>dangerous Error,</hi> in examining his Citations. Its long since the Epistle was Exhibit to publick view, and is in many hands, and upon a little enquiry, the Dr. may easily have a view of this <hi>dangerous</hi> Piece. For, if these Citations hold, the <hi>Opinion</hi> is not so <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Singular,</hi> as the Dr. Suggests, but it seems is an <hi>Old notion</hi> revived again: As the Dr. knows the <hi>Waldenses</hi> revived Old Points before them, and from them the <hi>Protestant Schismaticks,</hi> have taken up the same; and in special, so Learned an <hi>Antiquary,</hi> as the Dr. cannot be ignorant, that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Scots Dangerous New Notion,</hi> against which his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> is levelled, was condemned by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> as testifies <hi>Michael Medina, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De sacrorum hominum origine &amp; eminentia, Cap</hi> 5.</p>

<q>[<hi>Respondet</hi> Sorbonicus <hi>nominum quidem esse, sed non munerum, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem. Verum enimvero quando Presbyteri vocantur Episcopi, ibi agitur non de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus ac titulis, sed de ipsa muneris functione; cum enim</hi> Paulus <hi>hortatur Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteros</hi> Epheseos <hi>ad suum munus legittime obeundum, hanc addit rationem, quod illos Spiritus Sanctus constituit Episcopos: Non igitur ait eos vocari tantum, sed esse constituos Episcopos ex quo efficitur tot revera tunc fuisse Episcopos</hi> Ephesi <hi>quot erant Presbyteri &amp; Pastores Ecclesiae; adeo ut plane jaceat illa responsio de sola nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num confusione</hi>] i. e. The <hi>Sorbon</hi> doth Reply, that there is indeed in the premised places, a confusion of Names, but not of the thing it self, or the Office. But when <hi>Presbyters</hi> are called <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Apostle is in such places, treating not of the Names or Titles only, but of the Office and Function it self. For, when the Apostle exhorts the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to the right Exercise o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their Office, he adds this Reason, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost had constitute them <hi>Bishops,</hi> and therefore, he says not, that they were only called so, but that they were in very deed Constitut such <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> From whence it evidently follows, that there were then at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as many <hi>Bishops,</hi> as there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church; So, that this answer, touching the Confusion of Names only in the premised places, is quite overthrown. Well, thus he thinks, he has laid all along, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the Topgallant of the <hi>Sorbon</hi>; and consequently our Dr's great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. The Author proceeds to a New Objection [<hi>sed objicit, quod ait</hi> Paulus <hi>ad</hi> Timotheum. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Manus inquit, ne cui cito imponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, additque mandatum illud</hi> Pauli <hi>ad</hi> Titum <hi>de constituendis in</hi> Creta <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: Utrumque enim Episcopum fuisse atque eo ratione jus ordinandi habuisse conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi>] That <hi>Paul</hi> saith to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay Hands suddenly on no Man.</hi> And that he adds that Command of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> anent the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining <hi>Elders</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> and thereupon contends, that both the one and the other were <hi>Bishops,</hi> and upon this account had the Right of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
Here, no doubt, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> presented much of the Strength of our Dr's Reasoning; so that we see how much the <hi>Popish</hi> Agents, are in Love with our <hi>Prelatical</hi> Arguments, and that there is no new thing under the Sun.
<q>But let us hear our Authors Answer, [<hi>respondeo, nomine <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some what, in Confirmation of this, he adds— (<hi>electionum vero curam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Timothy</hi> alone, who from the frequent reading of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> had Learned, that Church Rulers, were not of old chosen otherwise than by the Judgment of the whole Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He adds (<hi>merito dicere possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in unius</hi> Timothei <hi>persona praefectos omnes Ecclesiasticos esse sui officii common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Num igitur illa omnia sibi uni</hi> Timotheus <hi>vendicavit— nonne pertinebant ad Presbyteros, quos</hi> Paulus <hi>ipse testatur laborasse in Sermone &amp; Doctrina</hi>] That <hi>Timothy</hi> is enjoyned to reject Fables, give Attendance to Reading, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> arrogat all these things to himself alone? Did they not belong to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who by <hi>Pauls</hi> Testimony Laboured in the Word and Doctrine? He adds, that <hi>Timothy</hi>'s <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> [<hi>Nullo Scripturae Testimonio confirmari potest</hi>] can be made good by no Testimony of Scripture, which he proves from these Words [<hi>Rogavi te ut maneres</hi> Ephesi <hi>cum profisiscerem in</hi> Macedoniam, 1 Tim. 1.3.] <hi>I besought thee to abide still at</hi> Ephesus <hi>when I went into</hi> Macedonia, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. Which shews, says our Author, he was left there, for some time, for this end — [<hi>Quemadmodum ipsa Historiae series evincit</hi>] As the very Tract of the History makes evident. And this he proves from <hi>Timothy</hi>'s attending <hi>Paul,</hi> when to go to <hi>Asia</hi>; As also from this Ground, that <hi>Paul</hi> was ordinarly attended by <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> in this Exercise of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Function. Adding further, that if we suppose him <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Churches, to which he was sent, we will make him <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, Philippians, Thessalonians,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58203:99"/>Now, from all that is said, whether the Body of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines and Churches, be not for the <hi>Official,</hi> as well as <hi>Nominal Identity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi>: Whether this be not likewise the Judgment of the most Ancient and Purer Church: Whether our Argument be only a <hi>Confusione Nominum,</hi> and Sophistical and Childish; Is left to the Judgment of Judicious and Impartial <hi>Readers,</hi> who shall Weigh what is said, in the Ballances of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Sound Reason.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed, I cannot but take notice of this Dr's petulant imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency in proposing our Argument. He says, this is our great Argument, <hi>That there is no distinction betwixt a</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter <hi>in Scripture</hi> — And therefore, we conclude that our Argument, <hi>a Confusione no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> is demonstrative and solid. As if, when we maintain, that in Scripture, there is no distinction betwixt these Offices, we meant <hi>a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal only,</hi> and not <hi>a real diversity.</hi> Had he ever perused the Authors he Cites, or conferred with any <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who understands the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, he would have found, that from the Scriptures Cited, and many Paralels, its an <hi>Official oneness,</hi> not a <hi>Nominal only,</hi> we plead for, and that our Arguments therefrom, has such Nerves, as he durst not medle with.</p>
               <p>The Dr. tells us (P. 23.) <hi>That whether the Bishop be of an Higher Order than the Priest, falls not under his enquiry, nor is it very Material— considered with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the common Priesthood, and Subordinat Officers, they might be of the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, tho at other times, when Authority and Iurisdiction is Named, the Bishop (with regard to his Dignity and Power) is alwise reckoned above a Presbyter.</hi> Here, I must say, is a strange Confusion, and that not <hi>Nominum</hi> but <hi>Rerum.</hi> 1. The Dr. is so much for the <hi>Official Scriptural Superiority</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> to the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that he affirms the Contrar Assertion to be a <hi>New opinion,</hi> got into the Heads of his Countrymen, and some others, but never heard of this 1400 years; For curing of which, he has sent down this Learned <hi>Pamphlet</hi>; yet he will not <hi>enquire, whether a Bishop be of a higher Order, or not, to a Presbyter,</hi> i. e. He will not enquire whether his Country-men or he, have the Right in this Debate. If the <hi>Bishop</hi> be not of an Higher Order, his Countrey <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are Right, their Arguments, which ly level to this scope, are good and Conclusive, and do batter his Principle of <hi>a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Order of Ministers above the Pastor,</hi> and in especial under this Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Character of <hi>Bishop</hi>: The <hi>Antithesis</hi> whereof (<hi>viz.</hi> that there is an Officer called a <hi>Bishop,</hi> of a Superior Order <hi>eo no nine</hi>) the Dr. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for <hi>tanquam pro aris &amp; focis</hi>; yet he says, the <hi>enquiry into this Point</hi> (which to all men of Sense, is the <hi>Cardo Questionis</hi>) <hi>is not in it self Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> Let any ponder, whether this stout pretended <hi>Signifer,</hi> doth not here let fall his Standart, and even flees at the First alarm. 2. He tells us, <hi>when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58203:100"/>
Authority and Iurisdiction is named, the Bishop with regard to his Dignity, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reckoned above a</hi> Presbyter. Now, I do appeal to all Men of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, whether the Dr dos not here Assert. (1.) A Divine Authority and Jurisdiction of a <hi>Bishop</hi> above a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> (2) By clear Consequence, that he is of an higher Order than the <hi>Presbyter</hi>; or else, how can he be in Jurisdiction and Authority above him? (3.) That the <hi>Bishop,</hi> under that Character, and <hi>eo nomine,</hi> is thus Represented in the Scripture Accounts of him. Now, all this being his Assertion, in opposition to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-mens supposed Errors, how can he decline the enquiry, whether the <hi>Bishop be of an higher Order</hi>? Let any Judge, if he says not this, upon the Matter, <hi>the thing is Clear in it self, in the Scripture Accounts; and this I maintain in opposition to the</hi> Scots <hi>Presbyterians, whom I do hereby Charge with a new Opinion on this Ground, but am not Concerned to Examin their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or make good my own.</hi> 3. He tells us <hi>they are sometime considered, as of the same order, with respect to the common Priesthood.</hi> I <hi>Answer</hi> we have proved that <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pastors,</hi> have both name and thing of all ordinary Ministerial Authority appropriat to them, and that with Relation thereto, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> and the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> are in Scripture made <hi>one and the same.</hi> (2.) When he says, <hi>they are made of the same Order, with respect to the Priesthood, common to either</hi>: He speaks Confusedly and Ignorantly; For will he say, that the attributing to Two Church Officers, who are different, the same Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or (to speak to the Dr's Scope) the same Generical Priesthood, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, will inferr, that they are of the same order therein, or specifical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? If so, then Apostles, who are called <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> he must say, are of the same Order with them; yea with <hi>Deacons</hi> also, since sometimes their Office and Ministry is represented by such a term, as Represents a <hi>Deaconate</hi> or common service. Further, I must here warn the Doctor. to take up his Shield, and beware of the Rebound of his own Blow: Was our Lord of the same Order, with the Prophets or Servants of God, because in the capacity of Mediator, and with Respect to a general Ministry or Service of the Father, he gets the Designation, name and thing of <hi>Prophet, Messenger, and Servant of God</hi>? Will the Dr. thus Blasphemously degrade him into the same Order with mere Creatures, who are Prophets and Servants? In a word, let us hold the Dr to his affirmative, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge his proof of this Point, <hi>viz. That in Scripture, there is an ordinary stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church Officer, exhibit under the Character and designation of a Bishop, who is alwise Reckoned above a</hi> Presbyter <hi>or</hi> Pastor, <hi>when Authority and Iurisdiction is Named.</hi> And according to the scope, measures, and extent of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let his ensuing Discourse, Answers, and proofs be examined, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I am sure, he has fair dealing, according to all acknowledged Laws of Disputation.</p>

The Clergy,</hi> saith the Dr. <hi>into Two Orders,</hi> (here he has soundly exponed his term) <hi>like that of Priests and Levits, tho as among the</hi> Jews— <hi>So, among Christians, this admitted of a Sub-division and subordination of Church Officers among themselves, as were the Priests of the Old Testament— This,</hi> he says, <hi>was suitable to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the</hi> Helenistical (<hi>or</hi> Graecian) <hi>Tribes</hi> (high Oratory!) <hi>of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Age— the Name of Priest and High-Priest being Confounded,</hi> Levit. 1.7. <hi>The Sons of</hi> Aaron the Priest shall put Fire, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 8. the Priests, <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons shall lay the parts, <hi>&amp;c. Now,</hi> saith the Dr. <hi>if Priests and High-Priests got the same Name, without any distinction of Order, notwithstanding the High-Priests extraordinary priviledges, the Name of High-Priest likewise being never affixt to</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>or</hi> Eleazar, <hi>and the term but Twice or Thrice mentioned in the Books of</hi> Moses <hi>while yet the Homonymie</hi> of Names pleaded not against the Subordination of Priests; Could <hi>it be thought strange, that Apostles or Apostolical Men in mentioning</hi> Presbyters <hi>of the New Testament, might not make use of the current</hi> Phraseology <hi>of their Countreymen, in speaking of Priests and Levites, Dividing them into two Orders, as if there were no more?—Tho the meanest</hi> Jew <hi>knew the high Priest was very Honourable, and by all marks of eminency and Authority, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from ordinary Priests.</hi> Thus he Pag. 23.24.25.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Answer, Quod haec ad rhombum</hi>? What says this to the Point? Or how lyes this Discourse level to his scope, either to prove the <hi>Bishops</hi> Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Authority above a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pastor,</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi> in the Scripture Sense, or to prove, that we Argue sophistically, when alledging that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter one in Name and thing,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the discriminating of both, by <hi>Episcopalians,</hi> is antiscriptural. How, I say, this lyes level to the Dr's Conclusion, or can in solid Reason reach the same, I must Confess, passes my Comprehension. For, 1. Tho all the Dr. says be granted, it is palpably evident, that this pleading, if it prove any thing, levels merely against such as would draw the <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter only from this, that there is an homonymie of these two Names,</hi> whereas, it is the <hi>Identity of the Qualifications, Gifts, Duties, and every essential of the Office,</hi> which is the Topick and Principle <hi>Presbyterians</hi> plead from, not merely the confusion of Names, 2. The Dr. himsef acknowledges, that notwithstanding of this supposed confusion of Names, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Old Testament Church Officers, yet <hi>the High-Priest, was distinguished from the other Priests, by marks of Eminency and Authority</hi>; for instance, [<hi>that he is called High-Priest</hi>] And therefore, before his Discourse can have any shadow of Answer, he is bound to Exhibit, in a just Paralel, <hi>the same Scripture marks of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and Authority of the Diocesan Bishop, above the Pastor or Presbyter-Bishop,</hi> as the Scripture Exhibits in reference to the High-Priests, above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Priests, or the Priests in reference to the Levites, else, this Answer, by his own Confession, and in the Sense of all men of Sense, is but a pitiful Begging of the Question: For, upon this Ground, he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Distinction betwixt the <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Preaching Presbyter.</hi> He alledges P. 25. That in the <hi>Hagiographical and Prophetical Writings, the High-Priest is frequently distinguished by his proper and special Character.</hi> Well then, he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to let us see in Scripture, such a frequent distinction of the <hi>Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> from the <hi>Pastor or Presbyter,</hi> by such a Character as the Dr. makes special and Peculiar to him, and exhibit his special Official dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference therein, and super eminent Authority over <hi>Pastors,</hi> else he never touches the Point. We hold that the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are in Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise one, Name, and thing: The Dr. grants, that the High Priest, and other Priests are not so, but distinguished; and therefore, he brings an impertinent Paralel and exception anent the <hi>sometimes</hi> Community of Names of Priests and High-Priests, unless he can otherwise than thus disprove and answer our Assertion. Besides, the Critical Disputant will here put him to prove, that the inspired Writers of the New Testament, followed the <hi>Phraseologie</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> in speaking of the New Testament-Church Officers, especially since we find frequent recitations of them, in a far other strain and Phrase, and that in their several Classes and Degrees, both ordinary and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. Moreover, when in that place, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 1. <hi>Aaron,</hi> is called not merely <hi>the Priest, but emphatice, Aaron the Priest</hi> (whose eminent immediat Call to the Priesthood, is so clear) and distinguished from his <hi>Sons the Priests,</hi> mentioned in the plural, in that very Passage, his Super-eminency above them, is insinuat, yea Asserted. The Dr. is bold to assert, that when Authority and Jurisdiction is Named, the <hi>Bishop,</hi> with regard to his Dignity, is alwise reckoned above a Presbyter. Of this <hi>alwise,</hi> we demand one instance, the Dr's extensive <hi>Phraseologie,</hi> boasts of a Plenty of Instances, but in not offering so much as one he shews great penury, especially, when, as the affirmer he stands so clearly obliged thereto: But here, as often elsewhere, he plys us with generals, alien from the purpose.</p>
               <p>He tells us, (P. 26.) <hi>Tho neither</hi> Aaron <hi>nor</hi> Eleazar, <hi>in the beginning of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Oeconomy, were called High Priests, it had been Madness from this Confusion of Names, to have inferred an Equality, since their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58203:101"/>
Offices were distinguished by their special Ministries and Iurisdiction.</hi> Here again, a Poor Repeated General, Alien from the Point; If this Dr. had intended to Dispute, not to Rove with Unprofitable Talk, he should, instead of Begging Poorly the Question, in Supposing it, have made that good, in the Case of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the New Testament Church Government, which he here asserts of the <hi>Priests</hi> in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the special Ministries and Jurisdiction of High Priests and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priests, were distinguished, and what was appropriat to the one, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to the other under that Dispensation, so there is exhibit in the New Testament, the same Discriminating Distinction, betwixt the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> and <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in point of Ministry and Jurisdiction. It is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to see a Man Represented in the Frontispiece of his Book, in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>D.

               <p>He adds <hi>(ibid.) Bishops were called Presbyters, who had Presbyters under them, in the Days of the Apostles.</hi> If he mean this of ordinary Officers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished as <hi>Bishops</hi> from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> I deny it, and that there were any such ordinary Officers, with such Authority over <hi>Pastors,</hi> under the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of either <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter.</hi> He tells us, <hi>that the</hi> Presbyters <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the</hi> Priests, <hi>who assist the</hi> Bishop <hi>in his Ecclesiastick Administrations.</hi> A New Begging of the Question. I deny either that <hi>Priests</hi> is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Designation of Ministers, and do consequently hold, that this his Designation is <hi>Popish</hi> and Anti-Scriptural, or that the Term <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> doth ever signifie in the Scripture such an Officer, as has a Relation to a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his Mould. The Dr. is bold to tell us, <hi>That tho all</hi> Bishops <hi>are</hi> Presbyters, <hi>yet not all</hi> Presbyters Bishops; <hi>and therefore, to infer an Equality from the Promiscuous Use of Names, is neither good Logick nor Good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</hi> But since the Dr. exhibits no Scripture Warrand nor History, for this his Forged Distinction betwixt the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pastor</hi> (wherein I dare appeal to all who ponders these his Answers) he shews himself no good <hi>Historian,</hi> in Obtruding such Doctrine: And since, instead of proving, he still beggs the Question, and that doubly: <hi>First,</hi> In supposing that we ground our Assertion of the <hi>Identity of Bishop and Presbyter,</hi> upon the mere promiscuous Use of the Names, without respect to the <hi>Official Identity,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit in the places which we plead: <hi>Next,</hi> In supposing the Scriptural <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> Distinction of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and grounding all his Answers thereupon, without the least Offer of a Proof, it is evident that his <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> is as bad as his <hi>History</hi> and Divinity.</p>
               <p>He runs on in the same Carreer of a <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> (P. 27.) He will

The Dr. tells us next, <hi>That the</hi> Jewish OEconomy <hi>was never abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the New Testament, and that their</hi> Taxis <hi>was Divided into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Subordinat Priests.</hi> Thus we have a clear <hi>Vidimus</hi> what he would prove from this, at least, what the <hi>Series</hi> of his Reasoning concludes, even a standing <hi>Primat</hi> over the Catholick Church: And therefore, needs Stumble no <hi>Protestants,</hi> nor Amuse them, tho he set the <hi>Cross</hi> upon the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> of his next <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> or upon his Breast, as a Devout Catholick Dr. of his Holy Mother Church. He adds, <hi>That still the</hi> Jews <hi>subdivided the Priests into highest and Subordinat, as is clear from</hi> Philo <hi>the</hi> Jew. He told us the Scripture distinguishes them, pray good Mr. Dr. what need is there of Proofs or Instances from <hi>Philo,</hi> since the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> are satisfied in the first, and think themselves not concerned in the Proof it self?</p>
               <p>But to proceed (P. 28.) He is still upon this Idle Repeated Begging the Question, telling us, <hi>of the Apostles speaking in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Phrase, Classing the Clergy into a Bipartit or Tripartit Division, as reckoned either among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or with relation to the People, as the Priests were by a Tripartit, while recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their Distinctions: That Community of Names, was as observable when the Offices were as truly distinguished as could be.</hi> But still we are Wearyed, Calling upon our Triffling Dr, to come Home from his Prodigal Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, to the Point, which is to shew us in the Scriptures of the New Testament, such a true Distinction of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> Office, as is exhibit in the Offices of the <hi>Iewish</hi> OEconomy, in the Old. The Dr. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That the Proestos in the Apostolick Age, was as much above the Subordinat Presbyters, as the High Priest among the</hi> Jews, <hi>above other Priests, who yet was Ranked among them, without a Nominal Distinction.</hi> But, as in the rest, so here, the Dr. presents us his Magisterial Dictats for Proof and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He should have given us a Scripture Instance of such a <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>estos,</hi> or first <hi>Presbyter,</hi> Vested with a <hi>Prostasie</hi> of this Nature in the Apostolick Age, and then drawn his Inference from the <hi>Nominal Identity.</hi> 2. What if we should grant the Matter of Fact, or such a <hi>Proestos</hi> in that Age? Will that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58203:102"/>
merely prove the <hi>Ius</hi>? If the Dr. say so, (and he does say it, in his Way of Arguing) then he Claps the Lawful Mitre, or a Divine Warrand at least, upon the Head of a <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and Stamps this <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> upon the begun Mystery of Iniquity, and other Tares, which the evil one was then Sowing among the Wheat. 3. That such a <hi>Proestos</hi> was as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as the High Priest above other Priests, is as Ignorant an Assertion, and Arrant Untruth, as the Dr. could readily have let fall: Whereof I will (1.) Convince him out of his own Mouth, unless in the Point of this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he still begg the Question. (2.) From the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Accounts of the High Priests Office. <hi>First,</hi> He does acknowledge, that the High Priest was thus Termed, <hi>upon the Ground of Special Ministries,</hi> which were Essential and Peculiar to him: Now, I pray, what were the <hi>Special Ministries</hi> of this <hi>Proestos,</hi> and even in the Point of Order, in the Apostles Days, above his Fellows? <hi>Next,</hi> the High Priest entred every Year into the Holy of Holies, with Blood and Incense, and had this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above other Priests, the Priesthood was Hereditary to his First Born, Tyed to his Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And would not the Dr. Blush, to Assert such like Prerogatives, as Applicable to the <hi>Proestos,</hi> or Supposed Fixed <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> in the Apostles Days? But he adds, <hi>Salmasius</hi> grants, <hi>That when the pretended Equality prevailed, a Preces had the</hi> Loce Primarius in Consessu <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Life — And that there are such palpable Evidences of the peculiar Honour and Iurisdiction of one of the Ecclesiastick Senat, in the Apostolick Age, that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst Sticklers for Parity cannot deny it.</hi> But if <hi>Salmasius</hi> assert, that while this pretended <hi>Proestos</hi> had the Chair, an <hi>Official Equality</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> was existent and prevailed, it is undenyable, that he denyes to this <hi>President</hi> or Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, such an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Preheminence and Dominion as the Dr. pleads for, and allows him only the Chair of <hi>Presidency,</hi> not <hi>Principality</hi>: A <hi>Moderator</hi>'s Chair, and no more. Again, I Challenge our Dr. to prove this Consequence. <hi>Salmasius</hi> asserts, that even an <hi>Official Equality</hi> prevailed among <hi>Pastors,</hi> when there was a <hi>Proestos</hi> set up, during Life: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he asserts, that this <hi>Proestos</hi> was <hi>ab initio,</hi> in the Apostolick Age, or approved by the Apostles. For what he adds, P. 29. <hi>That the Learnedst Pleaders for Parity, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a peculiar Iurisdiction appropriat to one of the Ecclesiastick Senat, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Age</hi>: He should have Named them, and where they assert this: For, as for what he adduces of <hi>Salmasius,</hi> I have shown how far it is from reaching his Conclusion. And <hi>Beza,</hi> I am sure (whom no doubt, the Dr. will owne, as an Eminent <hi>Pleader</hi> for <hi>Parity</hi>) condemns this Humane <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,</hi> as the <hi>Episcopus Humanus,</hi> distinct from the <hi>Divine,</hi> much more a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of Jurisdiction in one <hi>Pastor</hi> over another. For the Dr's Invidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Character of <hi>Sticklers for Parity,</hi> which he bestows upon <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers, the premised Account of them, discovers what a Black <hi>Theta</hi> he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58203:103"/>
marks himself with, who dare thus asperse the Body of Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Divines. No doubt, if they were such <hi>Sticklers</hi> for <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> or Preaching <hi>Presbyters,</hi> (for this is the <hi>Parity,</hi> which he thus igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly represents in such a Confused General) as he is for <hi>Imparity,</hi> and the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Hierarchy, their Stickling were not to be Valued.</p>
               <p>But what are these <hi>palpable Evidences,</hi> which convinces our greatest <hi>Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers? — Something,</hi> saith the Dr, <hi>that makes it evident beyond all Contradiction.</hi> Some mighty Evidences then we must expect. The first, which he addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is, <hi>That of the</hi> Apocalyptick Angels, <hi>among whom, he tells us, we justly reckon</hi> St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But, 1. How has he proved, that these <hi>Angels</hi> were <hi>single Presidents,</hi> and that the Term is not taken <hi>Collectively</hi>? 2. How does he prove, that such as acknowledge them <hi>single Persons,</hi> do hold them to be any more than <hi>Presidents pro tempore? Beza,</hi> I am sure, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges them only such. Whom the Dr, or any other, do reckon for the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> when <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the Epistle to that Church, is not the Question, but whom he can prove from Scripture, to have been such, and what the <hi>Bishops</hi> Character is in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Dr's. next supposed evidence, is drawn from <hi>the Epistles to</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>and the Catalogues of Bishops, succeeding to the Apostles in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sees.</hi> To which I <hi>Answer</hi> in short, First, That the Dr. can neither prove. 1. That the Apostles, or <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the Evangelists, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised an ordinary <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, to be continued in the Church. Nor, 2. Can he prove or conclude from these Catalogues, such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: Since (1) They are found to consist of Officers of diverse Cutts and unequal Authority. (2) Inconsistent and contradictory to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. (3) They are found resolving in Apostles or Evangelists, whose Office admitted of no Succession, and upon this very account, can found no shadow of an Argument for what he intends, far less, make the thing <hi>evident beyond contradiction.</hi> What the Dr. adds further in this <hi>Page, Of our concluding the Equality of Presbyters of the New Testament, from the Dichotomies used in Christian VVriters, and of the Ancients, dividing sometimes the Clergie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Orders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that nothing of moment was Canonically Determined in Ecclesiastick Meetings without their Bishops — That</hi> Cyprian <hi>compares the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Priesthood and Ministrations with the</hi> Aaronical: Is the same nauseat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated begging of the Question, with the former, wherewith, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of solid Scripture Proof of the <hi>Official imparity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> he fills up idle <hi>Pages.</hi> How often shall we tell him, that the point in question, is not what <hi>Dichotomies</hi> were used in Christian Writings, or who determined Canonically in Ecclesiastick Meetings, after the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Age? What Comparisons <hi>Cyprian, Clemens,</hi> or <hi>Origen</hi> used in setting out the New Testament Ministry? But what Answers the Dr. has to offer
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58203:103"/>
to the premised Scripture Arguments of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> for the <hi>Paritie</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter, Iure Divino</hi>? And what proof from Scripture, from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Doctrine and Practice, he can produce for such a Jurisdictional Power and Authority of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> under this Character, above the <hi>Pastor</hi> or preaching <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as he is bold to assert? We often tell him, that we plead other Grounds than his fancied <hi>Dichotomies.</hi> And tho that were made one Ground, and say further, he had disproved it, in these his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyful Tautologies and Repetitions, what says this to the many other Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Pleadings above rehearsed?</p>
               <p>But proceed we. <hi>P.</hi> 29.30. He presses thus his often Repeated Notion anent <hi>Dichotomies; Especially,</hi> says he, <hi>since the Ancients sometimes divide the Clergy into two Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet upon other occasions subdivide the highest Order, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the Bishop from subordinat Presbyters. Ans.</hi> He should have Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit these <hi>Ancients,</hi> and their words, thus distinguishing the <hi>Bishop</hi> under that Character, from all subordinate <hi>Presbyters.</hi> 2. The Dr. is obliged (this being the <hi>substratum</hi> and supposition of all his Answers, and insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Argument) to exhibit the Scriptures subdivision of the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, into higher and inferior Orders, and the Scripture distinction of such an ordinary Officer, as comes under the Character of <hi>Bishop,</hi> from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat Preaching <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pastors.</hi> As for determination in <hi>Councils,</hi> he did well to add to his bold Assertion, his two Limitations, of <hi>Matters of moment,</hi> and <hi>Canonically,</hi> which must be referred to his Explication. But we have made appear from the Learned <hi>Iunius</hi> and others, what was <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> interest in <hi>Councils</hi>; and he must be posed who concurred and Acted Authoritatively in that <hi>Council,</hi> Act. 15? As for the Comparison of the Old and New Testament Ministry, used by some of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> we have seen what a pitiful Argument it is, in reference to his Conclusion, and that the Comparison, is only with reference to a similitude, in point of of a Distinction and Subordination of Courts and Officers, not a Parity or Identity of both OEconomies: For, this were to make an illustrating similitude or allusion to infer an Identity; with absurdity, if the Dr. should draw upon himself, who will not hiss him? I desiderat still, and call for the Dr, s. Scripture-proof of the <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> Superiority to the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> according to the true State of the Question, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and supposition in his Answers, but there is no scent of it, tho I am still in Quest of the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. He is still repeating again his Notion and <hi>Phantastical</hi> Conceit of <hi>Dichotomies.</hi> Well, what more to this scope? <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> saith the Dr. <hi>divides the Clergy into two Orders, and so he doth the</hi> Jewish <hi>Ministry into Priests and Levites, tho in either there is no equality.</hi> But to this nauseous repeating Dr. I must Repeat again. 1. Tho he should exhibit <hi>Clemens</hi>'s
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58203:104"/>
Assertion of his Hierarchical <hi>Bishop</hi>; it touches not the Point in Question, which is anent a <hi>Scripture Assertion,</hi> of such an Officer, not what any <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Writers</hi> have <hi>Asserted.</hi> 2. He has not made appear, <hi>Clemens</hi>'s subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office into his fancied Orders, nor the Assertions of any Writers else to this purpose. For <hi>Tertullians</hi> Testimony, if it prove any thing, it proves too much, and beyond his Assertion, <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Deacons</hi> Power to Baptize, which the Dr. cannot own, without disowning the Scripture-accounts of this Office, and the whole Body of <hi>Protestant</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Divines.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with the Dr. P. 31. In stead of a solid Answer to our Scripture Arguments, for the <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or our demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scripture-proof of his supposed <hi>Imparity,</hi> I find the Dr. is still casting up his pityful recocted Crambe of <hi>Dichotomies,</hi> and telling us trifflling quibles of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>sense of the</hi> Seniores <hi>mentioned in his VVritings;</hi> he tells us, <hi>he is not at a Point in it, whether by</hi> Seniores, Tertullian <hi>understood all Presbyters, or those only advanced to the Episcopal Dignity</hi>: And what this signifies to the point in question often mentioned, the Appeal is made to all considering persons to Judge; And whether in such pretended Answers to our Scripture Arguments for <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government (long since offered to the view of the Learned World) and to our demand of a Scripture proof of his supposed Impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, this Man be not a poor Beggarly Trifler, and a Skirmisher with his own Shadow. Besides, <hi>Tertullian</hi> asserts, that [<hi>praesident probati quique Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niores</hi>] if the Dr. is not sure, but that such in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s sense, might be <hi>Pastors,</hi> he must acknowledge, that according to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> such presid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or had the Authority of a <hi>Proestos,</hi> in Church Judicatories, as were not of his Hierarchical Order: So, that he did not well to raise this fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ghost. What more to our Question? We are told next, That <hi>Clem. Alexan. Stromat. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>reckons up Three Orders of the Clergy.</hi> What then? We reckon up <hi>Pastors, Ruling Elders, Deacons.</hi> The question is, what Degrees he assigns of the <hi>Pastoral Office</hi>? And further, upon what Scripture VVarrand? <hi>How long will scorners delight in scorning, and fools hate Knowledge</hi>? VVhat more? Are we yet arrived at the Dr's. Answer to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Scripture Arguments, or his own Scripture Proofs of what he here beggs? No. We hear next, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> asserts the Episcopal Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But all who have read <hi>Cyprian,</hi> can tell him, that he also ownes the <hi>Presbyters</hi> as his <hi>Collegues, without whom he could do nothing</hi>; And therefore, that he owned no sole <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction.</hi> VVhat more? <hi>Polycarp</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Dr. <hi>who divids the Clergie into two Orders, in his Epistle to the</hi> Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians. VVhat will remedy this? VVhy? He recommends <hi>Ignatius</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, <hi>where the Apostolick Hierarchie is often mentioned.</hi> But what assurance gives the Dr. that these were his genuine Epistles, which now go under
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58203:104"/>
his Name, there being Passages in these Epistles, which the Dr. himself cannot but be ashamed of. But <hi>Polycarp,</hi> in the Dr's. Opinion, was a very modest humble Man, whose useual Stile was, Polycarp, <hi>and the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>that are with him.</hi> Which the Dr. will needs <hi>have to express his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Distinction from them.</hi> A proof, which, if you be a Friend, you may take off his Hand, when the poor empty Man has no better. I see it is now dangerous for any Minister to say or write, <hi>I and the Pastors that are with me,</hi> least the Dr. fasten an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Gloss upon it. The Dr. profoundly supposes, that nothing but an Episcopal Jurisdiction and Priority, could warrand this Phrase, and order of his Words: The contrary whereof, can be cleared, by so many Instances, as renders this Reason obviously ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. What more? we are told P. 32. <hi>That there can be nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, than to conclude a Parity among Priests, because the Ancients used the</hi> Jewish <hi>Phraseology, since they frequentlie assert the Iurisdiction of Bishops above Presbyters.</hi> But what can be <hi>more extravagant,</hi> than this Dr's. Trifling in this Debate, and telling over and over, <hi>ad nauseam usque,</hi> this pityful quible, not to the purpose and the point in question, and in stead of an Answer to our Nervous Scripture-Arguments for the <hi>Official Parity</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter, Iure Divino,</hi> presenting idle repeated Stories of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> Phraseologie, anent the New Testament Church Officers, which all Men of Sense, cannot but see, to be as far from the purpose, as East is from West; While pretending to run the Carrier of a fierce Assault upon <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he doth nothing but chase empty insignificant quibles, with his back to his Adversaries, and to the point, and in such a faint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of a closs and true Scripture-Dispute, upon this Question, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its genuine Nature and Terms, as all Judicious Persons, who read his <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> may see that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have this pityful cowardly Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in Chase, who dare not encounter them, and fairly deal Stroaks u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the point. The Scripture Assertion of the Authority and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> under that Character, over the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as an ordinary New Testament Officer, is that which we are still seeking from this Dr. not the Assertion of Humane <hi>Writers, Ancient</hi> or <hi>Modern,</hi> which last notwithstanding, so weak is his Cause, he has not produced.</p>
               <p>What more Answers? P. 32.33. Hermes <hi>contemporary with</hi> Clemens Romanus <hi>reproved their ambition, who in his time, strove for Dignitie and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</hi> Reader, here is a mighty proof of <hi>Bishops</hi> their <hi>Precedencie</hi> and <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Dignitie</hi> above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and Answer to our Arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Marr not your Modesty, in laughing at a Venerable Dr's. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Answers, while you read them. The Dr. tells you, <hi>he was contemporary with</hi> Clemens Romanus, <hi>who was of the Apostolick Age.</hi> And he will probably be got perswaded, that <hi>Clemens</hi> in this walkt up to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58203:105"/>
Sense of that Eminent and very Ancient <hi>Father,</hi> the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> who reproved <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> for his aspiring after this manner. But least you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse this Citation, to infer the dangerous consequence and <hi>Heresie</hi> of the <hi>official parity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the warry prudent Dr. precludes your mistake, by adding this <hi>Salvo, If there was no such Precedencie then in the Church, there was no Ground for his Reprehension.</hi> Mighty Reason! And well correspondent to his Reverend Father <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Sense and Pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Divines, for the <hi>Papacie.</hi> It should seem, Men were never tempted to strive for a Dignity and Preferment, in the Dr's. Sense, but what was Lawful; And that this very seeking and enquiry, proves the Lawfulness, and supposes it. It seems also, that a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was seeking a Lawful Preheminence, when he resisted the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the only fault was, that the Man did not modestly stay till the place was for him, and he for it. And in correspondence to the Dr's. Sense of this Reprehension, when <hi>Petter</hi> exhorted, not to be <hi>Lords</hi> over GOD's Heritage, he rebuked only an ambitious seeking of a Lawful <hi>Lordship.</hi> Our Saviour also, in His great Command and Prohibition above mentioned, relative to the Apostles seeking a <hi>Primacie</hi> and <hi>First Dignitie</hi> (as the Dr. calls it) supposed and established a <hi>Primacie</hi> in the Church; otherwise, ye will wrong and expose the Dr's. Consequence, if you admitt not this Reasoning: For, he will tell you, <hi>That else there was no ground for such a Reprehension.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, (P. 33.) The Dr. tells you, he is come (after this long Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and Pains, these Way-ward and Stubborn <hi>Presbyterians</hi> has put him to) <hi>and arrived at the Summ of all that these Reasonings amounts unto.</hi> We expect then, the Distilled Spirits, the Nerves of what goes before, Epitomized, if this be the <hi>Epilogue</hi> and Summ Total of what we have heard. Well, what is that <hi>Summ</hi> of all? Why? <hi>The</hi> Helenist Jews (<hi>the</hi> Grecian Jews) <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished the High Priest from the Levites, by the Name of Priest</hi> (for which again <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> stands Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cher) <hi>yet none will conclude, he had no Subordinat Priests; as now adays,</hi> Presbyterians <hi>argue upon the same Topick Sophistically,— for when the Priests were compared among themselves — then their Dignities and Subordinations were mentioned — when we compare the New Testament Priests and Deacons, we say Priests and Deacons, but when we compare them among themselves, we acknowledge their Subordinations.</hi> Really, if this be the Comprehensive Account of all, it is pity, the Dr. has spent so much Discourse upon it, and run himself out of Breath, to catch a Nothing. For, I am of the mind, that every <hi>Reader,</hi> will judge that this his <hi>Summ,</hi> might have very well served for <hi>all,</hi> and saved him the Labour of the Tedious Discourse, we have heard. But to the point, we often tell him, (I know not how often we must) that our Argument from <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. which all this his Quible main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58203:105"/>
aims at, is not merely drawn from the Division and <hi>Dichotomie</hi>: The Sense of the place, already exhibit by our Divines, evinces the contrary. Nay further, (which discovers this Mans Vanity, and Quibling Folly in this Matter) we acknowledge, that sometimes general Divisions of Church Officers in the New Testament, admits of a Subdivision, as particularly <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. is generally acknowledged; As also in that of <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. But this we assert, that these general Divisions and Subdivisions, and the several Recitations of the New Testament Church Officers, still supposes <hi>the Pastor-Bishop, or Preaching Presbyter, to be the highest ordinary Church Officer appointed of God,</hi> and that the <hi>Pastor</hi> or Preaching <hi>Presbyters</hi> Office, admits no Subdivision of Superior and Inferior Degrees, no more than the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi>: And we are still seeking from this Dr, the proof of his supposed Affirmative, that it doth. I confess, the Dr. Words it in so far well, <hi>When we compare,</hi> saith he, <hi>Priests among themselves, — we must acknowledge their Subordinations</hi> — We cannot help what the Dr. <hi>must,</hi> but he must have better Prespectives to give us, ere we can see his <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> in the New Testament: And as for his New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament <hi>Priests,</hi> we owne them not. We know there is an Holy Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Brotherhood, whereby the Scripture points out Believers joynt Priviledges, who are a Kingdom of Priests; and that there is a Glorious High Priest of our Profession, whose Priesthood is Unchangeable, and passes not to others: But for New Testament <hi>Priests,</hi> thus Characterized as Church Officers, we are yet to Learn their Warrand from our Dr, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others his Mysterious Points. I know the Prophecie of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, as to Ministers of the New, runs thus, <hi>I will take of them, for Priests and Levites</hi>; But, if the Dr. Strain this Allusion, to bear the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of a suteable Name of New Testament Officers, he will also upon <hi>Malachie</hi>'s Prophecy anent <hi>purifying the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>in order to offering a pure offering in in every place,</hi> draw the pretty <hi>Popish</hi> Conclusion, with his Friend <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> of a New Testament <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for his New Testament <hi>Priests.</hi> And really, when I consider his continued constant Designations of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel, after this manner, I do judge the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and he, are much one in this Sense and Conclusion: And that which follows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me; For, P. 33, 34. the Dr. tells us, <hi>That the Old Testament Priests, were by their offering Sacrifices, distinguished from the Levites; and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Priests of the highest and subordinat Order, are distinguished from the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, by their offering the Eucharistical Sacrifice.</hi> Now, we all know, that <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> are Correlates — But the Dr. knows, that his <hi>Novell</hi> Divines, the <hi>Protestants</hi> (tho they did pass with a Charitable Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, some of the <hi>Ancients</hi> Allusive Expressions this way, yet) do disowne the Name and Thing of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as appropriat to the Celebration of that Sacrament.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 34. The Dr. has not yet done with his <hi>Dichotomies</hi>: And the Sum of this Page is, The <hi>Iews used their</hi> Dichotomies <hi>of their Clergy, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Age — and the Bipartite or Tripartite Division upon this Ground, was used by</hi> Jewish <hi>and Christian Writers— yet these, who Reckon the two Orders, in other places, reckon up the Hierarchy of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> I have heard of a Beggar, who pleased himself, as possessing a great Sum, by telling a piece of Money often over. How often shall we have this more than recocted Crambe, these often boyled Colworts, repeated? I am of the mind, that <hi>Battologie,</hi> was never better exemplified, than in our Dr's Arguings. We are still seeking from our nauseous Dreaming Dr. a Bipartite or Tripartite Division of <hi>Pastors</hi> or Preaching <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the Scriptures and inspired Writings of the Apostles; And we do again, as often before, Challenge <hi>one Instance</hi> of this. We have already told him, and that not once, That we hold, that there is a Subordination of Officers, and Courts of Judicature, Represented in the New Testament; yea, and a tripartite Division of Officers, <hi>viz. Pastors, Ruling Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi>: But that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, Ordinary and Extraordinary, <hi>Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors,</hi> &amp;c. are of one <hi>Official</hi> Authority, and <hi>equal in their own kind,</hi> we maintain, and are still challenging his contrary proof. And to this Point, it is palpably impertinent to tell us of Ecclesiastical Writers, distinguishing <hi>Bishops, Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Besides, that the early <hi>Prostasie</hi> that obtained, and the <hi>Bishops Nominal</hi> distinction thence ensuing, might easily be productive of such a Division, or Phraseology, in some of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> as he mentions, who never had the Idea of his Hierarchy in their Head; and the Authority, which <hi>Presbyters</hi> are clearly found to exercise in Judicatories, after the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estos</hi> came in; together with the First <hi>Bishops</hi> acknowledgment of <hi>Presbyters</hi> collegiat Power with them (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> particularly) Besides, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Identity of the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as having one and the same Ordination, especially by <hi>Chrisostom</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> doth evince this beyond contradiction. I might add, that the Office of the <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Senior,</hi> who Rules only, acknowledged by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> as <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> have made appear, might easily in some Writers, have produced this Tripartite Division of <hi>Bishop, Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> wouthout the least Shadow of advantage to his Cause.</p>
               <p>The Dr. in the close of this <hi>Page,</hi> soares aloft in a Triumphing Vein; telling us, <hi>That we may easily perceive that our Argument against Episcopacy, founded upon</hi> Dichotomies, <hi>is not only weak, but foolish and extravagant.</hi> But truely, the Dr. in confining all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Arguments against <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> upon this head, to this one anent his fancied <hi>Dichotomies,</hi> and offering in Answer thereto, such trivial babling Repetitions, has discovered to all judicious Readers, that weakness, folly &amp; extravagancie, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58203:106"/>
to us. To Convince any Ingenuous Knowing person hereof, let it be considered, that he <hi>Cites Smectymnus, Ius Divin. Minist. Ang. The unbishop. of Tim. and Tit. Alt. Damasc.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dur.</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> He would be thought to answer these <hi>Authors</hi>; and their great Argument, he represents thus, That it is taken from the <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter.</hi> There is no doubt, but that this is one great Topick and Argument, and Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> makes use of that Term of <hi>Identity,</hi> in the Title of his <hi>Digression</hi> upon this head. But dare this Man say, or tho he should have the Brow to say it, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who ever Read so much as one, much less, all of these Authors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that it is a mere <hi>Nominal Identity,</hi> that they plead from, and not an <hi>Official,</hi> in all the parts and ingredients of the Office? Or, that the Strength of their Argument is drawn merely <hi>a confusione Nominum,</hi> as he expresses it; and not rather from many nervous Scripture grounds, which in the Texts mentioned by him, and other Paralels, do evince an Official Identity? Why then, bottoms he all his Answers and impertinent quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings upon this palpably false Supposition? To make what I assert, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to conviction, one of the Authors he names, <hi>viz: Ius Div. Minist. Ang.</hi> proposes the Question thus,
<q>We undertake to prove, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture Pattern, which is a perfect Rule, both for Doctrin and Government, a <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> are all one, not only in <hi>Name,</hi> but in <hi>Office</hi>; and that there is no such Officer in the Church, Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, as a <hi>Bishop</hi> over <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  </q>
Then they propose, no fewer than Nine nervous Scripture Arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all running to this issue, to prove an <hi>Official Identity</hi>: The Topick of the <hi>Fourth</hi> whereof, is thus proposed,
<q>They who have the same Name, the same qualifications for their Office, and the same Ordination, and the same work and duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, are one and the same Officer.</q>
Then subsuming, that thus it is in the Scripture account of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter.</hi> They sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join Scripture-proofs, to every one of these Clauses and Assertions, and thereupon conclud, that they are one and the same Officer. Now, upon this small view of but one of these Authors, let the World Judge of this Mans Impudence, in asserting, that not only, that Authors Arguments, but all the Arguments of the Authors he mentions, concluds only <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusione nominum</hi> (as he expresses it, in a distinct Character) and whether his founding of all his supposed confutation of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Arguments, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this supposition and quiblings about a <hi>Dichotomie,</hi> be not extravagancy with a Witness. Moreover, let the Serious &amp; Impartial, Judge, since these Authors he mentions, presents so considerable a Number of Scripture-Arguments, For that which this Man calls a <hi>New Foolish Opinion,</hi> in order to his design of making men believe he has fully Confuted them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of folly, whether he was not in Conscience and Reason, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58203:107"/>
fairly to present their Arguments to his <hi>Readers</hi> view, and offer formal <hi>Replys</hi> to them. I may further pose the Impartial <hi>Reader</hi> upon it, whether this Man, who has never encountered their Arguments, nor try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Strength in a fair and formal Dispute, and yet would fain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in this boasting <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> charging all their Arguments, with weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, folly and evtravagancy, has not Written himself a Fool of the first Magnitude, and a personat <hi>Thra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to proceed, our Dr. P. 35. Censures <hi>Blondel, Salmasius, Dallie, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he tells us, <hi>That this Opinion was never heard of before the days of</hi> Aerius. Good Mr. Dr. ye know the <hi>Answer</hi> of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines to the <hi>Papists</hi> Objection, <hi>where was your Religion, your Church and Doctrin before</hi> Luther? viz. <hi>That it was from the beginning, and is to be found in Scripture.</hi> The same I affirm of the <hi>Official Identity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter:</hi> And many Learned <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines think they have made it good, whom the Dr. may please to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, if his leasure from <hi>Pamphleting</hi> work, together with some piece of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty interest, and prejudicat preoccupation of Principles, will admit of the perusal.

point. The Dr. might likewise have found, that <hi>Michael Medina Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sacr. Hominum Orig. &amp; continen. Cap.</hi> 5. holds, that not only <hi>Ierom,</hi> but also <hi>Ambros.

P. 35. <hi>Apostle, Bishop and Presbyter, are sometime remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked without a Distinction, yet the Government of one among many, is particularly demonstrated.</hi> This is somewhat obscure.

For the <hi>Government of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many,</hi> in his Sense, I do still call for the Dr's Proof, but have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>We are told next, (P. 35, 36.) <hi>That our Saviour is called an Apostle,</hi> Heb. 3. <hi>That the Names seems restrained to the Twelve, and yet</hi> Matthias <hi>is called an Apostle, that the Name was bestowed on several others, besides the Twelve, as</hi> Paul, Barnabas, Adronicus, Junius, Epaphroditus: <hi>That our Saviour is called a Bishop,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.25. <hi>And the Government of the Apostles, Episcopacy,</hi> Act. 1.20. <hi>That Priests of the Apostolick Power and Iurisdiction, are called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; That thus all the Fathers understand</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1. Tit. 1.7. <hi>That the Bishops,</hi> Philip. 1.1. <hi>are by</hi> Chrysost. OEcum. Theoph. Theodo. <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Priests</hi> (still Priests) <hi>of the second Order: For, they conclude</hi> Epaphrod. <hi>Bishop of</hi> Philippi <hi>from</hi> Philip. 2.25. The Dr. is never wearied of this <hi>Nominal</hi> Argument, which seems one of <hi>Achillean</hi> Strength to him. I am sorry he is put to so much Pains in Print, to raise such Formidable Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against this <hi>New Notion,</hi> and am afraid, some Facetious Witts will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he is but getting himself a Heat, in Cudgelling and Beating a Man of Straw of his own Upsetting. But in short, it passes much my Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, what he would make of all this, if not to prove that palpably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Officers, do sometimes come under general Names: And who knows not, that this Argument and Answer is still <hi>ex ignoratione Elenchi?</hi> None of us doubts of this, which he offers in <hi>Thesi</hi>; But the Dr. will easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that these Officers mentioned, have, in the Scripture Accounts, their Marks of Distinction clearly set down, which makes it evident, that their Communicating in the same general Name, will not conclude an <hi>Identity in the Office</hi>: And thus the Dr. and we are easily agreed in the Application of the Answer, when he has exhibit to us, such Scripture Discriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Office of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pastor,</hi> or Preaching <hi>Presbyter,</hi> such a clear <hi>Official</hi> Imparity and Difference, as is betwixt the Office of an <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and betwixt our Saviours Apostolate, and that of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and betwixt his <hi>Episcopacy</hi> or Overseeing Care, and that of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. For the Denomination of <hi>Apostle,</hi> I need not tell one, who sets a <hi>D. D.</hi> to his Name, in the Frontispiece of his Book, how <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines understand the Name, properly taken, and do define the Office as distinct
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58203:108"/>
from all others: That first, <hi>Matthias,</hi> and thereafter <hi>Paul</hi> were added to the Number of Apostles, none doubts: That the Name is sometimes taken improperly, when attribute to certain Persons, is as little doubted. As for <hi>Adronicus, Iunius,</hi> who are said to be of <hi>Note among the Apostles,</hi> the Phrase imports in the Sense of some, that they were well known to the Apostles; Some take them to be of the Number of the Seventy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Others to be of the Number of the One Hundred and Twenty, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. Or of these Converted by <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.14. See <hi>Pool Annot.</hi> That 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.7. are understood of <hi>Priests</hi> of the first Order, with Apostolick Power by all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> must pass current only, with those, who will take the Dr's <hi>ipse dixit</hi> for Proof: But let them at their Leasure, Pose him, whether St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> and <hi>Ierom,</hi> upon these Passages, were of that Judgement, and whether he reckons them among the <hi>Fathers.</hi> That the <hi>Fathers</hi> after mentioned upon <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. Understood it of the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>second Order,</hi> he should have proved from their Words, and that they understood <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> to be <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Philippi</hi> from <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.25. Our <hi>Translators</hi> renders it with the current of Protestant Divines (as I have made good) <hi>your Messenger,</hi> which the Context convincingly discovers, <hi>viz.</hi> The Messenger <hi>that ministred to</hi> Paul's <hi>wants.</hi> But the Dr. has no shift, but <hi>to censure them as following</hi> Beza: A pityful shift indeed. The <hi>Episcopal</hi> Translators, who in their Translation, so Zealously patronize that Cause, that the Term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is with the utmost endeavour translated to that Scope, yet are so befooled (in the Dr's. Sense) as to translate this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, so advantagious to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> contrary to the Sense of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> so well seen in that Language, and all this to follow a <hi>Presbyterian Novelist.</hi> But the Dr. preferrs <hi>Salmasius</hi> to his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Masters, who thinks the word <hi>Apostle,</hi> signifies <hi>Legatum Dei ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>: He is now become of sudden Fond of <hi>Salmasius</hi>: But should have given us a better Account, than a bare naming of <hi>Walo Messalinus,</hi> putting us to search all the Book, in order to an enquiry of what he here asserts. I might tell him further, that the Complex Phrase [<hi>your Messenger</hi>] and the Explication of [<hi>ministring to</hi> Paul's <hi>wants</hi>] sufficiently restricts the Term <hi>Apostle,</hi> in this place, tho it were granted, that ordinarly it is thus taken.</p>
               <p>But one Word more, before I part with the Dr. on this Passage: If, in the Sense of these <hi>Fathers,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> mentioned in the Inscription of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, were <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>second Order</hi> only, and <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> the <hi>Chief Priest</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi>; Then 1. It seems the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was somewhat rude in his Salutation, to mention only these inferior underling <hi>Priests,</hi> with the lowest petty <hi>Deacons,</hi> passing quite over the <hi>High Priest,</hi> without any Hint or Note of Distinction. 2. It seems that either <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or some of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58203:108"/>
his late <hi>Episcopal</hi> Pleaders, are pityfully bemisted, who do cite <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as holding that the <hi>Bishops</hi> saluted by <hi>Paul,</hi> were not <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Church, but extraneous <hi>Bishops</hi> accidentally present; Thus the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>three Dialogues,</hi> P. 9. But <hi>Theodoret,</hi> saith the Dr. <hi>did judge, that when in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Age, Bishops were named as contradistinct from Priests, they were called Apostles.</hi> Behold our critical Dr. censuring again the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Salutation; It seems also there were none of the Apostles of the Dr's. Mould, when this Apostle gave his last Farewel to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> nor in the Church, which <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to; For, Ministers there, are called to <hi>act the Bishops,</hi> and nothing is heard of an <hi>Apostle-bishop</hi>: And really I think this inadvertant Man, <hi>Paul,</hi> is further to be blamed, in that describing of set purpose, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> and in the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> which are in the Dr's. Judgement, the great Charter of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Duties of Church Officers, he was so leavened with his <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Dichotomies,</hi> that he passes quite over in silence, the <hi>High Priest</hi> &amp; <hi>Apostle-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> whose Office was chiefly under this Name and Character to have been discribed, that the Churches then, and in after ages, together with all inferior <hi>Priests,</hi> might understand their Duty towards them: But since, in all their Descriptions, Recitals, and Accounts of Church Officers, he and other Apostles, were so foregetful, as to pass over in silence, the absolute <hi>High-priest</hi> of the Christian Church, the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> notwithstanding that the <hi>Iewish</hi> OEconomy of Church Government was never repealed, but still standing as a Patern to the New Testament Church, it is no wonder that they fell into this Mistake also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 37. He tells us, <hi>That he only mentions this transiently, not insisting upon it.</hi> What this extends to, is somewhat dubious; many, it is like, will be of Opinion (of whom I am one) that what ever he has offered hitherto, is a Digression, and but <hi>obiter</hi> to the point. But his business, he tells us, at present, <hi>is to prove that community of Names will not prove community of Offices.</hi> Truely, if this be all his business, he is a mere <hi>Officiperda,</hi> and has foregot his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Errand in this eloborat <hi>Pamphlet</hi>: For, no <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ever concluded this, from the mere community of Names simplely, and abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other Grounds, drawen from the Scope and Circumstances of such places, as we do plead from Scripture upon this Point, and from many other clear Scripture Arguments, long since exhibite to him, in the Books, which he mentions, and there needs no more, than the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to convince any person, that he is acting the <hi>Thraso,</hi> in this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Confutation of the same, which doth rather confirm, than weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the perswasion of any Man of Sense, who have perused these Authors. The Dr. tells us <hi>(ibid.) That</hi> Peter <hi>calls himself a Presbyter.</hi> Well, if this Apostle writing to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and dehorting them from acting the <hi>Bishops,</hi>

and Lording over the Flock, put himself, as to an ordinary Office and Ministry <hi>Pastoral,</hi> among the number, making this one of his Arguments; It is evident that he thus asserts their proper Succession to him, tho not to <hi>his Apostolat,</hi> yet to <hi>his Pastoral Office of feeding by the Word and Discipline</hi>: For, his Command imports both. But why did he not address the <hi>Chief Bishop,</hi> or <hi>High-priest,</hi> under the Apostolick Designation, after this manner? [<hi>The Apostle and inferior Presbyters among you, I exhort, who am also an Apostle</hi>] or thus [<hi>The Super-eminent Bishop and Presbyters I exhort, who also am a Bishop</hi>] But the Dr's. correcting information, is come far too late to him. I might further tell him, that when he shall exhibite as clear a distinction betwixt the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as there is betwixt the Office of <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> then, and not till then, his paralel Argument will appear of some force, which he draws from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> designing themselves <hi>Elders,</hi> and shall be acknowledged conclusive to his Scope.</p>
               <p>The Dr. will next preoccuppy our Argument from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. And tells us, <hi>That the Presbytrie mentioned in that place, was a Senat, composed of Apostles and other Priests, but whether of the first or second Rank, he is not certain.</hi> And really, the Dr, in my poor Judgment, might have added, whether there were any other Apostles in that <hi>Senat,</hi> than the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually uncertain: And let me humbly intreat his <hi>Reverence,</hi> by his next, to give us an Account of the Scripture Grounds of his Certainty of the one, rather than of the other. That the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was present, and concurred in this <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> I know is pleaded by his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Brethren; tho Collating the two places, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. the different Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Some have alledged, that by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie,</hi> we are to understand the <hi>Office</hi>: Which Pleaders, have been long since told, that the Office has no Hands to lay on. But that other <hi>Apostles</hi> were there than <hi>Paul,</hi> is a Notion, I am sure, much, if not only, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Dr's Fertile (that I say not Fond) Invention.

But let us hear the Dr's Argument upon these Passages; He tells us, <hi>It is evident from</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6 <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>was of the Number; and that in the other place,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>he is exh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58203:109"/>
to his Scope and Conclusion, it would have deserved our Consideration. However, to prevent his Mistake, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have long since told him, 1. That the different Phrase in both places, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the second, makes <hi>Paul</hi>'s presence, at least, Debateable, but clearly proves, that the Laying on of the <hi>Presbytries</hi> Hands is evidently Diversified in a distinct <hi>Comma,</hi> as a distinct Priviledge, in its self considered, from the Gifts <hi>given by Prophesie,</hi> and ascribed to the <hi>Laying on of</hi> Pauls <hi>Hands.</hi> And 2. That tho <hi>Paul</hi>'s presence in this Action were admitted, it clearly proves, that even an Apostles Laying on of Hands upon an Evangelist, did not exclude the <hi>Presbytries</hi> Authoritative Imposition: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (by a clear Consequence, from the Greater to the Less) that Priviledge, much more belongs to them now, with relation to ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> or Ministers, when the Office of Apostles and Evangelists is ceased. But, if I might be bold with a Person of the Dr's Reverence, I would ask him this Question: He holds <hi>Timothy</hi> was Consecrat a <hi>Bishop</hi>; here we find a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> Laying Hands upon him with <hi>Paul,</hi> whom the Dr. holds to be here Acting the <hi>Bishop</hi>; How comes he then to say, <hi>It is uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Presbyters or Priests of the first or second Rank</hi>? Really, if he be uncertain in this, he holds by clear Consequence, that mere <hi>Presbyters,</hi> might have laid on Hands upon a <hi>Bishop</hi> at his Consecration, yea, and this by Apostolical Warrand, tho <hi>Bishops</hi> superior to them, were present at this great Work: And what Consequence in Doctrine and Practice, this will further amount to, I leave to the Dr's Melancholick Reflection. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in mentioning this last Text, the Dr. says, <hi>He is put in mind to stir up the Gift, which he received by the Laying on of St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Hands</hi>: He has also told us, and positively asserted, that this <hi>Senat</hi> was composed of Apostles in the plural: How many there were, I think, the Dr. found it hard to determin; but in this, he is clear and positive, that <hi>there were other Apostles with</hi> Paul, and consequently of equal official Authority with him in this Action. Now, upon this, I would desire his grave Judgment, how comes this Apostle to mention the laying on of his own hands sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of no Apostles else? We find him so humble an Apostle and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishop,</hi> that in the inscription of several Epistles, he takes in the Inferior <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> with himself; whence then comes this singularity of expression, herein attributing to himself solely, what was equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to other Apostles concurring with him? What he adds further <hi>of the Work and Ministry of Apostles and Pastors, sometimes exprest by the General term</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; I have already made appear, how insignificant it is to his scope, so that it is here Idlely repeated.</p>
               <p>We are next told (P. 38.) <hi>That if any infer the Community of Offices from the Community of Names, he confounds the highest and lowest Rank of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:58203:110"/>
The <hi>Presbyeerians</hi> are of his mind, when the inference is from <hi>a mere Community of Names,</hi> while the Offices are otherwise distinguished in Scripture, but when both Name and Office in all essentials thereof, are i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentified, they think the Argument from hence for an <hi>Official Parity,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes well; and they pity this Dr's continued Repetition of his mistake, in stead of an Answer to their Argument. He tells us next, <hi>That it is certain, the Offices were carefully distinguished and separated in those days.</hi> This is true when understood of Church Officers in general; and hence we conclude that the Spirit of God has left us clear distinguishing marks of the Superiority and distinction of such Officers, as do communicat in General Names with (the inferior; and this to prevent the mistake which he instances: And therefore, unless the Dr. will fasten a blasphemous Reflection upon the Spirit, who dictat the Scriptures, he is obliged to let us see therein the distinguishing marks and Characters fixt to the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pastors Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> to shew the <hi>Official difference</hi> of the one from the other: And this he cannot but acknowledge necessary to prevent the bad consequence of <hi>an Official Identity,</hi> drawn from the Community of Names. And no doubt, had he as sincerely designed to give and receive light in this Point, as to present a vain <hi>prattling Pamphlet,</hi> he would have examined the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Arguments for the <hi>Official Identity</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to produce the Scripture distinguishing differences, discriminating the one from the other.</p>
               <p>What more? We are told (ibid.) <hi>That the Humility of Superior Officers, hindered them not to distinguish themselves from their subordinat Brethren.</hi> Right; <hi>Paul,</hi> no doubt owns, and strenuously pleads for the Authority of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Office, notwithstanding of his often instanced Humble Respect to Officers of inferior Rank. What then? Why? <hi>Bishops in the second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury transcribed this, tho they preserved the distinction betwixt Priests</hi> (still Priests) <hi>of the first and second Order.</hi> But we are wearied, seeking from this Dr. the Scripture Distinction of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> into a first and second Order: Besides, it is odd, that no <hi>Bishops</hi> were so modest and humble in this point, and prudent withal, but those of the second <hi>Century.</hi> We must know, the Dr. prefaced thus, that he might tell us, <hi>That they studied humble modest Expressions, and of Condiscension,</hi> which he instances <hi>in the Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Polycarp's <hi>Epistle to the</hi> Philippians. But since this modest Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, the Dr. will acknowledge, <hi>did not prejudge his care to distinguish the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Bishops and Priests, of Priests of the first and second Rank,</hi> he must either exhibit this in the place cited, or he puts this Reflection upon <hi>Polycarp</hi>: He may also remember, how that afterward (p. 84.) he makes <hi>Augustine</hi> to pass from his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority, in a Complement to <hi>Ierom,</hi> in his foolish gloss on that passage of Ep. 19.

               <p>The Dr. (P. 38.) drawing to an end of these impregnable reasonings, must needs give us a touch of his pulse and humour, in concluding with high Rantings; <hi>This Argument,</hi> he tells us, <hi>he has considered the more carefully, in that he Finds it over and over again in all the Writings of the Ecclesiastick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, as their first and last refuge.</hi> Truely, if these Disputers he calls so, had as inspidily proposed it, far less repeated it so often, as he has Parat-like, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the Character of <hi>Ecclesiastick Levellers,</hi> which he bestows upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; I think indeed his experience; together with that of his Fellow, has taught him, that in this respect, they deserve it, <hi>Viz.</hi> That their nervous Scripture Reasonings, which he dare not encounter, has so levelled and laid along, and aboard the high Top-gallant of the Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> he so zealously fences for, as all his Wit and Learning, will never erect it again: which in this place, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly apparent, since among the many Argumnts used by them, he has upon this head insisted so long upon (if not solely singled out) this one, anent <hi>the Community of Names of Bishop and Presbyter,</hi> which is none of the most considerable; and after he has disguised it, and spent Eight or Nine Pages, in exhibiting the outmost of his wit to answer the same, the expense of all his endeavours, has only amounted to such pityful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Repetitions, Battologies, and beggings of the Question, that it is evident, this one Argument has Mastered him, and with its Weight, born down his poor strength to the ground.</p>
               <p>The Dr. adds (<hi>P.</hi> 38.39.) <hi>That nothing is more frivolous and triffling than this Argument — that the Names of the lowest Officers of the Christian Church were frequently assumed by the highest; and distinction of Offices is rather to be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from peculiar Ministries and Acts of Iurisdiction, than any Names we can fix on.</hi> But what can be more triffling and frivolous, than this Dr's endless canting over and over this Quible and begged Supposition, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us any shadow of the <hi>peculiar Ministries and Iurisdiction,</hi> distinguishing in Scripture, the <hi>Bishop</hi> from the <hi>Pastor or Presbyter</hi>?</p>

<q>That whatever may be said for <hi>Prelacy</hi> out of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> yet (as they have proved) it hath no foundation in the Scriptures — That, as in the Matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, Christ brought the <hi>Iews</hi> to the first institution of Marriage, so we must in point of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> say as Christ [<hi>from the Beginning it was not so</hi>] Thereafter, they cite several of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> in proof of this, that it is not the Custom or Practice of the Church, but the Divine Scriptures; which must herein determin us, and that all Human Writings must be examined by the <hi>Canonical,</hi> and Customs never so ancient, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being perfect as to all <hi>Credenda, Petenda, Facienda.</hi> In the second <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> so far are they from making the most ancient Testimonies, or Practice of the Church, the Foundation of our Government, that they affirm and prove by clear Testimonies and Instances, that many Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions crept into the Church, in the Infancy of it, and were gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally received as Apostolical Traditions, which yet <hi>Episcopal</hi> Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confess to be Errors; instancing the <hi>Millenary</hi> Error, with diverse others: Whence, they conclude— That there are Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, pretended to be grounded upon Apostolical Institution, which are rather to be accounted as <hi>Apocryphal.</hi>

Had he gone to <hi>Iamaica,</hi> or to some places; where neither the <hi>Persons,</hi> nor <hi>Matter</hi> he speaks of, was ever heard or known, he might hope to get this believed.

               <head>CHAP. <hi>III.</hi> Wherein the Dr's <hi>Absurd Description</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Function,</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Divines,</hi> is exposed; Together with his <hi>Assertion</hi> about the <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bishops</hi> to <hi>Apostles,</hi> in a proper Formal Sense: His Opinion loaded with Gross and Palpable Absurdities.</head>
               <p>IN this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Dr. having told us, <hi>That he has Examined our most plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Pretences for Parity</hi> (And what Scripture Arguments, he has Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, let any judge) gives us Encouragement, by undertaking <hi>Truly to State the Controversie,</hi> (I am sorry, he has not done it sooner) No doubt, all will acknowledge this to be, what he stands obliged to. But to Trace his Steps, and Examine him clossly. 1. I am agreed with him in this, <hi>That the Government of the Christian Church, has been established and fixed by Christ and his Apostles, to continue to the end, and who oppose this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58203:113"/>
are Schismaticks.</hi> 2. For what he adds, (P. 95.) <hi>That it is agreed there was an Hierarchy under the Old Testament, the High Priests having a Superiority and Iurisdiction over inferior Priests.</hi> I must tell him, that we do hold, with all our Divines, that this Superiority was such a fixed Presidency, as had adjoyned thereunto some special Ministrations peculiar to it: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we hold, that both the one and the other was <hi>Typical,</hi> and also such, as did not encroach upon the ordinary Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or invade their Decisive Suffrage; as <hi>Iunius</hi> particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves. Our Dr's Inference, <hi>That Subordination of one Priest to another, is not simplely unlawful</hi>; if meant of a Subordination of Officers in general, is admitted; If, of one <hi>Pastor</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> in Point of <hi>Official</hi> Authority, it is a bad Inference, and a Begging of the Question, which is not about, what may be simplely lawful or unlawful in this Case, but upon the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Gods Institution, in the New Testament OEconomy and Government. The Dr's Distinction <hi>(ibid.) of the Apostles Ordinary, Permanent, Essential Power, and their Extrinsick Extraordinary Priviledges — suteable to the first Plantation of Churches,</hi> is in general accorded: But his Application and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication subjoyned, <hi>viz. That by the first, they were distinguished from all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat Ecclesiastick Officers, in the Christian Church</hi>; is that which I deny: And that upon this ground: That Power, which was Ordinary, Permanent and Essential, behoved to be so <hi>eminenter,</hi> in the Apostles, as it was to be transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to standing Officers, who were to be Invested with the same Ordinary, Essential, Permanent Power, else the Dr's assertion cannot subsist, that this Power was ordinary and permanent in its nature, or a Power necessary for the Churches Preservation, when the Apostles, at first Cloathed with it, were gone off: And therefore, to be <hi>Transmitted to successive Officers,</hi> consequently, these ordinary succeeding Officers were, <hi>in this equal to them,</hi> when cloathed with this Power, and invested therein; And by further necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, the Apostles were not by this essential necessary Power, <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all Subordinat Ecclesiastick Officers,</hi> it being such, as the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es subsistence required the same in all times: And besides, these succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers, when invested with this ordinary Power, were still subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to them, <hi>as Apostles, and cloathed with that formal Office and Authority.</hi> I know, that in this Phrase of <hi>Subordinat Ecclesiastick Officers,</hi> the Dr. excluds the <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the Series of his Reasoning, that he may take them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of a <hi>supposed Apostolical ordinary Power over Pastors:</hi> But how absurdly and inconsequentially, as well as cross to the Sense of sound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, in this Point, is already evident, and shall yet further appear.</p>
               <p>To proceed, the Dr. tells us, <hi>That by the second</hi> (i. e. <hi>their extrinsick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary priviledges, suted to the First Plantation of Churches</hi>) <hi>they were in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to exercise their Authority with greater Success, in the Conversion of Infidels,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58203:113"/>
in the Government of Churches.</hi> Wherein I differ from him in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is, that he makes their Extraordinary Apostolical priviledges, necessary only for the <hi>bene esse,</hi> which were necessary <hi>Simpliciter,</hi> for the Planting and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches, in that infant State thereof: The very exercise of their Apostolical Authority, as such, did consist in exerting these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary priviledges: For, thus, their Mission, their Gifts, their extensive Power, essential to the Apostolick Office, taken in a formal sense, Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the founding and watering of the Churches, in that Infant-state of Christianity, the Establishing the Gospel Ordinances therein, and all its ordinary standing Officers. I must then mind the Dr. that when he speaks of the Apostles ordinary, permanent, essential Power, by <hi>Essential,</hi> he must not, nay, cannnot understand that Power, which is <hi>Essential to them, as Apostles</hi> strictly, or under that reduplication, <hi>qua</hi> Apostles; For, then, their Office were not extraordinary, but a standing Office to be succeeded to, in its intire Nature formally, as they were invested with it, and did exercise it, which is cross to that Sense of the Apostolick Office, exhibit by <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, as I shall further make appear. The Dr. will needs distinguish, <hi>their Essential Apostolick Office from their extraordinary Prerogatives, their transient temporary Priviledges, who were the first Apostles, and were Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the exigences of the First Christian Mission.</hi> Wherein he speaks confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For, 1. These Prerogatives suted to the Churches First exigence, were in such manner suted, as was the very Office it self, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently were Essential ingredients thereof, for this end. Hence. 2. The Essential Office of the Apostolat, as such, or taken in a proper formal Sense, could admit of no such spliting and distinction, unless the Dr. will split and distinguish the <hi>Essence,</hi> which he should know consists in <hi>indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili. The Essential Apostolick Office,</hi> the Dr. tells us (<hi>P.</hi> 96.) <hi>is necessary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramanent, perpetual,</hi> citing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. [<hi>Lo, I am with you, alway even unto the end of the World</hi>] Hence, in his Sense, the Command and Promise in that place, imports the standing Essential Office of Apostolat to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> — What Harmony this keeps with the Sense of <hi>Protestant</hi> Interpreters, let all judg. <hi>Pool</hi> tells us,
<q>The Promise imports his presence to the end, with his Ministers, Preaching, Baptizing, Teaching to observe what he has Commanded. That it relates to Gospel Ministers, in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, as the Apostles successors; thus the <hi>English Notes, and Belgick</hi> Divines.</q>
But that it imports a standing Apostolick Office to the end, no sound <hi>Protestant</hi> ever dreamed.</p>
               <p>To proceed, <hi>to make this appear the more,</hi> saith the Dr. (<hi>ibid.</hi>) <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles as such, were formally and essentially distinguished from all other Ecclesiast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick subordinat Officers.</hi> This indeed makes it appear more, if one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Proposition will prove another: For, if the Apostles were For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58203:114"/>
and Essentially, <hi>i. e.</hi> in respect of their essential formal Office, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from all inferior Officers, all Officers, who were not in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per formal Sense <hi>Apostles,</hi> How could any succeed them in this proper formal Office? And consequently, How could that Office be permanent? It being certain, that such Functions, wherein they were to be succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not be their Characteristick <hi>as Apostles,</hi> and their <hi>mark of distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from succeeding Officers.</hi> For instance, the Function of Preaching and Baptizing, with the appendant proportioned ordinary power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a Work and Office, wherein they were to be succeeded. The Apostles were at first enjoyned <hi>[go Teach, Baptize, and Disciple the Nations] Paul</hi> enjoyned to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to Feed and Rule by the Word and Discipline, within their Percinct; Hence these Duties simplely consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not be that wherein they were distinguished from inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. For 1. In respect of this <hi>Pastoral</hi> Work, both the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> owned themselves, as <hi>Co-presbyters,</hi> which could have no good Sense, if in this they were distinguished from all others. 2. Hence this distinguishing <hi>Criterion</hi> had then evanished, when inferior Officers had it; So, that the Dr. in his <hi>Series</hi> of Reasoning, is driven upon this <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Charybdis,</hi> either to say, that their <hi>Essential Office</hi> perished with themselves, and consequently, was <hi>not permanent,</hi> in opposition to what he asserts (<hi>P.</hi> 95.) or else, in respect thereof, they were not <hi>formally and essentially distinguished from inferior Officers,</hi> in contradiction to what he asserts (<hi>P.</hi> 96.) I know the Dr's tacite Evasion is, that he supposes the <hi>Bishops,</hi> not to be <hi>Subordinat Officers,</hi> which, how cross it is to the <hi>Series</hi> and Contexture of his Reasoning, as well as the Sense of sound Divines, we shall further m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke appear. The difference of their Office, from that which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and formally Apostolick, being so palpable, that himself is forced to place a Distinction betwixt the Function of the one and the other, yea, and calls them a sort of <hi>secondary Apostles</hi>; Thus distinguishing them from those he would have to be <hi>Primary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Dr. will now enquire <hi>(ibid.) What distinguished the Apostles from the Seventy two, from</hi> Presbyters <hi>in the Modern Notion</hi> (as he speaks) (I could wish he had exhibite and refined his antique Notion) <hi>from</hi> Deacons <hi>and other Offieers of the New Testament.</hi> He undertakes, 1. To exhibite the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>'s Account of the <hi>Apostolick Office,</hi> and tells us, <hi>That the</hi> Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and <hi>and</hi> Socinians, <hi>contrary to the uniform Testimony of</hi> Antiquity, <hi>affirm, that the</hi> Apostolick Office <hi>is ceased as extraordinary, that the Apostles were distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from Subordinat Ecclesiasticks, by infallibility in Preaching, their power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, their being immediatly called by our Saviour to the Apostolat, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited and unconfined Commission, to propagat the Gospel among all Nations.</hi> This is such Stuff, as I dare challenge and appeal all <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58203:114"/>
Divines, to give Judgment and Character upon the person who presents it, which I am sure, will be such, as will fasten upon him an infamous <hi>Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>: Nor shall I here much medle with, or stand upon the shameless Man his comparing us to, and ranking us with the blasphemous <hi>Socinians,</hi> in this point, citing their <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechism, <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all, that are but acquaint in the least, with the <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine in this point, I shall exhibit in some few Instances, their Sense of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick</hi> and <hi>Pastoral Office</hi>: And of a vast Number, shall instance but a few.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>

They reckon among extraordinary Officers, that of the Apostolat, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Prophets and Evangelists [<hi>quorum vocatio,</hi> say they, <hi>fuit temporaria — sub novo faedere ad Ecclesiae Dilatandae propagationem ordinata</hi>] <hi>whose Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was temporary or transient,</hi> as being ordained and appointed for the Propagation of the Church of the New Testament. <hi>Thes.</hi> 18. They shew the ordinary Vocation to be that, whereby Officers with ordinary Gifts performs the ordinary and Common Service of the Church—such as that of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> — who promot the Edification of the Church, through all Nations, according to Christs Promise — [<hi>a temporibus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolorum per totum terrarum orbem dispersi, edificationem quibus libet in locis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movendam usque ad finem mundi locum habebit juxta Christi promissionem,</hi> Matth. 28.20. <hi>Ite &amp; Docete,</hi> &amp;c.] As being sent from the times of the Apostles, for the Edification of the Church, in every place, to the end of the World, according to Christs Promise, <hi>Go teach all Nations.</hi>
                  </q>
Where it's evident, that the Apostolick Office, <hi>as such, in universum,</hi> is by them held to be <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and that the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> are <hi>their Successors,</hi> as ordinary Ministers appointed for propagating the Church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motting its Edification to the end of the World, and that upon the Ground of, and according to that same very Promise, which this <hi>Pamphleter</hi> pleads, to prove the standing Office of Apostolat to the End.
<q>Thereafter, having noticed (<hi>Thes.</hi> 19.) That the Apostle having <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. placed the three Extraordinary Officers in the first Rank, they add (<hi>Thes.</hi> 20.)

And here I appeal to all Men, whether the learned <hi>Professors,</hi> offer not the same Description and Characteristicks of the Apostolick Office, which this Man makes the Opinion of the <hi>Scots Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians.</hi> Further, after the Description of the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Office of <hi>Evangelists</hi> (<hi>Thes.</hi> 23.) The ordinary <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office, is thus described (<hi>Thes.</hi> 25.)

                     <hi>(Pastores erant verbi divini dispensatores, certis Ecclesiis docendis ac regendis ab Apostolis &amp; Evangelistis praefecti)</hi> That the <hi>Pastors</hi> were Dispensers of the Word, appointed for Governing and Teaching particular Churches by the Apostles and Evangelists.

That the Prophets, Apostles, and Evangelists were the three degrees of extraordinary Ministers, of whom the Apostles had the first place; Having these Prerogatives beyond others, which they thus recite. 1. (<hi>Quod a Domino nostro Iesu Christo immediate vocati, &amp;c.</hi>) That they were called immediatly by Jesus Christ, to the Office of Preaching the Gospel to all Nations, citing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.19, 2.

Here again, the Apostles <hi>Extraordinary Office,</hi> is asserted by the <hi>Saumer University,</hi> and that with the same <hi>Ingredients,</hi> &amp; upon the like grounds, as we do hold.

<q>He proceeds to Describe <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> whom the Church can never want; in the Explication, he tells us, that [<hi>a praecedentibus differunt Duratione</hi>] They differ from Apostles, Prophets and Evangelists, <hi>in Continuance, as being of constant Necessity to the Church.</hi>
                  </q>
Thus, Denying in Contradiction to our Dr, the Permanency of the Apostolick Office.
<q>Afterwards he adds, [<hi>Officia Pastorum indicantur, &amp;c.</hi>] That there are four Branches of the <hi>Pastors,</hi> work and Office; The Interpretation of Scripture, the Ordering of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Discipline, the Administration of the Sacraments, together with Authoritative Admonitions and Exhortations: Shewing thereafter, that the <hi>Pastors</hi> do Succeed to what is Ordinary in the Apostolick and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Office: And their <hi>Episcopal</hi> Pastoral Authority, he proves from these notable known Passages, improven by the <hi>Presbyterians, Act.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 7.</q>

                  <q>I need not tell the Dr. the Answer of his <hi>Catholicus papista,</hi> the same it is with that of our Catholick Dr. and upon a pretence of (<hi>universalis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> patrum consensus</hi>) universal consent of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> The great Answer is (<hi>Apostolis Episcopos successisse</hi>) <hi>That the Hierarchical Bishops have succeeded the Apostles, in their proper formal Office.</hi>

                  <q>And to shew the sweet Harmony betwixt these Dear <hi>Catholicks</hi> and Patrons of that Cause, our Dr. makes this the goodly Title of his second <hi>Chapter,</hi> viz: <hi>Of the succession of Bishops to the Apostles.</hi> And remarkable it is, that the <hi>Catholick Iesuit</hi> and he, pleads upon the same very Grounds, viz: <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolat called Episcopacy Act.</hi> 1. — Then comes in <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>

I cannot here transcribe all that this <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi> Novelist <hi>Presbyterian, Rivet,</hi> returns in Answer to this point, which I really judge, had our Dr. impartially read and perused, it would have saved him the Trouble and Labour of this <hi>Pamphlet.</hi>
                  <q>He is first severe to the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> and to our Dr. as to the Name <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> or <hi>Priest,</hi> whereby they represent <hi>Pastors</hi> (<hi>De Episcoporum in Sacerdotes praeeminentia,</hi> saith he, <hi>frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra disputatur, cum sacerdotum ordo nullus sit in Christianismo, ut antea docuimus, &amp;c.</hi>)</q>
                  <q>That there is no access for a Debate concerning the Pre-eminence of <hi>Bishops</hi> above <hi>Priests,</hi> since in the Christian Church there is no order of Priests as he hath before taught; (so upon the preceeding Question, <hi>Par.</hi> 4.)

               <p>But let us hear what is our Dr's. Account of the <hi>Apostolick Office</hi>: It is thus: <hi>In opposition to which,</hi> saith the Dr. P. 96. (<hi>i. e.</hi> the premised <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> or rather <hi>Protestant</hi> Account of the Apostolick Office) <hi>We affirm</hi> (had he added, we <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> some would alledge the <hi>Epithet</hi> had been suteable to his Doctrine) Well, What affirms he? <hi>That the true Characteristick, formal, and distinguishing Mark of an Apostle, was his Constant, Supreme, Spiritual, Perpetual Power, Authority; and Iurisdiction, over all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat Officers, and all others believing in Christ, and his Power to transmit this Authority to his Successors, according to the Command of our Saviour.</hi> Here,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58203:119"/>
we have it in his own Words: Upon which, 1. Let it be considered, that he presents this Description and Account of the Apostolick Office, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to that which he premiseth as ours. We hold, as well as he, that the Apostles had a Supreme (though collateral and equal) and Spiritual Power and Authority over Officers and Members of the Church: Only we add these further Characteristicks of their Office, <hi>viz</hi>: Their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts, their immediat Call, including and having connected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, an unconfined Commission to propagat the Gospel among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as himself words our Tenet, and which is also proved from that Passage he cites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Now, since in opposition to our Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he holds, that his, not ours, are the proper discriminating Marks, whereby Apostles were distinguished from other Officers, he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, hold that these Characters are proper to other Officers, as well as them, For, there is no Mids: Either these Prerogatives were peculiar to Apostles, or proper to others also, and thus common to both, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, not to mention other properties, since their unconfined Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Preach to all Nations; And he cannot but acknowledge as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat Officers of all the Churches, <hi>in actu exerciso,</hi> and in order to the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and planting Gospel Ordinances, and Officers therein, according to our Saviours Commission, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. is our great Mark and Character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istick of an Apostle, I challenge him to shew me, what succeeding ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officer, had this applicable to him, whether of his supposed <hi>Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> will not deny, that upon this Ground, the Churches are said to be built upon the Apostles Foundation, and this in an exclusive Sense, not the Foundation of any succeeding Officers, whether the Dr. call them Subordinat or otherwise; And he knows the Churches Foundation is not to be twice laid; So, that he is obliged either to produce succeeding Officers with this Prerogative and Power, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this his Description naught, which he so vainly offers, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Account of this Office, offered by <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines. 2. He sayes, <hi>That this power was constant, perpetual, and to be transmitted to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</hi> Here, I ask him, whether the Apostles were to transmit their Power to one Successor and Supreme President, or to devolve their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral, Universal Power over all Believers, and all subordinat Officers, to respective Successors, coming after every one of them? If the Dr. adhere to the first, he clearly homologats the <hi>Papal</hi> Pleadings for a <hi>Primacy</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church Universal: And indeed, his owning as a Patern to the New Testament Church, the Continuance of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, does much oblige him thereunto. If he assert, that every one of the Apostles had a respective Successor, then his Descrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>on obliges him to mantain that every such Successor, has transmited unto him, <hi>A Perpetual, Spiritual, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58203:119"/>
Universal Inspection over all Churches, both Ministers and Believers</hi>: For, this essential Authority of Apostles, he affirms, they were <hi>to transmitt to Successors, and that according to the Command of our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed; Let us Listen to our Dr's Explication, (P. 97.) <hi>The Apostles Permanent Successive Power, was to Preach the Gospel, Govern the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they Planted, give Rules and Directions to Successors in the same Office, and all Subordinat Ecclesiasticks, Inflict Censures, Communicat this Authority to others, Hear Complaints, Decide Controversies, Settle Church Discipline, Conferr the Holy Ghost, as the Necessity of the Faithful requires</hi> — (He tells us, <hi>He understands the Gifts, that must needs attend the Authoritative Ministry of Holy Things</hi>) <hi>This being Essentially the Apostolick Office, it remains for ever in the Church, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Necessities thereof, requiring it should continue till Christs coming.</hi> Here, <hi>First,</hi> I would enquire again, since the Power thus described, is in the Dr's Sense, <hi>Permanent and Successive,</hi> and necessary to the Church, whether is it so, as devolved upon every Person Succeeding, and in the same Extent, and for the same E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, as the Apostles Exercised it? If it be not, then every Body of Common Sense, knows, that this Apostolick Power and Office, cannot be called <hi>Permanent and Successive,</hi> and of <hi>a continued standing Necessity in the Church,</hi> no more than a <hi>Pastors</hi> ordinary Power to Preach and Baptize, will prove this, and that they hold this entire Apostolick Office, which he describes. If this Apostolick Power and Office, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in its entire extent, and to every Person Succeeding, then every Person thus Succeeding, has an Entire, Unconfined, Universal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Inspection over all the Churches, <hi>all Ecclesiasticks and Believers,</hi> to use his own Terms, and are obliged by their Office, to Preach unto, and Govern them all, as the Apostles did, <hi>to give Rules, Inflict Censures upon all Subordinat Officers.</hi> If he say, that every Apostle did not so Extensively Preach and Govern: I <hi>Answer,</hi> even admitting some Gradual Difference in the Extent of the Actual Exercise, yet this did no whit Lessen their Universal Commission, exprest <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and the Obligation of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned Endeavour, could not Impeach their standing Authority over all the Churches, and their Relation, <hi>in Actu Exercito,</hi> as immediat Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Officers thereof: And the Dr, in saying, <hi>That this Authority and Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction reached over all Subordinat Officers and Believers</hi>; without Exception, (which <hi>very Power,</hi> he affirms, they were <hi>to Transmit to Successors</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what I said, and cuts him off from this Evasion. To clear this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the <hi>second</hi> place, it may be asked, whether these supposed Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, are Authorized to <hi>Plant Churches, give Rules to them, Decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Conferr the Holy Ghost,</hi> as the Apostles did, with Respect to the End, Manner, and Extent foresaid? If not, then sure this Power is Transient, <hi>not Permanent and Successive,</hi> as the Dr. calls it. If they have this Power of

Apostles, as above exprest; Then <hi>first,</hi> there lyes upon every such Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, an Obligation to Plant Churches, where they were not; For, he will not deny that the Apostles were to Plant &amp; to Govern the Churches Planted, and to give Rules and Directions thereanent. The Absurdity of which Assertion, is sufficiently apparent, and its necessary Dependence upon what he asserts, no less evident. But while we speak of Successors giving Rules, the Dr. would do well to inform us, what Rules he means, whether the Apostles Rules, or others? If the same, then they could not Succeed the Apostles <hi>in Authoritative, Infallible Delivery of the first Gospel Rules,</hi> this Work being already done: If others; then the Dr. will ascribe to them such a <hi>Nomothetick</hi> Authority as to Rules, as no Church can now acclaim, in the Sense of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines. If he say, he means an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or Declarator of Apostolick Rules, in particular Cases: Then I <hi>Answer,</hi> This is not the <hi>Apostolical Delivery of Rules,</hi> as all Men know, but is <hi>toto coelo</hi> different from it, both in its Nature and Extent; So, that this Shift will not help the Dr. out of the Briars. But in the next place, the Dr. has told us, <hi>of an Apostolical derived Power in Deciding Controversies, which he appropriats to the Bishops their Successors,</hi> and in the Sequel of his Reasoning, must atribute it to every one of them. And here, I would enquire of him, how did the Apostles Decide Controversies? The Dr. will not deny, that any one of the Apostles, by virtue of their Authority and Infallibility, could decide Controversies infallibly, as being our Saviours Living Oracles and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Mind of Christ: And what <hi>Bishop,</hi> or Succeeding Church Officer, I pray, has this Power and Authority? We know, <hi>General Councils</hi> have erred in their Decisions: But the Dr. gives a greater Power to every <hi>Bishop,</hi> by this his New Notion. Or, if the Dr allay and lessen this Decision, either as to Extent or Authority, then he is still in the Briars, and baffles his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition and explication. Further, the Dr. has told us, <hi>the Bishops succeeds the Apostles in giving the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Scriptures tells us the Apostles gave the Holy Ghost, and even Miraculous visible Gifts thereof, by impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands; and we have heard, that <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines ascribe this to them, as one of their incommunicable Prerogatives: The Dr. will needs have them succeeded in this. But being someway sensible of the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this lax Assertion, he restricts it <hi>to such Gifts, as must needs attend the Authoritative Ministry of Holy things.</hi> Be it so; but will he say, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did no otherways give the Holy Ghost? This he cannot assert. Then I say. 1. He must acknowledge, that here is a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, maimed, not an intire Succession in this work and part of their Office. 2. The Dr would be puzzled to shew a Reason, why he restricts and limits this Point of the Succession, rather than the rest. Finally, the Dr. calls this Power of the Apostles, <hi>Supreme,</hi> and no doubt,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58203:121"/>
since it is with him, one <hi>Criterion</hi> of the Apostolick Office, and competent to all their Successors the <hi>Bishops,</hi> in this Apostolick extent; For, he affirms, that <hi>this Power of the Apostles, is perpetual and necessary in the Church, and that the Bishops are their proper Successors therein</hi>: And here, the Dr. would do well to inform us of what Character and Mould, in Point of Power, these <hi>Bishops</hi> are, whom he owns to succeed to this Apostolick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: For, that <hi>de facto,</hi> there is a great variety in the extent of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he will not deny. Whether doth he hold, that every ordinary <hi>Bishop</hi> is such a Successor? or the <hi>Arch Bishop</hi>? or only <hi>Primats</hi>? If every <hi>Bishop</hi> does thus succeed (which the Series of his Arguing seems to import) then I would know, how a <hi>Bishop</hi> with a derived, subaltern, subordinat Power, limit to a certain, and may be, not a very great Precinct or district, can be said to succeed the Apostles, <hi>in a Supreme Iurisdiction over all Believers and Ecclesiasticks</hi>? Let him make Sense of this, if he can: If he say that the <hi>Bishops</hi> Succession relates to their Power within their own district: Then, 1. They no more succeed the Apostles, in the Power by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, than Successors to a <hi>Sheriff</hi> in a Kingdom, can be said to succeed to the Regal Throne. 2. If he once break square thus, and infringe his own Rule, his measures and description, he must consequently acknowledge, that a Government in the smallest precinct, yea, even of a Pastor over his Flock, is <hi>eaten us,</hi> a Succesion to the Apostles. If he say, the <hi>Pastor</hi> has no Rule over <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> and consequently, no Apostolick Succession, in his Sense: I Answer, neither has the <hi>Bishops</hi> over all <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> which is also his Sense and description of the <hi>Apostolick Succession.</hi> If he own, that only <hi>Arch Bishops</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are such <hi>Successors</hi>; Then, 1. How comes he to owne the <hi>Bishops, in universum,</hi> as succeeding the Apostles, in a Rectoral Power. 2. Since the <hi>Bishops</hi> can give <hi>Rules to subordinat Ecclesiasticks, Preach</hi> if their <hi>Lordships</hi> please, <hi>give Rules of Disciplin, hear complaints, decide Controversies,</hi> &amp;c. wherein he makes this Apostolick Succession to consist, how can he deny, even to <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> this Succession? 3. Suppose, but one <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church in a Countrey gathered, the Dr. will not deny an Apostolick Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government, there, according to his Pattern and Principles.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, if the Dr. hold, that only the great <hi>Arch Bishops</hi> or Metrapolitans, have this Supremacy and Apostolick Succession; I would know upon what ground, he can defend this in his Principles? I know none, except that of <hi>the extent of their Power,</hi> be alledged. But here the Dr. is still at odds with himself: For the Apostolick Power, which he holds to be <hi>Succeeded unto and Permanent,</hi> extended to all Churches, <hi>to all Ecclesiasticks and Believers.</hi> And besides, suppose an <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick Council</hi> Assembled, the Dr. will not assert, that he has an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity paramount to it, by his Office, and that there may not be a greater <hi>Metropolitan</hi> than he, existent, whose Power may be paramount to his, in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58203:122"/>
the <hi>Council,</hi> or otherwise. Thus, we see how our Dr. in his Phantastick Description of the <hi>Apostolat,</hi> and Pleadings for the <hi>Bishops Succession</hi> thereunto, has involved himself, and is Rolling <hi>Sisiphus</hi> Stone, which still returns upon him, and renews his Labour.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, the Dr. (<hi>P.</hi> 97.98.) tells us, <hi>That extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts of the Holy Ghost, Power of Miracles, Languages, other Spiritual Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were temporary, extrinsick advantages, necessary for first forming the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, and when this Fabrick is erected, Scaffoldings are removed.</hi> But I should think, if the Apostolick work and necessary duties required these <hi>extraordinary Gifts,</hi> as necessary advantages and furniture for the same, then they were intrinsick, not extrinsick to the Office it self; Which I will prove to the Dr, by a paralel Argument, the Topick whereof, he must needs owne: To be apt to Teach, to have Spiritual knowledge, and the Gift of utterance, in a competent Measure, prudence, a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, and Languages thereof, he will acknowledg, are needful for the <hi>Pastoral</hi> work of Feeding by the word and Doctrin: Therefore, say I, they are essential and intrinsick to the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office; For, 1. Else there were no need of a previous trial of these Gifts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to admission to that Office. And 2. God conjoins <hi>the call to the Office,</hi> with <hi>the Gifts for it,</hi> and the one in an ordinary way, must be made Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the other: I hope, the Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I are agreed as to the Soundness of this Reasoning. Now, let me subsum upon this Conclusion; In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Apostolick Office required these works or duties, whereunto were necessarly annexed the forementioned Gifts and Eurniture for the fame. 1. They were to <hi>teach all Nations</hi>; this they could not do without the Gift of Tongues, wherefore on the day of <hi>Penticost,</hi> they were thus seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Yea were, Commanded to stay and wait at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for this Seal. 2. Another piece of their work, was, to <hi>Confirm their Doctrin by Miracles,</hi> then new and unknown, thus to seal their Commission to an <hi>Infidel</hi> world, as also, to the <hi>Iews,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the Signs were shown of the Rod and Leprous hand: This Work required the Gift of Miracles. 3. They were to form the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and lay the ground plott of its Government, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Rules and plat-form of its Doctrine and Worship; This requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>an infallible directive Power and Authority,</hi> in reference to all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Officers thereof. 4. Their Work and Office required an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Relation, in <hi>actu secundo,</hi> to all Churches, so that they were, while alive, solely such Officers thereof: Hence, their very Office being of this Nature, and supposing the Christian Church a forming &amp; erecting, it is certain, that taken in <hi>a proper formal Sense,</hi> with these its Ingredients, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is <hi>the Scaffolding</hi> which is removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when this Fabrick is erected, since,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58203:122"/>
now no Mortal can pretend to such a Mission, Commission, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Further, The Command, [<hi>Go teach all Nations</hi>] he must hold still vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as essentially included in the Apostolick Office, for he distinguishes this part of their <hi>Permanent Power,</hi> from their <hi>extraordinary expired Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> (P. 96.) so that he must needs acknowledge, that this requiring the Gift of Tongues, it was essential thereunto. Again, he holds, there is a <hi>Supreme Power</hi> of Government, constant and transmitted to the Church: And this <hi>Supreme Power</hi> necessarly requires, (1.) Infallibility in all the Methods and Measures of Government; For, that upon the ground of such a Supremacy, the Apostles had an Infallibility, in all their Measures and Ordinances of Government, delivered to the Churches, the Dr. will not deny. (2.) He cannot deny this necessary Consequence, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were priviledged with unaccountableness and uncontrolable Power; And this in his Principles, he must needs hold to be transmitted: For, if <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> will not infer these two, surely nothing will. And the Dr. will not say, that Supremacy over all Church Officers and Members, are temporary expired Priviledges; For this he clearly distinguishes from them: And it being thus; the Question still recurrs to what <hi>Bishops</hi> he ascribs this? Whether to some of them who are of Special Character, or to all? If to all, then none of them are subordinat and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to another, as being all Infallible and Supreme, in the Exercise of their Government. If to some only, under what Character are they? <hi>Primats, Arch-bishops,</hi> or <hi>Patriarchs</hi>? And whether are they subject to one Head? If to one Head, then they loss the Priviledge of Supremacy, wherein the Dr. makes an Apostolick Succession to consist: Yet it will be hard to say, that they were not subject to a General <hi>Council,</hi> as to their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Administration: And sure I am, the Dr. will assert, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had such a Supreme Power, as put them beyond the reach of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to any Church Judicatory, and this their Supreme Authority, he asserts to be <hi>Constant</hi> and <hi>Permanent,</hi> still necessary for the Church, and died not with their Persons: So, that here is another confused Maze and <hi>Farrago</hi> of Inconsistencies.</p>
               <p>But further, to shew how this Mans precipitant folly has involved him, two things are again considerable: <hi>First,</hi> He holds the <hi>Iewish</hi> OEconomy never to have been abrogat, but to be still vigent, as it exemplifies a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to the New Testament Church; This he acknowledges had a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme High Priest, who was an OEcumenick President over that Church, over all inferior Priests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all their Courts: For, he wil be far from admitting any inferior Priests to share in this Priviledge. Hence, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably follows, that this Supremacy is in his Sense, applicable only to the Supreme OEcumenick President, that the Christian Church may come up
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58203:123"/>
to its Pattern. And it being thus, let us in the <hi>next</hi> place see, how he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withdanding crosses this in two Points; 1. In making this <hi>Constant, Supreme, Spiritual Power,</hi> over all Members and Officers in the Christian Church, to have been first exercised by every one of the Twelve Apostles, and by them derived to their respective Successors. 2. In holding <hi>in discriminatim,</hi> and without any note of distinction of one from another, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> (yea, all <hi>Bishops</hi>) are Successors of the Apostles; he means in a proper formal Sense: For, this is the very Title of this goodly <hi>Chapter, of the Succession of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops from the Apostles,</hi> as is said. Further, I would gladly know, whether our Dr. ownes any Church-Power to have been transmitted to <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> and to be asserted, <hi>Act.</hi> 20 28. 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 5.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. and many such places, pleaded by the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> It is probable, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, so that it be within their Precincts, &amp; insubordination to the <hi>Bishops.</hi> Now, I pray, why will he deny them the Priviledge of Succession to Apostles, in point of Church Power? He hath no Shadow of Ground, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less upon the Account of a Precarious Dependence upon the <hi>Bishop</hi>; So, that it is not <hi>a Supreme Spiritual Power,</hi> as he defines that of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> as succeeding Apostles therein. And I beseech him, why are not the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> upon this Ground of their Precarious Dependance upon Superior <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> equally cut off from this Priviledge? If he say, the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power reaches to Church Officers under them, not that of <hi>Presbyters</hi>; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told him, what an Insignificant Evasion this is, and that he cuts himself off from this Answer, in that he makes this Apostolick Power, which is Transmitted to Successors, to be a Jurisdiction and Authority <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Subordinat Officers, all Ecclesiasticks, and all others Believing in Christ.</hi> And he tells us, <hi>That the Apostles were to give Directions to their Suceessors in the same Office.</hi> So, that if it be not thus understood, who can reconcile his Words to Sense? For, he distinguishes <hi>the Successors to their Office,</hi> from such as he calls <hi>Subordinat Ecclesiasticks,</hi> who have no such Authority. And to say the <hi>Office</hi> is <hi>perpetual and permanent,</hi> that the Office imports Essentially <hi>a Supreme Power over all Church Officers and Members,</hi> and is thus distinguished from all Inferior Offices, that this very Office <hi>is derived to Successors,</hi> as being <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and necessary to the Church Government in all Ages,</hi> and yet that these Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, one or more, have a Power Encircled within a certain Plott of Ground or District, is such a palpable Contradiction and Non-Sense, as none can be more evident.</p>
               <p>We are told, (P. 98.) <hi>That the Essence of the Apostolick Office, consisted not in the forementioned extraordinary Priviledges— but in the</hi> Rectoral Power, <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Successors in all Ages.</hi> I have told him, and made it appear, that their <hi>Rectoral-Power,</hi> necessarly included these Priviledges, and since he acknowledges, that the Essence of their Office consisted in their <hi>Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Power,</hi> it does necessarly follow, that these being of the Essence of that Power, they were Essential to the Office. We acknowledge with him, that they were by their Office distinguished from Subordinat Officers; The Dr. infers, <hi>That therefore, this Distinction must consist in something so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them, as its incommunicable to any Orders of Officers not Honoured with this Character.</hi> Before I come to a direct Answer, I will here cleave all his Reasoning asunder, with a Wedge of his own Setting. The Apostles U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal, Unconfined Inspection over all Churches, Planted and to be Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as Catholick Universal Ministers thereof, <hi>in Actu Exercito,</hi> is that whereby they are distinguished from other Officers, who are not of that Character: And being thus distinguished, this must of necessity be the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their Office; for it is the Essence, from which Essential Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions flows: Yet, we will find the Dr. Disowning and Denying this (P. 96.) Next, from hence, its easie to infer, that to give Successors the true Apostolick Character and Power, it must be of this Nature and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, else its Hetrogeneous unto, and comes short of its Pattern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will any Rational Man deny, that the <hi>Rectoral Power</hi> derived to Apostles by our Saviour, wherein he says, the Essence of their Office did consist, was of this Nature and Extent? Now, let him produce, if he can, any one Officer or Successor, with this Character. Again, <hi>that whereby they were distinguished,</hi> or what was peculiar to them, may be understood two ways, 1. <hi>Materially,</hi> or Simplely. 2. <hi>Formally,</hi> or as making up their Complex Office, with its other Ingredients, and as properly subservient to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, formal, immediat Ends thereof. In the first Sense, there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, whereby they were not properly distinguished from other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers at that time, considering them materially and remotely; such as Gifts of Tongues, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which others had in their own Sphere and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: But formally, they were proper to Apostles, considering their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Circumstances, and proper immediat End. Others had Gifts of Tongues, and of Miracles, but these Gifts were distinguished from those of Apostles, upon the Ground above exprest. I would make it evident by a Scripture Instance: Our Saviour shews what Miraculous Signs shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them that believe; And in these first times, gives Instance, <hi>viz.</hi> their Casting out Devils, Speaking with Tongues, Taking up Serpents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hurt, (this we read of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 28.) their Drinking Deadly Things without Prejudice; yet <hi>Paul</hi> says, speaking of these extraordinary Gifts, [<hi>truely the Signs, Wonders and Mighty Deeds of an Apostle are wrought among you</hi>] But notwithstanding this, we know that <hi>Stephen,</hi> tho no Apostle, did Wonders among the People. But who knows not, that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, these Actings of the Divine Power, were of another Nature, and for another immediat End, <hi>viz.</hi> To Confirm and Ratifie an Apostolick
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58203:124"/>
Authority, as the Churches Infallible, Universal, First Messengers, upon whose Doctrine, the Foundation of the Church was to be laid? Thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sense of the Judicious and Learned <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> their Office consisted in this, <hi>That they were Christs Universal Ambassadours to lay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where the Foundation of the Gospel Church, and were sent immediatly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarly by him, instructed with Infallibility in Doctrine, and Power to Confirm it with Miracles.</hi> So, that in their Sense, and in the Sense of Sound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, already exhibit, when we speak of the Apostolick Office, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things were more remotely, and less principally, Ingredients therein; somethings, more immediatly and properly, to which the other was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient. Their Office lay in that Universal Legation mentioned, and as Levelled at that great End of Founding the Gospel Church, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly included their immediat Mission, as is said; other things, as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to this End, were Ingredients in their Office, in the remote Sense above cleared, such as the Gifts of Tongues, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This serves to Unravel our Dr's Foolish Notion, which he has (P. 98, 99.) to disprove our Sense of the Apostolick Office: Such as, <hi>First, That the</hi> Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>many of them, had Extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> I <hi>Answer,</hi> (not to stand upon his Expression, <hi>the Laity,</hi> or upon an Enquiry, who of them, had these Extraordinary, Ministerial Gifts) by denying they were either of that Nature, Measure, or for such an immediat End, as those of the Apostles. None certainly, had such a clear comprehensive, immediat, infallible Light in Divine things as they; And many things may convince the Dr. of this his Error: For, First, What meant else their Solemn Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Seal of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. striking the World with such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration? What need the Promise of the Spirit, to lead them unto all Truth, and endue them with Power from on High? Again, the Dr. will acknowledge, that the Apostolick Office was to Plant the Christian Church, and Gospel Ordinances through the World; And therefore, he must, by necessary Consequence, acknowledge, that their Gifts behoved to be, <hi>of such a Nature and Measure, as were suted to this End,</hi> and in special to the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat infallible Government of the Churches,</hi> and the Direction of both Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Officers thereof, in their respective Duties: Hence, our Lord spent fourty Days, after his Resurrection, in instructing them in the things, pertaining to his Kingdom, that they might be thus immediatly fitted for this Work. The Dr. will not deny, that the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Gifts before Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, of Scriptural Knowledge, Skill in the Languages, Prudence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are proper Ingredients in that Office, and Characteristicks thereof, <hi>as suted to the Ends of the same,</hi> and the Evidences of <hi>the Divine Call,</hi> all other things concurring, notwithstanding that some of the <hi>Laity</hi> may have these Gifts. <hi>Next,</hi> for their Infallibility, the Dr. tells us, <hi>That the Evangelists and Seventy
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58203:124"/>
Disciples were such.</hi> I <hi>Answer,</hi> supposing the Seventy to be Evangelists, I deny this Infallibility competent to them, understanding it of such a Nature and Extent as competent unto Apostles, and an Ingredient of their Office, else I beseech him, why was <hi>Timothy,</hi> after his Inauguration instructed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, in reference to so many Points of his Office and Duty, and so many things pointed out to him to beware of? As for <hi>Lukes Writing from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Eye-witnesses and Ministers of the Word</hi>; Any with half an Eye, may see, that this falls utterly short of proving an Apostolick Infallibility, in its Nature and Extent, and with respect to its Ends; Altho the Spirit of GODs infallible Guidance in what he wrote, is necessarly supposed. What he means by <hi>Under-Ministers,</hi> I understand not: If the Spirit of GOD, made use of his Information by Apostles or others, in order to His End of this infallible Writing, can any imagine that this will prove an Apostolick Infalibility, properly and formally such? <hi>As for</hi> Stephens <hi>doing Miracles, and being endued with such Wisdom, as Adversaries could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him</hi>: I deny the Consequence, that therefore he had Infallibility, or Gifts of Miracles of that Nature and Extent, or to such a proper imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat End, as was competent to the Apostles, upon the Ground already exhibite. Next, He tells us, <hi>That</hi> Matthias <hi>was not immediatly called, but by the Apostles, yet had power to continue that Succession to the End.</hi> I deny his Assertion, which is among the rest of his <hi>gratis dicta</hi>: It is evident to any, that but reads the History, that <hi>Matthias</hi> was by GODs immediat choice and Declaration by a Lot (the Disposal whereof, is of the LORD) set a part for his Work and Office, and GOD was sought unto by Prayer to shew His Mind, as touching this Choice: Which therefore, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly his own. It is true, the Apostles, who had the Mind of CHRIST, did with the consent of the Church, present the two to the LORD, but the Choice and Call was GODs. And the presenting of these Eminent Persons to GOD by the Church, will no more prove that <hi>Matthias</hi> was called and authorized by them, than the Peoples presenting the seven Deacons to the Apostles, to be ordained, will prove that they, not the Apostles, ordained them. The Dr. tells us, <hi>That the first Apostles were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Christs Resurrection — yet this did not make them Apostles.</hi> What does he drive at? None sayes, that merely to witness this, made any of them Apostles, or that to be an immediat Witness of it, was indispensab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needful in order to the Apostolick Office: For, so was not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>: Altho there is no doubt but that the Testimony of CHRISTs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, was a great Point of the Apostolick Doctrine and Testimony. But the Dr. will needs add his Proof, <hi>Or else,</hi> saith he, Matthias <hi>had been an Apostle before he was Invested.</hi> Who would not pitty such impertinent triff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Resurrection made an Apostle; Who knows not that several Women (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a Ministry) were among the early and first Witnesses of our LORDs Resurrection: Besides, that the Dr. has not proved that <hi>Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> was such an immediat Witness. The Dr's. Conclusion <hi>(ibid.)</hi> is <hi>That the Essence of the Apostolick Office, consisted not in extraordinary Priviledges, so plentifully poured out on the first Ministers and Converts.</hi> We have told him, in what Sense, the Apostolick Office included these Ingredients thereof: And even granting that some of these extraordinary Priviledges or Gifts, might have been in some Sense communicated to other Officers; The Dr. is never a white nearer his Conclusion, since the Apostles proper Work and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consisted in this, to lay the Foundation of the Gospel Church, to plant and water it, and as being infallibly inspired, to order the Ordinances and Officers thereof, as being Immediat and Catholick Officers of the same: Herein, we have often told him, lay their Office, as to its main Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and unto this their other Prerogatives, were Subservient. Now, in all his Instances, he has exhibite none, who ever did or could share with them in this Priviledge. 2. He alledges (P. 96.) <hi>That we include among the Essentials of their Office, their unconfined Commission to propagat the Gospel among all Nations — which necessarly includes an Immediat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> in actu secundo, <hi>to the whole Church, and inferrs their Duty to be of the Nature and Extent, as above exprest</hi> — Yet he neither can, nor offers to give the least shadow of any such Officer, that did or could share with the Apostles, or come up to them in this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The Dr. Concludes, <hi>That the Nature and Essence of the Apostolick Office is perpetual.</hi> His Conclusion is like some Mushroms, that <hi>Naturalists</hi> speaks of as a Miracle of Nature, because they grow without a Root: His Reason [<hi>that our Saviour promised to be with them to the end</hi>] is as far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Conclusion, as East is from West, taking the essence of the Office, in a proper formal Sense, as Apostolick. For, himself will not say, that this promise will includ the continuance of all the Apostolick Priviledges or Gifts, several of which, he holds to be expired. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it must still come under trial, wherein their Office was succeeded, even when this is admitted. How he has proven this, to be the Nature and Essence of their Office, we have seen above. <hi>Paraeus,</hi> with the current of <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, takes the place he cites, to import a general promise to the whole Church, in specal the Faithful Ministers, the Apostles true Succcessors; thus he Paraphrases it [<hi>Nec paucis tantum diebus, sed omnibus vobiscum ero, nec vobiscum tantum, sed &amp; vobis mortuis &amp; cum vestris successoribus Fidelibus Evangelii Doctoribus Ecclesiarum Pastoribus usque ad consummationem sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>] That the Lord promised to be with his Apostles, and when they were gone, with all their true Successors, the faithful Pastors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church till the end of the World.</p>

                  <hi>This derived Power,</hi> saith the Dr. (P. 100) <hi>is strictly</hi> Jure Divino: No doubt, that Power which the Apostles derived, is such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He adds, <hi>that nothing can more formally distinguish an Apostle from all other Ministers of the Gospel Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy, than a supreme Spiritual Power to Govern Ecclesiastick affairs by their Authority, of which they are to give account to our Saviour.</hi> But we have often told him, that this <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> most formally includes an immediat Relation unto, and Universal inspection over the whole Church, and the nature of the Work, and consequently the Office, as is above exprest. And the Dr. when put to let us see the persons, who are the Subjects of this conveyed Power, what ordinary Church Officers, are the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipients thereof, must go to <hi>Utopia</hi> to seek them; and in his arguing tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses in an inextricable Labyrinth; which, besides what is said, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s in this late Passage, a new proof: For, he says, <hi>that the Apostles were to give an account to our Saviour of this Power, described by him.</hi> He will not say, they were to give this account merely, <hi>as all Ministers are, in a mediat Sense;</hi> For thus, he would contradict his Scope, of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neating their Supreme Power; so, that his meaning must be, that they were to give an account only to our Saviour, and were accountable or Subject to no Church Judicatory upon Earth, for their Administration. Now, Mr. Dr. except the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> your dear Patron, I know no Church Officer, whose head this infallible Mitre will sute; unless these <hi>Supreme Infallibles</hi> be multiplied, according to the Number of <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> it must necessarly resolve thus in the Supreme incontrolable <hi>Patriarch</hi>: And what absurdity there is either in the one, or the other, I need not shew. We are told next, <hi>that the Name, with the Office, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to others, besides the Twelve— and</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>must needs be the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians <hi>Apostle and Bishop, because called their Apostle,</hi> Philip. 2.25. How impertinent this inference is, we have heard above. The Dr. alledges, the word signifies always a Messenger from God to Men.

And that every Apostle had a share of this Ministry of Apostolat, because all of the same Office. But this will noways infer (except by the Dr's Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which can prove <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet</hi>) that they were capable of a fixt Relation to any one Post, or Watch Tower of the Church. That they Governed the Churches where they resided, (as the Dr. next tells us) we doubt not. Tho I add, if the Churches were constitute in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick Beeing, according to Gospel Rules, their Apostolick Inspection was <hi>Cumulative</hi> unto, not <hi>Privative</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>the Ordinary Officers Constitute therein.</hi> He adds, <hi>(ibid.) They committed their Apostolical Episcopal Inspection to particular Persons, who succeeded them, even in their Apostolick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Question,</hi> which the Dr. still Cants over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proof. We have often told him, that their <hi>Apostolick Rectoral Power</hi> (as he calls it) related immediatly to the Catholick Church: And to say, that this they committed to particular Persons, related to one fixed Post, and by Consequence solely <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> thereof, in an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at proper Sense, and subject to Superior Collegiat Churches and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, (which he must needs hold, unless he embrace the <hi>Independent</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and he cannot deny, that <hi>de Facto,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> he pleads for, were and are thus subject) is as great Non-Sense, as to say, a Man succeeding to a Privat <hi>Cure,</hi> succeeds a <hi>Metropolitans</hi> Place, or that the Person who succeeds to an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Chair, doth succeed to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> in its supposed Rectoral Power. The Dr. doth here again Cant over, <hi>That their Rectoral P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58203:127"/>
them, this Rectoral Power reacht all Officers and Believers, as to the <hi>Ius it self,</hi> and consequently <hi>the Exercise upon Occasion</hi>: And that therefore, the Dr. absurdly calls this their Power <hi>Permanent,</hi> and as absurdly holds, that Officers related to particular Posts, did <hi>therein succeed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 103, 104. The Dr. thus proceeds, <hi>When the Evangelical Priesthood</hi> (still Priesthood) <hi>got its Qualified Officers,</hi> Bishops <hi>and</hi> Priests <hi>were not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon one another, but every one was to Feed the Flock within the Limits al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted to him.</hi> Now, here is a Confession, which contradicts and baffles all his Pleadings; For, even these pretended succeeding <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> in his Sense, could not, without Impeaching Christs Order, and Encroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching on their Fellows, go beyond their Limits, in the Exercise of their Ministry: And he will not deny, that this Limited Ministry flowed from the very Nature of their Fixt and Limited Office: But will he dare to say, that any one of the Apostles, were thus Limited, or had an Office of this Nature, or that they would have Encroached upon the Authority of any of these his supposed fixed <hi>Bishops,</hi> if Officiating within their Bounds, and Exercising their Apostolick, Rectoral Power, in an immediat manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their previous Consent, as one <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Pastor</hi> cannot, yea may not, upon this Ground, thus Officia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But, saith the Dr, <hi>(ibid.) They were not so Confined to their</hi> Sees, <hi>but that their Episcopal Care reacht the whole Church, as far as was possible, and Christian Charity did require.</hi> I <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. So is no <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi> fixt to his Post, but as a Watchman upon <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Walls, and thus having an immediat Relation to the Catholick Church, his <hi>Pastoral</hi> Care, in its Exercise, in an Orderly Way, is capable of a further Extension. The Church of God is a City, that has Watchmen set upon her Walls, and in their several Posts, whose Care must, in a mediat Sense, reach the whole City, but cannot in its Exercise be extended, but according to the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Laws and Discipline; So, that thus, the Dr. will make any <hi>Pastor</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the <hi>Apostles</hi>: For, he will not deny, that the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Care is of this Nature; Nor can he assign any Reason why, since the <hi>Bishop</hi> is tyed to his Limits, as well as the <hi>Pastor,</hi> the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Care is not capable of such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of its Exercise, as is suteable to the Churches Edification. But, 2. The Dr. speaks improperly and confusedly, when he assigns no other Rules and Measures of this extended Care, but <hi>Christian Charity, and a Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility thereof merely</hi>: For, unless he turn <hi>Independent,</hi> and deny all Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Church Officers and Courts, he must needs acknowledge, that this Extension of Exercise, must come under the Regulation, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So, that its pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58203:128"/>
impertinent to say, that its only <hi>Christian Charity,</hi> and the simple <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Thing in it self considered,</hi> whereof the Person himself is supposed Judge, that regulats this Matter of so high Importance. Who will say, that a Sentinel's Exercise of Military Inspection, can be extended beyond his Post and Station assigned him, by the Governour and Officers of the Garrison, upon mere <hi>Charity,</hi> and a <hi>Possibility</hi> of this further Extension, without Respect to what the Military Discipline, and the Authority of the Governour and Officers, will allow? Now, to subsume, I beseech this Dr. to tell me plainly, and speak it out, were the Apostles, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office, to extend their Apostolick Inspection from one Church or Countrey to another, only after this Manner, and by such Rules and Measures? And dare he deny, that they were to follow the Spirits Conduct every where, and by vertue of their Office, had an immediat Access to Exercise their Authority over all Churches, wherever they came, and were subject to no Churches Inspection, or Direction in this Matter? Can he not here see a palpable Distinction of the Office of Apostolat, from all ordinary Officers, as that of the Commanders of a Garrison, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to go the Round over all the Posts and Sentinels, to take Inspection o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Direct them, differs necessarly and essentially from the Office and Charge of those, who are in these fixed Posts, whether their Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be of a Larger or Lesser Extension? And hence it appears, that unless the Dr. can let us see such Officers in Scripture, whose proper Work was of this Nature, succeeding the Apostles in the Inspection mentioned, and having such a Power devolved upon them, he will never prove it from <hi>the Occasional Transient Officiating of Fixed Officers,</hi> beyond their Limits, Directed and Authorized therein, by, and under the Inspection of <hi>Superior Church Officers and Iudicatories.</hi> As for his Citation of <hi>Causabon, Exercit.</hi> 14. <hi>ad Annal. Baron.</hi> N. 4. touching the <hi>Bishops</hi> peculiar Care of their own Flock, yet so, as <hi>suo quodam modo,</hi> they Cared for the whole Church: I nothing doubt, but that it may have a Safe and Sound Sense, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to every <hi>Pastor,</hi> whose mediat Care, <hi>actu primo, suo modo,</hi> reaches the whole Church. And the Citation quite baffles the Dr. For, if their care reached to a <hi>peculiar Charge</hi> committed to them <hi>in solidum,</hi> it was <hi>toto coelo</hi> different from the <hi>Apostolick care and Charge,</hi> as is above made good. And the Dr. in saying, <hi>that this exactly resembled the Features and Lineaments of the Apostolick Office,</hi> shews himself to be as bad &amp; unskilful in the Art of Limning, as unsincere and unskilful in Disput. For, such a Confined, Limited Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, under such Regulations, as is above expressed, can no more Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Features and Lineaments of the Apostolick Office, in a proper formal Sense, and in its intire Nature, as delineat in Scripture, than a hand or Foot can Represent the Lineaments of an intire Body. For what he adds,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58203:128"/>
                  <hi>ibid. That Confinment to a particular</hi> See, <hi>proceeds not from the Nature of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but Rules of Prudence and Ecclesiastical OEconomy and Canonical Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> He speaks confusedly, and without Sense. For, this being the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Priest-hood or Ministry, <hi>viz</hi>: That it is Gods Ordinance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for Edification, it must be consequently Adapted and measured to this end: And therefore, whatever Person, hath an ordinary Ministry committed to him, must have it in such a proportion, as his Case and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal ability can reach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God committing to no Man, an immediat inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Catholick Church, as his peculiar Charge: So, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the particular individual Limits of the Charge, which is left to the Churches Prudence to assign, yet the persons having such <hi>a Limited Charge,</hi> as is above discribed, flows from the <hi>Nature of the ordinary Ministry,</hi> and the State and <hi>Case of the Church,</hi> when the extraordinary Office of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat is expired. And to Convince the Dr. of this, and of the Folly of this Lax Assertion, that <hi>Confinement to a particular See proceeds not from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Priesthood,</hi> I would put to him this Querie: Whether the Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto one <hi>Bishop</hi> an U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, yea or not? If not; then who sees not that he owns the Lawfulness and Divine Warrands of a <hi>Papal Primacy,</hi> especialy, if the Church should Corroborat this by an Universal Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If he say, that this extension were contrary to the Nature of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi>; Then he Contradicts himself, in Asserting, that <hi>the Priest-hood of its own Nature, requires no Confinment,</hi> as he calls it; and in Calling it so, he Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats some sort of Violence offered to the Nature of this Ministry. Besides, these Constitutions he mentions, Confining <hi>Bishops</hi> to a certain Charge, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cross or Correspondent to the Nature and ends of a Gospel-Ministry, expressed in Scripture: If cross thereunto; then sure they are not Lawful, unless he will say, God gives the Church Authority to enact Constitutions cross to his Revealed Will, and consequently paramount to his own Rules and Authority: Which, whether it be greater nonsense or Blasphemy, is hard to determin. If they be Correspondent to the <hi>Nature and ends of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Ministry,</hi> how can he deny, that such a Confinment or Constitutions proceed from the Nature thereof? His Reason added, <hi>viz. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ordained Bishops for the Spiritual Service of such as should believe,</hi> is as void of Sense or connection, as any can be: For, so are all <hi>Pastors</hi> (the true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Bishops</hi>) ordained by Apostles. But will he be bold to say, or if he say, will not all Men of Sense hiss him, <hi>That the Apostles ordained all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop or Minister, for the actual immediat Service of all Believers of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, as their proper peculiar Work and Charge?</hi> This he must either say, or his Reason is nought. Nay, will he not thus contradict himself, in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58203:129"/>
his <hi>Secondary Apostles,</hi> (as he calls them) to differ in Extension of Power from the first Apostles?</p>
               <p>P. 105. We are told, <hi>That the Apostles committed their Rectoral Power over sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat Ecclesiasticks to particular persons, succeeding in their Room, in particular Churches.</hi> Another piece of Repeated nonsense. The Apostles by their Office, had an Universal immediat Inspection over all Ecclesiasticks, or Church Officers of the Catholick Church, as himself describs their Office: Yet this their proper formal Office, thus described by him, he will needs have them to devolve upon particular persons, fixed to particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; as good Sense as to say, the King Commits his Regal <hi>Primacy</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Power over his Kingdom, when dying, or leaving it, unto the Man, whom he hath enstalled in the Office of a <hi>Sheriff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Dr. tells us, that he will now <hi>propose the true State of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.</hi> I am sorry a <hi>Doctor</hi> has disputed so long upon a Question, and has yet the State of the Controversy to propose. Common Ingenuity and Rules of Dispute, would have prompted him in the first place, to propose the true State of the Question, and explain the Terms thereof: But these Rules are too Pedantick for our Dr. who is more inclined to <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleting Harrangues,</hi> than <hi>Systematick Divinitie.</hi> Well, what State of the <hi>Question</hi> offers he? Thus it is, [<hi>Whether the Apostles committed their Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, they exercised in particular Churches, to such single persons, duelie and regularlie chosen; Or to a Colledge of Presbyters, acting in administration of Ecclesiastick Affairs in a perfect Paritie and Equalitie</hi>?] I shall be glad to admit this State of the Question, when one Exception is offered by way of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Viz</hi>: That as we grant an Ordinary Authority, which the Apostles exercised in particular Churches, contained in their Office <hi>Eminenter,</hi> which they transmitted to Successors; So, we deny, that the Authority, which they transmitted to these ordinary succeeding Officers, was an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>properly and formally Apostolical,</hi> or <hi>such, in a formal Sense, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves exercised.</hi> And this I have made appear to be the Harmonious Sense and Judgement of sound Divines, who distinguish the <hi>expired Apostolick Office and Authority,</hi> from that <hi>ordinary Power and Authority,</hi> which they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Successors. What next? We are told, (<hi>ibid.</hi>) That <hi>the Scripture-confusion of Names</hi> (might I presume to prescribe a better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Term to such a Master of Language, as our Dr. I should rather, to evite an apparent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the Holy Ghosts Language, call it <hi>Community</hi> or <hi>Homonymie</hi>) <hi>will not prove Community of Offices, when persons are undenyablie distinguished, with regard to their Authoritie.</hi> If we forget this mighty Caution of our warry Dr. we must not blame him, if an unwearied Repetition will help us. The Dr. will have this fixed, that we fight not in the dark. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do hold this as fixed as he. What next?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:58203:129"/>P. 105.106. <hi>The LORD promised a perpetual Duration of the Apostolick Office, not in their personal but Spiritual Capacitie, he loving his Church as much after as before his withdrawing— If then they conveyed their Episcopal Power to single persons in all particular Churches, and not to a Colledge of Presbyters, acting in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Equalitie, then the Divine Right of Episcopal Government is clearlie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabilished.</hi> But 1. How often will this Man cant over his <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> and take that for the Ground and Topick of his Argument, which is in the Question; Yea, and in the Question by his own Confession, <hi>viz</hi>: That <hi>the Apostolick Office is perpetual, permanent, and succeeded unto, in a proper formal Sense</hi>? What strange (may I call it Impertinency, or) Inadvertancy is this? Since himself asserts that we deny such a perpetual Office of Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolat, and he opposes above, his definition anent their <hi>permanent, perpetual Office</hi> unto <hi>Presbyterians</hi> assertion of the contrary, and their Definition as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Apostles <hi>Transitorie Function.</hi> 2. His Proof from <hi>Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and constant care of the Church,</hi> is, in the Sense of all <hi>Protestants,</hi> unsound and foolish, and he is therein inconsistent with himself: For, in their Sense (yea, and by his own Confession) there are many expired Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of Apostles, yea &amp; Gifts of Officers in the first Apostolick Church, which notwithstanding impeaches not, either that promise of Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Care of his Church, or his constant Love thereunto: And therefore, it reflects neither upon the one, nor the other, that this formal Office of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolat, consisting of such expired Prerogatives, is ceased. Nay, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesses, that without Impeachment of either of these, the Apostles <hi>Extensive, universal Power</hi> is changed unto <hi>a Limited and Confined Inspection of Bishops.</hi> Tho the Contexture of his Reasoning, renders him in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with himself, Christs Care and Promise are abundantly verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Establishment of such a Government and Officers in His Church, as are suted to her Edification and Preservation in all times and places. I cannot but further remark the Dr's. changing the Term of [<hi>Apostolick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>] which he holds to be transmitted to Successors, into that of [<hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power</hi>] as if these were all one. But this is such a confusion of Names and Things, as cannot be admitted. But proceed we.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Question</hi> the Dr. will needs have to be a <hi>Matter of Fact, to be decided by Testimony.</hi> Whom the Apostles appointed Successors is [<hi>Matter of Fact</hi>] simplely considered; But this [<hi>Matter of Fact</hi>] must have a Divine Testimony to clear it, it being [<hi>a Divine Fact</hi>] (to call it so) of Christs Infallible, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Inspired Apostles, in the management of the Trust committed to them, in founding and modelling the Gospel Churches. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in enquiring into this Point, we must take our Measures, both from their Doctrine and Practice, if we acknowledge the Apostles had no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, independent, but Subordinat, Subaltern Power, Authorized
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58203:130"/>
and prescribed by their great Master, whose Doctrine and Measures prescribed in his Holy Testament, we must therefore look unto. So that, when the Dr. asserts, <hi>There can be no decisive proof of this, but by Testimonie;</hi> He should have called it [<hi>Divine Testimonie</hi>] for an Human Testimony can here have no place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Question is anent <hi>the Apostles Doctrine and Practice, in point of Church Government</hi>: And therefore, what the Dr. adds, <hi>viz</hi>: That <hi>the Testimony alledged by him and the</hi> Episcopalians, <hi>is so much the stronger, upon the Ground of the Reception thereof,</hi> Discovers his bad Design of leaving out the Qualification of <hi>Divine,</hi> in the Testimony to which he appeals; And likewayes, his absurd alledging, that <hi>a Divine Testimony</hi> is strengthened by <hi>an Human,</hi> as influencing a stronger Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>of <hi>in eodem genere Causae.</hi> That <hi>the Church knew no other Government than</hi> Prelacy, <hi>for fourteen hundred Years</hi> (as the Doctor is bold to assert) shall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he shall exhibit the full Accounts and Records of these 1400 Years asserting so much. To proceed.</p>
               <p>To prove that the <hi>Apostles Rectoral Power, was by them transmitted immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to single Successors,</hi> the Dr. tells us <hi>(ibid.)</hi> that <hi>he will first view the Holy Scriptures, then Ecclesiastical Records. First view,</hi> I say <hi>only and properly view,</hi> in order to this proof: For, 1. our Faith of this, is <hi>a Divine Faith,</hi> which therefore cannot be founded upon <hi>an human Testimony,</hi> else it were but <hi>an human Credulity.</hi> 2. <hi>Ecclesiastick Records</hi> cannot be an <hi>infallible Comment</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Sense of these Scriptures, wherein this Testimony is contained: And this upon several weighty Grounds, which I have elsewhere exhibit; Since this were, (1.) To set up an higher Tribunal than the Scriptures. (2.) Ye exclud an examination of the Human Testimony by the Scriptures. (3.) To make the Churches practice the infallible Rule to direct our perswasion and practice, in reference to every Scripture Truth and Duty, therein held out. Besides, that neither this Dr, nor any for him, will ever exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Authentick Records of the Churches Universal Practice since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many of the <hi>Ancients</hi> having written nothing at all, many of their Writings also being lost, many going under their Name, being Counterfeit and supposititious: And that none of these, did in this Matter contradict th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58203:131"/>
supposed Scripture <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Timothies</hi> pretended Instalment, [<hi>I besought thee to abide at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when I went into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>that thou mightest Charge some, that they Teach no other Doctrine &amp;c.</hi>] Which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have long since told him, is a clear Proof of the contrary; since there was no need of <hi>such Importunity,</hi> if <hi>Paul</hi> had Committed the <hi>Episcopal Charge over</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <hi>to him</hi>: For, thus he might have laid as Dreadful a Charge upon him, to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as he doth afterward to <hi>Preach the Gospel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2. They have told him, that the Words specifie <hi>an Occasional Imployment,</hi> and are not Words of <hi>Instalment</hi> to any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For what the Dr. adds, <hi>That his Occasional Travels dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged him not from his Episcopal Inspection</hi>: It is long since <hi>Presbyteria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> (and in special, the Authors mentioned by him) have Baffled this Answer, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, and such as have pleaded thus, that they are challenged to prove, that any one, appointed Overseer of a particular Church, had such a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary Motion, and Transient Imployment, as that of <hi>Timothy</hi> is proven to have been. Or, 2. That either he or <hi>Titus,</hi> after this Imployment, did constantly or ordinarly return to <hi>Ephesus</hi> or <hi>Crete,</hi> and not to the Places of the Apostles present Abode or Imployment. 3. They also tell him, that this Answer is a Begging of the Question, since all the Ground of Instalment exhibit here by the Dr. and his Fellows, is in that <hi>Charge in Reference to</hi> Ephesus, wherein this Transient Imployment is clearly held out. The Dr. adds, <hi>(ibid.) That</hi> Presbyterians <hi>would not take it kindly, if told, that the Relation to their Flocks were lost, if upon Occasions they were Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now and then to Visit Forreign Churches.</hi> Certainly they would not, but they take it as unkindly, that the Dr, instead of an Illustrating Argument and Proof, by this Paralell, Beggs the Question still, and draws a <hi>Simile</hi> from an Instance, wherein there is a palpable Disparity and Dissimilitude. For, in the Instance adduced, the fixed Relation, Instalment and Title is supposed. 2. The ordinary fixed Attendance upon the <hi>Pastors</hi> Charge, in Consequence thereof; whereas, in the Case of <hi>Timothy</hi> his fixed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalment is begged, not proved, but rather a Transient Occasional Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pointed at in the very Place, which he Cites. Whence it clearly follows, That <hi>this Transient Unfixt Ministry, was</hi> Timothies <hi>Ordinary Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. proceeds to tell us (<hi>ibid.</hi>) <hi>That the</hi> Ancients <hi>took no notice of this Objection against his Episcopacy at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and that in the</hi> 11. <hi>Act of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>Twenty seven Bishops are Reckoned from</hi> Timothy. What notice the <hi>Ancients</hi> took of this Objection, is not the Question. But for the Catalogues, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have long since told him, what a poor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58203:131"/>
this is, and have largely baffled this Phantastical conceit; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Ius Divinum Minist. Ang. in Prop.</hi> 7. of the <hi>Appendix,</hi> in several weighty Considerations, to which I refer him. They have therein made appear, that in these Catalogues, besides, that there is an <hi>Homonomy</hi> in the word <hi>Bishop,</hi> the nearer they come to the Apostles days, they are the more uncertain and contradictory one to another; that the Catalogue-drawers spoke in the Language of their own times; and in these Catalogues, is a far other design than what is pretended by the <hi>Episcopalians</hi>; that the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues resolving in Apostles or Evangelists, who were not <hi>Bishops,</hi> nor could be properly, as not having an ordinary, but extraordinary Office, the proof of a successive Line of <hi>Bishops</hi> from them, which is drawn from these Catalogues, appears palpably unsound and impertinent.</p>
               <p>Before I pass from this, since the Dr. mentions <hi>Act.</hi> 20.4, 5. to prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> was left at <hi>Ephesus</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi>; He had done well to look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the 28 <hi>v.</hi> where he would have found the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> Charge over that Church committed after this to the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> before <hi>Timothies</hi> face, in <hi>Pauls</hi> last farewell unto them, and this without the least hint of any Interest that <hi>Timothy</hi> had in or over them, or of their precarious dependence upon him in this Matter. And here he might have seen a passage looking like the Apostles committing their <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power, or what was ordinary in their Function, to a <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently a Scriptural Decision of this Question and Controversy against him. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>The Dr. (<hi>P.</hi> 107, 108) undertakes to prove from the Epistles, that an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority was Committed to <hi>Timothy</hi>; And to clear this by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>viz. That he is Charged not to rebuke an Elder, but intreat him,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.1. <hi>Not to receive an accusation but before two or three Witnesses v,</hi> 19. <hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke such as sin before all, v.</hi> 20. <hi>Not to lay hands suddenly, v.</hi> 22. <hi>To ordain such Deacons as were blameless,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.14, 15. <hi>Where his particular Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Church, is insinuat, the Apostle Writing to him, to instruct how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in the House of GOD,</hi> &amp;c. To these the Dr. adds <hi>his Charge of the care of Widows, and Objects of Charity, and ordering the publick Worship and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of the Church</hi> 1 Tim: 5.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He and he alone,</hi> saith the Dr, <hi>is Charged to observe these things, without preferring one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doing nothing by partiality. Ans.</hi> 1. If all these prescriptions suppose only in <hi>Timothy,</hi> an Evangelistick, and consequently an exraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired Inspection, not an <hi>Episcopal</hi> and ordinary, then this Parade of the Dr's Argument, is cut off with one Blow: For, as for his proof of an <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Relation to that Church, drawn from the Apostles shewing his scope to direct him, how to carry in the House of GOD; it is so clearly adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58203:132"/>
to <hi>an Evangelistick Inspection over that and other Churches,</hi> that it can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him no shadow of a Reason or Evasion.</p>
               <p>For Convincing the Dr. of this, I shall make use of his own Paralel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and turn his Weapons point upon him. He hath told us [<hi>that no</hi> Presbyterian <hi>would think his Relation to his Particular Flock untyed, if imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to visit now and then Forreign Churches</hi>] Now, suppose, that in this transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent visitation of such Churches, the Church Rulers do write several dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to such a <hi>Pastor,</hi> in reference to Government, adding as a pressing Motive [<hi>that he is therein instructed how to behave in the Church of the living God, which is his House, in case he continue any time in this imployment</hi>] as the <hi>Apostle</hi> here adds the limiting Clause [<hi>if I tarry long</hi>] Will the Dr's Argument hold good, that this will infer such a <hi>Pastors</hi> relation to these Churches? If he says this, he Contradicts himself: And on the other hand, he will not dare to affirm, that a Minister in this Case, is not capable of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which would upon the Matter infer, that these Churches were not the <hi>House of God,</hi> and that a Minister is not concerned how to behave in them. And if this will not conclude such a Pastors particular Relation to these Churches, but supposeth only <hi>a transient Imployment</hi> in this Case, then I say, his Reason and Argument is naught, which Infers <hi>Timothies special Episcopal relation to Ephesus</hi>; I mean to that Church, from <hi>this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Apostles Scope,</hi> in the premised directions. Moreover, the Dr. will not deny, that <hi>Timothy</hi> visited and watered several other Churches, after this at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and after the directions given, while officiating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Now, I would fain know, if the Dr. will deny, that these directions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this expressed scope thereof, <hi>viz that he might know how to behave in the Church of GOD,</hi> were clearly applicable to him in his other transient Imployments therein? If the Dr. deny this, he will swallow Monstruous absurdities, <hi>viz.</hi> He will assert that in other Churches, he had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>rebuke,</hi> to receive accusations, <hi>to rebuke such as sin before all,</hi> to see to the Worship, to Charity, to the State and Carriage of Widows, to the right Instalment of <hi>Deacons,</hi> and all this without partiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Timothy</hi> in all these other Churches had this Authority, &amp; the premised prescriptions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the express scope thereof, were applicable to him, as officiating else where, then they can infer no particular Relation to this Church, more than others. If the Dr. say that they are applicable as in this transient Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, <hi>Protunc,</hi> but not so as in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where his Relation was fixed, &amp; the directions consequently in a special manner, applicable thereto: Who sees not that this is a palpable and shameless begging of the Question, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing these prescriptions to infer a fixed Relation to this Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> which is the very <hi>Quesitum</hi> and Point in question?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:58203:132"/>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> to strike out the Bottom of the Dr's Notion, and put this to a short Issue, since, upon the one Hand, the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Charge, as to both Order and Jurisdiction, was by <hi>Paul,</hi> in his last Farewel, committed to the <hi>Elders</hi> or Ministers of this Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> joyntly; Which Charge the Apostles are found to intrust likewise unto <hi>Pastors,</hi> in other paralell places: And since, upon the other Hand, <hi>Timothies</hi> Inspection is found Transient, and Relative to several other Churches, and therein Exercised, it follows necessarly, that what Authority he had in this Church, and is supposed in these Directions, and the Scope thereof, was <hi>Cumulative</hi> unto, not <hi>Privative</hi> of the ordinary standing Authority of the fixed <hi>Pastors,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished or to be established therein, and that <hi>Timothy</hi> had no sole or <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Authority, Paramount to that of <hi>Pastors,</hi> intrusted to him: Which may be further confirmed upon these Grounds, in that, 1. The Apostles themselves Exercised no such Authority in Churches constitute, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>Presbytries</hi> Concurrence with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Timothies</hi> Ordination, and <hi>Presbyters</hi> Authoritative Excommunication of the Incestuous <hi>Corinthian.</hi> 2. This Supposition of such a Paramount Authority would make the Apostles, in Cloathing Single Persons therewith, to contradict their Previous Doctrine and Practice in the Instalment of <hi>Pastors,</hi> with the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority. To make which convincingly apparant, one thing further I would propose to the Dr; Whether will he deny, that several Prescriptions delivered to <hi>Timothy,</hi> were Relative to such Authority, such an Exercise of the Power of Order, as is <hi>incontrovertibly Applicable to Pastors</hi>? I shall take the Dr's own Instance, <hi>of Rebuking such as Sin before all, Seeing to Widows, and the Objects of Charity</hi>; I add, <hi>To give himself to Reading, Exhortation, to take Heed to himself and the Doctrine, to Preach the Word, to be Instant in Season and out of Season,</hi> &amp;c. All which, the Apostle doth with the same <hi>Emphasis,</hi> of an Explicit Special Address to <hi>Timothy,</hi> prescribe; And to the same Scope of Directing him <hi>how to behave in the House of God</hi>—Charging him as Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to observe the same, as these that relate to the Power of Jurisdiction. But will the Dr's Inference <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer be Negative, why shall his Argument hold good in the Point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and the Precepts relative thereunto? I know nothing he can Answer, except that either <hi>Pastors</hi> had this Authority in a Dependance upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> or that the Power of Order is attribute to <hi>Pastors</hi> elsewhere, not that of Jurisdiction: Both which Evasions are a mere <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> and a Baffling of the great Topick and Ground of his Argument, taken from the <hi>Address of these Precepts to</hi> Timothy, especially since the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and equally supposing Authority in Church Government are attribute to <hi>Pastors.</hi> Who knows not, that the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Before I pass this, I cannot but add a Remark or two further: 1. That the Dr. will needs have Timothy <hi>Directed to Order the Publick Worship and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies of the Church.</hi> That he is Directed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. and elsewhere, anent Publick Worship, is certain: But for <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which the Dr. thrusts in, he must be told, they were not yet sprung up, if we may believe <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and others: It is palpably evident, that in all these Precepts, there's <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum silentium</hi> of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> whatever the Dr's Love to them, might Buzze in his Ears. 2. He tells us, <hi>That</hi> Timothy, <hi>and</hi> (with Emphasis) <hi>he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the Church of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>is Charged before the Lord, to observe these things, &amp;c.</hi> Thus, in the Dr's Sense, it seems that no <hi>Pastor,</hi> had any thing to do with Rebuking Sinners, either by Doctrine or Censure, or the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of Widows, and the Objects of Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These being peculiar to the Episcopal Function: An Assertion, no doubt, peculiar to the Dr. But proceed we.</p>
               <p>We are next told P. 109. <hi>That in those Apostolical Directions and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons addressed personally to</hi> Timothy, <hi>are contained the Nature, Extent, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the</hi> Episcopal <hi>Power.</hi> But why calls he it not <hi>an Apostolical Power,</hi> Since in his Sense, the Office derived is of this Nature and Character? Again, if this be the Nature of the <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> and if thus one and the same with that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> then sure, it is not paramount to the Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Power of Pastors; For such, we have proved <hi>Timothies</hi> to be. Next, as for the Extent thereof, we have made appear, that his Evangelistick
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58203:133"/>
Authority, is found extended to several other Churches: And therefore, if the Dr. shape <hi>Prelat</hi>'s <hi>Diocesses</hi> by this Standart, he will extend his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures far beyond <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What more is contained in those addressed Injunctions? <hi>His relation to that Church</hi> (saith the Dr.) <hi>and the perpetuity of his Power.</hi> But we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove made appear, that these Injunctions can no more evince a peculiar Relation to that Church, than to others, where he exercised his Evangelistick Office, as well as in that of <hi>Ephesus</hi>: And for <hi>the perpetuity of the Power,</hi> we have told him, that the intimation of <hi>Timothie</hi>'s transient Employment in that Church, presented in the beginning of the Epistle, the express Command of doing <hi>the work of an Evangelist</hi> therein (an Office, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, to be expired) the Apostles express recalling him from this transient Employment to the further prosecuting of his Office else where, as likewise, his ascribing the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power, after this, to the <hi>Pastors</hi> of this Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in <hi>Timothie</hi>'s presence, without the least hint of his Interest therein, convinceth this assertion of Falsehood.</p>
               <p>But to prove that his <hi>Power was not transient, but successive and perpetual,</hi> the Dr. <hi>presents unto us the Apostolical Command put upon him, to commit his Power to faithful Men, who shall be able to teach others.</hi> This proves indeed a Succession of a teaching Ministry, and of the Scripture Bishops and Pastors, who must <hi>be apt to teach, and hold fast the faithful Word</hi>; But that it imports a committing his <hi>Evangelistick Authority</hi> to Successors, is the Dr's. Anti-scriptural Dream; Wherein, he runs cross, 1. To the Judgement of sound Interpreters, as all know, since they understand by that which was to be intrusted to these Faithful Men, <hi>the Doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Timothy.</hi> 2. He doth herein cross the Scope &amp; Context: And that in three Points (1.) In that there is here a <hi>Plurality of Successors</hi> supposed, to whom this was to be committed: And if <hi>Timothie's</hi> Authority was to be devolved upon a <hi>Plurality,</hi> Dr. farewel the Derivation of an <hi>Episcopal Power</hi> to a single Successor. (2.) The great Characteristick of these <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men,</hi> is (as is said) that they be <hi>apt to teach,</hi> which is the very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> Chap. 3.2. (3.) The thing which is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted is, That which <hi>Timothy</hi> had heard of <hi>Paul,</hi> Sciz. <hi>The true Doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Charge thereanent, which is likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to all Ministers of the Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>But the Dr. will needs have that which is enjoyned in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept — <hi>(which is Faithfulness and Ability to teach others) to be by</hi> Timothy <hi>committed to a single Successor, as it was</hi> in solidum, <hi>his sole Prerogative.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Dr. this is at least slender Dealing of Charity. What! All Faithful Teaching monopolized in the person of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> committed to him, <hi>in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58203:134"/>
solidum,</hi> excluding <hi>Pastors</hi>? Many will suppose, that if this Work be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the <hi>Diocess</hi> will be meanly fed, especially since, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his personal incapacity to feed the whole <hi>Diocess,</hi> his Sermons drops very rarely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many poor Sheep may starve in the interval.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, the Dr. (<hi>ibid.</hi>) will have his Adversaries to grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That</hi> Timothy<hi>'s power exercised over</hi> Ephesus, <hi>was the very same, which he pleads for, as due to</hi> Bishops, <hi>in their particular Sees.</hi> That he had an Evangelis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power, we grant, and that <hi>Bishops</hi> take or usurp an Authority and Inspection, which, with some <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> is said to have an apparent Resemblance of that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> is true; But that the Function exercised by <hi>Prelats,</hi> is one and the same with that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> is denyed: For 1. We have proved, that neither Apostles nor Evangelists had <hi>a fixed or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Authority</hi> over particular Churches, or any <hi>such special Relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> as <hi>Prelats</hi> do pretend. 2. We made appear, that the Authority which they exercised, was not exclusive of, or paramount unto the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Authority and Decisive Power of <hi>Pastors</hi> in Government, that in Churches constitute, they had neither a <hi>sole Power,</hi> nor <hi>sole Exercise</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Jurisdiction, such as <hi>Prelats</hi> assume, who, according to the Nature of that Government, are the proper <hi>sole Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> and the whole power of Order and Jurisdiction is properly and original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seated in them, no <hi>Pastor</hi> having any thing of this, or the Exercise thereof, but according as it is lett out, or derived to them, at the <hi>Bishops</hi> pleasure; For, they deny universally, that the <hi>Pastoral Office</hi> hath in its Nature, included any Interest in Government. Now, this Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Church Judicatories, thus exclusive of all Authority of <hi>Pastors</hi> in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, no Evangelist, nay, nor Apostle ever exercised, it being such a Dominion in the House of GOD, as is disowned and discharged by them; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2, 3. Besides, the Dr. knows, that he pleads for a power in <hi>Civils,</hi> and a <hi>Civil Peerage,</hi> as due to <hi>Prelats,</hi> which he dare not say, that Apostles or Evangelists ever exercised, nor can he, or any of his Party, make it appear, that the Apostles gave the least shadow of a Warrand for it in their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, the Dr. adds (<hi>ibid.</hi>) <hi>That we pretend that</hi> Timothy <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised his power in the Church of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>under the Notion of an Evangelist, not as proper Bishop of</hi> Ephesus. That he was enjoyned, and accordingly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised this Office, and had a Command put upon him, to perform the Work of an Evangelist there, is that which (under this prodigiously profound D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'s Correction) a Man tinctured with the <hi>New Scots Opinion,</hi> viz: The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>postle, <hi>Paul</hi> pretends; And this Office, we hold to be distinct, <hi>toto coelo,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>om that of the <hi>Bishop.</hi> The Dr. saith, he will examine this afterward, wherein, I shall afterwards trace and search him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:58203:134"/>But at present, the Dr. will have <hi>some things to be granted, which cannot be denyed.</hi> If such indeed, its pitty the Dr. were denyed so just a Demand. What are these? <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>the power which</hi> Timothy <hi>exercised was Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it self.</hi> GOD forbid, we should assert that <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyned or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized an unlawful power; But <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> being Correlats, the good Dr. will allow us to <hi>Distinguish Lawful,</hi> into that which is so, upon ground of <hi>a Standing Law or Ordinance</hi>; And that which is so, upon <hi>a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and transitory Precept,</hi> and authorized by an <hi>Extraordinary Authority</hi> for the time; Which might be exemplified in a multiplicity of clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Instances, if we were not discoursing with a venerable Dr. who can distinguish General and Special, Ordinary and Extraordinary Precepts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lawful in their own time and Circumstances. We know the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Universal Authority was Lawful, writing authentick binding E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, in the Execution of this Authority, constituting Officers, Church by Church, modelling them in their Organick Being, delivering to them the Ordinances, their Disciplining all Nations, laying on Hands in order to the Spirits Miraculous Gifts, anoynting the Sick with Oyl, in order to the healing of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What next?</p>
               <p>The Doctor, in the <hi>Second</hi> Place, will have us grant, <hi>That this power was practised by</hi> Timothy <hi>in the Church of</hi> Epesus. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are highly Censurable, who will deny the Doctor so Just a Demand, so necessarly following upon the preceeding Concession, and the Scripture Records of the Exercise of his Power in that place. And no doubt, had the Dr. knit all his Consequences as well as this, he had past for a fair and Triumphant Disputant, and Acted as a Man worthy of his <hi>Cape</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi>: Only, we must be permitted, together with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, to Whisper the Dr. in the Ear, <hi>That he Exercised the same Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listick Office in other Churches, as well as in</hi> Ephesus, yea, and both before and after he was there, and he knows the Consequence, which these that have got the <hi>Scots Notion</hi> in their Head will draw upon him, <hi>viz. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Timothy <hi>had no Special Relation to that Church, nor Ordinary Inspection therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is his <hi>Third</hi> Desire of a Concession? <hi>viz. That this Power was committed to him alone, not to a Colledge of</hi> Presbyters, <hi>Acting in Parity and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.</hi> If he mean the <hi>Evangelistick Power,</hi> or an Evangelistick Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, supposing (as is often told him) the Existence of the Apostolick and Evangelistick Offices, which we hold, with all Sound Divines, to be expired; Supposing likewise, the Foundation of the Churches to be a laying, and which we may call the <hi>Scaffolding,</hi> which the Dr. hath told us, <hi>was to be removed, when the Building is perfected</hi>; And withal, understanding the Term <hi>Alone,</hi> as Exclusive of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and other Inferior Ordinary Church
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58203:135"/>
Officers; And so as not to Confine the Evangelistick Office to <hi>Timothies</hi> Person: This Demand is easily granted. But here we deny two Points, 1. That this Inspection, or Extraordinary Evangelistick Power, was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Timothy,</hi> over this Church, at this time, as to Exclude or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce the <hi>Pastors Ordinary Power,</hi> or to infer his Sole, and consequently <hi>Episcopal Interest</hi> in Government. 2. That the Ordinary Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not committed by <hi>Paul</hi> to a <hi>Colledge of Presbyters,</hi> as the Dr. sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, or that the Non-committing of <hi>Timothies</hi> Formal Office and Power as an Evangelist, to such a Colledge will infer such a Conclusion: Since, thus we would fasten a Contradiction upon <hi>Paul,</hi> in Intrusting the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power over the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> after this, to a <hi>Colledge of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Acting in Parity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Undenyable Point, the Dr. will have us to grant, is, <hi>That there is no mention of a Spiritual Power lodged in a Colledge of</hi> Presbyters, <hi>to which</hi> Timothy <hi>was Accountable for his Administrations.</hi> I <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. There was no need, because in that Infant-State of the Church, when (to use the Dr's Phrase) the Churches Fabrick was but in an Imperfect Scaffol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Posture, &amp; the Ordinary Church Officers and Judicatories were a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he was Accountable to the Infallibly Inspired Great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles, Paul,</hi> who Enjoyned him to order Things, in the Moulding of that Church, as he had <hi>Commanded</hi> and <hi>Appointed</hi> him. Besides, that the Nature of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Work, being a <hi>Temporary Transient Inspection,</hi> to pass off with that Exigent, &amp; to give Way to his other Imployments elsewhere, there was no Access for such an Inspection in the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Here I cannot but take notice, that the Dr. still adding the Clause of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> when speaking of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Power, must be minded of the <hi>Bishops Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> &amp; <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> which they claim. 2. We find mention made of a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie,</hi> that Ordained him, and whether, if ever fixed in any particular Post or Charge after <hi>Pauls</hi> Death, the mention of a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> that Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, will infer an Accountableness, is left to the Dr's Consideration. As also, whether the mention of that General Rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. <hi>That the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets,</hi> will infer an Accountable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all who come under a Character of <hi>Prophets</hi> to their Collegiat Meetings.</p>
               <p>The Dr's <hi>Fifth</hi> Concession, he will have from us, is, <hi>That the great and most eminent Branches of</hi> Episcopal <hi>Power, were lodged in his Person,</hi> Viz. <hi>the Ordination of such as were admitted unto the sacred Function, the care of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, the censuring of Elders, the Authoritative prevention of Heresies; about which</hi> (he tells us) <hi>the</hi> Episcopal <hi>Authority was most conversant in the Primitive times.</hi> I am glad that the <hi>Bishops</hi> high Office is become of so condescending and humble a nature and genius, that the mean business of <hi>the care of poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58203:135"/>
or Church Eleemo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ynaries, is become one of the most eminent Branches of their Power.</hi> I see these <hi>Branches</hi> runs far out, and their <hi>Lordships</hi> must have long A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms. But may I hope that the Dr. will take along in his next famous <hi>Work</hi> (since he hath in this place forgot it) the little mean and humble exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of <hi>Preaching the Gospel</hi> constantly and assiduously, since we find that <hi>Timothy</hi> was here enjoined it, and that in Season and out of Season, to which these <hi>Eminent Branches</hi> may stretch out, if at least, the Dr. can obtain a Licence for it of their <hi>Lordships,</hi> with such restrictions and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so's, in respect of their State-Imployments, as this unwarry Man, <hi>Paul,</hi> forgot to put in, who lays this in an unlimited general Precept upon the <hi>Bishop, Timothy,</hi> and with the solemnity of an alarming Preface of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Charge upon him before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the Dead, at his appearing and his Kingdom. 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> is found so far from having the Dr's <hi>Eminent Branches</hi> of <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power, lodged in him, that in the Scriptural Accounts, he is found, to have neither <hi>Root</hi> nor <hi>Branch</hi> of the same: The <hi>Bishops</hi> Power is supposed <hi>Ordinary,</hi> his was not; the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power is pleaded for as necessary to the <hi>Churches exedified State,</hi> in all times, and when Moulded in its Organick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his was suted to <hi>the Moulding thereof, when in fieri</hi> as to such a Being; the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power is in <hi>Fixed Diocesses, Timothies</hi> was not, but a <hi>transient Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> like that of the Apostles; The <hi>Bishops</hi> hath sole <hi>absolute Power</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Jurisdiction, over all <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Diocess; Timothy</hi> had no such <hi>Authority,</hi> but only of <hi>an Inspector and Moderator, for the time of his transient Mission</hi>; The <hi>Bishops</hi> assume a <hi>negative voice</hi> in all Judicatories of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> which the Dr. here owns, for he will have them subject to <hi>no col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat Meetings of Pastors</hi>; had <hi>Timothy</hi> assumed this, he had contradicted and baffled the Apostles Carriage <hi>Act.</hi> 15. where ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> are found concurring Authoritatively with the Apostles in the whole procedure of that solemn <hi>Council,</hi> both in the Disquisition, the Sentence, and the Epistle, enjoyning the Churches obedience thereunto: And I must presum to add with the Dr's good leave, that this <hi>Council</hi> is of more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Authority, and the Constitution thereof, of a more Divinly-exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying influence, than any he can appeal to, as patronizing the Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical <hi>Prelat,</hi> for whom he pleads. Again, had <hi>Timothy</hi> ordained alone, without <hi>Pastors,</hi> where they were to be had, he would have crossed the Rule of his own Ordination, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Precept supposing the same: Had he Censured alone, or assumed a sole Interest therein, he had crossed the Apostles Doctrin, who makes Censures the joint Authoritative Acts of the <hi>Collegiat Meetings of Pastors,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.14. As for the exercise of such <hi>Episcopal Power</hi> in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, the Dr. will never prove the <hi>Bishops</hi> sole Power herein, in the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Purest times,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:58203:136"/>
yea, and even after the <hi>Episcopus Praese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> was set up, and had obtained in Judicatories.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Concession which the Dr will have from us, is, <hi>That this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was not of it self of a temporary duration, transient, or extraordinary, but such as the constant necessities of the Church doth make necessary in all Ages</hi> That it was <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>transient,</hi> is that which we maintain, and is the Sense of Sound <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, as is already made appear; and we must have better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take this from us, and beat us from this Post, than our Dr's beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging assertion, without proof, or a Shadow of it. If the <hi>necessity of the Church</hi>
calls for such an Office, as this of <hi>Timothy,</hi> according to the Scripture Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Accounts, then sure for that of <hi>Apostolat</hi> also, in a proper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Sense, with all its Prerogatives, <hi>viz</hi>: That there be persons impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to give infallible Commands to transient Evangelists, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible direction of the Spirit enjoining and Authorizing the exercise of their Function, recalling thus the persons Authorized by an infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, from one Church to the further prosecuting this Work in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this in order to the Moulding and Watering of these Churches. Hence, 2. This Power not being properly and formally <hi>Episcopal,</hi> but contrary to such a Function, as well as in it self extraordinary, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed off, with that first State and exigence of the Church; neither can the Churches constant necessity crave it, nor doth it in the least patronize the <hi>Bishops</hi> acclaimed Power.</p>
               <p>For what the Dr. adds of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s <hi>committing his Power unto faithful Men, such as were able to Teach others.</hi> We have above discovered the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of this Argument, to bear the weight of his Conclusion: And he must prove, not barely assert, that <hi>the Trust Committted to him was ordinary,</hi> before it will be admitted, or his ruinous Consequence built upon this rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Foundation, that <hi>therefore there was no need of an extraordinary Officer to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now that the Dr. hath Done with <hi>Timothy,</hi> he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceeds to <hi>Titus,</hi> telling us, <hi>P.</hi> 110.111. <hi>That the same Power was committed to</hi> Titus <hi>in</hi> Crete, <hi>as one of</hi> Pauls <hi>Fellow-labourers:</hi> And the exception [<hi>that he was an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi>] which he cannot but know to be the Sense of the generality of sound <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>otestant</hi> Divines, our Dr. is bold to call a <hi>ridiculous subterfuge.</hi> Truely, if as ridiculous as his Arguments and Answers, it were so at all will. But, why <hi>ridiculous?</hi> Because, <hi>it is no where said in Scripture, that he was one of them, who are called</hi> Evangelists. I could wish the Dr. had been pleased to give us the definition of <hi>Evangelist,</hi> properly so taken, that it might be seen, how good. Harmony he keeps with <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches and Divines in this Point. I must add, that our critical Dr. seems very way-ward and ill to please: He will not have <hi>Titus</hi> an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> because, no where so called: Now
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58203:136"/>
he cannot but Confess <hi>Timothy</hi> is <hi>expresly called Evangelist,</hi> yea, and <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> enjoyned <hi>to do the work of an Evangelist,</hi> yet neither will he admit him to be such. We told the Dr. that the <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> have this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Office,
<q>That <hi>Evangelists</hi> were either <hi>scriptores Evangelici de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp; morte, dictis &amp; factis Salvatoris,</hi>—&amp;c. such as wrote the History of our Saviours Life and Death; or <hi>ab Apostolis ad Evangelium una cum ipsis praedicandum vocati</hi>— &amp;c. such as were called by the Apostles to Preach the Gospel together with them, and attended them as their Fellow-labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, unless, when they were by the Apostles set to oversee some Churches for a time; such were <hi>Barnabas, Silas, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to whom some add the Seventy Disciples.</q>
Here is the <hi>Protestant</hi> Notion of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which clearly appears Scriptural: And upon the equality and same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Function and Work, concluds them both <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</hi> I must further tell the Dr, that in <hi>Ambrose</hi> sense, <hi>Evangelists</hi> were such, as did <hi>Evangeliz are sine Cathedra, Preached without a fixed Charge.</hi> And <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> himself (<hi>de diversis gradibus Minist. Cap.</hi> 6.) upon that Precept of <hi>Paul, Do the Work of an Evangelist,</hi> tells us.
<q>That he will not deny <hi>Timothy</hi> the Name of Evangelist, since <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyned him to perform this Office.</q>
The Man knew <hi>Paul</hi> put not upon him an empty Name. But further, the Dr. <hi>will have nothing in the Office of an Evangelist inconsistent with the Dignity of Bishop, Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Deacon.</hi> That the Evangelistick Office, as in Scripture delineat, stands opposit to that of the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> I have above made good. How he comes to say, <hi>its not inconsistent with the Dignity of these Offices,</hi> is some what Mysterious, since the general acceptation of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Office, is, that it was next in Dignity to that of Apostles, at least, above all Ordinary Officers: And for the Dignity of <hi>Deacons,</hi> it seems Odd, that the Lowest Office hath a Dignity suteable to that of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</hi> The Dr. tells us further, <hi>That</hi> Eusebius <hi>Notion of</hi> Evangelist, <hi>is one who Preached the Gospel to such as had not heard it, or at least, had Resisted its Light and were not Converted.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> takes the Title two ways, either for such as Wrote the Gospel, or those that Taught it; and those again, were either such as had ordinary Places and Gifts, or whose Places and Gifts were Extraordinary, not Settled upon any Charge, but were <hi>Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Vice,</hi> or Vice-Apostles, having a Vicarious Care of the Churches, as the Apostles had the principal.</q>
Which Justles with the Dr's Account: And in the Passage of <hi>Eusebius</hi> Cited by him, he makes the Evangelist Work to be a Watering the Apostles Plantations, as well as a Preaching to such as had not heard the Gospel. But he adds, <hi>That its agreeable to the Function of either of these Offices, to Preach the Gospel to such as are not yet acquainted with it.</hi> This is hardly intelligible: 1. That the Evangelists Office consisted in <hi>mere Preaching,</hi> and to such as were in the Character of <hi>Infidels or Resisters of the Gospel</hi>; as it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58203:137"/>
appears not to be <hi>Eusebius</hi> Sense, so he cannot shew it to be the Sense of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sound <hi>Protestant.</hi> 2. The Dr. will not say, that <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Preaching-Work in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he was called to be instant therein, in Season and out of Season, respected not mainly the Members of that Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was also called to give Attendance to Reading, Exhortation, and Doctrine: And moreover, by the Dr's Confession, to many pieces of <hi>a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictional Work,</hi> which he must either grant to fall within the Compass of his <hi>Evangelistick Office,</hi> and consequently, that his Restricted Sense thereof above expressed, is foolish and impertinent, or prove the Exception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of out of that Precept, and the Service and Ministry therein enjoyned him by the Apostle, when he is thus exhorted <hi>to do the Work of an Evangelist, and make fall Proof of his Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the Dr. will Answer the Objection taken from this Precept, enjoyning the Exercise of an <hi>Evangelistick Office.</hi> And, <hi>First,</hi> He tells us, <hi>There was Good Reason for it</hi>: No doubt of that; Good Reason, a Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer be enjoyned Diligence in his Office. But why <hi>Good Reason,</hi> in the Dr's Sense? Because (saith he) <hi>Many among the</hi> Ephesians <hi>were Infidels.</hi> Here is a Reason of this Precept rare to be found elsewhere: But even granting this to be one Partial Ground, that this was the <hi>only or main Ground</hi> of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and that his Work as an Evangelist, was only of this Nature, is among the rest of the Dr's Magisterial Dictats, and <hi>gratis supposita.</hi> He adds, <hi>That it is no where insinuated, that he was only invested with that Authority, that agrees to the Notion of an</hi> Evangelist <hi>separated and distinguished from either</hi> Bishop <hi>or</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Here the Dr. speaks of an <hi>Evangelists</hi> Office separated and distinguished from that of <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi>; Whereof he hath given us no distinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. As for that Sense, in Reference to Preaching, which he hints as that of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and his own, we have made appear, how cross it is to the Sense exhibit by Sound Divines, and that <hi>Timothy</hi> had an Office distinct from <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> which consequently this Precept enjoyns, so, that it is enough for us, that he was invested (and in that Precept, is supposed invested) with such an <hi>Evangelistick Office,</hi> as is inconsistent with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> whom he pleads for. And to this purpose, it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that the Term <hi>Evangelist,</hi> being thrice only used in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and in this Precept: Since in the other two Places, it is taken for the Extraordinary Function above described, why not also here? Besides, tho Extraordinary Functions communicat in General Names with Ordinary, as when <hi>Apostles</hi> are called <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> yet he cannot shew, that Extraordinary Names are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de use of (at least, so <hi>Emphatically</hi> as in this Precept) to point at Ordinary Functions. If we Paralell this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Phrase or <hi>Phraseology,</hi> as the Dr. speaks, with the like in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Language, this may be convincingly made good, as when we read of Signs of an Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor</hi>: 12.12. Commands of Apostles, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. Foundation of Apostles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. Where the Term designs a peculiar Office: And thus it must be, when the <hi>Work of an Evangelist</hi> is enjoyned to <hi>Timothy.</hi> So that if the Office and Work of an Evangelist, which is in the Sense of sound Divines, extraordinary and expired, be ascribed to both these persons, and found incompatible with the Work and Office of a <hi>Prelat,</hi> the Dr's. Evasions are evidently found nought. Suppose a person enjoyned to do the Work of a Parent, a Magistrat, or a Husband, none will doubt that the peculiar Relations and Duties of Parents, Magistrats and Husbands are here intimat: As likewise, if a <hi>Pastor</hi> be enjoyned to do that Work, the same is held out. The Dr. will have it no where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuat, <hi>That</hi> Timothy <hi>was invested with that Authority that agrees to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an</hi> Evangelist, <hi>separated and distinguished from either</hi> Bishop <hi>or</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If by <hi>Separated &amp; Distinguished,</hi> he understand an higher formal Office, than that of <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the Passage above mentioned clearly proves it, admitting the Evangelists Office to be of that Nature, State and Rank above exprest. If by <hi>Separate,</hi> he understand such as is formally distinct from the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and of another specifick Nature, the Precept doth likewise clearly insinuat this. If by <hi>Only Invested,</hi> he mean such an Office as cannot exert the Acts or Duties competent to Scripture-<hi>Bishop</hi>
or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> this is impertinent to the purpose, and there is no need of such Insinuation. The <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> were invested properly and formally with their Apostolical, Evangelistick Offices, which <hi>Eminenter</hi>
had included therein the <hi>Pastors</hi> Work and Duties. This doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover the Dr's. empty Quiblings ensuing, to be mere impertinent Shifts: Such as, that one may do the Evangelists Work, who is higher; <hi>Sed quid hoc ad</hi> Rhombum, the <hi>Apostles</hi> performed the Duties and Work of <hi>Pastors:</hi> But that therefore there is no peculiar Office of a <hi>Pastor</hi> distinct from that of <hi>Apostle,</hi> is a palpably weak Consequence: And will he say, that when a <hi>Pastor</hi> is commanded and enjoyned his Work, there is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Office and Duty supposed, because his Office is <hi>Eminenter,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that of <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that they performed and were enjoyned the same Duties? The Dr's next Instance is as foolish: Daniel (saith he) <hi>did the Work of a King, yet was no King,</hi> Dan: 8.7. He is indeed said to do the <hi>Kings Business,</hi> in a passive Sense, That is, performed Service to the King, as the meanest Servant does his greatest Masters Business in serving him; But he that will hold that upon this account, he may be said to do <hi>the Work of a King,</hi> That is, performed <hi>the Royal Acts of his Regal Office,</hi> and such as are peculiar thereunto, or that this phrase hath the same import
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58203:138"/>
as <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being enjoyned to the Work of an Evangelist, hath a Crack in his Intellectuals.</p>
               <p>We are told next, P. 111.112. <hi>That</hi> Philip <hi>was an Evangelist,</hi> Act. 21.8. <hi>yet also one of the seven Deacons mentioned</hi> Act. 6. <hi>But had no power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Baptized, nor to ordain to Ecclesiastick Offices by imposition of Hands, as</hi> Timothy. <hi>Ans. First,</hi> That <hi>Philip</hi> continued in the Office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> when called an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> is more than he offers to prove, or will be ever able to do.
<q>The <hi>Belgick Divines,</hi> with <hi>Diodiate</hi> &amp; others, take the Office of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi> here, for the extraordinary expired Function, above described: And consequently, to be the same with the Office of <hi>Timothy.</hi> Thus also <hi>Pool.</hi> 2<hi>d. Part,</hi> paralelling this Passage, with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. And upon the last Clause, wherein mention is made of his <hi>Diaconate,</hi> they assert, that having discharged the Office of <hi>Deacon</hi> well, he did purchase to himself this <hi>Good Degree,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</q>
Judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, offers the same Sense of the Evangelists Office, <hi>Inter Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolos &amp; Doctores medii erant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That they had a midle Function betwixt Apostles and Doctors, and an Office next to that of the Apostolat, that they might every where preach the Gospel, and were sett to no fixed Station or Post.</hi> Whence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that his <hi>Diaconate</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was only transient, or for some time exercised by him, and that thereafter he was assumed to be an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> since otherwise, it had not been warrantable to him to leave <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and reside at <hi>Cesarea.</hi> He further adds,
<q>That he is not here proposed as a voluntar Deserter of his Office, but as one who had a more excellent Office entrusted unto him, so that he held not both Offices joyntly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the point of <hi>Ordination</hi>: I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> It is more than he hath proved, or can, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had a sole Interest therein in Churches constitute; And what he might do in Churches not constitute, is not to the purpose. For 1. Ordination is found in Scripture to be the Judicial Act of a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> which was exercised, even upon <hi>Timothy</hi> himself. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> would not ordain alone, tho the great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but took along the <hi>Presbytries</hi> Authoritative Concurrence, where a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> was constitute, as is evident in the Scripture Accounts of this <hi>Evangelists</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, wherein the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> Authoritatively laid on Hands, together with the Apostle. Hence it is evident, that far less could <hi>Timothy</hi> assume a <hi>sole Interest</hi> in Ordinarion, exclusive of that of the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute; since his Office was inferior to that of Apostolat. <hi>Next,</hi> Supposing <hi>Philip</hi> an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> in the proper Scripture Acceptation above described, he was no doubt capable of the same Employment and Exercise thereof, when the Churches Case required it, as <hi>Timothy,</hi> else the Dr. will say, that <hi>Evangelists</hi> had not all the same Office and Authority. For, what he adds of <hi>Confirming the Baptized,</hi> we have above spoken to it a large;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58203:138"/>
And when he hath described this <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and exhibite the Divine Warrands thereof, and proved from Scripture, <hi>Timothie</hi>'s Interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I doubt not to bring up <hi>Philip</hi> to the same Priviledge. We are told next, <hi>That to be an</hi> Evangelist, <hi>is very agreeable to all Subordinations of the Christian Hierarchy.</hi> Thus it seems with him, That the Term imports no peculiar Office: And thus, if he owns <hi>Eusebius</hi> Notion of Evangelist, which is to <hi>Preach the Gospel to such as had not heard it, or resisted it, and were not Converted</hi>; He appears inconsistent with himself, in making it applicable <hi>to all Church Officers,</hi> and consequently appropriating to them the Function of Converting Infidels, by Preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as in these first times of <hi>Christianity</hi>: And what Harmony this keeps with the Sense of <hi>Protestant Divines,</hi> in Reference both to the Pastoral and Evangelistick Office, is obviously evident. Not to scann the foulsom <hi>Popish</hi> Savour of his expression of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Hierarchy,</hi> and the necessary consequence of his absurd ascribing the Office of <hi>preaching the Gospel,</hi> consequently, the administration of the Seals of the Covenant, to the meanest and lowest of Church Officers. He adds, <hi>That the primitive Bishops were Evangelists, and that any Bishop or Presbyter that Converts Infidels, are as properly Evangelists, as these so called in the Primitive Church.</hi> He must say as this person of whom our debate is, who is by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> called to <hi>do the work of an Evangelist.</hi> This is such a gross absurd As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, that to recite it, is to refute it. Will any Man of common Sense imagine, that when <hi>Timothy</hi> is thus enjoyned, he is put upon no other work, or to exercise no other Function, than what the meanest <hi>Deacon</hi> was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of? Or that the Sense of this Precept, <hi>do the Work of an Evangelist,</hi> is only amounting to this, <hi>Convert Infidels</hi>? I think indeed the Man who believes this, is an <hi>Infidel</hi> to this Scripture Light.</p>
               <p>The Dr. is now advancing to a Scripture proof from <hi>Iames,</hi> and tells us, <hi>He will not debate with us, whether</hi> James <hi>was one of the Twelve or not</hi>: Nor shall I detain him upon this, it being spoken to above, and shall aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he had the Name and Authority of an Apostle ascribed unto him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. and 1.19. That he was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Dr. tell us, <hi>is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly attested by the most ancient Witnesses, especially</hi> Clemens Alexandrinus <hi>and</hi> Hegesippus. What Strength is in this Argument from Human Testimony, and what Credit <hi>Hegesippus</hi> deserves, is above touched: But we must tell him that he must be set to his task; It is <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> and <hi>Scripture proof,</hi> and Witnesses we are seeking, according to his undertaking, not that of <hi>Clemens</hi> or <hi>Hegesippus.</hi> But he tells us, <hi>he needs not fill Text or Margin with Gita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, since all his Adversaries, and particularly</hi> Salmasius, <hi>acknowledge that he was the first</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Jerusalem. But truely, he hath instead of Scripture proof, filled his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> with such stuff, that he had done well long since, thus
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58203:139"/>
to resolve. Here is a bold and broad amplifying Assertion, which some will be bold to call one of the Dr's broad and splendid Lies, What! All his Adversaries acknowledge <hi>Iames</hi> first <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>? I know not one, nor can he Assign one of this <hi>All,</hi> that acknowledge him <hi>Bishop</hi> in the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Sense. His Instance of <hi>Salmasius,</hi> which is the only one to evince this <hi>All,</hi> the Dr. Produceth, is such a pitiful faint Witness, that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of him, serves only to render the Dr. the Object of their Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who are less Serious; For, all that he can say is, <hi>That</hi> James <hi>continued at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>when other Apostles withdrew</hi>: But that he was therefore in his Sense, <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is a Consequence which will require other Rules of Logick to make it good, than have been heard of. Suppose <hi>Salmasius</hi> acknowledge that the <hi>Ancients</hi> called him so; all do know, that he asserts only their expressing the Offices of Apostles, and other extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, after the Mode of their Times, and Denominations, which had then obtained; as <hi>Iunius, Whittaker,</hi> and many other Learned <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines have observed; And the Matter it self is evident to all Unprejudicat Minds: So, that we need not insist upon this. Only, we must again enjoyn him, his Task of proving a Twofold Consequence, and help his Memory in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his next Undertaking against the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> 1. <hi>Iames</hi> stayed at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> when other Apostles withdrew; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally <hi>Bishop</hi> thereof. 2. <hi>Salmasius</hi> acknowledges, that <hi>de facto,</hi> the <hi>Ancients</hi> call him <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that he abode at <hi>Ierusalem; Ergo,</hi> he acknowledges him <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and a <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Dr's Mould, as succeeding the Apostolat therein, now it seems laid aside. Again, the <hi>Ancients</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>de facto,</hi> he was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> relates this; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ownes the <hi>Ius</hi> of the <hi>Hierarchical Bishop.</hi> When the Dr. hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged this Task, he shall be an <hi>Apollo</hi> for his Skill.</p>
               <p>But now (P. 113.) the Dr. tells us, <hi>That the Account the Scriptures gives us of him, is very agreeable to the Testimony of the</hi> Ancients. I am verrily of the Opinion, that the Dr's Veneration for <hi>Antiquity</hi> is too Venerable. I should think that the Dr. should have spoken better Sense and Divinity, if expressing it in this Order, that the Testimony of the <hi>Ancients</hi> is agreeable to the Account of the Scripture, and to have made the Scripture Account <hi>the Leading Testimony.</hi> Well, let us hear this Account of Scripture: Only before we hear it, let us remember, what the Point is, which this Account and Testimony must have Reference to, <hi>viz. That the Apostle</hi> James <hi>was properly and formally Bishop of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>having a fixed Relation thereto, as his proper peculiar Diocess, and Exercising an ordinary Episcopal Iurisdiction over that Church.</hi> The first Proof is, That <hi>Peter pays a Deference to him, in enjoyning notice to be given him, and the Brethren, of his Escape from Prison, Act.</hi> 12.17. Here is an Account given of an Important Mercy to a Fellow-Apostle, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58203:139"/>
other Ministers at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but a Deference to him asi <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the Sense above exhibit, even granting the ordnary Exercise of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship there, is such a Consequence, as no Rational Man can admit: For, 1. Were not all, whether we may suppose them Apostles or Brethren present, concerned in this, and capable of the Deference of this Information? Yea, are they not thus Represented? 2. Suppose Apostles present, without any such Residence, or supposed Episcopal Relation, will the mere Deference of such an Information prove this? Yea, say this supposed his special Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there, and consequently, his and the other Brethrens Concern in the Information, can any Rational Man imagine, that this Deference thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, will suppose any more, than such a Residence for the time? Besides, that the more Severe Critick, would Interrogat him, how this Information, simplely considered, comes under the Character of such a <hi>Special Deference</hi> and Honour, as the Dr. makes it? Will the Report of an Important Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prove this, since another End is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> The Instruction and Comfort of the Person Informed, simplely considered? The Critick would also Pose the Dr. upon this, What Deference was paid in <hi>Peters</hi> first <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Visit</hi> to the House of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the other Praying Persons with her? I think if mention had been of <hi>Iohn Mark</hi> his Personal Presence, this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, by the help of the Dr's Logick, and Quickned a litle by his Zeal for <hi>Prelacy,</hi> would have put fair to set him up as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at this time.</p>
               <p>But the Dr. tells us, this <hi>Deference is taken notice of elsewhere,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1, 9. For the first Passage, the Apostle tells, <hi>v.</hi> 18. that he went up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to see <hi>Peter.</hi> Here is some Deference. He adds, that he saw none of the Apostles save <hi>Iames.</hi> What Deference is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuat, and in special <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> will require a new Essay of the Dr. to draw it from the Text. <hi>Pool</hi> takes the Naming of these here to import, <hi>That the other Apostles being scattered, and gone off to prosecute their Work, these two Apostles were only at this time resident there.</hi> Thus it seems the Dr's great Topick from a Residence at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as peculiar to <hi>Iames,</hi> is much Weakned by this Testimony; And his <hi>Reverence</hi> did not well to raise this Ghost. As for <hi>Pauls</hi> second Journey to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Recorded in the other Passage, and the mention of <hi>Iames</hi> with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I know not what Shadow of Argument can be drawn therefrom, for his pretended <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> more than of <hi>Cephas</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>: Whatever Eminency in Moral Respects is here insinuat, sure it is Shared among all the three, without any Shadow of a Preference of <hi>Iames</hi> to the rest, and far less <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> unless the Dr. draw the Strength of his Argument from his being first Named, and thus Patronize the <hi>Popish</hi> Argument, from the first Nomination of <hi>Peter,</hi> to prove his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58203:140"/>
Which is long since Baffled and Disowned by all <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines. The Dr. alledges, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would needs Impose upon Mens Senses and Belief, their own Dreams; as if some Phantastick Person should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he sees Visions of Armies and Battallions in the Skies, and Challenge and Threaten others to see what they see not: If his Consequences in this and many other places of his <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> be not of this Nature, surely never any were.</p>
               <p>But the great Demonstration of the highest Class follows, which the Dr. Prefaceth with <hi>a most of all.</hi> What is that? Why? <hi>Act.</hi> 15.19. <hi>He pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Sentence of the Council by his Episcopal Authority.</hi> Here is an Airy Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion indeed, a Demonstration, the Rules whereof are existent only in the Dr's Brain. The Sentence and Decision of this Apostolick <hi>Council,</hi> upon Conference and Debate, was pronunced by <hi>Iames; Ergo</hi> as a Deference ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit to him by all the Apostles above themselves, yea, and <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> What a Rope of Sand is this? I know, its ordinarly supposed he presided in the <hi>Council,</hi> but that this doth import any <hi>Official Deference</hi> or <hi>Supereminency</hi> over his Fellow-Apostles, and far less as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is a Consequence as far remote from this Concession and Supposition, as East from West. The Dr. saith, he pronunced the Sentence by <hi>his Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>: Thus it seems <hi>his Episcopal Authority</hi> was a higher Sphere of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than ever he had by <hi>his Apostolat</hi>; And if so, the Dr. hath Razed all his former Pleadings for a Succession of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to an <hi>Apostolat,</hi> and must devise a higher Function, than even that of <hi>Apostolat,</hi> to found <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority. But the Dr. will not be thought (now that he is in a Calmer Humor) <hi>to plead that</hi> James <hi>alone Decided by his sole Power, without Concurrence of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her Apostles, but as</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>he presided in the</hi> Council. But here it might be asked, what sort of <hi>Presidency</hi> it is that the Dr. here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes to <hi>James,</hi> in this <hi>Council</hi>? Whether the mere <hi>Presidency</hi> of a <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> or that which is properly <hi>Episcopal,</hi> having the sole Rectoral Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therein? The asserting of the first only seems not Consonant to the Dr's Scope, which is to prove an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority in Judicatories, as here Exemplified. If he assert the second, then in Contradiction to himself, he robs the rest of the Apostles of this Rectoral Power, Monopolizing it in the Person of <hi>James.</hi> Or, if he should ascribe this <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power to him, with respect to the Inferior <hi>Clergy</hi> there present, he cannot deny, that his Fellow-Apostles Shared with him herein; And so there is nothing of <hi>sole Episcopal</hi> Power Exemplified in this Instance, or any thing else, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a mere <hi>Presidency,</hi> which might be allowed upon the Account of his ordinary Residence at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by his Fellow-Apostles, not unlike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Moderators</hi> Office allowed by a <hi>Synod</hi> to the Minister of a City, wherein it is assembled, which doth nothing impeach the same Rectoral Power,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58203:140"/>
competent to every <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Judicatory. But as to the <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Rectoral Power, the Dr. cannot be ignorant, that his Fellow-Pleader <hi>Bishop Downam,</hi> in his Defence (with whom the Dr. will not desire to Justle and Deal Stroaks) is clear and positive in this Assertion of the Bishops sole Authority in Government. That <hi>James</hi> presided in the <hi>Council,</hi> I have told the Dr, is supposed, though I conceive it a pretty hard task to offer a demonstrative Argument from the Text to make it good: But that it was as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is a phantastick Dream, which hath no shadow of Ground. That Passage [<hi>My Sentence is</hi>] the Authors of the 2<hi>d. Part</hi> of <hi>Pools Annot.</hi> with several others, take to be only the Signification of his Judgement upon the Question, in Correspondence to what <hi>Peter</hi> had before spoken. As for <hi>Simeons</hi> Succession to <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Hegesippus</hi> Account of the Succession of <hi>Bishops</hi> there: It is spoken to above, and what Credit is to be given to the supposed Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and other pretended <hi>Diocesses.</hi> For what he adds of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgement upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>As favouring his Opinion.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Calvin</hi> takes him indeed to be among Eminent Apostles, <hi>viz.</hi> In Moral Respects, <hi>prudentia &amp; aliis dotibus,</hi> as he expones the word <hi>Pillar,</hi> and attributs the same Eminency to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>; And speaking of his presiding in the <hi>Council,</hi> he doth not positively assert the Ground which the Dr. alledges, but problematically with a <hi>fortassis id factum,</hi> &amp;c. And even granting his Admission of a <hi>Presidency,</hi> the Consequence of an <hi>Official Presidency,</hi> and as importing a Majority of Power, far less <hi>eo nomine</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally <hi>Bishop</hi> there, is so very gross and obviously impertinent, as any with half an Eye may discover it.</p>
               <p>The Dr. tells us, <hi>That his Scripture Instances do plainly demonstrat that the Apostolical or Episcopal Authority was conveyed to single persons in the first Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christianity.</hi> What Demonstrations these are, I refer to the <hi>Reader</hi> to Judge from what is above replyed, such sure, as are not adapted to any Rules that hitherto hath been heard of, whereof this is a very clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that the Dr. in this Peroration and refined Summ and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of his supposed mighty preceeding Demonstrations, hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as great None-sense as ever was spoken or written: Which I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat thus from the <hi>Series</hi> of his Reasoning: In his Sense, the <hi>Apostolick</hi> and <hi>Episcopal Office</hi> is one and equal, and Apostles as such, were Superior to all Church Officers except <hi>Bishops,</hi> their proper Successors in Official Authority. Now, here is a Successor <hi>Bishop</hi> preferred to all Apostles <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as Successor-Bishop, yet deriving in his Sense also an Apostolat only; And which is yet odder, succeeding to an <hi>Apostolick Office,</hi> who was an Apostle before, and by his Confession thus related unto, and having an Official Authority, respecting the Church Universal; Yet when his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58203:141"/>
Charge is Restricted to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as his proper Post and Diocess, he doth upon this Ground Transcend all the Apostles in Official Authority. If any will sodder these Assertions together, and reconcile them to sound Sense and Divinity, he must be better skilled than all <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Gim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merers.</p>
               <p>The Dr. <hi>will not insist upon the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>imaginary and superficial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which they have invented.</hi> They must be such because he saith it, and save him from a Concern in Scanning them. No doubt, if as Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and Imaginary as his Demonstrations, their Inventions were very shallow.</p>
               <p>The Dr. brings next (P. 114.) the Trite Argument taken from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Asiatick</hi> Angels: And first tells us of Salmasius <hi>taking the Angels as denot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches, the Denomination being taken from the purer Part of these Cities, to which Christ wrote. To which he replyes from the distinction of the Churches from the Angels,</hi> Rev. 1.20. <hi>And that the Sense would thus be, to the Church of the Churches.</hi> Not to detain him much here, we only tell him, that whatever <hi>Salmasius</hi> Sense or Escape might be in this, he cannot deny, that in the Sense and Judgement of the Body of all <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> are distinguished from the <hi>Churches,</hi> as the Church <hi>Representative,</hi> is from the Church <hi>Collective.</hi> Besides, himself acknowledges (P. 115.) That the Heavenly Admonitions are first addressed to the <hi>Angels,</hi> and by them were Communicated to the <hi>Churches</hi>: As at the close of every Epistle, all are called to hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches. And he will not doubt that <hi>Salmasius</hi> distinguisheth Ministers from Church Members in this Point, and the Church Members concern in all that is written, he can less doubt. Besides that, <hi>Salmasius</hi> words will hardly bear his critical and sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Construction, who calls them <hi>a silly subterfuge,</hi> since he may be supposed to compare only the <hi>Populi purior pars</hi> (as he Terms it) with the <hi>rest of the Inhabitants of these Towns,</hi> so that the Address distininguisheth them from others; And the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church, in his Sense, will import only the Church in such a City, not the Church of such a Church.</p>
               <p>But the Dr. will not have the Angel <hi>a Multitude, but one single Angel, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding over Presbyters and People.</hi> We have already made appear, that the Collective Sense of the Term <hi>Angel,</hi> is most su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Dr. will needs loose the Objection taken from the <hi>Plural Address</hi> of the <hi>Angel,</hi> which he thus propones, <hi>That some Instructions there are in these Epistles, in which others beside the Angels, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly admonished.</hi> This is a piece of our Dr's. petty Sophistry: He must make the knot easie, that he may know how to loose it. The very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of this Objection, is a yeelding of the Cause; For, if in this <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Address,</hi> these <hi>others addressed,</hi> be not the <hi>Angel,</hi> then there is no

                  <hi>Plural Address</hi> of the <hi>Angel</hi> himself, or Representation of the Term <hi>Angel,</hi> in a Plural Mould: But had the Dr. intended to Dispute, not to triffle, in proposing a simple Foppery, in stead of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Objection, he should have told his Reader, that we hold (and do exhibit Instances of it) that the <hi>Angel</hi> himself, is addressed <hi>Plurally,</hi> and bespoken so in these Epistles, as a plurality of Officers, appear evidently to be pointed at by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There the same persons are addressed and spoken to, both singlely as one <hi>Angel,</hi> and plurally as many, &amp; that in reference to the same very individual Purpose and Duty, the Speech running on both to the same Persons, and the same Scope. So that to use the Dr's. Phrase in reference to <hi>Salmasius,</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Objection, appears to be <hi>a silly subterfuge,</hi> fit for nothing but to move their Laughter, who are seen in this Debat, and unworthy to have been uttered, much less printed by a Man who sets a D. D. to his Name. The Dr. cannot but know that the pinch of this Debate, and state of the Question betwixt him and us, is, Whether all that's spoken of this <hi>Angel,</hi> can be competent to <hi>one individual</hi> (the contrary whereof, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have made good) and not anent the Concerns of particular Persons, in some special Precepts of a general Epistle, which is <hi>in terminis</hi> addressed to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>The Dr. adds as another mighty Answer, <hi>That the second Epistle to</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy <hi>is addressed to him alone, tho the Conclusion be to all the Faithful at</hi> Ephes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. <hi>Ans</hi>: That the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> is addressed to him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, no Body doubts: As for that Conclusion, <hi>The Lord Iesus be with thy Spirit, Grace be with you,</hi> there can nothing thence be inferred, but that the Apostle in the Precepts addressed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> designed the Good of the whole Church: And altho what is contained in the Epistle, have this

Besides, that in this Conclusion, the People are distinguished from the person of <hi>Timothy;</hi> So, that the Conclusion doth not solely and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly reach them: But this holds not paralel with the Direction of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to a Plurality, thus Mystically represented by one single <hi>Angel.</hi> The Dr. adds further, <hi>That the Bishops of the</hi> Asiatick <hi>Churches, are said to be</hi>
Angels, <hi>in Imitation of the</hi> Jews, <hi>among whom the High Priest was dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with that Name, as</hi> Mal. 2.7. <hi>Where the Word Messenger may be translated Angel.</hi> I like not the Doctor's <hi>Iewish</hi> Imitations: If the Pattern was drawn from <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. Even granting this to the Dr, that the Term <hi>Angel</hi> is with Allusion to that Term of <hi>Messenger,</hi> the Term and Designation is Scriptural; And had his Eyes been single, he might in looking upon that Text, have found that the Term of <hi>Messenger</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> hath a plural Signification; And consequently our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the single Term <hi>Angel,</hi> in a <hi>Collective Sense,</hi> in these Epistles, and Application of the Plural Address to the single Angel, to be Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in that Scripture.

Indigitat an Officer Superior to <hi>Pastors</hi> or Ministers.

The Dr. pleads <hi>that the Faults of the Churches are imputed to the Angels, because of their Spiritual Power to Reform and Chastise these Abuses. Ans.</hi> No doubt Ministers have great influence upon the good or ill Frame of Churches, and this will say as much, yea much more for us, than for the Dr; for upon our Supposition of a <hi>Plurality of Pastors</hi> Addressed in the <hi>Angel,</hi> its much more suteable to suppose a Peoples good or ill Frame and Spiritual Condition to be influenced by the good or bad Carriage of their <hi>Pastors,</hi> who have an immediat Inspection over them, than to suppose it flows merely from the good or bad Carriage of one <hi>Prelat</hi> set over their <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>themselves,</hi> this Inspection being the more remote: And the Dr. knows we may call in an old gray Hair'd Witness, <hi>Experience,</hi> to testifie that there hath sometimes been some diligent <hi>Pastors,</hi> and a thriving People in a <hi>Diocess,</hi> where the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath been naught. And besides, that the Dr. here pitifully beggs the Question, he should have seen how to evite the Inconvenience of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> (so eminently commended for his Faithfulness, Stedfastness and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) his falling, as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> from his first Love, and by his bad Carriage influencing this bad Frame in that Church, and leading them wrong. As likewise, he should have seen, how to make it appear, that the Important Duties of <hi>Faithfulness, holding fast what is attained, not to Fear Sufferings, Warnings of a Prison Tryal,</hi> &amp;c. are applicable to <hi>one Person sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> As likewise, how several of these evils charged upon the Churches, could be the Objects of the <hi>Bishops</hi> supposed Spiritual Chastising Power, such as their <hi>Dead Frame, Falling from their first Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Dr. (<hi>ibid.</hi>) will in the next place, loose the Objection taken from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. <hi>But unto you I say, and to the rest in</hi> Thyatira: Whence he tells us we plead that the Epistles were directed to a Community, because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation is in the Plural.

                  </gap>nus aperta <hi>and</hi> manus clausa. <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> doth but here Shufflle and Obscure the true State of this <hi>Question,</hi> betwixt <hi>Episcopalians</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; Which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon our Supposal of that Authority and Government, ascribed in Scripture to <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Interest therein, how an Officer, who is pretended to be Distinct from them, and Superior unto them, and Enhancing and Concentring all their Power in himself, can be consistent with the Scripture Prescriptions in point of Government? The <hi>Surveyer</hi> should have known, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not only appoint the <hi>Official Power,</hi> but its <hi>proper Subject</hi>; So that the Removing it from its proper Basis and Subject, is a palpable Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these Institutions in point of Government: And therefore, if by our Lords Warrand, this Official Power is <hi>Diffused</hi> in a <hi>Colledge of Pastors or Presbyters,</hi> the Concentring it in the person of <hi>one Prelat,</hi> must needs be an arrant Usurpation in Men, yea (and if possible) in Angels. Next, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> Narroweth and Disguiseth the <hi>Bishops</hi> Power he pleads for: And that several ways, 1. He overleaps his Arrogated Power of Order, whereof he is the proper and primary Subject in the Diocess, wherein <hi>Pastors</hi> Act but as his Deputs. 2. His Civil Acclaimed Power. 3. He seems to Tye the Exercise of it to the Consent and Concurrence of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> wherein he dissembles the Nature of their Arrogated Jurisdictional Power: For, if he did mean a Concurrence and Consent, which is Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; Besides, that he in this contradicts himself, in Concentring this Power in the <hi>Prelat,</hi> since <hi>frustra est potentia quae non potest reduci in actum,</hi> he durst not affirm that the Official Power of the <hi>Prelat,</hi> then existent by Law, and whom he pleaded for, was of this Nature: For, according to the Law establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing <hi>Prelacy,</hi> they were to Exercise their Power <hi>with Advice only, and of such of the Clergy only, as they should find</hi> (they themselves being Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) <hi>of known Loyaltie and Prudence.</hi> Again, should the <hi>Surveyer</hi> say this Advice was only <hi>Consultive</hi> not <hi>Decisive,</hi> he did but Mock and Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricat,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58203:145"/>
in adding this Limitation of <hi>Presbyters Consent and Concurrence,</hi> and in pretending thus to put some Limitations on the <hi>Prelats</hi> sole Exercise of his Power, as if it did not swallow up and exclude the Official Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> in Government. In a Word, as it is certain that the Diversifying of the <hi>Subject,</hi> diversifieth the <hi>Species and Kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is evident in that of Monarchy, Democracy, Aristocracy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in the point of Church Government, depending upon Divine and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Institution, It is easie to discover such a vast Variation upon this Ground, as might have covered this <hi>Surveyer</hi> with Blushes, and which baffles his Notion with his own Similitude of the <hi>manus aperta &amp; clausa.</hi> For he will not deny the Lawfulness of an OEcomenick or General <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> in a Just Representative of all Christian Churches, having an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity diffused in all the Members, which respects the whole Churches. Now, here is the <hi>manus aperta,</hi> and in his Sense the <hi>manus clausa,</hi> or the Monopolizing and Concentring this Authority in one person, doth no whit impeach the Lawfulness of the Power it self. Then advance the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus clausa,</hi> an OEcumenick <hi>Bishop,</hi> or Supreme Head over all the Church, having all this Authority Monopolized in him, which was before diffused in the <hi>General Council.</hi> And here it may be demanded, whether this Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or such as he, did owne such an Officer as Lawful or not? If such an Officer be owned as Lawful, then farewel the <hi>Protestant</hi> Profession, and the Doctrine of all Reformed Churches against a Papal Supremacy &amp; U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal OEcumenick <hi>Bishop</hi>: If such an Officer be held unlawful, then this Notion and Argument is quit baffled and excluded, which asserted the Lawfulness both of the Diffused and Contracted Official Power: For, here the one Power is owned as warranded of GOD, and instituted in its Nature and Exercise; The other is disowned, as contrary to His Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. What the <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds upon this Head, touching <hi>a Lawful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manour towards Powers that are usurped, and entertaining fellowship with a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Church, though called by an usurping</hi> Bishop, hath been sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by the <hi>Apologist</hi> and Others, and the Difference so clearly stated betwixt the Condition of a Church, wherein <hi>Prelats</hi> are obtruded upon the standing Church Judicatories (in which Case Ministers are to keep their places, and contend against them) and such a State and Condition of a Church, wherein the Government is razed, and the Foundation of it laid upon a Princes arrogated <hi>Supremacy</hi> over the same, and <hi>Prelats</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as his Administrators in the Government thereof, and withall in the Concurrence a formal and direct acknowledgment of both the one and the other being required, as the Condition of Ministerial Communion, that nothing needs here be further added.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Next</hi> Ground the <hi>Surveyer</hi> adduceth is, <hi>That Ministers Union and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58203:146"/>
of themselves, and setting over them one single Person to Moderat and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Actions of the Meeting, is</hi> Juris Divini, <hi>and that by our own Confession. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> durst not make his Application here; or had he done so, the absurdity of the Consequence from this <hi>Moderator</hi> or <hi>President</hi> to the <hi>Prelat</hi> he pleaded for, would have palpably appeared, and his Inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency with himself: For 1. He saith that <hi>Associat Ministers set over themselves this Moderator,</hi> and this he holds to be <hi>Iuris Divini,</hi> and GODs Will; And if so, then sure it is neither <hi>Iuris Divini,</hi> nor GODs Will, that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator <hi>should be obtruded upon them by an Extraneous Power</hi>; without the least shadow of their Consent, as he could not but know the <hi>Prelats</hi> he pleaded for, were obtruded upon this Church. 2. If it be GODs Will that this <hi>President</hi> be set over Meetings of Ministers, <hi>to govern the Actions of the Meeting</hi>; and preserve <hi>Due Order,</hi> then it is not His Will that this <hi>Moderator</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> should have their whole Authority <hi>Concentred in him,</hi> as this <hi>Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> pleads, and so as to smallow up their whole decisive Suffrage, and render them mere Cyphers: This he cannot but acknowledge to exceed far the <hi>mere governing the Actions of the Meeting,</hi> and preserving of Order; Which is the proper Work of a Moderator. I might add that the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it is GODs Will, that Ministers set over their Associat Meetings one single person to Moderat, will not so much as infer, that he should mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat <hi>ad vitam</hi>: Since. 1. This will bring under the burden of whatever abuse of his Power he may be guilty of, and exclude all Help and Redress. 2. This will deny the Judicatory or Meeting, the Advantage and Use of these governing Gifts and Graces, that may be supposed in other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: And sure the <hi>Surveyer</hi> could not but acknowledge this contrary to the Divine Law, since the Gifts and Graces of every Minister are given by GOD for the Advantage of His Church, and to be improven accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. <hi>The Ministration of the Spirit</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is given to every one to profit withal</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> A Metaphor taken (as some do judge) from Bees bringing all to the common Hive. Thus we see, that unless the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi> degrade the <hi>Bishops</hi> to mere <hi>Moderators,</hi> this Reason is utterly remote from, and absolutely short of reaching any other Conclusion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Ground is, <hi>That it is</hi> Juris Divini, <hi>by way of Approbation, that the Churches in their Ministerial Combinations for Government, should have one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, who hath a singular Power for prevention of Schism and Disorder, and such a Power as what is Right or Wrong in the Church; may be imputed to him, as is manifest from the Epistles directed to the Angels of the Churches,</hi> Rev. 2.3. <hi>whom</hi> Beza, Cartwright, Reynolds, &amp;c. <hi>hold to be single persons: Ans.</hi> It is not clearly discernible what strength is in this Reason beyond the former, since it still runs upon the <hi>Ius Divinum, and necessity of a President in Church Meetings, in order to this</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as its native and great End, <hi>viz</hi>: the <hi>Prevention</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58203:146"/>
of <hi>Schism and Disorder</hi>: And if this be the Rule and Measure of such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> had been hard put to it, to prove that this doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly infer and require that it be such as swallows up the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive Power and Authority of Pastors in Government; And that Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Schism cannot be otherwise prevented by a <hi>President,</hi> than thus Authorized, and that reserving to Pastors their decisive Authority and Power cannot as well reach this End. 2. For what the <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, <hi>That the Power of the President must be such, as what is Right or amiss, may be imputed to him, as using his Power Well or Badly</hi>: As it may have a terrible Sound in the Ears of the Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> who hath an Authority and Power extended not only to all the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> but the whole Body of the People therein, as this <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi> owns, P. 194. Since he hath thus a Work and Office of such a Nature, as is impossible to be managed: Besides, that the Charge of all the evils within the Diocess, lyeth necessarly upon him; So likewise, it is more than this <hi>Surveyer</hi> could prove that what was well or amiss in the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, is chiefly imputed to one Person. For, 1. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to say, that some Authors, though acknowledged Godly and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do hold them to be single persons, but the Grounds <hi>hinc inde</hi> of those who hold them to be such, and of those who understand the Word [<hi>Angel</hi>] in a Collective Sense, must be weighed in the Ballances of the Sanctuary. 2. <hi>Beza</hi>'s Judgment is, that the <hi>Proestos</hi> or President is first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised, that by him all the rest of the Colledge, and also the whole Church might have notice made to them of that which concerned them all; And further, that not so much as the Office of a <hi>Perpetual President</hi> can be hence inferred, as that which he holds to be the Foundation of the <hi>Tyranical Oligarchy, whose Head is the Antichristian Beast.</hi> 3. Granting a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency for prevention of Schism and disorder, over these Churches, the Question still is to be discussed, <hi>what Presidency it was</hi>? And that it could not be of the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Supposed <hi>Episcopal</hi> mould is evident, and by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers made good from several Grounds; As that (1.) It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made good, that any directions in these Epistles, respecting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diversifie one <hi>Pastor</hi> from another, or suppose his <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over the rest. (2.) That without fastning a contradiction upon the Scripture Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> Office, this cannot be admitted, <hi>Pastors</hi> having the Name and thing of Rulers, Governours and <hi>Bishops</hi> attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, yea, and the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power being found committed to the <hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (the first of the Churches here addressed) in <hi>Pauls</hi> last farewell to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. And none will deny that the whole Churches were settled in an Uniform Mould of Government. That the Collective Sense of the word <hi>Angel</hi> is most sutable to the Scope of these Epistles, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58203:147"/>
paralel Scriptures, is above made good, and needs not be here repeated. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> alledges <hi>P.</hi> 193. <hi>That if single persons had not been intended, they would have been compared by the Spirit of God, not to single Stars but Constellations.</hi> Thus this critical Master of Language will needs Teach the Spirit of God how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press himself. But since he acknowledges that these Churches, tho made up of several Congregations, do upon the Ground of an Unity in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, come under the denomination of <hi>one Candlestick,</hi> why may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Pastors</hi> and Ministers, because of a combination in Government, come under the Denomination of <hi>single Stars</hi>? Besides, that these <hi>Stars</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> are (as is above made good) sometimes addressed plurally, and thus, upon the matter held out as <hi>Constellations.</hi> He adds, <hi>That we may as well extend the seven Candlesticks beyond the Seven Churches, as the</hi> Angel <hi>beyond a single Person.</hi> But the Spirit of GOD calling these <hi>Candlesticks</hi> the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> generally the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches, not the <hi>Seven Angels,</hi> sufficiently discovers the impertinent folly of this Objection: But says the <hi>Surveyer, ibid. by this Collective Sense of the Word Angel, we will take in the Ruling Elders, as Messengers of the Lord of Hosts, or else assert that these Churches had none. Ans.</hi> The Divine warrand of the Ruling Elder, is made good upon clear Scripture grounds, and if he have a share and Interest in Church Government, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> could give no reason, why he might not in so far, come under this Denomination, as a Church Officer, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that our Lord addresseth in these Epistles, both Church Officers and Members. For what he adds of <hi>Blondels</hi> Sense of the Authority of these <hi>Angels, P.</hi> 6. of his Preface<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is evident to any that reads it,
<q>That he ascribs the Power of <hi>Presidents</hi> only unto them, and holds that the <hi>Proesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> or <hi>Presidents</hi> acknowledged alwise the Power of the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to be above their own, and were subject to the Injunctions of the Meetings, as well as any other Member.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Ground, which the Surveyer layeth down, <hi>P.</hi> 194. is this, <hi>That as there are ordinances merely Divine, so also mixed Ordinances, which have a Divine ground, and with all adjoyned thereunto a positive human Institution, such as</hi> Calvin <hi>holds geniculation in prayer to be: The Episcopal Power being in it self Lawful, the Subjecting of it in one person, in a certain Circuit, is most suitable for preserving Unity, supposing the Person to be of greater worth, and consequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the light of Nature, and in so far by the word of GOD, and further warranded by a Lawful Church Constitution. Ans.</hi> This ground easily appears foolish and unsound, when we consider that not only the <hi>Power it self,</hi> is of Gods appointment and institution, but likewise <hi>the Subject thereof, and and Officers Cloathed with the Power,</hi> so that whatever Authority the Church may be supposed to have for regulating <hi>the Exercise,</hi> according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules of the word, and of Christian prudence; yet no Church under Heaven hath Authority to lift up the March-stones, which God hath set,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58203:147"/>
and impeach his Institutions in Point of Government: Which Guilt, is certainly Contracted either, 1. In setting up a <hi>New Officer,</hi> Cloathed with such Authority as he hath not allowed; such as we have made appear the <hi>Prelat</hi> to be, both in Respect of his acclaimed Civil and Ecclesiastick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 2. In Robbing the <hi>Pastor</hi> of that Authority, allowed by the great Masters Appointment and Institution, which, as we have made appear, doth in its Essence respect an Interest, both in the Power of Order and Jurisdiction. As for <hi>Calvin,</hi> he is found in that place, to speak nothing of the Nature of this Geniculation. or what may give light touching the Nature of those mixed Ordinances. Besides, that the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Reason here adduced, from the Light of Nature, appears to Confound the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and without Respect to the Gospel Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to found a Claim thereunto, merely upon the greater Worth and Ability: A Principle which will also brangle the Civil Government. And in a word, this Principle of Monopolizing the Power in one Person, in a certain Circuit, for this end of Preserving Unity, will tower up this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Government in one person over the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> till the Hierarchy resolve in a <hi>Papacy</hi> at last.</p>
               <p>Proceed we to the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Fifth Ground, <hi>ibid.</hi> resolving in a Partition of Three or Four Particulars, to infer a <hi>direct positive Institution,</hi> for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of one Church Officer, of a certain Circuit, over others. Whereof the <hi>First</hi> is, <hi>That Iesus Christ from his Received plenitude of Church Power from his Father, to be made use of, till the Elect be gathered in, sent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, with plenitude of Power for all Church Offices, necessary for Edifying and Preserving the same, as Power to Preach, administer Sacraments, preserve the Church in order by Godly Disciplin; for which he Cites Joh.</hi> 20.21. As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath sent me, even so send I you, <hi>&amp;c. Ans.</hi> As it is acknowledged, that the Apostles were sent forth for the Great end of laying the Foundation of the Gospel Churches, and Establishing the Ordinances and Offices thereof; so that whatever Officers they are found to have Instituted and Authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Churches preservation, and Purity of Order, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all due Reverence; so it is evident, that their Office was in this Respect, Extraordinary, and that they were Distinguished from all other Officers by their immediat Call, their immediat Instructions from Christ, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allibility in Doctrin, a greater Amplitude of Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence we have made appear, there was no Shadow of a <hi>Prelatical Power</hi> in their Office, &amp; the exercise thereof, since none of the Apostles were set over any fixed Diocess, but had an immediat Relation to the whole Church, they exercised their Ministry sometimes joyntly and promiscuously in the same place, they Ordained no Inferior Officers alone, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58203:148"/>
of other Officers, where they might be had, nor Challenged, as <hi>Prelats,</hi> a sole Power of Jurisdiction over the Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Subservient ground, which the Surveyer, <hi>P.</hi> 195, adduces, is, <hi>That the Apostles had Successors to themselves in that plenitude of Ordinary Church Power, for that Power was not to Cease till the end of the World, according to the Promise, Matth.</hi> 28.20. I am with you alway, to the end of the World, <hi>meaning with them and their Successors. Ans.</hi> That the Apostles had Successors, that derived down an Ordinary Church Power, in reference to the Preaching of the Word, the Administration of the Sacraments, and such a Governing Power, and the exercise thereof, as is necessary for the Churches Edification and Preservation in all times, is easily admitted: And this ordinary Church Power, we maintain with the Body of all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Divines, to be derived down by the <hi>Pastor,</hi> the proper Successor of the Apostles in this Work, as hath been above cleared. And this is most Properly that plenitude of Power, which was to continue to the end. For this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> in this Discriminating term of <hi>Ordinary Church Power,</hi> seems, to exclude any Succession of Church Officers to the Apostles, <hi>in eundem gradum,</hi> and properly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us in the <hi>Third</hi> place, <hi>That there are three probable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to this Succession of Apostles,</hi> Viz: <hi>Single Presbyters in the Modern Notion; Colledges of Presbyters in a full Equality of Power; Or some single Persons having Superiority of Power over ordinary Presbyters. The Pretensions of the People, or of any other to the Church Government,</hi> He tells us, <hi>he doth pass as Irrational</hi>: And so do we. Only I must here say, That as what a single <hi>Presbyter</hi> may do in extraordinary Cases, in Point of Jurisdiction, is not here the Question; And that therefore his three Pretenders may be Justly reduced to two: So in his confident Rejection of <hi>all other Pretenders as Irrational,</hi> he should have been aware of touching the Kings Crown, and more consistently defended his <hi>Erastian Supremacy</hi> in Church Government; Since in the last Edition of our <hi>Scots Hierarchy,</hi> he was Owned and Established, as the chief Officer and Head of this Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> will have this <hi>Question of the Matter of Fact, upon which the</hi> Jus <hi>depends, to be determined by Historical Narrations of the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apostles, and the first and surest Light, Church History can afford in the Churches purest Times.</hi> I have made appear that this Question of a <hi>Divine Fact,</hi> must be decided by the <hi>Scripture Light</hi> allenarly, and by Consequence, not from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles Solely, excluding what further Light in this Matter is to be had from their Instructions, in Point of Church Government, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Epistles, and likewayes from other places of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So, that whatever Practice of the Church, the History, even of Purest Times, presents unto us, must be brought to this Touch-stone and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58203:148"/>
Standard of the Scripture Institution, as being thereby Regulable: And therefore, can make up no part of this Rule. In determining this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> in the first place, <hi>Will not have the Fulness of Ordinary Church Power, committed by the Apostles to any single Presbyter, as if he had Actual Power of Ordination, or Iurisdiction</hi>: That the Power of Order, the Administration of the Word and Sacraments is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Pastor,</hi> is of it self Evident; That the Power of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is committed to him, as he is by Office a Member of the Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is the proper adequat Subject of this Authority of Ordination and Jurisdiction, is equally evident. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> challengeth us to shew <hi>such Colledges of single Presbyters, as had that Plentitude of Church Power commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by the Apostles, and exercised the same, especially taking in Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Ans.</hi> If by <hi>Plentitude of Church Power,</hi> be understood the ordinary Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, necessary for the Churches Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Preservation in all times, and as abstracted and distinguished from the extensive Power of Apostles &amp; Evangelists; We say it is found seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> both in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, and else where in the New Testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Apostles instituted <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Church by Church, and sure not to preach only and administrat Sacraments, but to Rule, seeing they have the Name and Thing of Governors, Rulers, Overseers, Bishops, ascribed to them; And if they were to Rule, sure in Collegiat Meetings. We find the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this Power commanded and commended to <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi>; Thus by the Apostle to the Elders or Pastors of <hi>Ephesus, Act.</hi> 20. By the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. to the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Churches, to which he wrote. We find this Jurisdictional Power accordingly exercised by them, both as to Ordination and the highest Censures, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And the Circumstances of these and such like Texts do cleary evince, that this Jurisdictional Power was to continue, thus exercised by these <hi>Societies</hi> or <hi>Colledges</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> when the Apostles were gone off the Stage, and that consequently they are the Proper Subject of the Power, immediatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them. As for the <hi>Ruling Elder,</hi> his Institution and Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in Scripture, he is upon Divine Warrand, supposed a Member of these Judicatories, when the Churches are fully constituted in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick being. But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>We cannot make appear, that in these Meetings of Presbyters, there was an Equality of Power, since Superior Officers were with them Ruling and Ordering their Church Actings. Ans.</hi> Though <hi>de facto</hi> it were found, that in these Meetings, Superior Officers were present, yet if they be found Officers of an Extraordinary Authority, and whose Power was Cumulative unto, not Privative of the ordinary Power and Authority of these Meetings; This is utterly remote from speaking any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58203:149"/>
thing to his Purpose and Conclusion. 2. Whereas the <hi>Surveyer</hi> peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torly poseth us, <hi>Where such a Meeting of Presbyters is found in the</hi> Acts <hi>of the Apostles</hi> (he should have added, or else where in the New Testament) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Superior Officers ordering their Meeting</hi>? We peremptorly Pose him, what Superior Officer is found set over the <hi>Colledge</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> gave them his last Charge, touching the Exercise of a <hi>Ioynt Episcopal Power</hi> over that Church? What Superior Officer is found set over the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi>? Or over these <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.? or these Ruling Teachers mentioned 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17? Sure, these Governing Teachers mett for Government, and these Meetings if found thus Constituted, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising an <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> we have therein Convincing Instances of an <hi>Episcopal Power</hi> in a <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> without the Inspection of any Superior Ordinary Officers: For, as for <hi>Apostolical Directions</hi> hereanent, they could no more impeach this Authority, than Directions with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Power of Order could impeach the same.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> P. 196. brings for his third Ground, <hi>The Apostles committing the Plentitude of Ordinary Church Power to single Persons, in a Superiority over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers; Instancing the</hi> Asiatick <hi>Angels,</hi> Rev. 2.3. <hi>And</hi> Pauls <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>whom he sent and instructed with a Iudiciary Power, into</hi> Ephesus <hi>and</hi> Crete, <hi>and to ordain Ministers, which had been to no purpose, had this Power been competent to Pastors. Ans.</hi> This Trite Argument hath been above at large spoken to; Therefore, we shall but briefly touch it in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For the <hi>Asiatick Angels</hi>; We have made appear, First, That the Collective Sense of the word <hi>Angel,</hi> stands upon the most probable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and is owned by the greatest part of sound Interpreters, as being most suteable to the Style of Prophetick Writings, representing many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by a singular Typical Term, whereof frequent Instances are exhibit; to the Style of this very Book, in representing many Persons, or a <hi>Series</hi> of Men, by one Symbolical Term, such as <hi>Whore, VVoman, Beast,</hi> &amp;c. Besides, that the <hi>Angel</hi> is found plurally addressed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.24. Next, That admitting the <hi>Angel</hi> to be a single Person, will only plead that he is the <hi>Angelus praeses,</hi> or <hi>Moderator,</hi> yea, and so <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and addressed as the Parliament is in the Person of the <hi>Speaker</hi>; That no Address is made to him with respect to any Jurisdiction over <hi>Pastors,</hi> nor can any Reason be given wherefore the Commendations and Reprehensions respecting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Dutys, must be fixed in an Exclusive Sense upon one Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> For the Directions to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>; It is above made appear, that their Office was Extraordinary, and passed off, like that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, with that <hi>First</hi> Infant State and Exigence of the Church, since it is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58203:149"/>
made Good they were <hi>Evangelists,</hi> in a proper formal Sense. 2. That u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Ground, they could have no Successors in their <hi>Formal Office and Inspection,</hi> which imported a Relation to no particular Church, nor can consequently represent the Authority of any ordinary Officer, with such a fixed Relation of this Nature and Extent. It is likewayes made appear, that the <hi>Episcopal Pleaders</hi> from these Directions, must either upon this Ground, extend their Power equally with that of Apostles, or make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that these Directions of this Nature, and importing this Authority, were applicable to them no where else, and in reference to no other Churches, where they are found to exercise their Office; Either of which are inevitable Absurdities. Finally, It is made appear, that this Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was of a <hi>Transient Nature,</hi> did suppose the Existence and Exercise of the Apostolick Office, was Cumulative unto, not Privative of the <hi>Official Authority of Pastors,</hi> and therefore cannot prove a sole and single Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>Prelat</hi> over Church Judicatories.</p>
               <p>But sayes the <hi>Surveyer, What need was there to send them for this End to these Churches, if a Iurisdictional Power was competent to Pastors</hi>? This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is above fully removed. And here again we repone, 1. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant State of the Church requiring a Temporary Super-intendency of an Evangelist, and Directions from an infallible Apostle. 2. <hi>Episcopalians</hi> must confess, that in many Points, wherein <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly addressed, ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> have a necessary and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Interest,</hi> and that therefore they must acknowledge this to be one end of these addressed Instructions, that <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> may have a clear <hi>Vidimus</hi> of their Ministerial Office and Duties; And that by consequence the addressing of these Directions to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> will not exclude <hi>Pastors</hi> from the Jurisdictional Power; And no more make this peculiar to these persons, than the Injunctions respecting the Reading, Preaching of the Word, Convincing the Gain sayers, and Rebuking the Scandalous, solely applicable to a <hi>Prelat,</hi> as his incommunicable Prerogatives.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> here Cants over again the Old Song, <hi>That its the greatest possible evidence, that can be in such a Matter of Fact, that immediatly after all the Apostles Death, until the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>the Church had no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that of Bishops. Ans.</hi> This Assertion, especially as respecting the Patriarchal <hi>Bishop</hi> of the late Edition, <hi>viz</hi>: with sole Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, tyed to Preach to no flock, and deriving all his Power from the Civil Magistrate, is so grosly absurd, so palpably false, that the very Repetition is a Confutation; the contrary having been demonstrated by several Learned Pens. The best <hi>Antiquaries</hi> confess these first times dark, as to Matters of Fact. But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> quite mistakes this Question, which is not anent a mere Matter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58203:150"/>
of <hi>Fact,</hi> or the Churches Practice simplely Considered, but anent <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Instructions and Institutions, in point of Church Government, viz</hi>: what Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers the Apostles set up and Instituted, in what order, and Cloathed with what Authority, how qualified for their Office, and instructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, how they are found to have exercised this Power, when thus Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and set up. If this be clear in the Scripture Records, then no defects or aberrations therefrom, either in, or after the Apostles times, can direct or warrand our Imitation, nor can be an Infallible proof of the Rule, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we will extend this to Regulat us as to every Scripture Truth and Duty therein held out. Both Scripture and Church History, do give us an account of the early aberrations from the Divine Rule, both in Point of Doctrin, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Government, such as those anent the Resurrection, Justification by good Works, Worshipping of Angels, the Error of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi>; and in Point of Government, the Mysterie of Iniquity, the <hi>Embryon</hi> of a <hi>Papal</hi> Primacy, was working in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and early appeared in <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aspiring after a <hi>Primacy</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not to stand upon the <hi>Millenary</hi> Error, the Error anent the Vision of GOD, and others, early appearing thereafter. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> will needs strengthen his Notion by the Maxim, <hi>Lex currit cum praxi, &amp; consuetudo est optimus interpres Legis</hi>: What interpretation and Sense this is capable of, in reference to Human Laws, or of what use, is left to the Consideration of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Long Robe</hi>; But sure with respect to the Divine Law, 'tis dangerous and sadly lax. Divinity, &amp; <hi>Israels Consuetudo</hi> and early practice of Idolatrie, and the Worshipping of Images, as that of the Golden Calf, with a pretended design to Worship the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> was a shrewd and gross interpretation of the Second Command. The People who told <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eremiah,</hi> that <hi>they would pour out Drink Offerings to the Queen of Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Progenitors in a long tract of time had done so, were much in this <hi>Surveyers</hi> Mind. But the great Lawgiver, who enjoyned his People not to walk after their Fathers Commandments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Judgments, though of never so Large an extent and long Continuance, but after his Laws and Judgments, is of another Mind. <hi>Tertullians</hi> Rule and Prayer is good, speaking of Custom in it self considered and simplely, <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge veritas ipsa. Scripturas tuas interpretare quas consuetudo non novit nam si nosset non esset</hi>: Did Custom know Scripture, it would be ashamed of it self, and cease to be any more: Upon which ground he pleads, that the Eternal Light himself might arise and expone his own Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>That in these preceeding grounds, he hath pleaded only for the Lawfulness of Prelacy, though the necessity is not denied.</hi> But sure, if these grounds evince any thing, they prove a Necessity, as well as Lawfulness: If the Apostles Directions and Practice in the Institution of Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, pursuant to their great Masters Commission, together with his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58203:150"/>
of the Apostolical and Christian Churches Universal Reception and Practice, will not evince and prove this, I know nothing will: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that we heard him plead upon the Ground of a <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> which will bear this Conclusion of Necessity, not of Lawfulness only. But in this proof of the Lawfulness of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quiet the Minds of People, anent the Covenant obligation against it.</hi> A good Pillow of security, no doubt this had been, had he proved, that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally and absolutely no Oath can oblige against a thing in it self Lawful or retrench our Liberty thereanent, and answered the Arguments urged by <hi>Casuists</hi> on the contrary. But it is not our purpose to digress on this head. He adds, <hi>That if Lawful, it is</hi> Juris Divini, <hi>that we submit to a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Human Ordinance and Command, for the Lords sake:</hi> Which Reason were valid, had he made good that the <hi>Human Ordinance,</hi> in this Circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Case, had for its object a <hi>thing Lawful</hi>; And that the Human ordinance is the <hi>First Rule</hi> and adequat ground of our Judging the expediency of a Practice <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> though in it self Lawful: And further, that the <hi>Human Ordinance</hi> can of its own Nature loose solemn Oaths and Vows u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lawgivers themselves, and the Subjects, against such a practice as is commanded.</p>

                  <hi>The First Scriptures</hi> (he tells us, <hi>P.</hi> 197.) <hi>that are made use of, for proving the Parity of Ministers in the Government of the Church, and disproving Imparity</hi> or <hi>Superiority of any over others, are</hi> Mark. 10.42. Matth. 20, 25, 26. Luke. 22.25. <hi>Where, because our Lord is speaking of the Kings and Great Ones of the Earth, their Exercising Dominion and Authority over their Subjects, forbids his Disciples to do so,</hi> it shall not be so among you; <hi>therefore, it is concluded, that there should be no Superiority or Governing Power of Ministers of the Church above Ministers, but all should be equal. Ans.</hi> These Texts have been above consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and improven: It is evident, that our Lord Commanded Parity of Official power among his Apostles, his First Ministers, and by clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, the same equality among <hi>Pastors,</hi> who are equal, and of the same Order as Apostles were, and their proper Successors in the ordinary power of Government. That the <hi>Prelats</hi> acclaimed Power in Civils, and Dominion over Church Judicatories, brings him within the Compass of the prohibition in these Texts, is above made good. The <hi>Surveyer,</hi> in his way of expressing our Argument, seems to oppose to this <hi>Official equality of Pastors,</hi> the Superior power and Authority of greater to the lesser Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, which is the necessary Ligament of all Government, and of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> consequently. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in his First <hi>Answer,</hi> will needs question, <hi>That there is at all</hi> a Prohibion <hi>in these Texts given to Christs Apostles, but only a mere prediction of what was to be their Lot in the VVorld,</hi> Viz. <hi>That they were not to have a Stately, Glorious, Pompeous, worldly Superiority over others; Christ assuring them they were to be dispised of the World; It was as Incongruous to prohibit them to Reign as Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, as to Charge a Man not to act the King, who is assured that all his days he is to be a Beggar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ans.</hi> This pitiful Shift and Gloss, out of the Road of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, discovers what a desperate falling Cause the <hi>Surveyer</hi> was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, which needed the support of such a Conceit as this: To which we oppose. 1. The Circumstances and Scope of the place, clearly refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this irrational Subterfuge. It is evident, our Lord was here curing the Disciples Emulation and sinful Debate about <hi>Superiority and Chiefness in his Church and Kingdom,</hi> and directing them, both negatively and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the exercise of their Spiritual power, as his Ministers, and this in order to the preventing of mistakes in Judgment, and contravention of their Practice, in Reference to the Nature and Exercise of Church Government: In order to which Scope, the pointing at the events of Providence, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their external Condition, had been utterly extraneous and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. And as in this Gloss, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> doth Violence to the prohibiting part of the Text, so most palpably to the positive Injunction, <hi>He that will be great or Chief,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>let him be as the Youngest,</hi> recommending to them a Humble Ministry, in Opposition to Pompous greatness. 2. The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58203:151"/>
                  <hi>Surveyers</hi> Reason is palpably absurd and impertinent, for notwithstanding of our Lords warning them of their despised State in the World, yet he also Instructed them in the Nature and Exercise of his Kingdom, did shew he was to have a Church, which is his Kingdom, <hi>against which the Gates of Hell should not prevail</hi>; In which Kingdom, they being Officers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, it was necessary they should understand its nature, in order to a due exercise thereof, and as necessary it was, their Successors should have the same knowledge. The Offices in the House of GOD are truely Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to be counted worthy of Honour and Highly Esteemed by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, was it not then necessary, that the Nature of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual greatness and Honour, in opposition to worldly Pomp, should be thus pointed out? The <hi>Surveyer</hi> holds there was a Prophetick Intimation, that Apostles and their Successors, should not have <hi>a Glorious, Pompous, Worldly Superiority,</hi> and thus excludes from an Apostolick Succession, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,</hi> who are Princes of the Empire, and Peers of the Land, and must set them in Terms of Contradiction to this his supposed Prophecy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Granting there is here a Prohibition, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is prohibited, and to whom. For the <hi>First,</hi> He tells us, <hi>It is</hi> that Sort of Dominion <hi>exercised among Kings of the Gentiles, according to the Notion the Apostles had of Christs Kingdom, Act.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.34. <hi>So that our Lord discharged Earthly Pomp, Coactive Power of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdoms, not all Superiority of one of his Ministers above others,</hi> non Rem sed Modum Rei. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is above Examined and Confuted. We have made appear, that <hi>all Masterly Power and Dominion</hi> is here forbidden, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with that Humble Ministry, and Ministerial Service, enjoyned in the positive part of this Precept, which doth not Discriminat one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion from another, as if one sort were allowed, and another forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or, as if Government, which is in the Nature of <hi>Lordship and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> were Diversified and Distinguished in respect of its manner of Exercise, good or bad, but all Masterly Power, though in its self lawful, is here, both as to matter and manner forbidden to Christs Ministers, in the Exercise of their Authority. This Man acknowledges <hi>Earthly Pomp</hi> to be forbidden and <hi>Worldly Grandure,</hi> and what could his thoughts be of <hi>Prelats</hi> being a third Estate of Parliament, bearing State Offices of the Highest Sort? He says our Lord discharged not <hi>Rem</hi> but <hi>Modum Rei</hi>: If by this <hi>Modus Rei</hi> he understand <hi>a Civil Dominion,</hi> he hath cut off the <hi>Prelats Civil Rule,</hi> and in so far acknowledges their Transgressing this Precept: If he restrict the Sense to a <hi>Dominion,</hi> which he may call <hi>Spiritual,</hi> he leaves still a Latitude for the highest Extension thereof, even to a <hi>Papal</hi> Primacy. He tells us, <hi>that a Chiefness is rather supposed than forbidden,</hi> as he labours to prove (<hi>P.</hi> 201.) from <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.26. And thus neither the Disciples Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58203:152"/>
nor Emulation about a <hi>Primacy,</hi> nor the <hi>Papal</hi> Pretensions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are ever touched by this Prohibition, according to his Gloss: And in this, as he crosses our Lords Scope, so he contradicts himself, since (<hi>P.</hi> 199.) he asserts with <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the Apostles were <hi>Pari honoris &amp; potestatis consortio praediti,</hi> had equal Power and Authority. This Answer of the <hi>Surveyer,</hi> wherein he embraces the <hi>Popish</hi> Distinction and Evasion upon this Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Lord discharged that Sort of Dominion only, exercised among the Kings of the Gentiles, and as he expresses it <hi>non Rem sed Modum Rei,</hi> brings to Mind a remarkable Passage of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Turretin, Institut. Theol. Elenct. Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Loc.</hi> 18. <hi>Quest.</hi> 16. <hi>de Regimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Ecclesiae, P. mihi</hi> 164, 165. Having Cited this Passage, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.25, 26. against the <hi>Papal</hi> Monarchy, together with the paralell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. And from both, having inferred that Dominion in the Church is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and a Ministerial Service enjoyned: He brings this <hi>Popish</hi> Argument and Exception,
<q>
                     <hi>Nec dici potest apud</hi> Lucam <hi>Monarchiam &amp; Dominationem absolute non interdici, sed tantum ejus modum, qui non sit simulis Dominationi Politicae seu Tyrannidi Regum Gentium</hi>; That is, It cannot be said in the place of <hi>Luke,</hi> that Monarchy and Dominion is not absolutely forbidden, but only the manner thereof, or such as is like to that Tyrannical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Earthly Kings.</q>
The Reasons of his rejecting this Gloss, he subjoyns,
<q>
                     <hi>Quia Apostoli non contendebant inter se de modo Primatus sed de Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ipso, &amp;c.</hi> That the Apostles were not contending about the manner of a <hi>Primacy,</hi> but the <hi>Primacy</hi> it self, and therefore, that our Lords Answer may be apposit to their Question, it must needs absolutely forbid all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. 2. If our Lord had intended to forbid only some special kind of Dominion <hi>certum Dominationis modum,</hi> he had not removed their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which he is here endeavouring signally to remove, since other Primacies also do Feed Ambition. 3. <hi>Saith he,</hi> this Phrase [<hi>Not so,</hi> viz. <hi>shall it be among you</hi>] according to the Use of the Scripture, doth import a simple and absolute Negation, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.4.147.20.

in the third place, that there was no need, that our Lord should speak of a Dominion of this Nature, because the Apostles Debate was not about a violent Domination. He adds further, <hi>Nec valet quod subjicitur, &amp;c.</hi> It is of no weight which the <hi>Popish</hi> Adversary pleads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Discharge of all <hi>Primacy,</hi> because our Lord subjoyns, <hi>He that is greatest among you,</hi> since our Lord speaks not of a true Greatness, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the thing it self, but of an Imaginary, in respect of Affectation and Desire: Which <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> do expone and clear by these Words, <hi>Whosoever will be great amongst you.</hi>
                  </q>
In the rest of his Reasons, he hath several things to this purpose, as if he had been expresly Disputing against this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> as indeed upon the Matter he doth, and Listeth him among the <hi>Popish</hi> Adversaries in this Point.</p>
               <p>For that Point of the <hi>Persons spoken to,</hi> the <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>The Apostles were sometimes spoken to, as representing all Christians,</hi> Mark. 13.37. <hi>In which Sense, this Prohibition was not given to them, which would strike at the Authority allowed among Christians: Sometimes what is spoken to them concerns themselves alone in their Apostolick Capacity, as</hi> Matth. 19.28. <hi>In which Sense, we cannot understand this Prohibition, since it would exclude all Ministers afterward: Some things likewise were spoken to them, as representing only Ministers, as when Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of remitting and retaining Sins is given them,</hi> Joh. 20. <hi>In which Sense, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply this unto them, since this will impeach the Superior Authority of any of them above others, and their Authority over Inferior Ministers, evidenced in</hi> Pauls <hi>Excommunicating</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>making Decrees for the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>&amp;c. Ans.</hi> Whatever may be said to this Partition in it self, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Enumeration is not so adequat as not to admit of a Super-nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary: Some things might be spoken to Apostles, which did most nearly concern them as Apostles, as being immediatly directed to them, and yet may have an useful reference, in a Subaltern and Subordinat Sense, to all the Ministers of Christ. As when our LORD said to His Apostles, <hi>Ye are the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth</hi>: This in some respect had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Application to them <hi>as Apostles,</hi> and our LORDs Infallibly Inspired Ambassadors, authorized to lay the Foundation of the Gospel Church, prescribe her Ordinances and institute her Officers, and several of them appointed to be the Holy Ghosts Pen-Men in writing the Scriptures, in which respect the Church is said to be <hi>Built upon their Foundation.</hi> But though no Ministers else could acclaim to be in this respect <hi>the Light of the World, and Salt of the Earth,</hi> or challenge a Right to the peculiar Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Apostles included therein, it is notwithstanding certain, that there is a Subordinat Application hereof unto ordinary Ministers, that they are in their Capacity and Sphere <hi>the Light of the World, and the Salt of the Earth,</hi> and have the Honour and Duties of their Ministerial Office therein
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58203:153"/>
enjoyned and included, as well as the Apostles had theirs. 2. Since he grants the Apostles were <hi>pari honoris &amp; potestatis consortio praediti,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that our LORD bespoke them upon that Ground of an equal Official Power, and as in that Capacity, it follows that he bespoke <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> whom he appointed to be in the same order of an equal Official Power, and to succeed to the Apostles in their ordinary Authority. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> can give no Reason wherefore our LORD discharged the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this instituted Equal Power of Apostles, by an <hi>Unlawful Dominion,</hi> and not to have given the same Prohibition to <hi>Pastors</hi>: Why a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Chief</hi> or <hi>Primat</hi> is discharged among Apostles, and not also among Pastors. The Surveyers <hi>Contrary Instances</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>of the Apostolick Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ministers in the Church,</hi> are palpably Impertinent, and do miss the Mark. For 1. Their Authority in the first plantation of Churches, can no wayes conclude what is the ordinary Authority of <hi>Pastors,</hi> in the Churches ordinary and settled Government. 2. Our Argument runs thus, That the Apostles being placed in an equal Sphere of a Ministry, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual among themselves <hi>as Apostles,</hi> formally, and equal among themselves as <hi>Gospel Ministers</hi> upon this Ground: But that therefore, they could have no Authority Apostolical, as Apostles, over Inferior Officers, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow this Supposition, nor will it follow, that because the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were Ministers, and had Authority over other Ministers, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a Lawful Official Authority of one Pastor over another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostles were more than Ministers, <hi>viz.</hi> Apostles, and in that Capacity had that Superiority, but not as Ministers simplely: So that such an Argument would run cross to the common Rules. It is certain, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Authority they put furth in the Churches <hi>in fieri,</hi> and in directing them in the Exercise of their ordinary Power, yet in settled Judicatories they are found acting as <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> and not as <hi>Apostles</hi>; This hath been made Good in <hi>Pauls</hi> assuming the <hi>Presbytrie</hi> in the Ordination of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>; The ordinary <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> concurring with the Apostles in that <hi>Council, Act.</hi> 15. Both in the Disquisition, in the Sentence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the Decree. But sayes the <hi>Surveyer, We must not distinguish where the Law distinguisheth not; If notwithstanding this Prohibition, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles exercised Authority over Ministers, it doth not Discharge such an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Pastors over Pastors. Ans.</hi> The Laws of our LORD delivered in the New Testament, and the Correspondent Recorded Practice thereof, doth State a clear distinction betwixt the <hi>Extraordinary and Ordinary Officers</hi> and Pastors, and that both with respect to the Nature and Extent of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>the Ambition beginning among the Apostles, the cure should have been applyed to them. Ans.</hi> So we affirm it was in our Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting either a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Dominion among themselves, or over Inferior
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58203:153"/>
Officers: But this could not impeach their extraordinary Inspection over the Churches,-which was together with their Office to pass off, and die with themselves, when that Case and exigency of the Church was over.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers Second</hi> Counter-evidence (P. 199.) <hi>is drawn from</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>God hath set in his Church, First Apostles, Secondarily Prophets, Thirdly Teachers; which is an ordinal Numbering, with reference to the Object they were imployed about; as Presbyterians hold upon this ground, the Pastors Office Superior to the Elder. Ans.</hi> Not to stand upon this his ordinal numbering; nor upon an enquiry wherefore the <hi>Evangelist</hi> is excluded by the <hi>Surveyer</hi> in this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ordinal numbering, whom we find Numbred, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. It is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that. 1. This Instance is extravagant from the Point: For, from our Assertion, that the Prohibition of <hi>Unlawful Dominion</hi> over their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, was given to Apostles as representing <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> he draws a Conclusion, that thereupon will follow a Discharge of the <hi>Superior Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of one Pastor over another,</hi> he means an <hi>Official Superiority,</hi> the Contrary whereof, he undertakes to prove by Instances; and here his great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is drawn from the <hi>Apostolical Authority,</hi> which the Apostles exercised over inferior Officers; or the supposed ordinal Numbring of <hi>Extraordinary Officers</hi>: But I pray, what is this to prove the <hi>Official</hi> ordinary Superiority of <hi>Pastors</hi> over <hi>Pastors,</hi> or to evince their Superior Degrees among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were placed in their several Degrees, or had their special Pieces of work in the Churches Infant State, therefore there ought to be the same Degrees of the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office: What Consequence is this? 2. He is inconsistent with himself in this Reasoning: For (1.) He hath already distinguished the Apostles <hi>Official ordinary Power,</hi> in the plenitude whereof, he alledges <hi>Prelats</hi> do succeed them, from another, which he must call <hi>extraordinary,</hi> else his Distinction is chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, and must fly with one Wing. And (2) He alledges some things are spoken to them alone in their <hi>Apostolick Capacity,</hi> which <hi>concerned none else</hi>; and thus distinguishes that capacity from the capacity of <hi>Pastors</hi>: Now when he is about to prove, that the Apostles, <hi>qua Pastors,</hi> or in that Capacity, and under thus reduplication strictly and properly, were above other <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> and consequently that there are different Degrees of the Pastoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; As if he had forgot his Distinction, he draweth his Argument from the Apostolical Acts of Superiority over inferior Officers, and the suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Degrees of Apostles, Prophets and others, in that extraordinary Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wherein he palpably baffles his former suposition and Distinction. That in the Text Cited, together with the Paralel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. there is a Numbering (whether we call it <hi>ordinal</hi> or not) of <hi>Extraordinary Officers,</hi> now past off with these first times of Christianity, is the consentient Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sound Divines, and by Consequence, that no Argument can be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58203:154"/>
drawn from hence, for distinction of Degrees in the <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> (P. 200.) <hi>cannot understand how the Pastor having a Doctrinal Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over other Officers of the Congregation, should in Point of Disciplin, which is but a Personal application of the Word sink below his Assistants in the Session and have his Voice swallowed up by theirs.</hi> But he might much more wonder at his own Principle, who alledges the <hi>Pastor</hi> to have, in dispensing the Word and Sacraments, an Authority and Power of the same Nature, with that of the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> and yet when he comes from the Pulpit, and sitteth in a Judicatory with the <hi>Prelat,</hi> losses all Authoriry in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and according to the last Edition of our Hierarchical <hi>Prelacy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mere Cipher without a Figure, having no Power but to advise the <hi>Prelat,</hi> and scarce that. As for the <hi>Pastors</hi> Authority in the Session, we say that although the higher Honour allowed to the Labourer in Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, above the Officer who Rules only, and who doth not thus Labour, will allow the respect &amp; deference of a constant <hi>Presidency</hi> in the <hi>Parochial</hi> Church Judidicatory, yet Ruling Elders having an Essential interest in Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he cannot have the sole decisive Vote, though there is still ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to appeal to a higher Judicatory, in case of mal-Administration.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers Third</hi> ground is, <hi>That if Governing Superiority be inhibit to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors over others, it is either of one over others, and thus we unjustly distinguish this Monarchical Government of one, while we allow the like Government of many, which in an Aristocratical form, may have as much of State and Command, as of one: If we say, that he Discharged all Superiority of many, or of some Number over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this will, in favour of</hi> Independents, <hi>destroy</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Government, and the Subordination of Iudicatories. Ans.</hi> This is in part already removed, by what we have offered anent the Essential difference, in Point of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, betwixt the Judiciary Power, as Subjected in a Colledge or Society, and the Monopolizing and concentring it in one Person. 1. We have told him, that our Lord hath Established and Instituted both the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of Church Power. 2. Having Instituted <hi>Pastors</hi> of an equal Official Authority, all <hi>Pastors</hi> as Members of the Judicatory, have an Essential interest in the decisive Votes, and an equal decisive suffrage therein upon this Ground; so that there is a Clear exclusion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized Government in one Person, who appears excluded and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by our Lords Instituted Principles and Grounds of Government, since this <hi>Concentring of Government in one,</hi> robs <hi>Pastors</hi> of this their Decisive suffrage, excludes a free and full Conference and Debate, in order to a sutable Determination, by a free suffrage, as is exemplified in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And therefore this Dominion of a <hi>Prelat</hi> over <hi>Pastors</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Pompous Civil Dominion) brings him palpably within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of this Prohibition. 3. That the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Subordination of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, cannot fall within the Compass hereof, nor come under the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58203:154"/>
imputation of State and Dominion, is many ways evident. (1.) This is founded upon the Light and Law of Nature, and the Nature of all Governments. (2.) This is notably consistent with the Jurisdictional exercise of the Pastoral Office, and the ends thereof, both which the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical</hi> Dominion destroys: This Subordination is founded upon our Lords Institution, as is evident, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. where the gradation in Point of Censure and Appeals, is from the Lesser to the greater Number, which the <hi>Prelatical</hi> form inverts and destroys. As for <hi>Commisions</hi> of <hi>Assemblies,</hi> which the <hi>Surveyer</hi> next quibles about: We say, that it is no extrinsick Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, exercising any extrinsick power, but a more Compendious meeting of the whole <hi>Assembly,</hi> with their Conjunct power for the purposes delegat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and limited, both as to the Time and Object of their power, and are accountable to the ensuing <hi>Assembly</hi> for their Administration. What the <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, touching <hi>their power to punish all Ministers who will not obey their Acts, &amp;c.</hi> It is palpably impertinent, for no Censures or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to go beyond the Limits of their Instructions and Commission, nor ever did, or could Assemblies engage to own them any otherwise; so that in whatever point they did Malverse, the <hi>Assembly,</hi> was still as an equal Judge to be Appealed unto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers Fourth</hi> Ground and Instance (P. 201.) is, <hi>That in the Texts under Debate, our Lord supposes some of his Disciples, in Comparison of others, were to be great and chief, in respect of Power and Authority, else the Speech were not to the purpose; And that our Lord directs such as attained to this Chiefty and Greatness, to Demean themselves Humbly and Usefully,</hi> let him be as the Younger, <hi>which is no Direction to Undervalue such, but only prohibits an Affectation of Honour, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat from the worthy Work mentioned,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1. <hi>Ans.</hi> This <hi>Popish</hi> Gloss of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others, we have already at large Confuted, which, as we have above made appear, establisheth and fixeth the <hi>Popes</hi> Mitre, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Levelling against it, as this Text certainly doth. <hi>Protestant</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, more appositely to the Scope and Contexture, have told the <hi>Papists,</hi> that our Lord said not, he who by my Appointment should be Chief, or enjoy a Principality or Supremacy, but he that from the bad Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> would seek this, must in place thereof endeavour and emulat Spiritual Faithful Diligence in the Ministerial Duties, and thus to be Chief in Vertue and Reward. That this <hi>Popish</hi> Gloss of a supposed Lawful <hi>Chiefness</hi> or <hi>Principality</hi> in the Church, so overthrows the Scope, that it makes our Lord rather to have Inflamed than Quenched by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the Ambitious Sute of the two Brethren, and the Disciples Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereupon. That this Gloss will prove the Disciples Concernment in the Enquiry, anent the Person who was to be Chief. The <hi>Survey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> though apparently excluding a Civil Chiefness or Kingly Power, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58203:155"/>
a Spiritual Principality. His Caution, that the Clause, <hi>let him be as the Younger,</hi> will <hi>not import a Direction to Undervalue such,</hi> is fruitless and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, since the Lord recommends therein a humble Ministerial Diligence, as is said. The <hi>Bishops</hi> Work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. is the Work and Office of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious <hi>Pastor</hi> and Scripture <hi>Bishop,</hi> but the Aspiring Seeker of <hi>a Chiefness,</hi> which the <hi>Surveyer</hi> would bring within the Compass of that Text, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who aspired after the same. For what he adds <hi>of the Motive drawn from our Lords Humility</hi>: We have above made appear, that in the <hi>Series</hi> of their Arguing, he and his Fellows doth underprop by such a Notion and Gloss of this Passage, a <hi>Primacy</hi> or <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> It is enough that we add here, that our Lords Exemplary Humility, who is the Master of the House, is in this place presented, the more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enforce his Servants abhorring all Ambitious Usurpation one over another, since they are all Fellow-Disciples and Servants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers Fifth</hi> Ground and Counter-Instance (P. 202.) is this in <hi>Summ, That our Lord mentioning in this Prohibition, the Authority, not of Kings over Chief Grandees, but over their Subjects, were our Gloss of his discharging all Governing Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority admitted, it would reach a Prohibition of Government over the People, and therefore our Lord discharges not the Rule of one or some Ministers over Ministers, but only the Lordly and Earthly Way of it. Ans.</hi> As the Dominion and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, which our Lord here discharged, is certainly such, as respects both Ministers and People, Church Members and Church Officers, and <hi>a fortiori,</hi> as reaching <hi>Church Officers,</hi> because respecting <hi>Church Members</hi>: Whence the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> Copying out this Direction of his Master, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted Ministers <hi>not to Lord over Gods Heritage</hi>; So we have made appear, that the Power and Dominion of the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> is such as encroaches upon the just Liberties both of Ministers and People, robbing the one of their Decisive Suffrage and Jurisdictional Power, the other of their just Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the Call of Ministers, and in other things. Here again, we may notice, how this <hi>Surveyer</hi> overshoots still his Mark, and wanders from the Point, while endeavouring to prove that an Official Inequality of <hi>Pastors</hi> is not here prohibited; And drawing his Proof from the supposed Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Apostles over ordinary Pastors. Again, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that there is here discharged a <hi>Dominative, Worldly and Lordly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and thus the Text forces him to give a Deadly Blow to his Darling <hi>Prelats,</hi> who owne the Title, Name and Thing of <hi>Lordship,</hi> and both Civil and Spiritual Dominion, they being owned as Spiritual Lords, and Lords of the High Court of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture made use of for <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which the <hi>Surveyer</hi> (P. 203.) undertakes to Answer, is that Passage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>If thy Brother trespass against thee,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58203:155"/>
                  <hi>go tell the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Whence he saith we argue, <hi>That Christ our Lord giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the great Charter of censuring Iurisdiction to be exercised among his Subjects, doth not give that Power to one Man, a Bishop, but to the Church, and one Man cannot be a Church.</hi> In Answer to this, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> in the first place <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to disclaim</hi> Erastus <hi>way, which denys an inherent Discipline and Government in the Church for correcting Offences, and keeping Ordinances in Purity.</hi> Which contradicts his Zealous Pleading for the Kings Ecclesiastick Supremacy in this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> as it was then established by Law, and screwed up to the highest pinacle of an Arbitrary Dominion, so that the <hi>Prelats</hi> were declared to <hi>Act as his Commissioners, accountable to him in their pretended Ecclesiastick Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Government it self, is in our Laws called and owned, as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie</hi>'s <hi>Ecclesiastick Government.</hi> But though the <hi>Surveyer</hi> pretends to disowne <hi>Erastus</hi> way, yet he spends a considerable Discourse in fighting with their Weapons. In order to this Scope he tells us, <hi>That a Course is here prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for charitable removing privat Quarrels arising among Brethren, both to gain their Friendship and their Souls too, from the guiltiness of the Breach of Charity, which he tells us, is clear from</hi> v. 21.22. <hi>And from the paralel,</hi> Luk. 17.2, 3, 4. <hi>Hence he inferrs, that our Lords Direction is in Limitation to privat Injuries, and not be extended to the whole Latitude of all Offences, to which this Direction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extended. Ans.</hi> First, It is evident that our Lord here prescribs this Method of removing Offences, <hi>viz.</hi> That when more privat Means reach not the end, and the person privatly admonished is not gained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Miscarriage, the Matter is to be brought to the publick hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, and such a Church and Collegiat Meeting, as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be cloathed with power to censure Ecclesiastically. So that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting there is a Remedy here prescribed for the removal of the privat Offences, it is still under the Notion of Scandals that might arise among them in point of Charity and Equity. And hence it is evident, that the <hi>Gaining,</hi> here made the Scope of Dealing with the offending Brother, respects mainly the gaining of his Soul to GOD: So the word is taken <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.20. and the gaining of his Friendship, only in a Subordinat Sense. As for the Passages cited, neither <hi>v.</hi> 21.22. of this <hi>Chap.</hi> nor <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.1.2, 3, 4. (which the <hi>Surveyer</hi> himself dare not call exactly paralel to the place under debate) can evince that the Offences mentioned were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mere privat Injuries, and not Scandals; as Mr. <hi>Gillespie</hi> in the <hi>Aarons Rod, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. hath abundantly proved: And admitting there is a <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt privat Injuries and all Offences, this place is meant only of Offences and Scandals; Nor can it be hence inferred, that the more grosser and the lesser Scandals may not fall under a diverse Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, with reference to some pieces of a Method of Procedure, as is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58203:156"/>
evident from what the Apostle prescribes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. in reference to the removal of that attrocious Scandal of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> (P. 203, 204 205.) spends a long Discourse in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to load with Absurdities, the Distinction betwixt <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi>
Powers, upon the account of the Varieties of Offences arising upon sins of Omission and Commission, sins of <hi>Quotidian</hi> Incursion, Scandals from Actions Criminal, or in point of Civil Injuries, of Oppression, <hi>&amp;c. And Injuries in order to the joynting of the supposed Discipline,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>with the Civil Government, when the Civil Injuries and Scandal are joyned, whether he shall complain to the Church to Iudge of the Scandal, since thus the Church will Iudge the Civil injury, and invade the Magistrats part, or else pronounce the Actions Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and Censure blindly, following the antecedent Iudgment of the Magistrat, or otherwise be necessitat to review the whole Process</hi> de novo, <hi>&amp;c. Ans.</hi> As Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters coming before these Respective Judicatories, must be considered Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially and Formally, so the proper difference betwixt the two Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with respect to the Object, is to be drawn from the Formalities of the Actions, or the <hi>ratio suo qua,</hi> they come under their Respective cogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. It cannot be the Materiality of the Action simplely, for this would make the Two Powers inevitably to Justle, and the Church might not medle with any Action, which the Civil Magistrates Power doth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Case touch, such as habituated Adultery, Perjury, Incest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Scandal being the proper formal Object of the Churches Power, the same Action, as under the other <hi>formalis Ratio</hi> of the Civil injury, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of the Magistrats Cognizance; and in the Case wherein the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil injury is dubious, the Magistrats Right stands good, as to a Priority in the Cognizance. Likewise, there are Civil wrongs, wherein the Case is so dubious, that before the Legal Decision, the Person wronging, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be presumed to have Acted from a bad Principle or purpose, but from the ground of a mistaken Right, and therefore after the Legal Decision, no Scandal can be concluded. And in cases wherein there is manifest Scandal, the Churches Power takes place and herein there is no necessity, as the <hi>Surveyer</hi> pretends, either for a blind following the Magistrats Decision in this Point, or an immediat medling with Civil Processes. For the Scandals Mentioned by him, we say, that as in the Circumstantials of procedure, there is such variety allowed to the prudentials of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, according to the General Rules of the Word, as cannot Justle with the Method prescribed in this Text, so these Sins, whether of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, ordinary incursion, of opinion, in Matters Civil or Criminal, in so far as habituat and scandalous, do come under the Churches Cogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, understanding this still with the due Caution premised, touching the Scandal of Civil injuries: For Scandals in Matters Criminal, if the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58203:156"/>
Magistrats Sword of Justice do strike, in removing the Person from the Land of the Living, there is a prevention of any further dealing; If he neglect his Duty, the Church is to follow the ordinary Methods for gaining the Persons Soul, and removing the Scandal. In a word, the Civil &amp; Ecclesiastick Jurisdictions being both Gods appointments, as this <hi>Surveyer</hi> should not deny, it necessarly follows, that they have their distinct Limits and Measures drawn, their proper Ends and Objects appointed by the God of Order, and therefore cannot be said of themselves, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, and clash together, without a Blasphemous reflection upon him, <hi>who is the Author of both</hi>; so that whatever practical interfeirings and abuse of Power, men in either Capacity may be guilty of, can no more reflect upon these Ordinances themselves, than Mans Sinful abuse can be said to impeach the Divine Authority of the Office he sustains. I add this remark further, that the <hi>Surveyer</hi> doth in the Premised discourse palpably contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himself, while endeavouring to asperse a true Ecclesiastick Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he professes to disclaim <hi>Erastus his way, and asserts there ought to be a Godly Disciplin in the Church, for correcting Offenders, and keeping the House of GOD and his Ordinances in Purity,</hi> and consequently he professes to own <hi>an intrinsick Church Government distinct from the Civil,</hi> and by further consequence, a coordination of the two Powers and Jurisdictions, and likewise a necessary mutual Subjection of persons Cloathed therewith, to the Respective Authority of the one and the other Jurisdiction; yet in his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of supposed absurdities, he impugns this Principle, and endeavours to prove that without palpable Confusions and clashing of Societies, there can be no exercise of this Government. Besides, he pretends to impugn only the received sense of this Passage, and to keep within these Limits, yet while attempting to prove, that this is not the sense of the place, he rambles out into such a Discourse, as if it prove any thing, doth evince that neither this, nor any other place of Scripture, doth hold out an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Jurisdiction and Disciplin, as properly and formally distinct from the Civil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers</hi> next Answer (<hi>P.</hi> 205.) is in Summ this, <hi>That supposing the Church Collective cannot be here understood, but the Representative only, in the Matter of Representation, it is indifferent, whether they be one or many; one Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner may represent a Presbytrie in an Assembly: So that tell the Church, is tell the Presidents and Rulers of the Respective Churches, or tell him that's Chief, with his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.

And sometimes its put for the Assembly of Believers, sometimes for the Church Militant, sometimes for a Province, Kingdom or City: Compare <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. with <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. And here good Interpreters do conse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently take it to Represent the Ecclesiastick <hi>Senat</hi> or <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> making it one and the some with that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> properly signifies in <hi>Concione delibero, Verba facio,</hi> to Consult, Deliberat and Discourse in Publick Assembly. The Text convinces of this; For, 1. The Gradation is from the Lesser to the Greater Number. 2. Our Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. speaks of an <hi>agreeing on Earth, and gathering together in his Name.</hi> Besides, that the <hi>Surveyer</hi> himself expones <hi>the Church,</hi> of the <hi>Rulers and Governours,</hi> who, if they have a joynt Essential Interest in their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, he overthrows his Opinion of Concentring this in the <hi>Prelat</hi>; if he ascribe the Jurisdictional Decisive Authority to one, who is Chief, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the rest but his Assistants, he again contradicts himself, in seeming to ascribe this Ruling Power to the <hi>whole Meeting,</hi> for thus the Sense could not be as he says, <hi>tell the Rulers and Governours.</hi> For what he adds of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,</hi> it is palpably absurd: For, 1. The Church Representative, or the Officers thereof, have a Divine immediat Institution, are set by God therein, and have not a derived Authority from the Church. 2. It is the Court it self, not the Deputed Commissioner, one or more, which is the proper Subject of the Jurisdictional Power. 3. To make the Paralel hold, he behoved to say the <hi>Prelats</hi> have a derived Power, as Commissioner, from the Church, the Falshood whereof is apparent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, (P. 206.) <hi>That the attributing a Iurisdictional Power to the Church, is nothing against him, who allows not to one single Bishop this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without the Council of Presbyters, according to the</hi> 4th. Council <hi>of</hi> Carthage, Can. 23. <hi>though nothing is to be done without the Bishop. Ans.</hi> In Stating the Question with the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> (P. 192.) he tells us, It is <hi>whether this Power be equally Diffused in the whole Colledge of Presbyters, or Concentred in one Person:</hi> Now if the Person of the <hi>Bishop</hi> be the Centre, he cannot allow this <hi>Official Power</hi> to step beyond that Centre; So, that no Members of the Meeting have any Interest therein. He adds here, as likeways in the place before Cited, <hi>That the</hi> Bishop <hi>must exercise this Power with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce and the Assistance of Presbyters</hi>; But this can import no Exercise of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58203:157"/>
since privat Persons may Counsel and Advise, who have no Decisive Suffrage: And he knew, that in the late Edition of our Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> were to Advise the <hi>Bishop</hi> only, and scarce that. So that our <hi>Prelats,</hi> in such Exercise of their Power, baffled that Act of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which he mentions. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, <hi>That there is a Plurality of Officers, even where this Inequality of Power is supposed, whether Iudging or Advising.</hi> But if one only Judge, and the rest are but mere Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visers, the Judging Power being thus Concentred in one, there is no such Court, as is the Subject of a Jurisdictional Power; So that the <hi>Surveyer</hi> bewrays great Impudence, in saying that <hi>the Determination properly flows from them all,</hi> since the Authority is thus Concentred in one. But says the <hi>Surveyer, since the Organick Church is made up of Rulers and Ruled, the Notion of a Church will not import an Equality of Power in all. Ans.</hi> This Paralel is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably unjust and impertinent, since the <hi>Church Organick,</hi> considered thus complexly, doth necessarly and essentially include Members and <hi>Officers, Rulers</hi> and <hi>Ruled,</hi> and consequently a <hi>necessary Inequality</hi>; But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> could not deny, that in this place, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Church, imports a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety or Colledge of <hi>Rulers only,</hi> which can come under no such Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a necessary Inequality.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers Fourth</hi> Answer is in <hi>Summ, That we find the highest Censures of the Church inflicted by the Authority of single Persons, who ever otherwise concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; So</hi> Paul <hi>excommunicat</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And to say he acted as a Member of a</hi> Quorum, <hi>is to make him a vain Boaster, and to make the Scripture speak what we will. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> must acknowledge, yea &amp; hath acknowledged the difference betwixt the Apostolick Authority, in the Framing and Constitution of Churches, and the Exercise of their Power, in Churches already constitute in their Organick Beeing: In the first Case, there was an indispensible necessity of exerting a singular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Authority, when no Officers were to concur, and Churches were not fully Moulded in their Organick Beeing: And we heard himself di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the Apostles <hi>ordinary and extraordinary</hi> Power: In the other Case, when Churches were constitute, it is evident, and hath been made good, that they did assume the Official Concurrence of ordinary Church Rulers. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> challengeth us <hi>to produce a Warrand for our Assertion of</hi> Pauls <hi>acting here upon an extraordinary Apostolick Authority.</hi> Thus he challenges the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to produce his Warrand for this his Apostolick Acting, which he has long since produced and recorded, if this Man had been pleased to read and consider it. Whereas he tells us, <hi>It was none of the extraordinary Characters of the Apostles to act in these Matters, by his own only Authority</hi>; We say it was, where Churches were not constitute, and no ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to concur: And this <hi>Surveyer</hi> might be challenged, as the Affirmer, to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58203:158"/>
prove that this Act was put forth in an Organick Church, where ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers were to concur, or else in denying this to be one of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristicks of the Apostolick Office, he asperses his Apostolick Power and Authority. He adds, <hi>That what was beyond their immediat Calling, infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, illimited Iurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was transmittable to</hi> his <hi>Successors, and actually transmitted to</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus. It is <hi>Answered,</hi> we have made appear, that their immediat Calling, considered with reference to its Nature and End of Planting Churches, Constituting the Officers &amp; Ordinances thereof, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly include this Authority in this first Framing of Churches, which neither was nor could be transmitted, unless it be pleaded that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Foundation could be twice laid. For <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove spoken to their Authority and Office, and made appear that it was <hi>transient</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi> as that of Apostles, and to be Exercised with the Authoritative Official Concurrence of ordinary Officers or Presbyters, where they were Planted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyers Fifth</hi> Answer and Exception (P. 207.) is, <hi>That there is in this Text an Allusion to the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church Courts, wherein there were Chief and Subordinat Rulers, both in the</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>and Synagogues. Ans.</hi> Unless the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi> can make appear, that the whole <hi>Iurisdictional Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> therein, was so Concentred in <hi>one Person,</hi> as there was nothing of it left to any of the Members; and that their Work was only to <hi>give Assent unto</hi> the sole Decisive Determination and Sentence of that one Person, this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer will never help the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> whose Power was of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to our Laws. If it be supposed that the Jurisdictional Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was competent to the whole <hi>Colledge</hi> in these Meetings, the Passage stands still in its Condemning Force against the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop.</hi> That the whole Jurisdictional Power in the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> was Concentred in the Person of the High Priest, none can, without extreme Impudence, assert. We heard that the Learned <hi>Iunius</hi> (and several others) do assert that the ordinary Jurisdiction was <hi>penes concessum Sacerdotum,</hi> competent to the whole Meeting of the Priests. The <hi>Levits,</hi> as well as the <hi>Priests,</hi> were to shew the Sentence of Judgment in Matters and Questions brought before them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10. So <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8, 9. restoring this <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi> set the <hi>Levites,</hi> as well as the <hi>Priests,</hi> to Judge the Controversies that came before them, by way of Appeal. And though we find that the High Priest did pronounce the Sentence of Judgment, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.11. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. this will not infer the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Conclusion of his <hi>sole Decisive Suffrage,</hi> since the <hi>Moderator</hi> of an <hi>Assembly</hi> may pronounce the Sentence flowing from their joynt Decisive Votes. For the <hi>Rulers</hi> of Synagogues, since we read of them, and of <hi>Chief Rulers</hi> in the plural, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8, 17. it is evident there could be no peculiar Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction lodged in one exclusive of the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:58203:158"/>His <hi>Last</hi> Exception to this Passage is, <hi>That the Remedy here prescribed was presently to be made use of, upon the rising of Scandals, and therefore, was not for Scandals to arise a long time thereafter. Ans.</hi> This first Seminarie of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, being at present under our Lords immediat Inspection, there was no such Access for a present Use of this Remedy, &amp; therefore this Rule and Remedy was mainly prescribed for after-times, as the Charter of the Churches Jurisdiction. The <hi>Author</hi> of the second part of <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Annot.</hi> well observes upon this Passage,
<q>That we are not to understand our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as speaking with relation unto the present time, but the time to come, and giving Laws, which should take place, and abide from the gathering of the Christian Church: And if the Church be understood of those that have the Authority of Binding and Loosing, they shew that the present Church of Apostles, was to constitute particular Churches, to whom, when constituted, in force of this precept, such Offences were to be told, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>

Jews? Upon the Ground I now offered, the Negative Answer is clear; The Complaint was to be made to this glorious Head of the Church, in whom all Church-Authority is truely concentred, and in telling him, the Church was told. But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us of <hi>Bucers</hi> Assertion, <hi>That Christ and his Apostles were a sufficient Representative Christian Church; And this Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Presbytrie and Representative, he professes to accept well of, where was no Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Power in the Members. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> knew there was here an absolute Dominion of the Churches Glorious Head over a Society of Officers; And if he will still have such a standing Pattern of a Representative Church, <hi>viz.</hi> a Supreme <hi>Vicar</hi> having the Radical Authority thereof, the <hi>Pope</hi> will joyn issue with him in his gladful Acceptance thereof.. That there was no Equality of Power in the Members, contradicts his former Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anent an <hi>Equality of an Official Power among the Apostles,</hi> unless he will put Christ the Glorious Head among these Members, and degrade Him from his Head-ship. He tells us further, <hi>That in this Primitive Pattern, there was no Inter-mixture of Lay-Elders.</hi> A witty Knack and Notion indeed. He hath told us P. 199. of several Classes and Degrees of Church Officers, which he thinks exemplifies the continual standing Measures for the Christian Church, from that Passage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>First Apostles, Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Prophets, Thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles,</hi> and he will not doubt <hi>Evangelists</hi> likewayes are of the Number, who are reckoned <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Our <hi>Surveyer</hi> saw no mixture of these in this <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> nor of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> whom he distinguishes from the Apostolick Office, the <hi>Bishops</hi> being with him, their Successors: So that the poor Man was upon the <hi>Charybdis</hi> or <hi>Scylla,</hi> either to acknowledge that this <hi>Presbytrie</hi> was not so compleat as it ought to have been, and thus forced to contradict what he here asserts, <hi>That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to this Form all others afterwards should be framed</hi> (for this will make the Pattern and after Copies manck and defective) Or else, if he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that in this Primitive Seminary and <hi>Embryon</hi> of Church Judicatories, all ordinary Officers were not present, he behoved to confess that his Charge against <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> (as he calls them) because not here, was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and groundless. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> calls for <hi>such a Presbytrie to end all our Controversie.</hi> That is a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> with a <hi>Head,</hi> having a Soveraign Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion over all the Members: And since he would not with the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> have our Lord to reign personally on Earth, he here wished for a Supreme infallible <hi>Vicar</hi> to end the Controversie.

The <hi>Surveyer</hi> founds his Argument upon the <hi>Allusion made to the</hi> Jewish <hi>Courts</hi>: But 1. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in general, there are Scripture Allusions, that will not so much as plead for the Lawfulness of the thing alluded to, witness, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to Charming, and our Lords warning that he comes as a Thief. 2. Should he plead for a compleat equality betwixt the <hi>Iewish,</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church Judicatories, he would plead for an Oecumenick <hi>Bishop</hi> and fixed <hi>President</hi> over the whole Christian Church, as there was a Supreme High Priest set over the <hi>Iewish</hi>; so-that this Argument proving too much, and beyond his Assertion, proves nothing. 3. It is enough to found the allusion, that there be some likeness of the things compared; and thus in this Case, there being in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, Courts, a sutable Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lesser to the greater, and a Correspondent Official Power seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, the allusion stands good, intire, and evident upon this ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Christian Church Courts are of such a Nature.</p>

Now, this <hi>Surveyer</hi> might have pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what Sense or Divinity it could be in him, or <hi>Beza</hi>; to assert <hi>that the Church is guided by the Spirit in her declinings from the word of GOD.</hi> To this Scope we might Cite many Passages of <hi>Beza</hi>: See (for brevity) <hi>Beza ad Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>apud Sarav. num.</hi> 20. <hi>Beza Resp.</hi> C. 11. <hi>N.</hi> 3. Likewise in <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. <hi>Referent. Sarav.</hi> P. 92. In which Passages (and many such like) we find him clearly condemning this Human <hi>Prostasie,</hi> in so far as transcending the Limits of a <hi>Moderators</hi> Office.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> next coming to the Second proposition of the Argument, tells us, <hi>That its sooner affirmed than proven, that there were no Bishops in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles days, differing from Presbyters in the modern notion: And he compares the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians to the Melancholick Man in</hi> Athens, <hi>who concerned himself in every Ship arriving in the Harbour, as his own property</hi> A Charge easily retorted; since in such like Hypochondriack distempers, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> (as his Fellows) would needs have the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop</hi> of their New Notion, to be lodged under the Denomination of the Scripture-<hi>Bishop</hi>: Yea (and in a Distemper beyond that of the Man at <hi>Athens</hi>) will often lap him under the Denomination of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> where there is not so much as an appearance of this auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arriving Vessel. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Name of Presbyter is not in Holy Scripture, a distinguishing Name of one sort of Officers from all others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58203:160"/>
sometimes the Scripture requires that it must be looked on as Distinguishing those that are under that Name from other Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ans.</hi> The proposition he impugns, is, <hi>That in the Apostles days, there were no</hi> Bishops <hi>Superior to</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, no Ordinary Officers of the Hierarchical Mould, or <hi>Bishops</hi> of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Notion. That from these places Cited, it is aparent, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Church Officers Instituted by Apostles, were <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> of the same Official Mould and Authority, to whom the Feeding and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the Church is enjoyned promiscuously: And all his Answer to the Proposition amounts to this, <hi>that the Name of Presbyter is sometimes a more general Name, than to point at an ordinary Officer</hi>: An Answer utterly remote from the Point, as is obvious to any that considers, That it touches not. 1. The <hi>Official Identity</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in the Passages Cited, and their equal Official Authority, as ordinary Church Officers, given to Feed and Rule the Church jointly, which is a necessary Consequence of the former. 2. The unwarrantableness of such an Officer, as the Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Prelat,</hi> whose Office encroaches upon, and robs them of that Power allowed them of GOD, which is another Necessary Consequence drawn from this Ground. This Charge is the more evident in that he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, <hi>that sometimes these Names of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter, <hi>distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es those that are under the same, from other Officers.</hi> And in the Passages Cited, he cannot but acknowledge them thus distinguished: Sure they are so, at least for any thing he hath said. He tells us, he will in this and other Considerations, <hi>remove our Mistake</hi>: But sure he hath here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented his own.</p>
               <p>He adds, (<hi>P.</hi> 209.) <hi>That in the Rehearsal of Church Officers,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>with</hi> Eph. 4.11. Presbyters <hi>are not in the Number, though</hi> Bishops, <hi>and they are comprehend under the Name of Pastors and Teachers, which shews that the Name is not appointed to design any certain Order of Ministers. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> could not but grant, that the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> according to his modern Notion, as distinguished by this Name from the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> is in none of these Rolls, and therefore, upon his own Principle, this <hi>Name is not appointed to design any certain Order of Ministers</hi>: And where is then his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand for the Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> as thus distinguished? Likewise the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi>
very unhappily made the Name of <hi>Teacher,</hi> the Characteristick of his Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> who looks upon <hi>Teaching</hi> as none of his work, nor is Chargeable, <hi>qua Prelat,</hi> with any deficiency in his Office, though his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons drop but once or twice, <hi>pro forma,</hi> and on Solemnities from one years and to another. In a word, as the <hi>Surveyer</hi> in this Reason quite ruined his Cause and assertion, so it is evident, that in the Scripture Accounts of the institution and work of Presbyters, the work and Office is found the same with that of these ordinary Officers, Cited 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58203:160"/>
since both Teaching and Government, are evidently committed unto them <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. with <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5: 7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. But for the Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Hierarchical Prelat, or any proper designation for his Office in that Capacity, our <hi>Surveyer,</hi> after all the Travels of his Surveying Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, brings us home nothing but a <hi>non inventus est.</hi> He adds as a proof of his former Assertion, <hi>That he knows no place of Scripture, where the word</hi> Elder <hi>must needs point out an Officer fixed to a particular Charge in Teaching and Ruling, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above him in Power, or having Power over any other Officers.</hi> But he should have pointed us to the place, where the <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> of his new Mould, is represented in Scripture, under the Name of either <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi>: And if he give over this discovery, and the Answer of our demand herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, he must take home and Lodge this Argument with himself, and when he falls upon a good answer, bestow it for us upon himself. But for such Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters or Elders, as he doth desiderat, he might have found them in the same Text of Act. 20.17, 28. impowered with the ordinary Office and Authority of Teaching and Ruling the Church, as succeeding the Apostles in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Office, yea and fixed as the ordinary Officers of this Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> for this end; as likewise Elders thus set up with an <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> and fixed to their Charges, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. Likewise 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. We have <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> supposed to have a fixed Relation to that Church, having also a Teaching and Governing Power: Yea <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. We find such <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ordained Church by Church, or in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church. But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, <hi>That</hi> Presbyterians <hi>hold Elders to be of two Ranks, and therefore, if the Ruling Elders are not to be here supposed, they make the first Constitution of Churches manck and defective, without Ruling Elders or Deacons; Or if they include both under the Name of Elders, he can with bete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Ground, include the</hi> Majores Presbyteri, <hi>or Bishops, distinct from the</hi> Minores, <hi>or Pastors. Ans.</hi> Whether we assert there are Ruling Elders here or not, his Hierarchical <hi>Bishop</hi> is not in the least helped, or his Pleading for him strengthened. For, if we shall say, that in this first plantation of the Churches, there were only Teaching Elders or Pastors appointed, who were <hi>in tuto</hi> to appoint and ordain Ruling Elders and Deacons, his absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is easily evaded, if we shall but suppose that which is easily supposable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the first Constitution of Churches, there was a gradual procedure, and the chief Officers, the <hi>Pastors,</hi> first ordained and impowered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as above said: If we embrace the other Answer, and affirm that Elders of both sorts, were here ordained, his Inference hath no shadow of a Connection hereupon, since we do make good from Scripture, the Distinction of the Teaching and Ruling Elder, who both come under this general Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But for his <hi>Hierarchical Bishop,</hi> his Institution, Name, or Office, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> can give us no shadow of a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>of, and but beggs the Question in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58203:161"/>
supposing such an Officers Existence. Besides, though it were granted, that such a Distinction could be admitted, where finds this <hi>Surveyer</hi> the <hi>Deacons</hi> in these Catalogues? And how will he thus evite the Rebound of his own Blow, and his own absurdity of a manck Constitution of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches</hi>? For what he adds, <hi>That</hi> Irenaeus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Lyons, <hi>is called a Presbyter of his Church of</hi> Lyons. It is certain, <hi>Bishops</hi> were sometimes so called, and therefore they were the more guilty who did appropriat the Name <hi>Bishop</hi> to a pretended Office, Superior to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> especially since this Retention of the Name <hi>Presbyter,</hi> was from some Impression of the New Testament Times and Writings, wherein the two Names are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uously used to point at one and the same Officer. And it would seem this Name, which, with <hi>Beda</hi> signifieth <hi>Sapientiae Maturitatem,</hi> should have been rather assumed by these pretended Fathers, than that of <hi>Bishop,</hi> which with him imports <hi>industriam curae pastoralis,</hi> the Industry of the Pastoral Care, a Work that Prelats are found little to concern themselves about.</p>
               <p>There is another Passage, wherein he might have seen such <hi>Presbyters</hi> as he desiderats, viz. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.22, 23. where mention is made of Apostles and Elders, meeting in that Council at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who must needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of fixed Pastors of that Chuch. The Surveyer (P. 210.) offers to our thoughts, <hi>Whether</hi> James, <hi>the LORDS Brother, called by the Ancients Bishop of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and is a Distinct person from the two of that Name, comes under any of these Denominations</hi>? We have above made appear, in collating this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. That this <hi>Iames</hi> who is called the Lords Brother, is called an Apostle, and such an Apostle as <hi>Peter</hi> and others, <hi>v.</hi> 17.18. Which is also clear from this, that we read of a <hi>Iames</hi> the less, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.14. Which (as <hi>Ierom</hi> contra <hi>Helvidium</hi> reasons) had been no fit Distinction, had there been three <hi>Iames</hi>'s. The Harmony of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taking <hi>Iames</hi> to be an Apostle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. is above made appear; such as <hi>Estius, Paraeus, Gomarus, Menochius, Piscator, Tirinus, Simplicius,</hi> &amp;c. The Surveyer was not to be troubled in a <hi>Counter-enquiry,</hi> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he proposed the Question? Or next, under which of these Names he comprehended the <hi>Deacons</hi>? But for us, a rational Account may be given, If it be said they are comprehended under none of these Names, there being in this Meeting put forth a Diatactick, Critick, and Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power and Authority, in none of which, <hi>Deacons</hi> as such, have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, their Work and Interest being to serve Tables.</p>
               <p>To that Passage 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. where the fixed Elders or Presbyters of the Churches have ascribed unto them an Authority in Feeding and Ruling the same; The Surveyer Answers, <hi>That the Name of Presbyter is common to all Church Officers, Higher and Lower, even to Apostles, as</hi> Beza <hi>acknowledges. Ans.</hi> He hath already acknowledged, That <hi>it must sometimes in Scripture be looked on,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58203:161"/>
as distinguishing those pointed out thereby from other Officers</hi>; So that it may here denote a Preaching Pastor in special, notwithstanding that in a general Sense, Superior Officers had that Name, such as Apostles. He could not deny the peculiar Office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appropriat to Superior Officers. And besides, that the proper Name and Designation of the Superior Officer, he cannot shew to be given to the Inferior, though the Superior in a General Sense, have sometimes the Name of the Inferior attributted to them. He might have here seen, that these Officers or Presbyters have an Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Inspection and Oversight over the Flock ascribed unto them, and that of such a Nature, as imports a compleat Official Equality, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Lordship over GODS Heritage: Which doth clearly Justle out his Hierarchical Prelat, as having no Interest in Church Government. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> further tells us, <hi>There is no ground to assert that the Presbyters</hi>
Act. 20.17.28. <hi>were such only in the Modern Notion, and none of them Bishops in the Modern Notion</hi>: And to obviat an Objection from their Relation to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi> he adds, <hi>That they were not only Elders of that Church, but of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> Asia <hi>about, so far as in a transient Visit they might get Intelligence.</hi> This often baffled Subterfuge, <hi>Episcopalians</hi> have been told, is contrary to the Sense of Ancient <hi>Fathers, Ierom, Theodoret, Chrysostom</hi>; contrary to several <hi>Councils</hi>; contrary to the <hi>Syriack</hi> Translation, which reads the Text thus, <hi>be sent to</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and called the Elders of the Church of</hi> Ephesus.
<q>Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> holds, they were the Twelve, upon whom the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Hands, and gave them the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6. and such others (if any such were) whom <hi>Timothy</hi> had ordained.</q>
See <hi>Lightfoot Harm. Chron. N. Test.</hi> The Text says, <hi>He sent to</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and called the Elders of the Church</hi>: Sure of that Church to which he sent, and there is no shadow of a hint of any other <hi>Elders</hi> there present. Again, he sent for the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> in the Singular Number, <hi>viz.</hi> that particular Church: But the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Gloss will read <hi>the Elders of the Churches,</hi> in the Plural, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> then mett at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The Scripture expresses Provincial Churches in the plural, as the Churches of <hi>Asia, Rev.</hi> 1.11. Churches of <hi>Iudea,</hi> but otherwise of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem, Corinth,</hi> in the singular, which were in Cities. Neither will the old rotten Evasion help the <hi>Surveyer, viz.</hi> that <hi>v.</hi> 18. its said <hi>he Preached throughout all</hi> Asia, and <hi>v.</hi> 25. speaking to these that were conveened, he saith, <hi>you all among whom I have gone Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God</hi>; from which he pleads, <hi>there were others present, as well as the Elders of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>who might be proper Bishops in their places</hi>: Since it is evident, that the Term [<hi>All ye</hi>] doth properly relate to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> then present, and was immediatly spoken to them: Such Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Terms, used in such a Sense, and to such a Scope, are very ordinary
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58203:162"/>
and caseable, as if one should say to a certain Number of an <hi>Assembly, ye are all now dissolved,</hi> it would not imply the presence of all the Members. Again, the Apostle might speak many things, which did import the Concern and Duty of all, though the Speech were directed immediatly and personally to those only that were present. When he said, <hi>You all among whom I have gone, Preaching the Kingdom of God,</hi> the <hi>Surveyer</hi> will not be bold to say this will infer that <hi>these all</hi> were present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that the Speech did import so much. As for the Passages Cited, <hi>viz. v.</hi> 18, 25. It is <hi>Answered,</hi> that the Apostle spent most of these Years in <hi>Ephesus</hi> only, <hi>viz.</hi> two Years and three Months, and the Superplus in the places adjacent; So that these <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> could not be ignorant, how the whole was spent. Some have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved further, that there is nothing of a peculiar Address here to a supposed <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and that all these Elders are Charged with the Oversight of that Flock. But the Surveyer <hi>will not have the</hi> Presbyters <hi>here to be meaned in the restrained Signification, or that this Term should restrain the Term of Bishop.</hi> But we restrain none of them from their due and Native Signification, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Preaching Presbyter or Pastor. As for his enlarged Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, stretching to an Hierarchical Prelat, it is the Chimera of his own Fancy, whereof he hath offered no Shadow of a Proof.</p>
               <p>To that Text of <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. wherein the Bishop and Elder are found clearly <hi>Identified,</hi> and a Plurality of them fixed in that one Church; The Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (P. 211.) repones again his Old Recocted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Crambe of the <hi>Majores &amp; Minores Presbyteri, as comprehended in these Terms,</hi> and tells us <hi>of an Analogical Reasoning which the Apostle uses, from the Qualifications and Duties of the Bishop, properly so called, to shew the necessity of the like in all</hi> Presbyters, <hi>who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under their Order. Ans.</hi> As his Supposition of the properly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called <hi>Bishops,</hi> is still begged by him without any ground, &amp; as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily denyed by us, as affirmed by him; So his Gloss and Reason adduced, is clearly cross to the Text; Since the Apostle shewing <hi>Titus,</hi> how the Elders to be ordained in every City, were to be qualified, adds this Reason of Advice, <hi>for a Bishop must be blameless</hi>; this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>for,</hi> is causal, shewing the Identity of the Office, as well as the Name, else the Reasoning were false: Should a <hi>Chancellor</hi> in one of the <hi>Universities</hi> (saith <hi>Smectymnus,</hi> who useth this illustrating Similitude) give Order to his <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none to the Degree of <hi>Batchelour</hi> of Arts, but such as were able to Preach, or keep a Divinity Act, <hi>for Batchelours of Divinity must be so</hi>: What Reason or Equity were in this? And we may enquire here what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this, <hi>The improperly called Bishop must be so and so qualified, because the Bishop of the higher Order and distinct Function must be so qualified? Gerard. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Minist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eccles.</hi> useth the same Reason to shew the Absurdity of such a Gloss. The Apostle in the <hi>Series</hi> of his Reasoning, Identifies both the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58203:162"/>
Work and Office of Bishop and Presbyter: But this Surveyer will needs correct him, and cast in his <hi>Limiting Cautions,</hi> and instead of that identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Apostle asserts of the Offices, make them only <hi>in some Sense the same,</hi> not intirely. He tells us, <hi>That in Sacerdotal Acts they are the same</hi>: But he cannot say, that the Apostles Identity here asserted, reaches and includes only the Acts of Order, and is not to be extended to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Jurisdiction. As for the Acts of Order, the Hierarchical Bishop, is in their Principles, the proper Primary Subject of the Sacerdotal Acts and Authority in the whole <hi>Diocess,</hi> whereas that of the Pastor is Precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Subaltern to his, and fixed to one Flock. He calls (P. 200.) the Acts of Jurisdiction <hi>a Personal Application only of the Word, or of the Power of Order</hi>; yet he doth here Diversifie them; so that though he assert the Pastor is the very same with the Prelat in the Sacerdotal Acts, he is not so in those of Jurisdiction. But we cannot stand to Trace all the Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Surveyers Notions.</p>
               <p>This distinction of <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the First and Second Order, in a New <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> serves his turn as an Answer to our Argument from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. And here we are again told, <hi>That the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>allow two Ranks and Orders of Presbyters</hi>: Where it would seem, he Screws up his Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> in this and the preceeding Answers to a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and thus quites and Justles with what he often pretends anent a Right he calls <hi>partly Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, the Text ascribs an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Authority and oversight to these <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> which as is said in former Cases and Instances, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows the Hierarchical <hi>Prelats</hi> sole arrogated Power in Ordination and Jurisdiction. It hath further this unlucky aspect upon <hi>my Lord Bishop</hi>; that the <hi>Bishops</hi> or Elders here, are enjoined an <hi>immediat Ministerial Inspection over the Flocks,</hi> and diligently to Feed the same by sound Doctrin, are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be <hi>Lords over GODs Heretage,</hi> much more to be <hi>Peers</hi> in Parliament, which pitifully plucks the Plums of their <hi>Lordships</hi> Grandure, and marrs their Figure in Herauldry. They are bidden beware of the <hi>Filthy Lucre,</hi> which will much straiten their Revenues, which doth so far overstretch the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Maintainance of a Laborious <hi>Pastor.</hi> But of this, enough.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58203:163"/>
and Disciplin Established in the Church, for keeping Gods Ordinances in Purity</hi>; which no person of common Sense or Reason can but ascribe to a distinct Select Society from the whole Community: For, if all were <hi>Correctors</hi> and <hi>Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> there is no <hi>Correlate</hi> of this <hi>Relative Power,</hi> or persons to be Ruled. If he understand the Passage, <hi>Do not ye Iudge them that are within</hi>? of a Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictional Power and Authority, it must needs have some <hi>Object,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently must have for its <hi>Subject,</hi> some <hi>Select Order of Men,</hi> distinct from the Collective Body. Next, who knows not, that the Directions Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally addressed in the Epistles, to the whole Incorporation or Body of the Church, are to be understood and applyed <hi>pro unius cujusque Modulo,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Persons several places and capacities, though the General Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress supposes still the General Concern of all? When the Apostle thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins <hi>Warn them that are unruly,</hi> and again, <hi>if any obey not our Word in this Epistle, mark that Man</hi> (which all do understand of a <hi>Censuring mark,</hi> as the word imports) who will alledge that these Authoritative Acts were competent to every individual?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> foreseeing this, tells us, P. 212. <hi>That though this in some things will hold, yet in the usual Stile of the Apostolick Epistles, there are distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Notes and Periods, that each person may know the Precepts wherein they are concerned, and</hi> Apostrophees <hi>made to several Ranks, as Ministers, Masters, Servants, to evite a dangerous Confusion: And upon the same ground an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iurisdiction in any of the Presbyters, would have here procured a distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from the People. Ans.</hi> The Surveyers Concession [<hi>That sometimes Precepts are not to be applyed and appropriat to all, distributively, but respectively, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as several persons or sorts of Persons are concerned in these Commands contained in Epistles directed to the collective Body</hi>] hath razed the Foundation of this Answer, which, from the Non-nomination of Elders, concludes the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Body of the People to be addressed only, and stiffled it in the Birth: Since he must acknowledge, that sometimes peculiar Duties, and such, wherein some persons only have a special Interest, are thus promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and generally propounded, and even in this same Epistle: And then it would have suted his Thoughts to ponder, how in this Case, he could evite his own Consequence and Charge of a dangerous Confusion follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, unless he quite the Topick of this his Argument and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; It would have likewayes suted his thoughts to assign his distinctive <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Apostrophees</hi> in the Passages cited, and the Apostles Precepts touching the Lords Supper in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> As likewayes to assign such in the Passages, which do intrust a Jurisdictional Power to Elders: I mean such distinctive Notes and Apostrophees, as would have distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the <hi>Bishop</hi> properly so called, from his <hi>Minor</hi> and improperly so called <hi>Bishops,</hi> in order to the eviting the Confusion of their Offices, and to cut off the dangerous <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Consequence and Error of understanding

the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> to be Indentified in Name and Thing. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that <hi>in some things this our Answer will hold</hi>: And sure, if in any Case, it must in this, where Rulers are supposed Existent, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge of their Official Authority, both in themselves and the People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, <hi>That there is a deep silence concerning Presbyters Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or a fixed Presbytrie at</hi> Corinth, <hi>at this time, though there were Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Eminent Teachers, Extraordinary Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer will not disowne, that in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. There is a Tryal and an Examination of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ascribed to these Teachers, therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny them the Authority of <hi>Iudging those that are within,</hi> mentioned 12. <hi>v.</hi> of 5. <hi>Ch.</hi> But for the Surveyers <hi>deep silence,</hi> which he alledges, of a Presbyterial Jurisdiction here, he might have found it removed by a full Scripture Sound, had he pondered, First, in General, the Jurisdictional Power ascribed to Pastors and Teachers, such as is imported in these Names mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Rulers, Governours, Overseers, Bishops, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Stewards, Ambassadors. And next in Special, that this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is clearly found to have been a <hi>Presbyterial Church,</hi> and under the Inspection of a <hi>Presbyterial associat Ministry.</hi> 1.
<q>There was a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Believers there, mention being made of many Believers, of many Baptized and added to the Church; All whom <hi>Paul</hi> Baptized not himself, consequently, are supposed to be Baptized by other Ministers: God likewayes having a great Harvest of Souls there, <hi>&amp; much People in that City,</hi> upon which <hi>Paul</hi> was encouraged to stay among them for so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a time, as the Year and six Moneths, compare <hi>Act.</hi> 18.1.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. This multitude behoved to be divided in particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. 2. There is correspondent Plenty of Ministers and Preachers found there, pointing it out as a <hi>Presbyterial Church,</hi> and not one single Congregation; first <hi>Paul</hi> stayed all this time at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as a <hi>Master Builder,</hi> having other under Builders, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. an occasion of their Doting, some upon one, some upon a second, some upon a third Teacher; So that there appears a plenty of Preachers there, who had their several Flocks and Followers; And <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of their not having many Fathers, though they had ten thousand Instructers, compare 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Mention is likewayes made of a Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prophets to Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. Considering likewayes the Division of Tongues and Languages, this Church could not be one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but united in a <hi>Presbyterial Classical Unity.</hi> Which in a word, is further confirmed from this Principle, that we read of a Plurality of Churches there, while the Apostle sayes, <hi>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58203:164"/>
in that Church.</hi> Yet this Plurality of single Congregations in <hi>Corinth,</hi> are called and owned as one Church, in the Inscription of the Epistle, which could not be merely upon the Ground of Heart-unity, for thus they were <hi>jure-charitatis,</hi> nor in regard of an Explicit Church-Covenant, whereof the Scripture is silent, nor in respect of the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments; for these were dispensed in single Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> severally, since they could not all meet in one Congregation: So that of necessity they are owned and designed as one Church, in regard of one joynt Administration of Government among them, by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Presbyterie</hi> or <hi>Colledge of Elders,</hi> associated for that End.</q>
See <hi>Ius Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. Minist. Eccles.</hi> P. (<hi>mihi</hi>) 206.207, 208. That the Prophets menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned 14. <hi>Ch.</hi> were ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> and Ministers of that Church, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, as the <hi>Surveyer</hi> insinuats, since Rules and Directions aptly agreeing to ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> are imposed upon them, for the well ordering their Ministerial Exercises, is upon this and many other Grounds made good by Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> in his <hi>Due Right of Presbyt.</hi> P. 466.467.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in his next Answer, is, in with standing the Evidence of this Scripture, driven upon the contrary extreme of ascribing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Jurisdiction here mentioned to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> solely. He tells us, <hi>That the Apostle speaks of the Sentence, as proceeding from himself, though the declaring and executing thereof was committed unto the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>that they are charged for not mourning that the Incestuous might be taken away by such as had Power: And it were improper to say, a Man were to take a thing away from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Ans.</hi> The plain reading of the Text, is a sufficient Confutation of this Distortion and Gloss. The Apostle certainly reprehends this Church, and imputs a Guilt to them, as to Non-procedure, in this Matter. Now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, wherein their Negligence appeared? And this is best seen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, in pondering the Duty enjoyned, <hi>viz. their Iudging such as were within, Purging out the Infectious bad Leaven, the Delivery unto Satan, &amp;c.</hi> comp. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 7, 12. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. If they had no Authority herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, why is such a Defect and Negligence reprehended? This Surveyer, in making them only the Promulgaters and Executers of the Apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Sentence, taketh the Guilt of this Negligence from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and puts it upon the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> The Surveyers Gloss upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Rebuke, as to their not mourning over this Wickedness, <hi>viz.</hi> That they <hi>sought not with Tears to such as had Power to inflict the Censure</hi>: If meant of a Power lodged in the Apostle, is contrary to the Scope, since they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned <hi>to deliver the Person to Satan,</hi> and <hi>to put him away from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> But says the Surveyer, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I have judged, <hi>imports the Apostles sole Determination, that none are taken in as Sharers with him in this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and imports he required only the Execution of their Sentence.</hi> We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready removed this Objection, the Apostles giving his Apostolick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58203:165"/>
as touching the Necessity and Expediency of the Thing, can no more exclude and prejudge the Authority and Interest of the Ordinary Church Officers herein, than his giving his Apostolick Judgment in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uncontroverted Duty, wherein the Persons enjoyned the same, have an infallible Interest, will bear such a Conclusion. Suppose the Apostle giving his Judgment touching <hi>Archippus</hi> greater Diligence in his Ministry; And giving his Judgment in the Point of Marriage, and the Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>one that had found mercy to be faithful,</hi> can this prejudge the Interest of the Persons concerned in the Duties enjoyned? Or would the Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have said, that <hi>Pauls</hi> requiring the Obedience of Church Officers, in any Point of their Ministerial Duties, and shewing them that he had jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged such and such things to be their Duty, will conclude they had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Interest therein, antecedaneously to such Judging and Enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Surely not at all. Nay suppose his Hierarchical <hi>Bishop,</hi> set up in this Church, with his arrogated Power of Ordination and Censures, and that upon his <hi>Neglect of putting forth his Power, Paul</hi> had thus declared, that he had already judged the Necessity and Expediency of such Duties, will this prove that the Bishop was destitute of all this Authority antecedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to such Judging, or had none previous thereunto? The Surveyer could not say it, and no more could he assert it in this case. The Apostle saith, <hi>to whom you forgive any thing, I do also,</hi> which looks like the Apostles corresponding with the inherent Authority in these Officers, so that the Apostles Judging in this Case, was to prevent and obviat their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Delay, and quicken them to their Duty.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Surveyer,</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 213.) from that Passage, <hi>when you are mett toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my Spirit, and the Power of the Lord Iesus,</hi> inferrs, <hi>That something was to be done, beyond the Authority of the Church of</hi> Corinth, viz. <hi>Delivering of the Man to Satan to be tormented outwardly, which</hi> Paul <hi>only by his Miraculous Power, could effectuat. Ans.</hi> Suppose such an extraordinary <hi>Appendix,</hi> distinct from the Censure it self (which may be upon weighty grounds called in doubt) it doth no whit impeach the intrinsick, ordinary Authority of the Church Officers, in the inflicting of that Censure, though this Miraculous Effect, attending the same, were ascribeable to Apostolick Authority. Again, the Surveyer, in the <hi>Series</hi> of his Reasoning, shutting up both the Sentence in its self, and this Miraculous Appendant (which two, he must needs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish, unless he totally deny the Right of Excommunication in the Churches) within the Sphere of an Apostolick Prerogative, renders use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and casts a blot upon several Clauses of the Sacred Text; such as <hi>their Solemn Meeting together,</hi> here enjoyned, and that expresly, in order to <hi>the delivering of the Man to Satan,</hi> which doth include the intire Sentence and Punishment, and that <hi>this Punishment</hi> is expresly said to be <hi>inflicted by many,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58203:165"/>
viz. the <hi>Church Officers</hi> as distinct from the <hi>Church Members,</hi> for thus they are called in Opposition to the Collective Body. Besides, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in this Passage joyning first <hi>in their gathering together,</hi> and then menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning <hi>his Spiritual Confirming Presence,</hi> holds out that the first was <hi>an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative gathering together,</hi> the other <hi>a Confirming Approbation,</hi> for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in this Exercise of their intrinsick Power and Authority, as all Sound Interpreters take it. Again, the <hi>Separating</hi> here enjoyned, must be an <hi>Active, Iudicial Separating this Person from them</hi> (as the Leper and Unclean Person under the Law, was thus separat from the Congregation) which doth import an Authoritative Interest of Church Rulers, in putting forth this Censuring Act, whereas the Surveyer makes it a consequential withdrawing only from a Person already Censured.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in his third Answer, tells us, <hi>That though a Censuring Power were in these Church Officers, it can make nothing for us, unless we could prove they were single</hi> Presbyters, <hi>in the Modern Notion; There were Prophets here above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers, who might have this Power, and it is uncertain whether ordinary</hi> Presbyters <hi>were here settled. Ans.</hi> The Surveyer hath forgot that he hath acknowledged upon that Passage 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. That there were here such <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as will include the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and likewise Presbyters: Besides, that the Apostle diversifies the Ordinary and Extraordinary Gifts, <hi>v.</hi> 8.9.10. Likewise, he knew there were in <hi>Corinth</hi> many Instructers, and such as were settled in every Church, <hi>Act</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Compared with <hi>Ch.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Viz.</hi> Preaching Elders and Presbyters, so that he could not with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shadow of Reason, suppose they were all extraordinary Officers. And in a word, if he asserted, there were here mixed Officers, he not only made the Power and Authority of the extraordinary Officers, to swallow up that of the <hi>Pastors,</hi> but likewise he crossed his monopolizing this extraordinary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Apostle. Again, since he could not say the Apostle in these Injunctions, doth by <hi>distinctive notes</hi> or <hi>Apostrophees,</hi> diversify the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the Extraordinary Officers, in the point of this high Jurisdictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Act, he baffled and excluded his First Answer. And in a word, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Answer, a Jurisdictional Power and Authority in this Act, to a <hi>Collegiat Meeting of Church Officers,</hi> and asserting that it was joyntly thus put forth by them, he did thus bid farewell to <hi>my Lord</hi> Bishops singular prerogative in this Matter, and generally in Point of Government.</p>
               <p>His last Answer is, <hi>That if this Power were supposed in the ordinary Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of</hi> Corinth, <hi>they might have had this by delegation and Commission of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</hi> But where did the Surveyer read this Commission? What account can he give of such a delegated Power beyond the Essential Authority of <hi>Pastors,</hi> to <hi>deliver to Satan, purge out the old Leaven, to meet together</hi> for this great Jurisdictional Act? And why was the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> so fatally Cross
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58203:166"/>
to the <hi>Diocesan</hi> Prelat, as not to deliver this Commission to him? But we must know this Chimerical fancy stands upon the strong Pillar of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Surveyers <hi>may be,</hi> or <hi>might be,</hi> and this is all the proof we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. But what is the last shift and dead lift? We are told next, <hi>That this Instance of the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>is but one, which cannot make a Rule, without the sure knowledge of the Divine Direction, which the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He tells us, <hi>That though not mentioned under that Name, they are mentioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of Pastors and Teachers.</hi> But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he unjustly supposes that our Argument Concludes from that one place, so he deals as unjustly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully in lapping them up under the Name of <hi>Teachers,</hi> who so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themselves in that work, and marrs his design in making them Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Apostles, <hi>in the plenitude of their ordinary Power,</hi> as he doth, <hi>P.</hi> 194, 195. for thus they are to be included rather in the Name of Apostles, or else he must bring up Pastors and Teachers to the same Succession. The Surveyer could not exhibit different Degrees of the Apostolick or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistick Office, why then did he assign different Degrees of the Pastoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? This Consequence, the Surveyer calls <hi>weak, because a Governing Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority among Apostles and Evangelists, was partly impracticable, partly unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they seldom living in ordinary Societies, because of their Dispersion, for speedy spreading of the Gospel, and having infallible direction in their Ministry: Whereas Pastors living in Society, and fixed-upon their Charges, their Associations have need of some Governing Superiority among them, to be a Nerve and Sinnew of their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the Prudence of some may repress the Levity of others. Ans.</hi> This Reason is but the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of our <hi>Surveyers</hi> fancy: First as touching Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, we find them notwithstanding of the infallible conduct of the Spirit, joyning Counsel together, yea, and with concurrence of ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and a <hi>Moderator</hi> of the Meeting presiding, whom his Party will needs make us believe did preside as Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; so that this very Colledge of Apostles had the Superintendency of this <hi>Episcopal Nerve,</hi> in their Sense. And none can deny that persons managing one work, if far dispersed, have the greater need of a Corresponding head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58203:167"/>
in Scripture, and that their Union was a Presbyterial, Classical Union, and did not Coalesce into the Headship of a Hierarchical Prelat. Besides, the Surveyer is a niggardly Dispenser of Governing Prudence, when Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing it in one Prelat, and denying it to the rest of the Members of the Society of Pastors: Or, if he allow it to more than one Person, he plucks the Hierarchical Bishop from his Seat, and disownes the Concentring of this Authority in his Person. For what he adds <hi>of the Early Reception of this supposed Headship of the</hi> Hierarchical Prelat <hi>by the whole Church</hi>: His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Assertion is easily Answered by a well grounded Denyal. He is bold to say, there is nothing in Scripture against this Officer: But his palpable Perversion of the Scriptures pleaded against him, discovers there is more said against him, than he was able to Answer, and these Texts pleaded, appears the more forcible after all his faint Essays this way.</p>
               <p>He offers in the next place (P. 214.) a Reply to our Argument from <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. From which we argue, <hi>That there being here a Plurality in one and the same Church, who must need be Pastors and Officers therein: Therefore, the Scripture Bishop is not the Hierarchical Bishop, since the Apostle salutes these Pastors joyntly, as Officers of the Highest Rank, under this Notion of being Bishops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and without the least hint of a respect to any Superior Officer set over them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that no Inferior Officers are denominat by the Name proper to the Superior.</hi> In <hi>Answer</hi> to this, the Surveyer first <hi>takes notice, that in this Epistle only, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is by</hi> Paul <hi>to the Officers, as contradistinct from the Church, whereas in the rest of the Epistles, he includes them in the Organick Church, without express men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them. Ans.</hi> Not to stand upon this Variety in the Inscription of Epistles, wherein sometimes the Apostle Stile himself by his Authority, sometimes not, sometimes associats with himself, Officers of an Inferior Order, sometimes not. It is noticeable here, how this Man, in a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Contradiction to himself, doth quite baffle and run down his first large Answer to our Argument from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. which concludes the People only to be bespoken, because Officers are not Named: Whereas here he acknowledges, <hi>that except in this one Epistle, in the rest the Church Officers are included in the Organick Church, without the express mentioning of them.</hi> But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the Surveyer <hi>will needs, with</hi> Ambrose, <hi>have the Reason of the Difference to be, that they were not Bishops and Deacons of that Church, but present with</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Timothy <hi>at Writing of the Epistle, and assumed as Consenters with him; and this he makes paralel with</hi> Gal. 1. All the Brethren that are with me. He tells us, <hi>the Apostle calls them not Bishops and Deacons of</hi> Philippi, <hi>but absolutely Bishops and Deacons, and the Copulative</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

it appear, he is followed by any Interpreters) it is evident beyond all Contradiction, that the Apostles usual Method in the Inscription of all the Epistles is, First, To describe himself, either by his Office of Apostle, or otherwayes, as the Pen-man of the Epistle, together with Others (if any such be) whom he is pleased to Associat with him in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: And then in a Distinct Clause and Branch to Describe these, whether persons or Churches, to whom the Epistle is Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And we dare confidently Challenge such as embrace this Sense to exhibit a contrary Instance in any of the Epistles, or to shew where the persons supposed present with the Apostle, are in their Description cast behind his Character of himself, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Persons to whom he writes. Nay, this so evident, that the Surveyers own Instance <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. baffles his Answer: For, after <hi>Pauls</hi> Description of himself, as the Spirit of GODS Pen-Man, calling himself <hi>an Apostle, not of Men, neither by Man,</hi> &amp;c. He doth in the 2 <hi>v.</hi> add, <hi>and all that are with me</hi>; And next describes those to whom the Epistle is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, viz. <hi>Unto the Churches of</hi> Galatia. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> inverts the Order, and would make the Words run thus, Paul <hi>an Apostle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unto the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>and all the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. And that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. should thus run and be Sensed, Paul <hi>an Apostle unto the Churches of GOD at</hi> Corinth, <hi>and</hi> Sosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>our Brother,</hi> point blank cross to the Scope and Order of the Text. Thus also 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. Paul <hi>an Apostle of Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unto the Churches of GOD at</hi> Corinth, <hi>and</hi> Timothy <hi>our Brother.</hi> Thus the Sense of this place <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. is (with the <hi>Surveyer</hi>) Paul <hi>and</hi> Timotheus, <hi>the Servants of Iesus Christ, to the Saints in Christ Iesus at</hi> Philippi, <hi>with the Bishops and Deacons with</hi> Paul. What Sense, or rather Non-sense is this? He could assign no Instance of such a Trajection of the copulative <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as he here admitts, nor any Reason why <hi>Timothy</hi> is not ranked with these Bishops.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> P. 215. to strengthen one absurd Notion with another, doth in the <hi>second</hi> place alledge, <hi>That there was here a casual Muster of other Bishops of</hi> Macedonia <hi>gathered at</hi> Philippi <hi>the Metropolis thereof, to consult the good of the Churches; And</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Apostle speaks generally, as to the Saints at</hi> Philippi, Ch. 4.21. <hi>And not only of that Church, so of these Bishops and Deacons taken universally as mett there, though not of that particular Church.</hi> But this fantastical Muster-master of these Extraneous Officers, as he can give no shadow of Ground for this Matter of Fact, which is the <hi>Substratum</hi> of his Reason &amp; Answer; So he doth in asserting <hi>Philippi</hi> to be the Metropolis of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> either in a <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastick Sense,</hi> contradict the Judgement of several of the Learned. And as he still beggs the Question, in supposing the Existence of his <hi>Diocesan Prelat,</hi> so there is nothing in this Epistle, that might be supposed to have the least respect to the Ends of such a Meeting,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58203:168"/>
or can give Ground to extend the <hi>Bishops, Deacons,</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> beyond the Limits of that Church, unless such an Extension be applyed to other Churches, in the like case of Epistles addressed to them, as <hi>Ephesus, Rome, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, where there is in the Inscription of Epistles, such an express Extension in reference to the persons addressed, we find it in a distinct Clause; Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. after this general Inscription and Designation, viz. <hi>Unto the Church of GOD, which is at</hi> Corinth, there follows this Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>with all that in every place call upon the Name of Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. After the Direction to that particular Church which is at <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inth,</hi> follows this express Extension, <hi>with all the Saints that are in all</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in his <hi>third</hi> Answer, will admit the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> to be related to that particular Church: But tells us, <hi>This will not prove they were all Bishops of an equal Degree.</hi> It is good, that the <hi>Surveyer</hi> will at last admit these <hi>Bishops</hi> to be the settled <hi>Bishops</hi> here, and will take them off, and likewise the <hi>Deacons,</hi> whose work is only to serve Tables, from his alledged great and general Consults, anent the Case of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> But for what is here forged and pretended, we have told him, that the Scripture Bishops or Pastors are of equal Official Authority, and that he would here mind and take home his own Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no such <hi>Notes of Distinction,</hi> or <hi>Discriminating Characters,</hi> as he stands so much upon, in the Apostles Salutation. The Surveyer tells us, <hi>The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Name might be common to the Bishops, strictly so called, and the Inferior Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: As in a Letter directed to the Magistrats of a City, and terming them Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats in general, though one only is supposed a Provost, and others Bailiffs: Thus Saluting the Bishops</hi> in cumulo, <hi>he denyeth not their different Degrees. Ans.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the Surveyer is still renewing his <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> and supposing the Existence of his Hierarchical Prelat, he should have pondered the Rule <hi>Similitudo ad Pompam, &amp;c.</hi> A Similitude may illustrat a thing proposed or supposed, but cannot prove a thing in Question. Next, this Similitude overthrows his Scope: For, 1. There is not here a Naming of all <hi>in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulo,</hi> but under distinct Epithets of Bishops and Deacons, diversifying as he acknowledged, Church Officers of a distinct Character and Office. 2. He makes the Term <hi>Bishop,</hi> to be the Name distinguishing the Diocesan, as under that Character, from Presbyters, and who is supposed to be but one in one Church; Thus looking to his Similitude, he makes the Apostle speak as improperly, as if a Plurality of Provosts, or Provosts in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ural, were saluted in a Letter to one City. But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> P. 216. urges, <hi>That since we own two sorts of Elders, the Preaching and Ruling Elder, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them under the Name Bishop, we must owne it that there are diverse Ranks of Officers, saluted under that Name; Or if disowning this, it follows that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did not intend to write to such, tho supposed Church Officers. Ans.</hi> This <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58203:168"/>
is crocked, and pushes us not: If we say such Officers were not as yet existent in this Church, it only follows, that it was not yet fully consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in all its Officers: Or, if in the next place, we admit them existent, the Surveyer hath no Advantage: For, 1. We admit <hi>this Divinely institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Officer,</hi> as <hi>eminenter</hi> included in the Office of the Bishop or Pastor, both having the general Notion of <hi>Inspection</hi> applicable unto them; But the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchical Bishop is but a <hi>half Divinely appointed Officer,</hi> by his Confession. 2. The admitting of the Ruling Elder, impeaches not the equal Power of Pastors, here saluted in the Plural, but the admitting of the Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prelat overthrows this, and consequently the Apostles Scope. But the Surveyer tells us, <hi>he may, upon our ground, bring in the Superior and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Degrees of Bishops and Presbyters, under this general Name of Bishops. Ans.</hi> We can comprehend none under this Designation, who have not our Lords Institution, as all Inspectors and Governours of his House must, else they run unsent, and cannot be called his Stewards, not having a Commission from him. We include the Elder, as a Divinely instituted Officer, whose Divine Institution we make good, but do reject the Hierarchical Prelat, as an Officer of Mans devising: And the Surveyer might, under Pretence of this general Name, and upon such a Topick, advance <hi>Cardinals, Primats,</hi> or whom he pleased.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer,</hi> in the <hi>fourth</hi> place, will needs loose the Objection, that the Name of the Superior Officer is not given to the Inferior: To which he gives this Return, <hi>That the Name of the Superior Officer is given to the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, in respect of some common Dignity, Qualifications, or Accidents, competent to both; as the Name of</hi> Presbyter, <hi>both</hi> via ascensus <hi>and</hi> descensus <hi>is given to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and Inferior Officers, as</hi> Beza <hi>confesses on</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Surveyer here hath disguised the Strength and Nerves of this Objection. We know that Superior and Inferior Officers do come under general Names and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations: But our Assertion is this, That no Name of the Superior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which is the <hi>proper Characteristick of his Office,</hi> and whereby he is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Inferior, is attributed to such Inferior Officers, since this would Brangle the Scriptures Distinction thereof, and remove the March-Stones, which God hath set; So that his Instance of the common Name to Superior and Inferior Officers, upon the ground of common Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is impertinent to the Point: For no Names of this Nature and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, can be the proper distinguishing Names of the Superior from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, since this would infallibly infer a Confusion in the Holy Ghosts Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, such as cannot without Blasphemy be imputed to him. Thus the Name Apostle, in its proper Sense, or Evange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ist, is ascribed to no Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Officer. To apply this, the Name of Bishop, is in the Surveyers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, a distinguishing Character of an Officer superior to a Pastor or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58203:169"/>
and therefore the Absurdity of his Inference or paralel Reason, is palpably evident; this Name being by his own Confession, ascribed to ordinary Pastors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in the <hi>Fifth</hi> place, repeats again to us for Answer, this poor, hungry shift, which we have before refuted, <hi>viz: That granting there were none but mere</hi> Presbyters <hi>at that time, in that Church of</hi> Philippi, <hi>who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Bishops, <hi>yet upon what grounds shall the Constitution thereof be the Measure of all Churches, unless a Divine Rule for Managing the Government in that uniform man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner could be produced? Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> in Repeating this Subterfuge, which he made use of, to eschew our Argument drawn from the State of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> told us, that that <hi>Church, which is but one, ought not to be a Rule to others, and that one instance cannot make a Rule.</hi> Here it seems he he hath found <hi>another Instance,</hi> to make the Number two, yet this will not please him, unless a Divine Rule be produced, for managing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that manner. It is certain, that the Apostles practice, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Churches, in their Officers and Ordinances, pursuant to their great Masters Commission hereanent, and upon the necessary supposition of their Infallibility and Faithfulness, in managing this Trust, is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule and Divine Warrand to found our Perswasion and Faith in this Matter. This is so clear, that the <hi>Episcopalians</hi> must either acknowledge it, or baffle and overthrow their own Principles and Arguings for Prelacy: For I pray, how will they make their supposed Constitution of the Churches of <hi>Ephesus</hi> &amp; <hi>Crete,</hi> under the pretended Episcopal Inspection of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> a Standart and Measure for all Christian Churches, if this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Constitution therereof, be not admitted, as an infallible ground of this Argument? And if <hi>Presbyterians</hi> shall repone to their <hi>Episcopal</hi> Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that the Constitution of these Churches, cannot be a Standart for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, unless a <hi>Divine Rule be produced, for managing the Government in that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform manner,</hi> they are destitute of an Answer: So, that it appears the <hi>Surveyer</hi> behoved either in granting the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and of <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> to be thus governed, to yield the Cause to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a Divine Presbyterial Constitution of these Churches,</hi> or sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Episcopalians</hi> might have found that these Instances are exhibited by us as proofs and Demonstrations of the common Universal Rule. The Constitution of the other Apostolick Churches, after this manner, hath been exhibit and evinced, as by several others, so in special, by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Authors of the <hi>Ius Divin, Minist.

Eccles.</hi> from P. 292. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in special, the Surveyer and his Fellows might have found this made good, which he here pretended to seek a Proof of, <hi>Viz:</hi> That the Pattern of the said <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, is for a Rule to the Churches of Christ in all after Ages. Which is made good,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>First,</hi> From this, that the First Churches were immediatly Planted and Governed by Christs own Apostles and Disciples. The strength of this Reason is illustrated from several Grounds; As that 1. The Apostles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly received the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.21.23. 2. Had immediatly the promise of his perpetual presence in their Ministry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.19.20. The plentiful donation of the Spirit to lead into all Truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.14, 15. 3. They received immediatly Commands from Christ, after his Resurrection, and were instructed Forty days, in the Nature of his Kingdom. That they were first and immediatly Baptized of the Holy Ghost extraordinarly <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. to 5. So that whether we consider the Spirits infallible influence upon the Apostles in this great work of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Governing the Primitive Churches, or their performing Christs Commandments in this work, which he did impose upon them, touching his Kingdom, and consequently their infallibly Right use of the Keys of his Kingdom, which he Committed to them, it is evident beyond all contradiction, that the Pattern of their Practices herein, must be a Rule for all the succeeding Churches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is made good from the end proposed by the Holy Ghost in the careful Records of the Apostolical Churches State and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which must needs be in order to succeeding Churches imitation, since this Record, as the other Scriptures, must needs be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>for our Learning or Instruction</hi>; which Instruction must Relate, not merely to the <hi>Factum,</hi> but mainly to the <hi>Ius, viz</hi>: the Reasons and grounds of this Apostolical Government, this being the most proper and profitable Instruction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That, if in the Point of Government, such Apostolick Patterns will not amount to an obligatory Rule, we will impeach the Authority of other Acts of Religion, received from them, and bottomed only and Chiefly upon the Foundation of the Practice of Christs Apostles, and Apostolical Churches, such as the Reciving of the Lords Supper on the Lords days, &amp;c.</q>
See <hi>Ius Divin. Minis. Eccles.</hi> P. 213, 214. Nay, this is so evident, that the <hi>Surveyer</hi> without contradicting himself, cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Rule; For <hi>P.</hi> 195, he will needs have the determination of this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58203:170"/>
Question to depend upon the Historical <hi>Narrations of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles contained in Scripture,</hi> and the surest Light History can afford in the Churches most Virgin times. Now, here is exhibit Historical Accounts and Narrations of the Churches pure and Primitive pure Constitution in its first and most Virgin times, why then did he (in Contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) call for another Rule?</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Surveyer,</hi> P. 216.217. presents yet another evasion, <hi>That this Church might have had a Bishop,</hi> Eminenter, <hi>so called, though not present at</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi; <hi>That we cannot otherwise account of</hi> Epaphroditus, <hi>who is called</hi> their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, Philip. 2.25. <hi>or Messenger, as the Angels</hi> Rev. 2. and 3. <hi>are called the Angels of the Churches; and not for any Temporal Imployment of being sent with their Alms, it being too high a Stile to give Men upon so low an Account: Thus</hi> 2 Cor. 8.23. <hi>We read of the Messengers of the Churches, and the Glory of Christ. Ans.</hi> We have above removed the Foundation of this exception, both in Reference to <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and the <hi>Asian</hi> Angels. That <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> gets the Name of their Apostle and Messenger Catachrestice and improperly, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he was no such Bishop, as the Surveyer pretends, is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in the Sacred Text, since he is thus termed, with respect to that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Employment of carrying the Churches Benevolence to <hi>Paul.</hi> For the Apostle, after he hath called him their Messenger, doth expresly adjoyn this ground of the Epithet and Denomination, <hi>viz. He that Ministred to my Wants,</hi> which doth clearly restrict and explain the Term [<hi>Messenger</hi>] in this Context. Besides, that <hi>v.</hi> 30. he is said to come to supply their Lack of Service towards the Apostle; and the Apostle mentioning him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.18. tells this Church, <hi>That he received from</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>the things that were sent by them</hi>: As for the Surveyers Exception, <hi>That this was too high a Stile to be given upon so low an Account, comparing this with</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. I have above told such Pleaders, that the Service of the Churches, and the Interest of Christ in them, is such a Honourable Employment, as the most eminent need not be ashamed of, since he who is Lord of all, came not to be Ministred unto, but to Minister; and the Holy Angels, literally so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, think it no Disparagement to their High Estate and Dignity, to be sent forth as Messengers, to Minister and do Service to the meanest, who are Heirs of Salvation. For that Passage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. we have made appear, that it rather Confirms, than Impugns our Answer and Exposition of this Scripture anent <hi>Epaphroditus</hi>: The Apostles Scope in that place, being evidently to stir up the Church to a large Expression of their Charity and Bounty, upon the Account of the Fidelity and Worth of the Messengers sent to them for that end. Next, I might tell this Surveyer, that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> and these other Messengers, being restrictedly called <hi>Messengers of the Churches,</hi> and with a special respect to the Employment specified in the Text, are thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58203:170"/>
from the Apostles, who properly are <hi>Christs Messengers to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; And therefore, Persons under this Character of <hi>Messengers from Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to Churches,</hi> have not that special proper Signature, which the Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleads for, upon the account of the general Name, <hi>Messenger,</hi> applyed to them. In a word, in this Conjecture, as the Surveyer presents but a new <hi>Petitio Principii</hi> and groundless Fancy, without the least shadow of Proof, so, its baffled by his own Principle, who thinks it below his suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed great Men to be sent upon a Temporary Employment. Now, it is certain that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was sent with this Churches Benevolence to <hi>Paul,</hi> and it would have puzzled this Surveyer to Ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er the <hi>Querie: Why none else, but the sole and eminent Bishop was sent with this Benevolence</hi>? As likeways, to Answer further these <hi>Queries,</hi> First, Why the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> put the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name and Characteristick of this <hi>sole and eminent Bishop,</hi> upon all the Pastors of the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi>? Which, upon his Principles, did draw with it great Inconveniences; as tending 1. To cast a Cloud of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon these Pastors, in reference to a Person, to whom they did owe important Duties. 2. This might tend to involve them in the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sinful Emulous Disposition and Breach among themselves: And no body will judge, that the Apostle was not careful to prevent this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this could not consist with that high Esteem of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> which the Apostle here expresses, thus to deal with him, and in special, to make him the Messenger of such Derogatory Expressions, in this Epistle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is so much commended. Thus we have seen, that the Evidence of this Scripture, as likewise of the preceeding, doth quite dispel the Mist of the Surveyers fond Exceptions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> tells us, <hi>He finds one Scripture more, wherein, because</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie <hi>is Named, we account we have great Advantage for our Way</hi>; The Passage is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whereas, he may more justly triumph in the word</hi> Bishop, <hi>so often mentioned in Scripture.</hi> He professeth his Resolution <hi>pressely to consider this place</hi>: And his Replyes shall be pressely consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His first <hi>Reply</hi> is, <hi>That we cannot prove that by Presbytrie here is meant a Colledge of single Presbyters, in the Modern Notion, and not rather the Dignity and Office of a Presbyter, as</hi> Calvin (Institut. Lib. 4. Cap. 3.) Jerom, <hi>and others also do judge. Ans.</hi> 1. Not to stand upon the <hi>Surveyers</hi> cutting off by this Gloss, <hi>Presbyters</hi> from so much as a consent to <hi>Timothies</hi> Ordination, which in contradiction to himself here, he doth in his other Replyes to this Text, allow them. It is in this place very considerable that this Word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> being used only thrice in the New Testament, viz. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.66. and <hi>Act.</hi> 22.5. and in this Passage under Debate; Since in the two first places, it must necessarly be taken, for a <hi>Concessus Presbyter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, a Colledge of Elders</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> this <hi>Surveyer</hi> could offer no shadow of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58203:171"/>
Reason or Evidence for the altering the Signification in this Passage; Since 1. The Scope and Circumstances do clearly lead to this its ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acceptation. And 2. There can no such Exposition be offered here, without a very gross Imputation upon the Language and Sense of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost; It differing little from Non-sense, if at all reconcilable to Sense, thus to read the Text, <hi>Neglect not the Gift given thee &amp;c. by the laying on of the Hands of the Office</hi>: For what Hands hath an Office to lay on? Not only Reason, but the very Ear disrelishes such a Sense: Especally, if the Matter of Fact be admitted (in opposition to which, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> could give no Evidence) that as there was Ruling Officers or <hi>Presbyters</hi> then existent, so they did <hi>de facto,</hi> lay Hands upon <hi>Timothy.</hi> For <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgement, we find that in his <hi>Commentary</hi> upon the place, he asserts that such as understand the Word <hi>Presbytrie</hi> here, in a collective Sense, and to import the <hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>Presbyters, do, in his Iudgement, put a right Sense upon the Words</hi>; So that he cannot be reckoned as holding the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Gloss<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And however, we do not judge that most worthy Person (as neither <hi>Ierom</hi> in this point, Inferior to <hi>Greek Fathers</hi>) infallible, or our selves obliged <hi>jurare in ejus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</hi> As for the Authors after cited, as understanding the Term in his Sense; It is one thing to say that the Term <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> have been indifferently used by <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, for the Office and Order of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; it is a far other thing to say, that the Scripture Term in these three Passages, is so to be understood; Since here the signification of the Word is to be drawn from the Scope and Contexture of the place of Scripture where it is, which must needs Over-rule and Determin the Signification in this Passage, though it were granted that sometimes <hi>Greek</hi> Authors did use it in another Signification. The Language of the Holy Ghost in these three Passages, as it doth certainly Over-rule all other <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, so the Term in the three Passages exhibited, doth palpably appear to be of one and the same Signification, <hi>viz.</hi> pointing at a <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders.</hi> Besides, that there want not Ecclesiastick and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors thus understanding it; Such as <hi>Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact.</hi> For what the <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds out of <hi>Bilson,</hi> P. 77. <hi>That ordinarly in Ancient</hi> Greek Councils <gap reason="foreign">

And the other Paralels <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.66. and <hi>Act.</hi> 22.5. he expones of the Meeting of Elders. <hi>Scapula</hi> expones the Word in this Passage, <hi>Caetus Presbyterorum, Presbyterium,</hi> a Presbytrie or Colledge and Meeting of Presbyters. The Passage of <hi>Euseb. Lib.</hi> 6. C. 8. may be taken without any Violence offered to the Words, to import the Colledge of Presbyters, and in <hi>Camero</hi>'s Judgement <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. In a word, it is enough to baffle this Exception, that as this Term in <hi>Greek</hi> and Ecclesiastick Authors, is ordinarly thus taken, for which frequent Instances might be given, so it is certain, and enough for us, that it's alwayes taken in a Collegiat Sense, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the New Testament. And in the Paralels mentioned, it were gross Non-sense to take the Word in the <hi>Surveyers</hi> Sense, and to say that the Office of Elders did meet together, and the Office of Elders did bear Witness to <hi>Paul,</hi> so it carrieth the same Incongruity and absurd Sense with it, to assert <hi>that the Office laid Hands upon</hi> Timothy. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts against our Argument drawn from the Paralels, <hi>That therein the word imports not a Meeting of Christian Presbyters, but only of</hi> Jewish <hi>Elders, persecuting Christ and His Apostles: That though the Term were taken in this Sense only in this place, there wants not Paralel Instances of such an acceptation of words; As the word</hi> [Church] <hi>is taken but once</hi> Matth. 18.17. <hi>for a Representative Church, so the</hi> 1 Cor. 11.10. <hi>the word</hi> [Power] <hi>in that place of Scripture only signifies the Covering and Vail upon the Womans head, as a token of Subjection to her Husband: And that it is enough in such Cases, that the Strain of the Context requires a Varrying from the Acceptation of the word in other places. Ans.</hi> The Strength of our Argument is drawn, both from the ordinary Acceptation of the Word, which hath its own secondary weight, and likewise, and mainly from this, that the Scope and Contexture of this Passage, do clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead for the Acceptation of the Word in the ordinary Sense, and not to varry from it. And therefore his Assertion, <hi>That the Strain of the Context re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a varrying from this ordinary acceptation in this place,</hi> is but his bold begging of the <hi>Question</hi>; For of this, he neither offers, nor can offer any <hi>solid proof</hi>: Nay, the contrary, is the consentient Judgement of Interpreters.
<q>The Imposition of Hands here signifies Consent and Election, whereof it was a Sign, saith <hi>Vatabulus.</hi> The whole is signified by a part, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, saith <hi>Estius,</hi> To wit, of the whole Ceremony of the Presbytries Ordination.</q>
Prayer was added with Imposition of Hands, saith <hi>Grotius.</hi> I hope he will not say the Office prayed. <hi>Camero</hi> censures the contrary Exposition, upon several Grounds. 1.
<q>Because the Imposing of the hands of the Office, is a harsh saying, and sounds improperly. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

Because <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>'s Authority was greater, than that it could be called a <hi>Presbyter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.

                     <hi>unus fuit ex Presbyterio, vel Presbyterii nomine imposuit</hi>; Because <hi>Paul</hi> was one of that <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> or impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands in their Name; Where it is evident he understands the <hi>Prebytrie</hi> in a collegiat sense, for a <hi>Meeting of Pastors.</hi>

                  <hi>Piscator</hi> upon the place, shews,
<q>That <hi>Timothy</hi> is stirred up to diligence, first upon the account of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vocation to this Function, by the Revelation of the Holy Ghost: And next, by the vocation of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obeying this Command of the Holy Ghost, <hi>in imposing the Hands of the Presbytrie upon him,</hi> because the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> by this Rite <hi>ordained the Ministers of the Church.

               <p>But now to proceed (after this little digression with Interpreters) to our <hi>Surveyers</hi> Instances and Exceptions taken from the Terms in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>We Answer,</hi> that the exception is palpably absurd; For he could not deny that these terms [<hi>Church</hi>] and [<hi>Power</hi>] are Ordinarly taken in Scripture in another Sense, than in these Passages, though the circumstances of these Scriptures plead for varrying from that Acceptation: But he neither did, nor could make it appear, that this Term <hi>Presbytrie</hi> under debate, is ever in Scripture taken in this Acceptation, nor could he deny, that it is taken in our Sense elsewhere; So that his Exception touches not the Point: And as much ridiculous, if not more, is that other Exception which he offers to the paralel Passages, <hi>viz. That Rulers therein signifies Civil Rulers, and Rulers who were Enemies to Christ</hi>: For, whatever were the Moral Qualities of the Rulers, if the Word signifies a <hi>Collegiat Meeting of Rulers,</hi> it is enough to our purpose, and evinceth our Argument from the paralels, to be good and valid, unless he could evince a contrary Acceptation, which he doth not so much as essay. He could not deny, that <hi>the Legal Constitution</hi> of one Assembly or Parliament, is a far and distinct thing from <hi>the Qualities of the Members,</hi> who consequently come truely under these Denominations upon the ground of a Legal Constitution. And supposing our Sense of the Word Presbytrie, and the Matter of Fact to be such as we assert, he could not, without making himself most ridiculous, infer from these Paralels, that the Members Constituent of this Presbytrie, were either <hi>Civil Rulers,</hi> or bad.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer,</hi> (P. 217, 218.) is bold to call this our Exception against his Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Office hath no Hands to impose, <hi>a ridiculous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection flowing from a Mistake of the Meaning of the Text, which attributes not the imposed Hands to the Presbytrie, as to an Agent or Efficient, but only limits and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines that Imposition of Hands which</hi> Timothy <hi>had from the Apostle, or other high Officers of the Church, to the particular use and end for which Hands were imposed on him,</hi> viz. <hi>the giving him a Power of a Presbyter or Elder. Ans.</hi> Here is a strange Exposition, obscuring rather than clearing the Text. Had the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle no other way of expressing the end of the Ordination, and its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than by telling him of <hi>Hands of the Office laid upon him,</hi> which in all common Sense, doth relate to an Agent or Instrument, and not to the Limitation and Use of his Office? A Man may thus fasten the most Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58203:173"/>
Senses upon Scripture. Besides, he holds that there were eminent high Officers with <hi>Paul,</hi> and concurring with this Imposition of Hands upon <hi>Timothy</hi>: Why then will he strike off their Hands from being here meaned, when Imposition of Hands is so expresly mentioned? The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer thus further Senseth the Words, Neglect not the Gift given thee by the Laying on of Hands, <hi>not Confirmatory, not Reconciliatory, but Imposition of Hands Ordinatory, whereby thou was ordained, or made a Presbyter. Ans.</hi> Besides, that this Division of Imposition of Hands, is as odd, as his Sense of the Text, it is strange, that he admits of Imposition of Hands upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this end of making him a Minister, and yet denyeth the Presbytrie here to import a <hi>Collegiat Meeting,</hi> thus imposing. He holds that the Sense is, <hi>Neglect not the Gift given by the Laying on of the Hands, whereby thou was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Now, pray, what hinders these Hands to be the Hands of the <hi>Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Meeting</hi> imposing the same? Whereby the Sense is ours, or otherwise, in Contradiction to himself, he makes the <hi>Office</hi> the <hi>Ordaining Agent.</hi> If he acknowledge this place paralel with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. he cannot but see a like Construction in both, of the Term of <hi>Hands,</hi> with the <hi>Genitive.</hi> Nor can he deny that the Imposition of Hands is ever constructed with the Office in other Paralels, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6. and 13.3. He calls our Reason against his Gloss <hi>ridiculous,</hi> but whether his Return be not <hi>more ridiculous,</hi> is left to the Reader to judge.</p>
               <p>We are told for his <hi>next</hi> Answer, <hi>That were a Presbytrie here admitted, there is nothing in the Context to evince that it was a Classical Presbytrie, to which only we ascribe Ordination, and not a Congregational or Paroch Presbytrie. Ans.</hi> Here again, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> is driven to seek shelter among the <hi>Independents,</hi> but is ruined in this Shift; For, upon his Supposition, that a Congregation, or one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor with Unpreaching Elders, is the Subject of an Ordaining Power, the <hi>Prelatical</hi> as well as the <hi>Presbyterian Ordination,</hi> is overthrown. The places above referred to, and hinted at, do abundantly clear and evince the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution of <hi>Classical Presbytries,</hi> and Collegiat Meetings of Pastors of several Congregations, in order to a Ministerial Rule and Jurisdictional Authority over the same, and consequently, that they are the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Ordaining Power. The <hi>Treatise</hi> above mentioned, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. besides several others, have abundantly evinced this Point, that the Fraternity or Community of the Faithful, and consequently of the particular single Congregation, cannot be the proper Subject of the Jurisdictional Power, nor the Power of Order; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Surveyer did but ridicule the Scriptures, or rather expose himself, while pretending to impugn the Presbyterians, and answer their Scripture Reasonings, for he comes on with his <hi>may be</hi> this, and <hi>may be</hi> the other Sense; the one sense [<hi>may be</hi>]
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58203:173"/>
striking out and Contradicting the other, whereas, in the Judgement of all who own the Truth and the Authority of the Scriptures, the true sense is but one, since otherwise there can be no Truth, where there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and various Senses. In his first Answer, he will needs have <hi>High Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church</hi> (as he calls them) to concur with the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in Imposing Hands upon <hi>Timothy</hi>; these <hi>High Officers,</hi> he no doubt advances far above the Sphere of Presbyters and Pastors, and puts them in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his <hi>Magnates</hi> or Hierarchical <hi>Bishops</hi>; yet in this second Answer, he will needs (in a palpable Contradiction to the First) croud in all these <hi>High Officers</hi> into <hi>one Congregation</hi>; yea, and positively asserts, <hi>that there is no evidence in the Text to prove that this Presbytrie was any other than a Paroch-Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie; and that it will trouble the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>to prove the contrary</hi>: But would it not much more have troubled this Fantastical Dictator, with his <hi>Linsey-Woolsey,</hi> party coloured Senses and <hi>Comments,</hi> to prove that these <hi>High Officers,</hi> near to the <hi>Apostolick Character,</hi> were all related to <hi>one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and but a Meeting of a <hi>Paroch Presbytrie,</hi> as he speaks.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Third</hi> answer is taken from collating this Passage with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. where <hi>Paul</hi> enjoins <hi>Timothy</hi> to stir up the Gift that is in him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of my Hands,</hi> as here 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. He saith, <hi>Grace was given thee <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytrie. The former place import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Authority in the Action, and the latter the concern and consent of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Presbyters with him: So that granting a Presbytrie present, there is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining power can be hence inferred. Ans.</hi> We have already made appear, that these places Collated, do clearly evince a <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Authority in the Point of Ordination, and that since the imposing of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands in order to the Gifts, is clearly distinguished from the imposing of the Hands of the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> which must needs respect his Ordination, and consequently their Authoritative influence thereupon, these Texts collated, do confirm this Point; and further do thus give light unto it, that supposing that the Imposition of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, and the Hands of the <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> were contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Cause is the more strengthened, in that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of an Apostles Hands, did not swallow up, nor exclude the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytries Authoritative imposition: So that this Authority may be much more now supposed competent to them, when the Office of Apostle is gone. I must here again Reflect upon it, that this our <hi>vertumnous</hi> Expositor, who will needs have in his First Answer, several <hi>High Officers</hi> to concurr with <hi>Paul,</hi> in this Imposition of Hands, makes <hi>Timothy</hi> thereby to receive a <hi>Presbyterate</hi> only: And I pray what needs such High Officers to concur with <hi>Paul,</hi> in order to this end? But in this Answer, we find ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> concurring in the Ordination of this his supposed <hi>Presbyter</hi>; for the Surveyer in collating these Texts, insinuats no Officers of a higher Order,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58203:174"/>
to have been present, except the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>: And indeed the Passages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do only point at the Presbytrie and the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> Here also, <hi>Presbyters</hi> are found laying hands upon our <hi>Surveyer</hi> and his Fellows sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> set over the Church of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, he acknowledges that the mention of imposing of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. with the emphatick <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>by,</hi> respects <hi>the Gift of GOD in him,</hi> wherein he seems to distinguish the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the <hi>Authority</hi> and the <hi>Gift,</hi> yet expones this precisely <hi>of Pauls Authority in his Ordination,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of that of the Presbytrie: But so it is, that the imposing of Hands, in order to Gifts of the Spirit, he must needs acknowledge to be of it self distinct from such an Imposition of Hands, as is in order to Ordination: Yea, even some of his own party acknowledge, that Hands were twice laid upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> and once by the Presbytrie alone. Besides, that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. we find him very confusedly and inconsideratly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning thus, <hi>Viz. The Grace given him with (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) the laying on of the hands of the Presbytrie</hi>: Whereas the Text runs thus, <hi>neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophesie, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytrie</hi>; where it is evident, the Gift given, and the Prophesie, are in two distinct Clauses, and <hi>the laying on of Hands of the Presbytrie,</hi> is in the third and last, and diversified by a distinct Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> both from the Gift, and from the <hi>Prophesie</hi>: So that it is apparent, that this <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Gift,</hi> hath a special Respect to the <hi>Prophesie,</hi> but <hi>the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytrie,</hi> is here set down in a distinct Clause, as a distinct Priviledge from the other two, and therefore, must either import their Authoritative action, or doth here signifie nothing; especially, since (as is said) the variation of the phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>with,</hi> doth here import so much, and diversifie the one from the other. Which baffles his Sense and Exposition, that makes the imposing of the Presbytries hands to import no more but a Consent or Concurrence; The folly of which Exposition is further evidenced in that. 1. This solemn Action of Imposing Hands, being in the Scripture Accounts and Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a badge of <hi>Authoritative Blessing,</hi> must neeeds import much more, than a bare Consent or Concurrence, for he will not dare to say, that all those whose Hearts do concur in praying for the Blessing, had right to impose hands upon the Ordained. 2. He tells us in the beginning of his Answer, <hi>that the Presbytrie imposed not hands alone without a Higher Officer joyned with them in the Act.</hi> Now, I pray, what was this Act, if not of <hi>Ordination</hi>? Now, if the Presbytrie had an Authoritative Concurrence in the Act, or rather an influence thereupon, as their Act, how can he say they did only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the thing? For, upon this ground of a naked consent, he could not say that <hi>Paul</hi> was joined with him in the Act, which imports their <hi>joint Authoritative Concurrence</hi> (if this phrase have any Sense) and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58203:174"/>
of this, according to his exposition, in the latter part of his Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the Action was <hi>Pauls</hi> alone, and not theirs; and he Confines the Authority of the Action, within the compass of the Apostles Imposition solely. I only add, if the Actions were supposed diverse, as severals do hold, the Surveyer hath no Shield nor Buckler against such a Weapon, which notwithstanding quite baffles this his Answer, if admitted.</p>
               <p>His <hi>fourth</hi> Answer is, <hi>That since the Name of Presbyter or Elder, even in</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's <hi>Sense on</hi> 1 Pet. 5. <hi>comprehends in general, all who have any Ecclesiastick Function, the Officers here might be of a higher sort than single Presbyters, even ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Term</hi> Presbytrie, <hi>to import a Collegiat Meeting. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> is still here repeating his groundless Conjectures, and beggings of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, for an Answer, yea, and confuting and baffling himself in these his fantastick Quiblings; For, besides that the existence of ordinary Officers, Superior to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and cloathed with Episcopal Authority, is still begged by him, in several other Respects, this his Conjecture is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and repugnant to the Text: For neither, first, can he make appear that such a Meeting of such Officers of a higher Order than single <hi>Presbyters,</hi> comes under the Scripture Denomination of a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> in any Passages of Holy Write, or that when Officers of a higher Order, mett with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> they had no distinct Specification by their Titles or Names; As when the Apostles mett with the Elders <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and Prophets and Teachers mett together <hi>Act.</hi> 13. we find distinguishing Epithets and Names given to these Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> As this conjecturing <hi>Surveyer,</hi> could give no account, whether this Meeting was solely of extraordinary Officers, or a Meeting mixed of Ordinary and Extraordinary, whether of his supposed <hi>Bishops,</hi> with these Extraordinary Officers, or not; So, whatever Answer he might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, he is still in the Briars, and overthrows his own Scope; For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that he cannot give account, why a Colledge of Prelats is called a <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> or to what end such a mixed Meeting can be here supposed: If his Conjecture be admitted, they could be no <hi>Paroch Presbytrie</hi>; And thus his second Answer is baffled, which supposeth this. Again, if there were in this Meeting higher Officers than <hi>Presbyters,</hi> he would needs grant that the ordaining Authority was not monopolized in one: And thus 1. He affronts and excludes all his former Pleadings for the sole Authority of the Prelatical <hi>Bishop</hi> in Ordination. 2. He asserts that all here imposing Hands, did <hi>Authoritatively Concur,</hi> and therefore none of them were mere Consenters (as he alledges this <hi>Presbytrie</hi> was) and this universally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exception of any one of the Number; And the Authority of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not solely <hi>Pauls</hi>: And thus again, he hath given a deadly wound to his third Answer, asserting so much. In a word, if all were <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58203:175"/>
Officers,</hi> the sole Authority of the <hi>Prelat</hi> in Ordination (a supposed ordinary Officer) is no way concluded, nor that of a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If they were all ordinary Officers, this <hi>Ioynt Authoritative Concurrence,</hi> cutts the throat of the <hi>Prelats</hi> arrogated <hi>sole Interest</hi> in Ordination: If mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers of a Superior and Inferior Order, this <hi>Surveyer</hi> could give no shadow of a Reason wherefore the <hi>Pastors</hi> did not Authoritatively concurr. I need not mention the common Maxim, pleaded by some of his Party, in a like Case, <hi>Actiones sunt suppositorum,</hi> the Authoritative Act is ascribed to the whole Collegiat Meeting or <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> without the least shadow of a Distinction of the Interest and Authority of one Member from another, and he hath before told us, that <hi>non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> adds, <hi>If he was ordained a Bishop, as some of the most Learned Commentators of the</hi> Ancients <hi>do think, as</hi> Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact <hi>and</hi> Oecumenius, <hi>That Presbytrie might be a Meeting of Bishops, concurring according to their Mind in that work with the Apostle</hi> Paul. <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Surveyer</hi> striving against the Light of this Scripture, is still more and more involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Briars. Before, he would needs have <hi>Timothy</hi> to receive but the Office of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> in this Ordination, and thus he expresly paraphraseth the Text, <hi>Neglect not the Gift which is given thee by the laying on of Hands, whereby thou was ordained or made a Presbyter</hi>: This he seteth down in distinct Characters, as the Genuin Sense of the Text: Now, here he quits this post, and will admit that he was ordained a <hi>Bishop</hi>; For he Ownes and Defends the Sense of the Authors cited to this Scope, so that we know not where to find this <hi>Proteus,</hi> in these his inconsistent Answers. Again, if <hi>Bishops</hi> here concurred in this Ordination of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> he wil grant that they all Authoritatively concurred, and were not mere Consenters in the Action: And thus again farewel his third Answer, which monopolized this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the person of <hi>Paul,</hi> or else he must say that all these <hi>Bishops</hi> were Apostles. Again, if not Apostles, but ordinary Officers, then sure, <hi>Paul</hi> put forth no Extraordinary Authority in this Case, but acted as an ordinary Bishop; and then it would puzzle this <hi>Surveyer</hi> to shew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle imputs this Ordination to the <hi>Laying on of his Hands solelie,</hi> or why upon our true Supposition (which he cannot disprove) <hi>viz.</hi> That the persons concurring were <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the presence of <hi>Paul,</hi> or the laying on of his Hands, did swallow up or exclude their Authority, rather than that of a supposed <hi>Bishops,</hi> in this Matter. As for the Authors mentioned, it is above made appear, that they spoke of Scripture Church Officers, according to the Practice and Style of their own Times. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> calls this <hi>a foul Imputation, as if they did wrest the Scriptures, to colour the Practice of their own times. Ans.</hi> Here again the <hi>Surveyer</hi> is put upon this pitiful <hi>Dilemma,</hi> viz. either he must disowne the <hi>Comment</hi> of these <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58203:175"/>
and yeeld to the Strength of this Objection (which truely makes the best Apology for this Exposition) or else he must acknowledge that his preceeding Answers puts him under this foul Imputation of palpable wresting the Holy Scriptures, to patronize the Antiscriptural Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> and imputs the same to these Fathers; For it is evident to any that reads his Answers, that these Fathers Sense of this Text, and his forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Answers, are <hi>Antipods,</hi> yea and cross and destroy one another. The Sense and Comments of these Fathers, which he is so Zealous in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes <hi>Timothy</hi> to have received an <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> in his Ordination: His first Answer makes him to be ordained only a <hi>Presbyter</hi>: His third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer makes the Authority of Ordaining to be only the Apostle <hi>Pauls,</hi> and the rest of the Meeting to be but <hi>Consenters</hi>: The Comment of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, makes them all to concurr with Official Authority; For such, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that of Diocesan <hi>Bishops,</hi> is held to be: The Comment of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers makes the Members of the Meeting such <hi>Bishops,</hi> as had every one of them Authority over a <hi>Diocess,</hi> and consequently over many <hi>Congregations</hi>: His first Answer makes them all <hi>Congregational Elders,</hi> and crouds them within the small Circuits of one Paroch. Now, this <hi>Surveyer</hi> might, or any of his way, may still call in <hi>Vulcans</hi> Gymmerers to sodder these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions with themselves, and with the Fathers Comments, if they can. That the Expressions of the Fathers touching Scripture Church Officers, were of that Mould, as is said, hath been made good by several of the Learned, and is in this convincingly apparent, in that they put the Names of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi> or <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> upon <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> We need not here again remind what is above made good touching <hi>Ambrose</hi> Assertion upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Non per omnia conveniunt,</hi> &amp;c. That the Practice of the Church then (he is speaking in point of Church Government) did not sute in every thing the Writings of the Apostles. And that of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Hom.</hi> 11. <hi>That betwixt the Office of Bishop and Presbyter, there is almost no difference.</hi> As for his Charge of <hi>our wresting the Scriptures to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize Human Devices</hi>; We let it pass among the rest of this Mans lying Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, it being evident to the candid Searchers of the Word, and into this Controversy, whether this person and his Associats, in their Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> be the Perverters and Wresters of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> P. 219. further adds, <hi>That if the Ordination of</hi> Timothy <hi>to be an Evangelist, be spoken of here, under the Name of Presbytrie, may well be comprehended a Mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing of Apostles or Evangelists, or Apostolical Men, seeing the conjugated word</hi> Presbytrie, <hi>may be of as great a Latitude and Signification as to a Meeting, as</hi> Presbyter <hi>is to a Person. Ans.</hi> Here is a new flight of our Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers fancy, <hi>Timothy</hi> now stepping up to be an Evangelist, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers Apostles or Evangelists, or Apostolical-Men: But sure, if they be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58203:176"/>
either of the first two, as he supposeth, <hi>Paul</hi> is put out of his Office of a <hi>Sole Ordainer</hi> here; Yea, and in his Sense, if any of the three be admitted, the Scripture Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he pleaded as importing <hi>Pauls</hi> single Authority in this Action, is expunged, that room may be made for other Apostles and Evangelists. This <hi>Surveyer</hi> would be hard put to it to prove that the Ordination of an Evangelist, necessarly required such a compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meeting: But as in the rest of his Comments and Replyes, so in this, we must take his word for proof, as if his new Prelatical Office (if such it was indeed, as some have supposed) had derived an Infallibility into his Magisterial Dictats. As for his Latitudinarian Extensions of the word <hi>Presbytrie,</hi> besides, that he hath exhibit no Scripture Instance to prove such an Extension, or evince that the word is ever taken in such a Sense, he still beggs the Question in its Application to this Passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> We are still in the dark, what he means by <hi>Apostolick Men:</hi> If he intend his Hierarchical <hi>Prelat,</hi> here is a new begging of the Question, and though the word <hi>Presbytrie</hi> might reach the comprehending of the higher Officers to the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who have the Scripture Stamp and Signature, it is a stretching of the Term upon Tenter Pins till it crack, to make it reach to an Officer of a Human Invention, or a <hi>half Human Mould,</hi> as he makes the <hi>Bishops.</hi> It would have also puzzled this <hi>Surveyer,</hi> or these of his mind, upon the supposition that <hi>Timothy</hi> was here ordained an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, to reconcile this with what he and they do plead from <hi>Pauls</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in the first Epistle to him, for his Instalment in his <hi>Episcopal Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> over the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein he is commanded <hi>to do the Work of an Evangelist</hi>; For they must either here degrade him from this Function, upon their Supposition of his <hi>Episcopal</hi> Instalment, or if they make his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalment here <hi>Evangelistick,</hi> they make him to have been twice instaled in that Function.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Surveyer,</hi> now P. 219. tells his Reader, <hi>He hath presented the Summ of the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Strength in these Passages, and given fair and just Interpretations of these Scriptures, which they plead.</hi> Whereas he hath presented rather a <hi>Farrago</hi> of his own fantas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Quiblings, and contradictory Notions and Conceits, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of true Interpretations of these places: And it is apparent that after all this Mans faint Essays, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Bow abids in its Strength.

               <p>The <hi>one</hi> is, <hi>That the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>disown Episcopacy as a Human invention, as a new Office, never appointed by Christ, and consequently to be expelled his House</hi>: In Answer to this, the <hi>Surveyer</hi> having acknowledged, <hi>that there are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inventions which proceed from Mens pleasures, as</hi> Matth. 15.9. adds, <hi>that there are results of sanctified Reason, subservient to the orderly performance of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and to the Ruling of his House, with respect to the general Rules of the Word</hi>; Wherein as before, he still beggs the Question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in supposing Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be one of <hi>these variable Circumstances determinable by Human Prudence, and subservient to the Churches good, according to the General Rules of the Word,</hi> which is proved to be Diametrally opposit to Christs Institutions, in point of

Ans.</hi> The impertinency of all this evidently appears, when we consider, that our Question with them, is anent an Office and Officer not appointed by the Lord, and cross to his Institutions, in Point of Government, whether Men may set him up in the House of God, yea or not. His Instances speak only of the Lawfulness of our Reason and Christian Prudence, in a clear sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency to the obedience of Commanded Ordinances; for such is <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Ministerial instruction, Catechising, and Singing of Psalms</hi>; So that these being Commanded Ordinances and Institutions, the proper subservient means thereof, do in a Remote Sense, fall within the compass of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commands, enjoining the same; such are these he mentions, <hi>viz.</hi> a methodical form of Sound words, digested into Catechisms, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples instruction and growth of Knowledge, the framing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the use of Singing (a Commanded Duty) into such a Metrical Composure, as is suitable hereunto, I mean keeping still close to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text, and not varying from the true and genuine Sense of the words; the Minister making use of Sanctified Reason, in a suitable Methodical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, to digest the Matter he delivereth, in the best Mould, for the Case and Edification of the People, to whom he is the Mouth of God, and must divide the Word of Truth aright unto them, applying it for Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, Reproof, Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to their various Conditions. For the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which the Surveyer in derision calls <hi>Holy,</hi> it falls under the same Consideration with the preceeding Instances, besides the clear Scripture Precedents, recommending and warranding the Practice. These I say, are so far from reaching any Patrociny to the setting up of a <hi>Prelat,</hi> whose Office encroaches upon the Due Rights of a true Gospel Ministry, and consequently stands in opposition both to Divine Institutions and ends of Government, that this defence appears no defence at all. For what he adds of the <hi>

                     </gap>reed</hi> and <hi>Doxologie,</hi> it is removed by what is said, and we need only to add, that the end of such Observances is better reached in the present Practice of our Church, in point of Worship, than with such Observances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:58203:177"/>But the <hi>Surveyer</hi> appears very angry at the calling the <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishop a <hi>New Officer,</hi> not Instituted by GOD in his House, and spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds to this Scope many words, <hi>P.</hi> 222.223. which is this in Summ. First <hi>That the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Function, is only a new Dignity and Authority granted for Peace sake, to one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister above others, within the bounds of the same Order. Ans.</hi> First, the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer</hi> should have considered that his Spliting of a supposed Divinely Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Office, and dividing the Work and Duties thereof unto different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Recipients, is upon the Matter a devising of <hi>New Orders,</hi> and all one therewith. Do not <hi>Papists</hi> tell us, that the Priest is the Highest Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ministry, and comprises, with the <hi>Diaconate,</hi> their whole Hierarchy, which is nothing else but an extension of these? Suppose the <hi>Pastoral Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of Order were thus Split, that one Rank or degree of Men were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to Baptize, not to Preach, others to Preach, not at all to Baptize, who will disown it, that these were Antiscriptural Human Inventions, dividing what GOD hath conjoined? And once admitting this, what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits can be set to Mens inventions in this Point? Or how can the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Orders in <hi>Popery</hi> be condemned, and all the Swarm of their new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Officers? Sure, the solid ground of Condemning them, is, that they are a Spurious Brood, inverting and destroying the End, Union and Order of the Divinely appointed Officers of the House of GOD. The Spliting of the Actings of the Power of Order is surely condemned upon this Ground of the Oneness and Identity of this Office of the <hi>Pastor</hi>: And if the Case stands thus with Reference to the Power and Exercise of Order, why is not the case the same in the Point of Jurisdiction, which is for the same end as the other? Moreover, if upon pretence of Order and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this extension of the exercise were admitted, in the Method he pleads, this Jurisdictional Power may be extended to the highest degree, even of a Patriarchat or <hi>Popedome,</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi> doth pretend he is but of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Priestood, and the lowest Rank of that Hierarchy have, by this Principle, a fundamental aptitude for the highest Office and extent of their Order. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> will have a Power left to the Church, to Rank Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, with a Respect to Union; and here is an Union of the Univers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church, resolving in such an Officer, and clearly going upon his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the way of uniting particular Churches: And who will doubt that the Union of the Church Universal hath the same Ground with that of Particular Churches?</p>
               <p>In a word, the Folly of this Discourse appears in this, that Ministers who have an unquestionable interest in Ordination and Jurisdiction, are charged by the Great Master, duely to exercise both, as they shall Answer to him, and therefore must not, but upon their perril denude themselves of any piece of that Work and Authority committed to them; this being
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58203:178"/>
the Talent, whereof they are to give an account to him, who hath given to every one of his Servants their Work. The distinction of the Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Hierarchical <hi>Prelat</hi> from the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as a <hi>New Officer,</hi> is evident, whether we consider his <hi>New Name,</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Archbishop</hi>; his <hi>New work</hi> of Governing the <hi>Diocess,</hi> besides his Trust in the Civil Government; his <hi>New Ordination</hi> or <hi>Consecration</hi> to his New work; his <hi>distinct Qualifications,</hi> in consequence of the whole, from the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Minister</hi>: So that he appears in all these Respects, a Compacted <hi>New Officer,</hi> and supposing the <hi>Pastors</hi> Divine Authority, a <hi>New Usurper.</hi> The Surveyer tells us, <hi>He is no New Officer, since the inferior Officer doing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> same Acts, it is not a nullity.</hi> But, as this Reason would tend to the former Antiscriptural spliting of Offices, so that the <hi>Episcopalians</hi> will not allow this Concession, is by this time evident. We all know who have in a late practice, condemned the Presbyterial Ordination of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church of <hi>France.</hi> For what he adds of the Power of the <hi>Commission of Assemblies,</hi> to Fortifie his Notion, the Disparity is palpable and apparent, whether we consider the <hi>Powers Deputing</hi> and giving Commission, <hi>viz</hi>: The King, in the Case of the <hi>Prelats</hi>; the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Representative</hi> or <hi>Assembly,</hi> in the Case of the <hi>Commission</hi>: The <hi>Prelat</hi> receiving a New Ordination; The <hi>Commissioners</hi> not: The <hi>Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> being limited as to their work and continuance by the Assembly, and as being Answerable unto them, not the <hi>Prelats &amp;c.</hi> But of this above. As for his discourse of Superintendents, <hi>P.</hi> 223. The Author of the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae Epistolae Philadelphi</hi> against <hi>Spotswoods</hi> Calumnies, hath at large made good the vast and essential difference betwixt the transient Office of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents</hi> and that of <hi>Prelats, P.</hi> 31.32. in no less than Twelve Instances to which, for brevitie, we refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surveyer</hi> P. 223.224. attempts in the next place, to answer the Objection against <hi>the Hierarchical Prelat taken from Christs Faithfulness, and the Scriptures perfection: From the Comparison institut in Scripture betwixt Christ and</hi>
Moses, <hi>in point of Faithfulness, in the Ordering and Institution of the Government and Ordinances of the House of God.</hi> The Argument is no doubt very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon both grounds, if we shall but suppose the Absolute Perfection of all our M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diators Offices, and the Correspondent Exercises thereof, for the Edification and Salvation of his Church, and especially under the Gospel Dispensation: As a Prophet, he hath fully revealed the Counsel and Mind of GOD, so as nothing is to be added to his Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, no new Rules, Truths or Duties to be superadded beyond the limits he hath revealed: As a Priest, his Satisfaction, his Intercession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is so full, that no pretended subservient Intercessors or Saviours, are to be devised by Men: Thus ful and perfect is the Exercise of his Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in appointing the Officers, Censures, Laws and Government of his House. The Argument appears further invincibly strong when we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58203:178"/>
Ponder two things. <hi>First,</hi> What the faithfulness of <hi>Moses</hi> under the Legal dispensation, did reach unto, which our Blessed Lords Soveraign Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesss doth exceed. 1. <hi>Moses</hi> appointed <hi>the Officers of the House of God</hi> their several Orders and Degrees, their Work and Duties, in so far that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions did amount to determin a species of Government. 2. All his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments hereanent were fixed and unalterable, so as none might add to or detract therefrom. 3. They were hence not Committed to the dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Civil Magistrate, to mould them after the Rules of worldly Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 4. These Officers were not to denude themselves of any part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Function committed to them, or of the exercise thereof. Hence, it inevitably follows, that the Government and Officers of the Church of the New Testament, is in all these Points of the like Nature; the Species is determined, the Offices and Officers are unalterable, are not to be Fashioned by Mens Laws at their arbitriment, are to continue in this Fixed Mould of his Institution, and Method of its Official Exercise, till his Returning again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scriptures Perfection clears this abundantly, all things to be believed and practised, in order to Salvation, are perfectly contained therein, and there being so much delivered in Scriptures, touching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Laws and Offices of the House of GOD, and in order to the Instruction, both of Church Rulers and Church Members, in their Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Duties; if these Directions, Laws and Institutions be not compleatly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to these ends, the Scriptures perfection is palpably impeached, and the infinit Wisdom of the Lawgiver blasphemed.</p>
               <p>To this Argument the <hi>Surveyer</hi> Answers, <hi>That in order to the great end of our Lords Prophetical and Kingly Offices, He hath given particular Commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Essentials of the Government of His House, and general Commands to direct the Prudence of His Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to order what is Left to Christian Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the best Ends; And that it is preposterous to fancy a thing necessary; and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christ hath instituted the same, because Faithful, but rather upon this ground, we must reason the necessity of the thing from his Appointment. Ans.</hi> This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in a word, by this one <hi>Position,</hi> That if we acknowledge these <hi>Essentials</hi> do include all necessary Offices and Officers of the Church, and do draw the Limits and Measures of their Actings, Qualifications, and the Nature of their Power, with such Exactness, as none may justle with, or encroach upon their Priviledges therein; We can offer such Scripture Discoveries in this Point, as do sufficiently lay aside the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan <hi>Prelat,</hi> and prove him such an <hi>Heteroclite,</hi> as his Office cannot be brought up to the Scripture Rules. Thus, we are so far from such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, as this fancycal <hi>Surveyer</hi> imputs to us, that on the contrary, we do suppose and prove the Scripture Institutions in this Point, and upon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58203:179"/>
the Scripture Discoveries thereof, we reason the Necessity from our <hi>Lords Faithfulness.</hi> But if the <hi>Surveyer</hi> did hold that the Offices and Officers of the House of GOD, their Duties and Qualification, are such things <hi>as falls within the compass of the Churches Liberty, to dispose as she thinks fit</hi>: 1. It might be enquired, what he or those of his Mind will owne as <hi>Essentials? Next,</hi> To what end are all the Scripu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Directions and Institutions in this Point delivered unto the Church of GOD? And why upon this Ground, the most extended Hierarchy may not be pleaded for? 3. How this can consist with that express Design of the Scriptures Perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> To make, not only the ordinary Christian, but also the <hi>Man of God, the Minister of God, perfect and thorowly furnished to every good Work, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very piece of his Office and Duty; and with this further Expression of this Design of Ministerial Instructions proposed by the Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. viz. <hi>To instruct the Man of God how to behave in the House of God, which is His Church</hi>? In An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this, the <hi>Surveyer acknowledges the Scriptures Perfection,</hi> to make the Man of GOD wise to Salvation, and furnish him for every good Work, either <hi>by the general or particular Precepts thereof, but that it belongs not to the Perfection of the Scripture, to contain the particular Rules for all the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Church Government, more than it doth for all the particular Practices of our common Life. Ans.</hi> Behold the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> in this our <hi>Surveyers</hi> great <hi>Essay,</hi> turned into the Dwarf of a mere <hi>Circumstance.</hi> Behold also his Zeal for right ordering of the House of GOD, what Officers must Rule therein, what the Nature of their Work and Power is, what Duties are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, what the Nature and Species of the Government must be, whether it must run to the Extrems of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or the <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistical Morellian way,</hi> of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> or the midle Forms; All, or either of these is but a mere <hi>Circumstance,</hi> with our <hi>Surveyer.</hi> Let any Judge, if he gave not here <hi>manus victas</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and yeelded up his Cause to them: For no Man of Sense, will call the Matters, instanced mere <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>; And if they be not, the Scriptures Perfection, for the ends men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, must clearly reach the Determination thereof. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> told us, <hi>That the work of the Bishop</hi> 1 Tim. 3. <hi>Doth import the Work and Office of the Hierarchical Prelat;</hi> And he has acknowledged here the Scriptures Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to furnish the Minister of Christ for every good Work, yea, he hath asserted P. 194.195. <hi>That the plentitude of the Apostolick Power, committed by our Lord to the Apostles, for the great End of the Churches Edification and Union, was by them committed to the</hi> Bishops, <hi>as their proper Successors.</hi> Now, how these Assertions can consist with his Describing and Owning here the Work and Office of the <hi>Bishop</hi> as a mere <hi>Circumstance,</hi> wherein the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures gives no certain distinct Sound, must be put among the rest of his mysterious Inventions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:58203:179"/>Two or three things further, I add, and I have done with this <hi>Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. First,</hi> It is generally acknowledged by all Sound Divines, That there is no Lawful Church Office or Officer of the House of GOD, but what must have our LORD'S positive Grant or Institution: And this is fortified by several Grounds. 1. <hi>Whatever is not of Faith is sin,</hi> in general, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretends to Officiat in Christs House and Kingdom, as an Officer therein, acts <hi>sine titulo,</hi> and his Actings are void; And therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act in Faith, if there be not a Divine Warrand for the Office he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains, and the Official Exercise and Actings thereof. 2. If we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christs Kingly Power and Headship over the Church, as a political Body, whereof he is the political Head, giving her her Laws and Officers, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.22. As in all Kingdoms, no person can claim an Office of State, or Magistracy, without the Warrand of the Laws, and the Kings Authority thereto Interposed, so all Church Power and Authority, must be conveyed to Church Officers by this Glorious KING's Authentick Commission or Grant. Now, none can pretend to any Grant or Commission from Him, but what is in the Scriptures; Which is especially evident, and further convincingly clear, both from the Perfection of His Word and Testament hereanent; And likewise, from this, that the Church Government in the whole of it, must needs be acknowledged to be founded upon a Divine and positive Institution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our LORD did thus actually exercise His Kingly Power, and derived the same to Church Officers, thus he gave the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wer to Bind and Loose, and the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to his Apostles, promised His Presence with them and their Successors to the End; And this for the Edification and Building up of His Church, till her Warfare is accomplished, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.19, with <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.19.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> When this Fundamental Truth of our LORD'S political Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Influences accordingly, in the Government of the Church, and the Perfection of His Holy Testament, in reference to the Laws, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Officers thereof, is denyed, the Foundations of a Christian Church are removed, the Rules, Limits, and Boundaries, in reference to the Duties, both of Church Officers and Members, so annihilate, as the Church becomes a Chaos of all Confusion and arbitrary Disorder whatsomever, or at least the Leaden and Versatile Rule of Worldly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being made her Measures of Ordinances and Government, a Door is opened for Inundations of all Errors and Superstitions, and for the most wicked Usurpations and Disorders, in point of Government, that the wicked Mind of Man, by the influence of Satan, can invent.</p>
