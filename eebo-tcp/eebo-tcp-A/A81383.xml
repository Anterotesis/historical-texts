            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to your earneſt deſire, I have
taken the beſt care I could to ſatisfie you,
concerning the <hi>Witches</hi> lately tryed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and executed at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Albans:</hi> It
had been very difficult to convince me
of that which I find true, concerning the wiles of
that old Serpent the Divel, for the ſupporting of his
dark dominions, which appeares in the ſubtile trade
hee drives for the enlarging of his territories; by
ſtrengthning of himſelf upon the weakneſſe of his
ſubjects, relapſed men and women.</p>
            <p>I ſhall the more clearly give you to underſtand
what you deſire concerning theſe two, by name,
<hi>John Palmer</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Knott</hi> of <hi>Norton,</hi> within the
Liberty of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Albans,</hi> if you pleaſe to pardon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
whereunto I ſhall reduce the ſeverall kinds of
<hi>Witches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt I find that man at his beſt eſtate was created
with excellent beauty of knowledge in his mind,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117554:3"/>
which his own unhappy mutability together with
the Divels ſuggeſtion, hath folded up in darkneſſe
and obſcurity; whereupon being impatient to be
coop't up within the narrow ſcantling of his own
intellectualls, I ſee him very buſie with the Divel;
and rather then keep his ſtation, hee will make tryall
what the Divel can do for his advancement in
knowledge: I find thoſe that dealt with curious arts
in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. fitly comprehended under this kind:
I know not whether to reduce <hi>Marſh</hi> of <hi>Dunſtable,</hi>
whom <hi>Palmer</hi> confeſſeth to be the head of the whole
<hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Witches,</hi> that hee knows in the world:
This <hi>Palmer</hi> hath been a <hi>Witch</hi> theſe 60 years, (by
his own confeſsion) long enough to know and give
in the totall ſumme of all the Conjuring conclave,
and the ſociety of <hi>Witches</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> This <hi>Marſh</hi>
hath ſo long gratified the Country people with his
Conjurations, that time and ignorance ſtiles him a
good <hi>Witch,</hi> or a white <hi>Witch;</hi> I ſuppoſe you eaſily
grant that the Divel is never blacker, and more to be
abhorr'd then when hee transforms himſelf into an
Angel of Light. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. I eaſily believe that if <hi>Marſh</hi> was
brought to his tryall, hee might confeſſe as much
of his brother <hi>Lilly,</hi> as <hi>Palmer</hi> hath of him, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Prognoſticator, and bold <hi>Balaam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I conceive to be one occaſion to the god of
this world, in tempting and deluding thoſe who are
led captive by him, namely an inordinate deſire to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117554:3"/>
know more then his maker hath thought fit for
him to know.</p>
            <p>Secondly I find an other occaſion whereupon the
Divel offers his ſervice ſo officiouſly, which is envy,
who ſeeing a predominancy in the iraſcible faculty,
hee is never behindhand in the proffering his ſervice
for the attempting what ever hee temp<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By the plain confeſsion of <hi>Palmer</hi> it may certainly

Divel firſt made this mark he drew his bloud and
cauſed him to write his mark upon the ground with
his own hand therewith; his trading in this horrid
and abominable practice of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> was (as hee
confeſſed) betwixt the ſpace of 50 and 60 years, the
hurt which from time to time hee had done was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this I account his prime pranck that
he notoriouſly ſeduced <hi>Elizabeth Knott</hi> his kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to conſort with him in his villany who hath
aſſented to him more eſpecially in the death of one
Goodwife <hi>Pearls</hi> of <hi>Norton,</hi> whom <hi>Palmer</hi> ſaid hee
would do nothing to occaſion her death unleſſe this
<hi>Elizabeth Knott</hi> would aſſent: whereupon they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
agreed to frame the picture of the woman
(<hi>Pearls</hi>) in clay, which was forthwith laid upon the
fire, and duly raked up in the embers; while it was
conſuming and mouldring away the woman lay in
miſerable torments, when it was quite conſumed the
woman immediately dyed: and this hee confeſſed to
be done by him, and his kinſwoman out of revenge
which he ought her, for hanging a lock upon his
doore, for the not paying of his rent: At another
time to ſatisfie his revengfull humour hee killd an
horſe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cleavers</hi> by ſending his familiar: and
this <hi>Elizabeth Knott</hi> bewitcht a Cow of <hi>John Lamans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
by ſending an evil ſpirit unto her, which was in the
likeneſſe of a <hi>Catt,</hi> but had no hand in the death of
any thing, ſave the death of Goodwife <hi>Pearls.</hi> The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117554:5"/>
familiar which ſhe entertained came to her about
three weeks before the ſaid Cow was bewitched at
twelve of the Clock in the night, and the familiar
promiſed her, that ſhe ſhould have her deſire in any
thing ſhe would deſire, except money: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why ſhe bewitched the Cow of <hi>William Laman</hi>
was, becauſe ſhe demanded money which was due
to her, from the ſaid <hi>Lamans</hi> wife, and it was denied
her. We underſtand alſo from this <hi>Elizabeth Knott</hi>
that when ſhe was caſt upon the water her familiar
ſucked upon her breaſt, but after ſhe came out of the
water ſhe never ſaw it any more.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to reckon up the multifarious
exploits of this old Witch <hi>Palmer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for <hi>Knott</hi> his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
was but a novice, in compariſon of him,
and as I conceive had made no direct Covenant
with the Divel, as <hi>Palmer</hi> had.</p>
            <p>A little before his execution he confeſſed to <hi>Sampſon
Clark,</hi> the Keeper of the Priſon, that falling out with
a young man, hee transformed himſelf into a Toad,
and lying in the way where the young man came,
he kick't it, immediately <hi>Palmer</hi> complained of a
ſore ſhinne, whereupon hee bewitched the young
man for many years to his great woe and torment.</p>
            <p>That you may further underſtand what ſociety hee
had on your ſide the Countrey, with ſuch as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond
to the Divel, I ſhall ſignifie to you what hee
confeſſed before his execution: In <hi>Hitchin,</hi> he reckons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117554:6"/>
two, <hi>Mary By-chance</hi> and <hi>Widdow Palmer:</hi> In <hi>Norton
John Salmon</hi> ſenior. <hi>Joſeph Salmon,</hi> and <hi>Judeth</hi> his
wife. <hi>John Lamen</hi> ſenior and <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, <hi>John La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
junior. <hi>Mary</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iohn Lamen</hi> ſenior
<hi>Ioan Lamen</hi> the daughter of the aforeſaid <hi>Iohn Lamen:</hi>
and the wife of one <hi>Mayes</hi> in <hi>Weston.</hi> And at the place
of execution he confeſſed two more, <hi>Sarah Smith</hi> and
<hi>Anne Smith</hi> ſervants, the one to Mr. <hi>Beamont,</hi> the other
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Reynolds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a third ground whereupon the Divel
takes advantage by his deluſions to beguile men and
women, and that is by a diligent obſervation of their
concupiſcible faculty, whereby they are inordinate in
their deſires after money and gain, which the God of
this world is very free to promiſe, but as one of his
ſlaves confeſſed, ſhe never wanted, (that is) any
miſery or affliction, after ſhe had contracted with
him.</p>
