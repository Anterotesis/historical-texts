            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>heſe laſt dayes has powered forth of his Spirit upon his Sons and upon his Daughters, and we with many thouſands, that have received thereof, cannot but bear witneſs thereto, That the Lord is come that ſearcheth the Hearts and tryeth the Reins, to take up his dwelling in men and women, who are obedient to his Spirit and Requirings find Peace therein, and we dare not do contrary thereunto; though for it we have been dealt hardly with by men, as at this day, in Spoiling of our Goods, and Impriſoning of our Bodies, and the ſhedding of our Blood in the Streets, though it could never be proved that we, or any of us, have in any kind done, or invented to do: any evil to King or People, or allow thereof; for we are full of Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will unto all, and our Enemies could never find any advantage againſt us, but in the matters of our God; ſo our Sufferings have been for our believing in, and obeying the Spirit of Truth, in which we have and do worſhip God every where, and we have not, nor dare we be diſobedient thereto, whatever it coſt us; for by this we are ſealed to an Inheritance inviſible and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And we have a Liberty at this time to lay before you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Innocency and Harmleſneſs of all us that are brought to the Obedience of this Spirit, that the King, and all in the Nation, may fear and bow before him, whoſe Servants we are: O judge in Righteouſneſs you Rulers in the Earth, whether we ſhould obey God or man in this matter; for we are bold in the Spirit and Power to declare unto you. That he that hath required Worſhip in Spirit and in Truth every where is our Leader, and with us of a Truth; and they that are againſt us, he hath, and will rebuke.</p>
            <p>O Remember, it is but a little while ſince this City and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was viſited with <hi>Plague, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Sword;</hi> And was it not when you oppreſſed the Worſhippers in the Spirit? And when you ceaſed your ſtrife againſt them, then the Lord gave you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to repair your Loſſes: And ſo full of Good-will are we unto the Land of our Nativity, that we muſt call unto you, that you might mind what the great God of Heaven and Earth hath made known unto us, that he hath appeared, and doth appear in this Nation and Kingdom, more then in any Nation in the Earth, that it might be cleanſed and delivered from the Deſtruction threatned by the Lord, becauſe of the great and raining Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein; and none cries louder, nor ever did ſooner bring down vengeance on a People or Nation, then the reſiſtance of the Spirit and Light of God, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ewith the Lord hath viſited this Nation at this day; ſo we cannot but beſeech you to come to this Spirit and Light in your ſelves, that reconciles to God; and we know it from all other ſpirits, for it is Holy and Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and none it is can oppreſs or reſiſt the Appearance of it in any other: And we cannot but mind you, as bound in duty thereto, that the reſiſtance of this Spirit overthrew and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old World, and as <hi>Stephen</hi> told the Prieſts and Rulers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had killed and put to death the Prince of Life, That it was becauſe they reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did; and though they believed him not, and ſtoned him to death, yet all their wiſdom and ſtrength could not defend them from his Diſpleaſure, whom they had grieved; and how ſoon Deſtruction came on them &amp; on their Nation you know, and it is good to remember; for it is the ſame God we ſerve, and his Arm is not ſhortned, and there is amongſt you a poor and afflicted People, to whom he hath regard; for they dare not go contrary to his Commands, nor any juſt Command of man; but there was a Law by which ſome ſaid the Son of God was to be put to death; and there has been Laws in this Nation, by which the beſt <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the Land have been Martyred; and there are yet Laws, which to yield obedience to, were to diſobey God, and in ſo doing we ſhould haſten deſtruction on our ſelves and the Nation, as the many Examples in the Scriptures and elſewhere makes manifeſt, and for us are they written, upon whom the Ends of the World are come; therefore we have been moved and conſtrained in the Love of our God, to call unto you, even to all, from him that ſits on the Throne, to the meaneſt in Authority in this Nation. O that you would hear! O that you would grant Liberty of Conſcience, for every one to Worſhip God, as of the Spirit they come to receive Underſtanding, according to that Royal Law, <hi>In doing as you would be done by;</hi> and by this you would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your Enemies, &amp; ſtrengthen your Frends, and deter Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lengthen your Tranquility; but if you will not hear, nor be intreated, but go on to oppreſs thoſe that worſhip in Spirit, you will be found Fighters againſt God, &amp; he is mighty, and will plead the cauſe of the Innocent. This from us that would have you all to ſo act, and do, that you might render your account before God with joy, in the day of his righteous Judgment, that haſtens, and is near unto every one of you. And we cannot but mind you of the many that lie in the ſeveral Goals and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Nation, ſome four, five, ſix, or ſeven years time, being found in no other offence, when committed to Priſon, but their meeting to worſhip God: O that you into whoſe hands the Lord hath given power to ſhew mercy, and ſet free the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Names under-written are ſome of the many Thouſands of our mind with us, that cry day and night, that Liberty of Conſcience may be given, that we may ſerve the Lord in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs all the dayes of our Lives, and we know the Lord hears.</p>
