            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>O LORD, I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, for my iniquities are increaſed over my head, and my treſpaſs is grown up even unto Heaven. I have wrought all theſe great provocations, and that in the moſt provoking manner; they have not been only ſingle but repeated acts of ſin: for, O Lord, of all this black Catalogue which I have now brought forth before thee, how few are there which I have not often committed, nay, which are not become even habitual and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie to me? And to this frequencie, I have added both a greedineſs, and obſtinacie in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, turning into my courſe as the Horſe ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the battel, doing evil with both hands, earneſtly, yea, hating to be reformed, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy words behinde me, quenching thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me, which teſtified againſt me, to turn me from my evil wayes, and fruſtrating all thoſe outward means whether of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or mercie, which thou haſt uſed to draw me to thy ſelf. Nay, O Lord, even my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances may be numbered amongſt my greateſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:136899:25"/>
ſins, they have ſometimes been feigned and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, alwayes ſo ſlight and ineffectual, that they have brought forth no fruit in amendment of life, but I have ſtill returned with the dog to his vomit, and the ſow to the mire again, and have added the breach of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and vows, to all my former guilts. Thus, O Lord, I am become out of meaſure ſinful, and ſince I have thus choſen death, I am moſt worthy to take part in it, even in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, the lake of fire and brimſtone. This, this, O Lord, is in juſtice to be the portion of my cup, to me belongs nothing but ſhame and confuſion of face eternally. But to thee, O Lord God, belongeth mercie and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: though I have rebelled againſt thee, O remember not my ſins and offences, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy mercie think thou upon me O Lord for thy goodneſs. Thou ſenteſt thy Son to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, behold, O Lord, I have gone aſtraie like a ſheep that is loſt, O ſeek thy ſervant, and bring me back to the Shepherd and Biſhop of my ſoul; let thy ſpirit work in me a heartie ſenſe and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all my abominations, that true contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, which thou haſt promiſed not to deſpiſe. And then be thou pleaſed to look on me, to take away all iniquitie, and receive me graciouſly, and for his ſake who hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs, be reconciled to me, who have done nothing well; waſh away the guilt of my ſins in his blood, and ſubdue the power of them by his grace, and grant, O Lord, that I may

I have with the prodigal waſted that portion of grace thou beſtowedſt upon me, and therefore do infinitely want a ſupplie out of this treaſurie: But, O Lord, how ſhall ſuch a wretch as I dare to approach this holy Table? I am a dog, how ſhall I preſume to take the childrens bread? Or how ſhall this ſpiritual Manna, this food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be given to one who hath choſen to feed on husks with ſwine, nay to one who hath alreadie ſo often trampled theſe precious things under foot, either careleſly neglecting, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily receiving theſe holy myſteries? O Lord, my horrible guiltineſs makes me trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come, and yet makes me not dare to keep away; for where, O Lord, ſhall my polluted ſoul be waſhed, if not in this fountain which thou haſt opened for ſin and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs? Hither therefore I come, and thou haſt promiſed that him that cometh to thee thou wilt in no wiſe caſt out: This is, O Lord, the blood of the New Teſtament, grant

And though I have ſo often and ſo wretchedly broken my part of that Covenant, whereof this Sacrament is a ſeal, yet be thou graciouſly pleaſed to make good thine, to be merciful to my unrighteouſneſs, and to remember my ſins and my iniquities no more; and not only ſo, but to put thy laws into my heart, and to write them in my mind, and by the power of thy grace diſpoſe my ſoul to ſuch a ſincere and conſtant obedience, that I may never again provoke thee; Lord, grant that in theſe holy myſteries I may not only commemorate, but effectually receive my bleſſed Saviour, and all the benefits of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and to that end give me ſuch a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul as may qualifie me for it, give me a deep ſenſe of my ſins and unworthineſs, that being wearie and heavie laden, I may be capable of his refreſhings, and by being ſuppled in my own tears, I may be the fitter to be waſhed in his blood; raiſe up my dull and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind from groveling here below, and inſpire it with a holy zeal, that I may with ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection approach this ſpiritual feaſt; and let, O Lord, that infinite love of Chriſt in dying for ſo wretched a ſinner, inflame my frozen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed ſoul, and kindle in me that ſacred fire of love to him, and that ſo vehement, that no waters may quench, no floods drown it, ſuch as may burn up all my droſſe, not leave one unmortified luſt in my ſoul, and ſuch as may alſo extend it ſelf to all whom

thou haſt given me command and example to love, even enemies as well as friends.

Yet O merciful Jeſu, this blood is my only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, O let this make my atonement or I periſh eternally: Wherefore didſt thou ſhed it, but to ſave ſinners? Neither can the merit of it be overwhelmed either by the greatneſs or number of ſins. I am a ſinner, a great one, O let me finde its ſaving efficacie. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful to me for my ſoul truſteth in thee, and in the clefts of thy wounds ſhall be my refuge until thy Fathers indignation be over-paſt.

And that thy own heart deceive thee not in this ſo weighty a buſineſs, it will be wiſdome to ſend for ſome godly</hi> Divine, <hi>not only to aſſiſt thee with his prayers, but with his counſel alſo. And to that purpoſe open thy heart ſo freely to him that he may be able to judge whether thy Repentance be ſuch as may give thee confidence to appear before Gods dreadful Tribunal, and that if it be not, he may help thee what he can towards the making it ſo. And when thou haſt thus provided for thy better part, thy Soul, then conſider thy Body alſo, and as the Wiſe man ſaith,</hi> Ecclus. 38. 12.

               <p>O Eternal and everliving God, who firſt breathedſt into man the breath of life, and when thou takeſt away that breath he dies and is turned again to his duſt, look with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on me thy poor crature who am now drawing near the gates of death, and which is infinitely more terrible, the bar of Judgement. Lord my own heart condemns me, and thou art infinitely greater then my heart, and knoweſt all things. The ſins I know and remember, fill me with horrour; but there are alſo multitudes of others, which I either obſerved not at the time, or have ſince careleſly forgot, which are all preſent to thee. Thou ſetteſt my miſdeeds before thee, and my ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance; and to what a mountainous heap muſt the minutely provocations of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie years ariſe? How ſhall one ſo ungodly ſtand in thy Judgement, or ſuch a ſinner in the Congregation of the Righteous? And to adde yet more to my terrour, my verie repentance I fear will not abide the trial; my frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes heretofore have ſufficiently witneſſed the unſinceritie of my paſt reſolutions. And then, O Lord, what can ſecure me that my preſent diſlikes of my ſins are not rather the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:136899:37"/>
effects of my amazing danger then of any real change? And, O Lord, I know thou art not mocked, nor wilt accept of any thing that is not perfectly ſincere. O Lord, when I conſider this, fearfulneſs and trembling comes upon me, and an horrible dread overwhelmeth me, my fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and my heart is wounded within me. But, O Lord, one deep calleth upon another, the depth of my miſerie upon the depth of thy mercie; Lord, ſave now or I periſh eternally. O thou who willeſt not that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, bring me, I beſeech thee, though thus late, to a ſincere Repentance, ſuch as thou wilt accept, who trieſt the heart. Create in me, O God, a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me: Lord, one day is with thee as a thouſand years, O let thy mightie ſpirit work in me now in this my laſt day, whatſoever thou ſeeſt wanting to fit me for thy mercie and acceptation. Give me a perfect and entire hatred of my ſins, and enable me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee with that ſacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, which thou haſt promiſed not to deſpiſe; that by this I may be made capable of that atonement which thy dear Son hath by the more excellent oblation of himſelf made for all repenting ſinners. He is the propitiation for our ſins, he was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was o him, O heal me by his ſtripes, and let the cry of his blood drown the clamour of my ſins. I am indeed a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:136899:38"/>
childe of wrath, but he is the Son of thy love, for his ſake ſpare me, O Lord, ſpare thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whom he hath redeemed with his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, and be not angrie with me for ever. In his wounds O Lord, I take Sanctuarie, O let not thy vengeance purſue me to this Citie of refuge: my ſoul hangeth upon him, O let me not periſh with a Jeſus, with a Saviour in my arms. But by his Agonie and bloodie ſweat, by his Croſs and Paſſion, by all that he did and ſuffered for ſinners, good Lord deliver me; deliver me, I beſeech thee, from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of my ſins, thy wrath and everlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in this time of my tribulation, in the hour of death, and in the day of Judgement. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and do not now repay my former neglects of thy calls, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to anſwer me in this time of my greateſt need; Lord, there is but a ſtep between me and death, O let not my ſun go down upon thy wrath, but ſeal my pardon before I go hence and be no more ſeen. Thy loving kindneſs is better then the life it ſelf, O let me have that in exchange, and I ſhall moſt gladly lay down this mortal life. Lord, thou knoweſt all my deſire, and my groaning is not hid from thee; deal thou with me, O Lord, according to thy Name, for ſweet is thy mercie; take away the ſting of death, the guilt of my ſins, and then though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death I will fear no evil; I will lay me down in peace, and Lord when I awake up, let me be ſatisfied with thy preſence in thy glorie.

               <p>O Lord God, to whom vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, I deſire humbly to confeſs before thee, both on my own behalf, &amp; that of this Nation, that theſe many years of calamitie we have groaned under, are but the juſt, (yea milde) returns of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:136899:43"/>
more years of our provocations againſt thee, and that thy preſent wrath is but the due pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of thy abuſed mercy. O Lord, thou haſt formerly abounded to us in bleſſings above all people of the earth. Thy candle ſhined upon our heads, and we delighted our ſelves in thy great goodneſs, Peace was within our walls, and plenteouſneſs within our palaces, there was no decay, no leading into Captivity and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our ſtreets: but we turned this Grace into wantonneſs, we abuſed our Peace to Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our Plenty to riot &amp; luxury, and made thoſe good things which ſhould have endeared our hearts to thee, the occaſion of enſtranging them from thee. Nay, O Lord, thou gaveſt us yet more precious mercies, thou wert pleaſed thy ſelf to pitch thy Tabernacle with us, to eſtabliſh a pure and glorious Church among us, and give us thy Word to be a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our paths; but O Lord, we have made no other uſe of that light, then to conduct us to the Chambers of death, we have dealt proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not hearkned to thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by rebelling againſt the light, have purchaſed to our ſelves ſo much the heavier portion in the outer darkneſs. And now, O Lord, had the overflowings of thy vengeance been anſwerable to that of our ſin, we had long ſince been ſwept away with a ſwift deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and there had been none of us alive at this day to implore thy mercy. But thou art a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, ſlow to anger, and haſt proceeded with us with much patience and long-ſuffering,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:136899:43"/>
thou haſt ſent thy Judgements to awake us to repentance, and haſt alſo allowed us ſpace for it: But alas! we have perverted this mercy of thine beyond all the former, we return not to him that ſmiteth us, neither do we ſeek the Lord, we are ſliden back by a perpetual back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding, no man repenteth him of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſaith what have I done? 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we fear the rod, (we dread everie ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that we are ready to buy it off with the fouleſt ſin) but we fear not him that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, but by a wretched obſtinacy harden our necks againſt thee, and refuſe to return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now, O God, what balm is there in <hi>Gilead</hi> that can cure us; who when thou wouldeſt heal us, will not be healed, we know thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that there is no peace to the wicked, and how ſhall we then pray for peace, that ſtill retain our wickedneſs? This this, O Lord, is our ſoreſt diſeaſe, O give us Medicines to heal this ſickneſs, heal our ſouls, and then we know thou canſt ſoon heal our Land. Lord, thou haſt long ſpoken by thy Word to our ears, by thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even to all our ſenſes, but unleſs thou ſpeak by thy Spirit to our hearts, all other Calls will ſtill be uneffectual. O ſend out this voice, and that a mightie voice, ſuch as may awake us out of this Lechargie: Thou that didſt call <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> out of the grave, O be pleaſed to call us who are Dead, yea, putrified in treſpaſſes and ſins, and make us to awake to righteouſneſs. And though, O Lord, our frequent reſiſtences even of thoſe inward Calls, have juſtly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:136899:44"/>
thee to give us up to the Luſts of our own heart; yet, O thou boundleſs Ocean of mercie, who art good not only beyond what we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but what we can wiſh, do not withdraw the influence of thy grace, and take not thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit from us. Thou wert found of thoſe that ſought thee not, O let that act of mercie be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to us who are ſo deſperately, yet ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly Sick, that we cannot ſo much as look after the Phyſitian, and by how much our caſe is the more dangerous, ſo much the more ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Remedies do thou apply; Lord help us, and conſider, not ſo much our unworthineſs of thy aid, as our irremediable ruine if we want it; ſave Lord, or we periſh eternally. To this end diſpenſe to us in our temporal Intereſt what thou ſeeſt may beſt ſecure our Spiritual; if a greater degree of outward Miſerie will tend to the curing our inward, Lord, ſpare not thy Rod, but ſtrike yet more ſharply. Caſt out this Devil, though with never ſo much Foaming &amp; tearing. But if thou ſeeſt that ſome Return of mercie may be moſt likely to melt us, O be pleaſed ſo far to condeſcend to our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to afford us that, and whether by thy ſharper or gentler methods, bring us home to thy ſelf. And then, O Lord, we know thy hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave, when thou haſt delivered us from our ſins, thou canſt and wilt deliver us from our troubles: O ſhew us thy mercie and grant us thy ſalvation, that being redeemed both in our bodies and ſpirits, we may glorifie thee in both, in a chearful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

Of this tempeſt and ſtorm we may thank our own Wickedneſs and ſinful living, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it well and confeſs it, we diſcern thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and we bewail our unrighteouſneſs: But we appeal to thy <hi>Mercy</hi> which <hi>ſurmounteth all thy works;</hi> we have now ſuffered much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, being ſcourged with ſo many Wars, conſumed with ſuch Loſſes of goods, ſhaken with ſo many floods, and yet appears there no where any Haven or Port unto us, being thus tired and forlorn among ſo ſtrange evils, but ſtill every day more grievous puniſhments and more ſeem to hang over our heads.

Now in this far greater Tempeſt, wherein not a few mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be in danger, but innumerable Souls: we beſeech thee at the crie of thy holy <hi>Church,</hi> which is in danger of drowning, that thou wilt awake. So many thouſands of men do crie, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh,</hi> the Tempeſt is paſt Mans power; it is Thy word that muſt do the deed, Lord Jeſu, only ſay thou with a word of thy mouth, <hi>Ceaſe, O tempeſt, and forthwith ſhall the deſired calm appear.</hi> Thou wouldſt have ſpared ſo many thouſands of moſt wicked men, if in the City of <hi>Sodom</hi> had been found but ten good men. Now here be ſo many Thouſands of men which love the glorie of thy Name, which ſigh for the beautie of thy Houſe, and wilt thou not at theſe mens Prayers let goe thine Anger, and remember thine accuſtomed and old mercies? Shalt thou not with thy heavenly policie turn our folly into thy glory? Shalt thou not turn the wicked mens evils into thy Churches good? For thy mercie is wont then moſt of all to ſuccour, when the thing is with us paſt Remedie, and neither the Might nor Wiſdome of men can help it. Thou alone bringeſt things that be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo out of order into order again, which art

But how much greater Confuſion is this, where is no Charitie, no Fidelitie, no bonds of Love, no reverence neither of Laws nor yet of Rulers, no agreement of Opinions, but as it were in a miſordered Quire, every man ſingeth a contrary note!

Shalt thou ſuffer the ſtrong Captain of miſchief, whom thou once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threweſt, again to invade thy Tents, and to ſpoil thy Souldiers? When thou wert here a man converſant among men, at thy Voice fled the Divils. Send forth, we beſeech thee, O Lord, thy Spirit, which may drive away out of the breſts of all them that profeſs thy Name, the wicked Spirits, maſters of riot, of covetouſneſs, of vain-glory, of carnal luſt, of miſchief and diſcord. <hi>Create in us, O our God and King, a clean heart, and renew thy holy Spirit in our breſts, pluck not from us thy holy Ghoſt.

This Spirit if thou wilt vouchſafe to renew in all mens hearts, then ſhall all theſe forreign miſeries ceaſe, or if they ceaſe not, they ſhall turn to the profit and avail of them which love thee.

And becauſe thy ſpirit, which according to thy Prophets ſaying, <hi>containeth all things,</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Science of ſpeaking; make, that like as unto all them which be of thy Houſe, is one Light, one Baptiſme, one God, one Hope, one Spirit; ſo they may alſo have one Voice, one Note, one Song, profeſſing one Catholick truth. When thou didſt mount up to Heaven triumphantly, thou threwſt out from above thy precious things, thou gaveſt Gifts amongſt men, thou dealteſt ſundry rewards of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Renew again from above thy old bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, give that thing to thy <hi>Church,</hi> now fainting and growing downward, that thou gaveſt unto her ſhooting up, at her firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

ſhortly render accompt unto thee that art the King of Kings. Give wiſdome to be alwayes aſſiſtant unto them, that whatſoever is beſt to be done, they may eſpy it in their minds, and purſue the ſame in their doings. Give to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> the gift of Propheſie, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and interpret holy Scripture, not of their own brain, but of thine inſpiring.
