         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Repent for the kingdome of God is at hand.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord God of heauen, the moſt
righteous and mightie iudge of
the world, neuer intends to inflict
plagues or puniſhmentes on any
Countrey, Cittie, or nation, but
firſt it pleaſeth him of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable
mercie, to forewarne
the ſame countrey, cittie, or nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, by the mouthes of his Prophets, and other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of his worde, or elſe by his wonderfull ſignes and
tokens ſhewed in the heauens, the earth, or other his
creatures, that thereby the people may be induced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
their former wickedneſſe, and to learne amendment
and newneſſe of life. Examples hereof we haue in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
how many tokens of his wrath did the Lord ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Pharao,</hi> before his deſtruction in the red ſea? Likewiſe
before Sodome was conſumde with fire from heauen, it
is written that <hi>Abraham</hi> had knowledge thereof, and
intreated the Lord to ſpare it: but ſuch were the ſinnes of
that curſed Cittie, that his prayers could not preuaile. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
more then the ſpace of an hundred yeares before the
<pb facs="tcp:15608:3"/>
waters drownd the worlde, had <hi>Noah</hi> warning to build y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Arke, and long it was ere hee finiſhed that worke, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the children of men made a ſcorne thereof, and
ſo farre were they from grace, that no warning at all they
tooke thereby. The Niniuites hauing warning repented
at the preaching of <hi>Ionas:</hi> but <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was nothing
moued though Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe foretold their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
for which cauſe ſorrow came vpon them as vpon a
woman when ſhe trauelleth. The ſigns and tokens which
the Lord ſent ouer that Cittie before their fall were many
and maruelleus, notwithſtanding they perſiſted in their
ſinnes, and flattering themſelues in their owne follies,
made falſe interpretations of thoſe prodigious wonders.
Séeing then that as the Apoſtle ſaith, that whatſoeuer is
written, is written for our learning, let all Chriſtians
take warning hereby, not ieſtingly to ioyne themſelues
together (as they did in the old world) to deride or falſely
to interpret the dreadfull tokens ſent among vs, leſt with
them of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> deſtruction do ſuddenly come vpon vs.
I haue here to ſhew you a ſtrange and wonderfull token
of Gods wrath figured forth in a ſilly Herring, in which
ſmal fiſh he doth demonſtrate great and dreadfull matters
as by the picture you may perceiue: on the one ſide where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you may plainely behold the perfect ſhape of two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men, the one hauing in his hand a launce, the other a
ſword, cloſe buckled in their corſlets, with burgancts on
their heades, ſtanding as it were in their defence, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and aſſayling one another. I know that many will
giue as ſmall credit hereunto, and as ſleightly eſteeme
thereof as <hi>Pharao</hi> did of the flies, &amp; the Iewes of Chriſts
miracles: notwithſtanding the Lord hath choſen the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
thinges of this world to confound the wiſe, and the
weake to ouercome the mighty, as he himſelfe hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in his holy Goſpell. Moreouer there was toward
the taile of this Herring the right portraiture of two
rods, the one farre bigger then the other, ſeeming to bee
<pb facs="tcp:15608:3"/>
bound together with two ſtrong bandes apéece, which
euery man muſt confeſſe to bee the vndoubted ſigne of
dreadfull correction: according as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh,
ſaying: <hi>Thou ſhalt bruſe them with a rod of Iron, and
breake them in peeces like a Potters veſſell.</hi> In ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſword and peſtilence is ſaid to be the ſcourges of the
Lord: and therefore that cruel and bloody tyrant <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi>
did iuſtly call himſelfe the ſcourge of God, by whom
he corrected the proud, rebellious and wicked world: bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by bloody wars many kingdomes into his ſubiection.
If we enter then into due conſideration hereof, and with
the eyes of grace behold the ſame, we cannot but confeſſe,
that the righteous Lord hath ſent theſe ſignes vnto vs, to
forewarne vs of our wickedneſſe, leaſt by the ſharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
rods of Gods wrath wee be moſt iuſtly puniſhed
with ſword and famine. But now behold on the other ſide
of this Herring, were fiue Characters moſt perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen,
ſome of them vſual, and wel knowne among vs at
this day, others ſtrange and not vnderſtood: but what the
God of all power and might will giue hereby to be known
is left to better iudgement, notwithſtanding let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that as it once pleaſed God by the finger of his
power to write on the wall a heauie ſentence againſt <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſar,</hi>
ſo hath it pleaſed him at this preſent to write
on this Herring vndoubtedly a heauie ſentence againſt
the ſinnes of this age, thereby to call this drowſie worlde
out of the damnable ſléepe of ſinne and wickednes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it hath ſlugged ſo long a time. Then what is he that
ſéeing the ſame, and dreading the hot vengeance of the
Lord, will not be inforced with <hi>Balthaſar</hi> to ſhake and
tremble at the grieuous iudgements which is therby like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee threatned: if <hi>Balthaſar</hi> being a heathen King,
ſhooke ſo ſore at the handwriting on the wall, wel may all
Chriſtians harts ſhake to ſée, and there withall to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what fearefull ſentence may vpon the Herring be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen.
When our Sauiour Chriſt did write vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:15608:4"/>
ground, before thoſe that accuſed the woman of adulterie,
her accuſers were therby ſo confounded in conſcience, that
for very ſhame they ſlipt away out of his ſight: how much
more then may we be confounded at the ſight &amp; interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of theſe ſtrange characters, which the Lord hath
not written on the ground in the duſt of the earth, but in
the very meat which we ſhould eat, thereby (as it were)
laying his indgements in our diſhes, at euery meale to be
remembred. For who is ignorant that among the fiſhes
of the ſea, there is none ſo common at our table as the
Herring, no fiſh more vſed in any land, nor better knowne
among all ſorts of people: whereby it is iuſtly to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Lord hath ſent it for a generall warning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his people: the Lord grant our heartes may be moued
thereby. Moreouer, this Herring was full fouretéene
inches in length: importing (as I coniecture) that this
iudgement threatned againſt the world for ſinne is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
and no vſuall iudgement, but ſuch as the eyes
of men haue ſeldome or neuer ſéene: beſides, the markes
were all of red and bloody colour. The Lord for Chriſtes
ſake be merciful vnto vs, &amp; giue vs grace with ſuch repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
harts to turne from our ſinnes, that he may turne his
iuſt wrath from vs. This Herring among a number of
others was taken on the 26. day of Nouemb. 1597. néer
vnto <hi>Drenton,</hi> ſometime the ancient and chiefe Cittie of
the kingdome of <hi>Norway.</hi> And after it was ſhewen to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the nobility, &amp; magiſtrates of that countrey. The
portraiture thereof &amp; admonition was firſt printed in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,</hi>
by <hi>Iohn van Doetec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m</hi> in the Dutch tongue, &amp;
out of the ſame language tranſlated into Engliſh, for the
profite and inſtruction of our countrey people. The Lord
God Almighty giue vs grace to watch and waite for the
comming of the heauenly brydegroome, that being decked
and attired in the true wedding garment of Chriſtes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
we may enter with him to the heauenly banket,
