            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

G, not stirring my hand till I come to the foote or paw at H, where I finish it quite at E, or the heele.

               <p>To begin with the definition, the Sence of seeing is a facultie of the sensible soule, whose Organe is the Eye, and obiect is whatsoeuer may be seene.</p>

                  <hi>Empedocles</hi> (as also <hi>Plato</hi>) thought there was in the eye a certaine little fire not burning, but which yeelded as it were a light, the beames whereof, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the beames of the ayre or <hi>medium,</hi> grew vnited, and more strong betweene both which beames the sight was effected.</p>

               <p>To the fourth argument I answere, that distance being not perceiued by the eye, but by the common sence, the point of the <hi>Pyramis</hi> is not lesser to mine eye, by remouing or going backe, but alwaies one and the selfe same.</p>
               <p>To the fift, it is not the sight of the woman that infecteth the glasse, but certaine grosse and putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vapors, that issue from the eies, as we see in those that doe <hi>laborare opthalmia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the sixt, of the Basiliske, I answere the most haue held it fabulous, yet suppose it to be true, the best authors haue written that infection proceedeth from his breath not his eyes.</p>
               <p>To the seuenth and last, it is replied, that cats and wolues retaine a certaine naturall light in <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To conclude to these and all other obiections for emission of the sight, in briefe I answere with this <hi>dilemma</hi> vnanswerable.</p>
               <p>If any thing be sent out from the eye it is either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal or incorporeal, if corporeal, it hath <hi>motu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> locale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or mouing in place and time, which motion seemeth to be swifter then the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the heauen, for the eye in a minute can discerne from one part of the heauen to the other, which were repugnant to truth and all Philosophie. Say it were light and no corporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it followed, though that a sensitiue part of the soule went forth with the same, and that an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent should become the subiect of the soule, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be granted more absurd. If incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as Metaphysicall, it cannot mooue the sence: Now it remaineth, that according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the truth, wee decide this controuersie concerning the sight, wherein so many famous Philosophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
