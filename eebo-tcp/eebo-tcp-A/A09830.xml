            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

letter: Seeing they are
most lively, &amp; giue a
farre greater lustre in
your selfe, where God
hath planted them, then can be expressed by
the blunt &amp; vnlearned Pen of a Souldier. But
seeing God hath made them so transparent, &amp;
hath kindled in you so holy a flame of loue and
zeale vnto the true &amp; onely worship of his name:
<pb facs="tcp:19843:3"/>
Me thinkes this plaine translation of mine, not
for any worth that is in me, but for the subiects
sake, hath found out a fitt Patronesse, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
&amp; practize affordetth a reall confutation of
that superstition which is here vnmasked,</p>
            <p>And so much the more presuming vpon your
Ladiships favour &amp; gentle acceptance: in regard
I dedicated this same Authours former refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon the invocation of Saincts, vnto my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Lord your husband; so that now, as God
hath made you one, I may make you both equally
interressed in this one subiect (though diversly
handled) striving for that honour, which is due
vnto his name.</p>
            <p>These Popish iuglings cannot bee vnknowne
to your Ladiship, seeing the vnholy blood of <hi>Hales</hi>
(which did cleere &amp; thicken as the Pilgrims purse
was light or heavie) is of your owne house, &amp; of
so fresh remembrance, whereby your honourable
Auncestours did learne to detest such divelish
cousenage, as the burned bones of your most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Granfather did long agoe witnesse, to all the
worlde.</p>
            <p>Moreover, (Madame) there are also some
abhomiations in this disputation, which I know
made my Authors pen to tremble in copying
of them out, and mine to quake in translating
them: others againe, which may drawe from
your Ladiship a chast smile and a modest blush:
<pb facs="tcp:19843:3"/>
but let the shame light vpon their heads, who are
the authors thereof: &amp; the more they blaspheme
and dishonour our blessed God &amp; Saviour, the
more let vs worship and honour him, and learne
as Bees to sucke honey from banefull weedes, or as
cunning Physicians to extract Antidotes from
poyson, since God turneth the very abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; execrations of the wicked, as exsamples
for the good &amp; edification of his children.</p>
            <p>Here with (Madame) as with the chiefe

marche pouldron to pouldron with them

this translation, free from ostentation:
onely my ambition is (in tracing after the
stepps of my Authour) to haue one flurt at
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> and one push at the fall of the
great <hi>whore of Babylon,</hi> and so much the
rather, because mine eyes haue seene some
of her fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which some others haue
but heard.</p>
            <p>But it may seeme strange to some, that
a souldier should vndertake such a taske, as
<pb facs="tcp:19843:4"/>
not appertaining to his profession: as that
man judges me a souldier, so I entreat him
to esteeme me a Christian, and then both
hee and I shalbe consonant.</p>
            <p>Wel then, into whose handes soeuer this

God hath alreadie inlightened, let vs sing
an everlasting <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> &amp; giue praise vnto

I entreate them to reade it, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it, for alas they are not able: because it
is grounded and bounded vpon &amp; within
the sacred word of God, and seconded by
the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the most holy Fathers. That
were as if they should runne in vpon Gods
two-edged sword. That were as if a falling

it were better for them to suffer it to
graze vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their stonie hearts then to resist.
And for my part, I will daylie praye vnto
the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> to illuminate and water
their soules with the beames and streames
of his <hi>Sunne of righteousnesse,</hi> that as Eagles
wee maye soare vp onely vnto him with
<pb facs="tcp:19843:5"/>
the wings of our faith, in whom alone is

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is more then two
yeeres past, since a
marchant of this ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers
of our French
Church, came to
shewe mee in my
lodging two cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of an Epistle, published by the <hi>Canons</hi>
of <hi>Awcon</hi> in Germanie, touching the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
due vnto their reliques: which
a friend of his, a zealous lover of the trueth
<pb facs="tcp:19843:6"/>
had sent him, with expresse charge to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it vnto me in his behalf, &amp; earnestly to
request me, to returne some answere vpon
it. Wherevnto, considering that I could
not so suddenly accomplish his desire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of my other employements, hee
thought good not to limit mee any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
time: but that I should vndertake &amp;
finish this worke at my leisure. This is the
cause, that I haue made noe great hast in
composing this treatise, which I haue distri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buted
into three partes: In the scope there
of, I haue followed the order &amp; the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the ancient Prophets and Apostles,
as also their true Successours, and Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
who haue all maintained with one
common accord, that God onely ought
to be worshipped by his people, &amp; will not
haue this seruice giuen to anie other, by
the authentique, and irreprehensible testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of holy Scripture, the which God
hath armed with an inviolable authoritie,
to the end, that those which feare him,
might make noe scruple to receive it who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to giue full beliefe therevnto.</p>
            <p>True it is, that I haue annexed vnto it
some attestations of the ancient Fathers,
not to approoue the foolish imagination
of the Romanists, but that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:19843:6"/>
maye take more force &amp; credit: seeing
she hath receiued it alreadie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, who
is the authour thereof: or that the trueth
of it, which is infalliable, should depende
vpon the advise and jugement of our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
&amp; predecessours, which might erre:
but rather to shewe the Doctours of the
Romane church, who relye more vpon the
authority of men, then vpon Gods in the
poincts which concerne our controversies,
that their conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation is not onely found
in the decrees of divine Law: but also in the
recordes of the pastours of the primitiue
Church: yea euen in theirs whome they
choose for their Iudges and defendaunts.</p>
            <p>I call the Epistle of these <hi>Canons</hi> Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
in the beginning of my disputation:
because after I had conferred it with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins</hi>
booke, the first tutour of these Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
vpon this subject, I finde it is but a
patching together of his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he sought to prooue the worshipping
of the reliques of Saincts.</p>
            <p>I meant not to vse in the resutation of
their Epistle anie elegant speech, or anie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution
and readiousnesse in wordes:
because the trueth (without borrowing else
where) hath ornaments enough in her self:
and when shee is simple, and in her naked
<pb facs="tcp:19843:7"/>
robes, shee taketh the more delight in such
as fetts her foorth, &amp; represents her before
the view of al men, in roundnesse and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie.</p>
            <p>Forasmuch then, as wee cannot resist to
much, nor too often the heresies which
daylie multiplie in this wicked worlde: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the foolish superstition of those
which would attribute to the reliques of
mortall man, the honour belonging vnto
the sole maiestie of the immortall God: al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though
that <hi>Calvin, Chemnicius</hi> and some
other excellent Divines, haue taken penn in
hand to oppose themselues against the first
inventours and advancers of this Idolatrie:
yet I haue also thought it my duty, to giue
foorth this disputation against the new
protecters of this superstition, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
against the <hi>Canons</hi> of Awco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: because
it may be availeable to the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church
(as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) that manie bookes
be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon one subject: prouided that
they be made in diversity of stile, but not in
diuersity of beliefe, seeing that by this
meanes heretickes are the more convicted,
and on the otherside, wee open the more
passages for the Children of God, to escape
from the call, and out of the snares of these
fowlers, &amp; offer them sundry sorts of coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpoysons
<pb facs="tcp:19843:7"/>
to preserue their braines from
the venoume of their Sophistrie.</p>
            <p>As for the rest, there are manie conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which mooued mee to dedicate
this treatise vnto you: For I will not
here speake of that holy zeale, which made
you expose your person and goods, from
your youth, aswel in the defence of our iust
cause at S, Amands, and in some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
adioyning therevnto, wherein you bore
the brunt of the first persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as for the

iudging well of our disputations against
the traditions of the papisticall Doctors,
and cheifly in this, vpon the reliques of the
Saincts departed.</p>
            <p>For as in the daies of your ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, you
haue seen the abuse of this superstition, &amp;
quickly after your conversion manifested
vnto the worlde, that you had it in abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
so having as it were this smal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
alreadie printed your heart: I assure
my self that yow will approue it, and will
finde that whatsoeuer I haue alledged ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in,
is grounded vpon the experience of
trueth, the instruction of the <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

            <head>A DISPVTATION
against the worshipping of
the Reliques of Saincts
departed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the Idolatries in the
world, there is none more
displeasing to God, nor
more hurtfull to a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
man, then that
which he committeth by
the religious worshipping
of the bones and reliques
of the dead. For, if God would never suffer,
that we should worship his living creatures, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
after his owne image &amp; likenesse; noe not
his Angels themselves, which are pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
and haue noe participation with our
humane corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how much lesse wil he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
vs to attribute that honour due vnto his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
Maiesty, to the bones &amp; garments of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bodies returned into ashes? Moreover if the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19843:10"/>
worshippers of the false Gods haue estranged
themselves from our Creator,<note place="margin">Ier. 13. 17. 13.</note> who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of living waters, to digg them pitts that
can containe noe water: how much more are
all those gone astray out of the right waie of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which runne after I know not what pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of old raggs, in-uented at their pleasure,
and seeke for the light of lyfe, among the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of death.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the Canons of Awcon in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,
haue not long since put forth an index
of their relickes, with a Iesu-iticall Epistel stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
with false gloses and sophisticall reasons, to
stirt-vp thereby the poore abused people of this
age vnto the visitation of their said reliques, and
to change at an instant, their natural stupiditie
into a self-obstinacie, by preferring the deceitful
shewes of religion, before he service which God
prescribs vs in his holy word. So I desiring to ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>complish
the earnest request of some of my frein<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des,
and also my vocation which bindes mee to
pre-advertise the ignorant to take heed of these
blind-leaders, which leads them vnto perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
haue spent some houres in composing of this
Treatise, that may serue as a preseruative to the
weake, against the venomous errours eontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the saide writing, as a morning-watch to
awaken &amp; rouse vp the sluggish, as a Guide to
such as are gone astray out of the path of truth,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19843:10"/>
and as a spurre to the dull to convert them to
God, &amp; to divert them from the pernicious
adoration of things dead &amp; corruptible, vnto
the wholsome worship of our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the onely God living &amp; incorruptible,
who is a spirit, and loues such as worship him
in spirit &amp; truth.</p>
            <p>Whereunto I will indevour to bring them
by three degrees. First,<note place="margin">The depu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts.</note> I will lay downe to
them the principall causes for which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are not permitted to doe anye religious
seruice vnto the reliques of the dead.</p>
            <p>Afterward, I will refute the arguments
of the Canons of Awcon, whereby they seeke
to prooue the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Finally, I will advertise the Reader of the
falsities of those reliques specified in their
index.</p>
            <p>I will confirme this my proposition (<hi>that
Christians are not permitted to doe any religious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the reliques of the dead</hi>) by three reasons:
whereof the first shall be, that the tradition of
visiting and reuerencing religiously the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
of the departed Saints, hath no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the holy Scripturs, nor from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of those which haue followed invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
their paterne.</p>
            <p>The second, how some Christians inconsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in
their waies, hauing learned this superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19843:11"/>
ceremony in the Schoole of the Gentiles,
haue brought it into the Primitiue Church
about foure hundred yeeres after Christ.</p>
            <p>The third, that the consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
abuses, sprung from this wicked custome,
nourished and maintayned yet vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Idolaters Synagogue, ought to
mooue and stirre vp the true worshippers of
God, wholly to banish it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church.</p>
            <p>Touching the first poynt of my admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
surely we finde in the Byble,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part.</note> that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Patriarckes and their children haue buried
honourably their dead, according to the
ordinance of the Lord,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19</note> 
               <hi>Thou art dust, &amp; to dust
shalt thou returne;</hi> but we read not in any place
of it, that they haue torne their bodies, and
tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sported them by peece-meal after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasse:
placed their bones in sundrie places,
showne their garments to the vulgar people
with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to worship them, and promisse
that in calling vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should be heard,
Neither reade wee also in it, that God hath
commanded vs by his auncient prophets, to
goe on pilgrimage to those parts where their
inheritours had carried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to offer vp there
vnto them burning tapers and holy candles,
to touch, salute &amp; kisse their bones with great
devotion: Much lesse reade we in it, that God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19843:11"/>
hath prescribed them to sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nize the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of their reliques by certain convocations
of the people &amp; publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of solemne fests,
nor yet to load the Churches &amp; Altars with
them, nor to carry them vppon their necks &amp;
shoulders, nor to walke vp &amp; downe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in processions; to the intent to moue every
one to reverence them, with confidence to
obtaine succour from God and his Saincts by
worshipping them.</p>
            <p>And albeit that the Patriarke <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
his son, grounding them-selues vpon the
truth of Gods promisse, that he would giue
for an inheritance to their posterity the land
of Canaan, enioyned their children to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them forth of Egypt, when the houre of
their deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce should come into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey
which God had promissed them: and that
<hi>Moses</hi> tooke their bones alonge with him
when the children of Israel came forth of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt:
notwithstanding he never shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto the people of God in his greatest distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
either in his passage through the redd sea,
or in the wildernesse: much lesse did he lift
them vp into the ayre, and sett them vppon a
Perch (as he did the brasen serpent) or orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that any should behold them, with sted
fast assurance that every of them should bee
delivered from their euils by contemplating
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19843:12"/>
them: but contrary wise he kept them secret,
&amp; close in their coffins: and the Elders of the
people that surviued <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be buried so soone as they arrived
in the land of Canaan,<note place="margin">Ios. 24. 32</note> in a field which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
&amp; <hi>Iacob</hi> had bought before time of the
sonns of <hi>Hamor</hi> the father of <hi>Sechem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> sheweth vs,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21 13. 14.</note> that K.
<hi>Dauid</hi> hauing taken the bones of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inhabitants of Gabish Gilead
which had taken them vp from the streete of
Beth-shan, brought them from thence into
the contrey of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> caused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the sepulchre of <hi>Kis</hi> the father of <hi>Saul,</hi>
and that in the Solemnizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their funer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
his subjects did all that the King co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them: but there is no mention made of
any pilgrimage, or any religious seruice: which
they should doe in honour of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about their
Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>Likewise,<note place="margin">2 Kings. 23. 17.</note> in the second booke of kings, the
Authour of this Historie writeth, that King
<hi>Iosiah</hi> willing to prophane the Altar which
King <hi>Ieroboham</hi> had caused to be built in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,
and to dishonour eternally the Priests &amp;
other Idolaters, which he had maintained
there; caused the bones of the false priests &amp;
other their confederates to be digged vp, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to burne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vppon the same
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19843:12"/>
Altar: But on the contrary espying an other
Tombe in the same Cittie, demanded of the
cittize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thereof, <hi>What title is that which I see?</hi> &amp;
hauing vnderstod by their answer, that it was
the sepulchre of the man of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prophesied the things which the sayde
King came then to doe vpon that very Altar,
to shewe the publick reverence he bore vnto
that man of God even after his buriall, bad
the inhabitants of Bethel <hi>Let him alone, let none
remoue his bones,</hi> whereto this Historia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> addeth,
that the citizens of the said city obeied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
king <hi>Iosiahs</hi> commandement.</p>
            <p>Although the holy Scriptures giues vs to
vnderstand, that among all that are borne of
woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God hath not raised vp more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
servants of his house, then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Baptist:</hi> nor a more faithfull Martyr of his son
Christ Iesus then S. Stephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, one of the seaven
deacons of the Apostolique Church, &amp; one of
the first witnesses of Christ persecuted in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:
Neueverthelesse their bodies were
presently interred after their departure, that
of <hi>Moses</hi> by God himself after a miraculous
manner,<note place="margin">Deut. 34. 6.</note> in the contrey of Moab, in a place
vnknowne vnto the children of Israel, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible
for the deuil, to the end, they might
not abuse it by Idolatrie: that of S. <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
by his disciples, and S. <hi>Stephens</hi> by some
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19843:13"/>
men that feared God,<note place="margin">Marc. 6. 29. Act. 8. 2. Iud. ver. 5</note> as appeareth by the
History of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Gospel according to
S. <hi>Marke,</hi> the book of the Acts of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and the Epistle of S. <hi>Iude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among all the auncient Prophets, there is
none whose buriall is more memorable then
that of the Prophet <hi>Elishas;</hi> in regard it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to raise vp miraculously by touching
of his dead and buryed bodie: a man which
in great hast for feare of their enemies they
had cast into the grave of this prophet,
as we read in the second booke of Kings &amp;
2. Chap, howbeit the Authour of this historie
addeth not for all that, that the Priests of the
old Testament, haue commanded the people
of God to resort vnto that tombe, to offer vp
their praiers and sacrifices, or that they insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
any Feasts vpon certain daies in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of this miracle, or enclosed the bones
of this Prophet into a shrine, or chose out any
expresse place to raise vp some altar in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or did perswade any to resort thither
from all partes, to offer vp there their praiers
and sacrifices in the name of the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as if it were before the face of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Morover the prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> hauing respect
vnto the auncient custome of interring the
dead, and hiding them in their graues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19843:13"/>
the sepulchres of the righteous vnto
bedds, to shew by this similitude, that wee can
doe noe greater pleasure to God, nor a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour to his wel-beloved Sainctes after
their departure, then to wrap vp their bodies
in the beddes of the Earth, to rest there from

in which Christ wil come to awaken &amp; call

            <p>I say moreover, that the greatest hypocrits
among the last Doctors of Israel, to wit, the
Scribes and Pharises, who through hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and vaine glorie buylt vp the sepulchres
of the prophets, and repaired the tombles of
the righteous, stoned &amp; massacred to death
by their auncestors did not deterre their corp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
to dismember them, and shew their bones
vnto the meaner sort of people, or to adorne
the Altars of the Tempel of Ierusalem with
them, but suffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to rest in their graues,
as Christ himself witnesseth in the 23. Chap.
of S. <hi>Mathews</hi> Gospel, the 27. verse and the
next following.</p>
            <p>Touching the Apostles &amp; disciples of our
Saviour Christ, the historie of his burial shews
vs, that S. Peter &amp; S. Iohn approching neere
vnto his sepulchre, to see whether he was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
risen or noe, found there his kerchief with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19843:14"/>
his linen clothes laied aside, but the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> noteth more expresly, that they came
thither one after another, to behold the more
earnestly his hand-kerchief and linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
he had left behinde him after his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
addeth not (which neverthelesse would have
ben soo much the more remarkeable) that
they either handled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or bore awaie those
reliques with them, to shewe them vnto their
con-disciples, or put them into any shrine or
boxe, which with out all doubt they would
haue done, if they had receued any such charg
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. or if they could haue gathered by
any of his familliar speeches he had with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
before, that such a collection &amp; transportatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his reliques would haue pleased him after
his resurrection, &amp; haue ben as a fitt meanes,
to confirme their bretheren in the Christian
faith.</p>
            <p>As for S. <hi>Luke</hi> who discribs vnto vs all the
memorable acts of the Apostles, since the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention
of Christ, vntil the second yeere of S.
<hi>Pauls</hi> imprisonment at Rome, to the intent
they might serue as a miror and exsample to
all our actions, he makes no recitall, nor rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
vp in his second booke any of Christs
reliques, his Parents or faithful Martyrs, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by his Apostles, or giuen into the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of their frends: but hee shewes that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19843:14"/>
christians of his time perseuered with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
in the sincere doctrine of the H. Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and in breaking of bread, the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
and memorialls of the instructions &amp;<note place="margin">Act. 2. 42</note>
suffrances of our sole Redeemer Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Apostle S. Peter while
he was living, would not promisse the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia,
Capadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, to leave after
his death any other reliques behinde him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his Epistles which he wrote vnto them, as him
self declareth by these wordes, that <hi>he wold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
alwaies</hi> (to wit,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 15.</note> by his writings) <hi>that they
also might bee able to haue rememberance of those
things after his departure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could here alleadg for this purpose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excellent admonitions, and notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the auncient Fathers, and true succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
of the Apostles: by which they shew
vs, that they vnderstood right well, that the
last degree of honour, and charitable office
which survivours are bound to yeild vnto the
dead, according to the rule of holy Scripture,
and the custome of the chiefest fathers, aswel
of the olde, as of the niew Testament, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in burying of their corpses: but for this
present I will onely recite that which <hi>Origen</hi>
writeth thereof in his disputations against
<hi>Celsus,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his firste booke of the

            <p>Humane bodies (<hi>saith Origen</hi>) hauing once ben

thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>According to which S. Augustine saieth,</hi>
that we ought not to dishonour and reiect the bodies
of the departed, especially those of the faithfull, which
the H. Ghost vsed as vessells &amp; instruments vnto
all good workes. For if our affection hath ben
great towards our Parents, the more pleasing is their
garment or ringe vnto posterity, their corps which
touch vs more neerly; and with whom wee haue
more familiarity, ought in noe wise to bee dispised,
sith they serue not onely for an aide &amp; ornament,
but also partly vnto humane Nature. From hence
it proceedeth that through a seruiceable piety they
haue heretofore taken care for the buriall of the
righteous, solemnized their funeralls, and prouided
for their interring.<note place="margin">Tob. 12. 13.</note> As for <hi>Tobie</hi> hee obtained

daies some of the imitatours of the Gentiles,
begann (as we shall vnderstand hereafter) to
attribute more honour vnto the Martyrs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in times past, and to solemnize the constancie
of their faith and other christian vertues, with
the like pompe and solemnity, as the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

Marathon. Neverthelesse, their principall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
S. <hi>Ierom</hi> alleadgeth for their excuse,
that the ceremonies which they did about the

were even men, when the Lyconians hold them
for</hi> Iupiter <hi>and</hi> Mercurius, <hi>and would have

Chistians of his time should bee so debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
as to transferre the worship due vnto
God, vnto the ashes of their Martyrs, that
contrari-wise he denieth, that they did not
once thinke to worship any other creature,
which he preferreth before the reliques of
Saincts, by this manner of speech follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>We neither serue nor worship, I say not
onely the reliques of Saincts, but also the Sonne
and Moone, neither Angels nor Archangels,
neither Cherubines, nor Seraphins, nor any name
which is named, either in this world, or in that
which is to come: Least we should rather serue
the creature, then God, who is blessed for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
Now we honour the reliques of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
to worship him whose Martyrs they are.</hi>
From whence it appeareth plainely, that
the collection and religious seruice which
those of the Papacie doe vnto the reliques
of such as God hath with-drawne long
since out of this world, being not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon any commande of the Lord, nor
from the' exsample of any of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of his diuine Majesty,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 23</note> can neither
be acceptable to God, nor available vnto
those superstitious men which giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19843:18"/>
to this Idolatrie through a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
devotion, without faith or assurance
that God doth approove it in his holy
word, which is the light of our faith, the
rule of our religion, the measure of all our
devotion, the guide of our conversation, &amp;
a lawe for all our workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 14 23 He. 11. 6 1. Sam. 15. 22.</note> without which
all our actions &amp; intentions are but sinne,
displeasing to our Souveraigne Lord, who
had rather that we should obay, and be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue
to his voice, then to offer sacrifice.
Now if there were noe other consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
then this which I haue expressed, it were
sufficient enough to make them renounce
this errour: but the perversity and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie
of such, as take for a light their fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

the exsample of their predecessors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines
me to proceede forward vnto the

that the Christians in time past haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this superstitious veneration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the departed, in the Gentils scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
and since haue followed it, and brought
it into the primatiue Church by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

because that heretofore the source and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
thereof was but small and simple:
whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> and some other Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
propounds vs a cleare exsample in the
life of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour: For they
all confesse with one accord, that this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
thought good to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
to immitate many sumptuous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies,
which the gentiles vsed in solemniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the funeralls of their ancestours, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in tansporting the dead corps of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
personnages, and men of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume
in their Contrey, out of base and

            <p>But they witnesse in noe place, that hee

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19843:19"/>
that they should salute and kisse

Devill taking hold and making vse of the

it litle by litle into a ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>surable superstition.
For since that time many Christians haue
suffred them-selues to bee carryed away
through there in considerate Zeale from
one vanity vnto another, imagining with
them-selues, that the bodies of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deserued more, or asmuch seruice after
their departure as the infidels: were not
onely contented to remoue them from farr
and remote places of their countreies, into

assembled in those days to watch &amp;
pray, and to doe therein some others rites
of religion, because then they had no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And euen thus sought to eternize
the memorie of their vertues, by building
them Sumptuous tombes, &amp; solemnising,
their funeralls with too excessiue praises.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To shew then to euery man, that Sathan

instituted this Ceremonie, I wil onely
alledg without reciting the testimonies of
other Historians, what Plutarke writeth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19843:19"/>
thereof in his discourse vpon the interring
of</hi> Theseus <hi>and</hi> Cimon. <hi>His wordes are
these,</hi> that when <hi>Cimon</hi> by fore of armes had
conquered the Ile of Scycros, bee remembred
with himself, that the auncient Theseus sonne
vnto Ageus, flying from Athens came into
that Ileland, where Lycomedes for some bad sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
hee had of him, caused him to be slayne
by tresaon. Now by all meanes hee laboured to
finde out his graue, in regard the Athenians
had receaved before an or Oracle or prophesie
from Apollo (<hi>or to speake more properly
from the Deuill,</hi>) by which hee commaunded
them to bring backe to Athens the bones and
ashes of Theseus, &amp; to honour him as a Demy-God:
but hee knew not where they had enterred
him, because the inhabitants of that Ile kept his
graue secret and vnknowen, and would suffer
no man to seeke it out: Howbeit; Cimon vsing
all expedition to search it out, espied by chance
an Aegle, which strook the ground with her
beake and talents, in a place some what higher
then the rest, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it came into his minde,
(as it were by divine inspiration) to cause that
place to be digged, where they found the graue of
some great corps, and the poynt of a brasen lance
with a sworde. In such sorte, that hauing at last
found the tombe, he tooke forth <hi>Theseus</hi> bones,
and brought them into the Admirall-Galley
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19843:20"/>
somptuously adorned, and transported them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
into his Contrey foure hundred yeeres after
<hi>Thesius</hi> had departed from thence. For this
seruice the people receaued him with great ioy
and he gott thereby the good will of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which receaved theise reliques with great
Applause, with somptuous sacrifices, &amp; processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as if <hi>Thesius</hi> himself had ben liuing, and
had returned back again into the Citie. And his
reliques are in the midst of the Towne, yet vnto
this day, neere vnto the Parcke where the young
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> resort together for the excercising of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

bones &amp; ashes were brought back againe into
Attica. Notwithstanding the inhabitants of the
towne of Citium honour still a certaine Tombe
which they affirme should be Cimons, because
that in the time of a great dearth &amp; famine they
had an oracle (<hi>that is an answere from the
Deuill</hi>) which commaunded them to haue a care
vnto Cimon, and not to neglect him, but to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reverence him as a God, as Nancicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
the Orator hath recorded it in writting. <hi>The

Now al-be it that the Christians &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers
of the primitiue Church, were borne
away with the torrent of this heathenish
custome, wherevnto the Emperour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine
had opened the sluces, passing
beyond the boundes of Christian puretie &amp;
simplicity: yet the honour which they did
about the graues &amp; bons of their Martyrs,
was in noe wise comparable, nor so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
as that was of the Athenians, and

consider what S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith thereof in
his 8. booke of the cittye of God. <hi>Wee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
(saith hee) <hi>build Temples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. 1. 8. ciuitat. Dei. c. 27</note> 
               <hi>nor make priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
nor sacrifies, nor any other diuine seruice, as
a religion to the Martyrs. For they are not
our Gods, but their God is ours. Truth it is,
that wee honour their memorie, as the holy men
of God. Which haue fought valiantly for the
truth euen vnto the death of their bodies, to the
end, that true religion might bee knowne &amp; the
false convicted. What man is it amonge the
faithfull that ever heard a preist say standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Altar, built vppon the corps of Some
Martyre to the honour and seruice of God,</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Paul <hi>or</hi> Cyprian <hi>I offer thee Sacrifice, seing
that in memorie of them wee offer vp vnto God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19843:21"/>
who hath made them both men and martyrs, &amp;
hath conioyned them through a celestiall glorie
vnto his angels, that in the assembly of the people,
wee might giue thankes vnto the true God for
their victories, and by the remembrance of their
crownes &amp; palmes, might exhort others vnto the
imitation of their vertues. The funeralls then
which the religious solemnize by the monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of the Martyrs, are noe other-wise then orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their memorialls, &amp; noe sacrifices which
they doe offer vnto the dead as vnto Gods.</hi> These
are S. <hi>Augustins</hi> wordes, by which hee testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
that notwith-standing the ouverture,
which the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his time made vnto
this paganish superstition, in solemnising
the Martyrs feastes: yet true pietie &amp; the
right invocation of the name of God bore
some sway and aucthority amonge them.
But if S. <hi>August.</hi> and his fellow-souldiers,
could haue ben able to haue prevented the
euils and mischiefs that this superstition
drew after her taile, they would then haue
redoubled their forces and fell vppon her
with all their might, to haue hindred her
from winning so many countryes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.</p>
            <p>So then it is my duty to excuse them,
considering they opposed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfs against
her, both by word and writing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:19843:21"/>
To begin with S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi>
giues him this testimonie,<note place="margin">Aug. li. 6. de co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fess. cap. 2.</note> that hee did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his Mother, and some other of his
frendes, from frequenting of those publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
feasts, which the Christians solemnized
yeerely in praise of their Martyrs, &amp; that
for sundry reasons, among others, <hi>Quia illa
quasi parentalia superstitioni Gentilium essent
simillima, (that is to say</hi>) because that theise
funerall banquets, and solemne feasts, held
in honour of their neerest kinred, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
like vnto the superstition of the
Gentils.</p>
            <p>As for S. <hi>Augustin</hi> himself, he plainely
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demns it in his eight booke of the Citie
of God, wherein hee doth not coulour it,
but saies that such as brought their victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
vnto the sepulchres of the Martyrs, to
solemnize there their feastes, were not of
the better sort of Christians.</p>
            <p>The same authour returning an answere
vnto the reproch which the Manicheans
made against him, to wit, that those which
vaunt themselues so much at the name of
Christians, worshipped notwithstanding the
Tombes of Martyrs, following therein the
exsample of the Heathen, saith (<hi>Pick mee
not out from among the Christian name; those
which neither know, nor follow the vertue of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19843:22"/>
their profession? seeke me not out the troupes
of ignorant men which are superstitious, euen in
the true religion, and so much giuen ouer vnto
their pleasures, that they haue forgotten what
they promised vnto God. I know</hi> (saith hee)
<hi>that there are many which adore the monuments
&amp; pictures. &amp;c. and among so great a multitude
of people it is no wonder. Cease then I pray you
at last from slandering the Catholique Church,
in blaming the fashion of those, which her self
condemneth and hath evermore sought to correct
as wicked childeren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also hee complaineth in his Epistle hee
wrote vnto <hi>Ianuarius.</hi> That they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
mens consciences with seruil burdens,
and addeth thereunto, that the condition
of the Iewes was more tollerable then that
of the Christians, because men had made
them subject onely to the burdens of the
Lawe: but Christians vnto humane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
that is, according to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
taken among them-selues, obstinatly to
maintaine them to prejudice the truth. He
confesseth likewise therein, that the church
of God being pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted amonge much chaffe
&amp; daernell tolerated many things which
neuer-the-lese her self did niether doc, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue,
nor conceale. Also hee plainely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
in that Epistle, that hee could not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19843:22"/>
allowe of diuerse things which they had
instituted in the Church of God, ouer and
besides the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t custome of the fathers,
of the old Testament, as if it were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of a Sacrement, which yet not-with-standing
he confesseth, on th'other
side, hee durst not so freely reject for avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the scandall of some persons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some were holy and others seditious,
where vpon hee openeth his minde more
clearely by the distinction which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundes
against <hi>Faustus</hi> saying, <hi>One thing
is that which wee support,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. contra Faustus. Lib. 20. cap. 21.</note> 
               <hi>another that which wee
are commaunded to teach, &amp; another that which
wee are commaunded to amend; and constrayned
to beare with, vntill wee haue amended it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If S. <hi>Augustin</hi> hauing conceaued some
hope, sought to cure his auditorie of this
contagious maladie, rather by gentlenesse
then by seuerity. Not-with-standing called
them wicked Children, superstitious euen
in the true religion, giuen ouer to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
forgetfull of that which they had
promissed to God, and finally that they
were not of the better sort of Christians,
would hee not crie out with greater vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
against the Idolaters of the Romish
Church, who scornefully and obstinately,
refuse the fit remedies which should purge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19843:23"/>
them of their bad humours, being laden
with so many corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s almost incurable?
would he not cry out louder, and tell them
that they are not of the better sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but of the wickedest? would hee not
call them with the Prophet <hi>Esaye</hi> a sinfull
nation:<note place="margin">Esa. 1.</note> a people lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with iniquitie, a seede
of the wicked, corrupt childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which haue
forsaken the Lord, and haue provoked the
holy one of Israel to anger?</p>
            <p>I could here produce many other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
to the like effect, were not these suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to conuict all contradictours, and
to shewe the ignorant, that S. <hi>Augustin</hi> &amp;
his fellow labourers (which liued foure hun
dred yeeres after Christ) perceiued noe soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the bitter fruit of this da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous plant,
which Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked spirit had brought
from the Athenian Schole into their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but they laboured with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to root it vp; &amp; hew downe the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof. From whence necessarely
we may inferre, that these <hi>Canons</hi> of Awcon,
which anone wee will refute more perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
bragg of the antiquity of this tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with false brauadoes, since God who is
the auncient of dayes, hath never taught
it to our Fathers, in the first dayes of his
grace, by his auncient Prophets, nor in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19843:23"/>
beginning of the latter by his Sonne Christ
Iesus and his Apostles, nor for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres after their time by their true
successours: but on the contrarie, raised vp
holy and faithfull Doctors to resist &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
it. So that the title of Heretiques
which they so vsually giue vs in all occurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
may by a good consequence be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpon them. And here-upon I entreat
the vnpassionate Reader, to censure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this reproch which S. <hi>Tertullian</hi> made
heretofore vnto their predecessours, who
alwaies had antiquety in their mouths and
noveltie in their braines, may not justly be
appropriated to them.<note place="margin">Tertul. in Apog. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Where is the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?

            </p>
            <p>Now resteth the lait part of our disputa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of nine seuerall abuses.</note>
that this law and custome of going
to salute the reliques of the dead, ought to
be abolished &amp; banished out of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
church, because of the manie-fold abuses
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19843:24"/>
which heretofore haue ben committed, &amp;
which they yet committ vnto this daye in
Christendome by obseruing them.<note place="margin">The first abuse.</note> The
first is, It withdraweth the hearts &amp; spirits
of men, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right waie by which it hath
pleased God to draw vs to the knowledge,
and enioying the benefits of his son Christ
Iesus. For in stead that God commandeth
vs to seeke his son in his word and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp; in th' assemly of the liuing, which
worship him in spirit and truth, amongst
whom he is found. It perswadeth vs the
contrarie to seeke him among the shrines
and reliques of the dead, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagny
of those which dwell in the dust of
the earth,<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 5.</note> where hee forbids them by his
Angel to seeke him. Againe, instead that
the Apostle exhorteth vs to seeke Christ in
Heauen where he sitteth at the right hand<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7. 16. Col. 3. 1. 2.</note>
of God his Father, and learnes vs to know
him after the spirit and to assend vp vnto
him in the high Places with the feete of our
faith, it councels vs the contrarie, to seeke
him and knowe him after the flesh, to seeke
him now here, and now there, some-times
by pilgrimages from one Contrey into an
other, and sometimes to descend into the
caues of the earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 23. 24.</note> to contemplate there
the reliques of his bodie, directly against
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19843:24"/>
his owne expresse prohibition quoted by
S. <hi>Mathew</hi> in the 24. Chap. of his Gospel.</p>
            <p>The second abuse is, that they haue
transported the reliques of Saincts into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
places, and admonished everie one to
resort thether vpon feastiuall daies dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their memory, and so they intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the simple with this false opinion, that
not only the saints but God himself taketh
delight in such pilgrimages, and that their
prayers made neere to the theise religious
reliques, are sooner heard of the Saincts, &amp;
of God himself, then when they are made
else where, as appeareth by the decree of

Counsel enioyneth all Bishops &amp; others, to whom

that (according to the vse of the Catholique and

of Christian Religion, the consent of holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the decrees of sacred Counsels) they
diligently instruct the faithfull in the Doctrine
of the interecssion and invocation of Saincts, in
honouring their reliques, and in the Lawfull vse
of images, admonishing them touching the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
that the holy Boddies of the Martyrs &amp;
other Saincts living with Christ, who while they
liued in this worlde were his liuely members &amp;
temples of the holy Ghost, whome one day hee
will raise vp and glorifie vnto eternall life, ought
to be reuerenced by the faithfull, because GOD
bestowes many benefits one men through those

their reliques are neither to be reuerenced, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
&amp; that the faithfull reverence them, and

that they in vaine frequent the places, wherein
such reliques are, to obtaine succour from the
Saincts, ought expresly to be comdemned, as for a

            </q>
            <p>I maintaine that this opinion is false,
that God heareth soner our Prayers neere
vnto the reliques of the dead, then else
where; because it is grounded on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
directly contrarie to the infallible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of holy Scripture, where of the
first is. That Christians are permitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
the departed Saincts, and to honour
religiously their reliques. The second,
that the deceased Saincts know whatsoeuer
is done vnder the Sunne, and consequently
vnderstand the Prayers of those which crie
vnto them in this world. The third, that
the Saincts after their departure, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the seruice of such as salute, kisse, and
honour their reliques, by way of religion.
Fourthly, that God hath instituted the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages
which they obserue in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church, and had rather be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in a place, wherein there is some reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19843:27"/>
reimprinted at <hi>Sedan</hi> my refutation against
the invocation of Saincts, by which I haue
represented vnto the reader the falshoode
of the three first principles, I will send the
Reader vnto it. But for the latter, I will
set downe before him, that which S. <hi>Gregorie
Nyssene</hi> iudgeth thereof in his Epistle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the pilgrims, that went to Ierusalem,
to see the sepulchre of Christ, and the most
remarkeable memoriall of our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>When the Lord (<hi>saith Gregorie Nyssene</hi>)<note place="margin">Gregorie Nyssene.</note>
calleth the blessed into the inheritance of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven, he places not amonge the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their workes which brings them thither,
the pilgrimage vnto Ierusalem, neither maketh
hee anie mention of such a worke, amonge the
number of the Blessed. And why should men
employ their time then, in doing that which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
makes them happie, nor is available vnto the
Kingdome of Heauen? Wherein cann that
man advantage himself, which should come into
those parts, as if more abundance of the holy
Ghost were there, and that his grace were more
ample in that place? If Grace were more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in Ierusalem, then sinne would not bee so
rife amonge those that inhabit there: but at this
present, there is noe manner of wickednesse which
is left vncommitted amonge them. Let our
exsample offend noe man, but let rather our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19843:27"/>
finde beliefe, seing wee diswade them from
that which wee haue seene with our eyes. As
for vs, before and after wee came thither, wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
confessed that Christ is true God, and our
faith was neither impaired, nor engmented therby.
This good I haue gathered by it, that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
I haue had therof, I must alwaies acknowledge,
that there is more sanctitie in vs, which
dwell fardest from it. You then which feare
God, praise him at home in the places were you
make your abode, for the alteration of the place
makes not God to come the neerer vnto you: But
wheresoeuer thou shall be, he wil come vnto the, if
he finds the Lodging of thy soule readie to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him. But if the inward man bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with wicked thoughts, thou shalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Christ, though thou wert in Golgotha, in
mount olivers, or in the tombe of his resurrection.
Perswade the Bretheren then, that they goe on
pilgrimage out of their Bodies vnto the Lord, &amp;
not out of Cappadocia into Palestina. If that
which was done there in the beginning did last
still, the holy Ghost dispensing his gifts in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of fire, then would it behooue vs all to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
there, where he maketh such distribution to
all: But if the Spirit bloweth where it pleaseth
him, those which haue beleeved there, are made
partakers of his diuine gift, according to the
proportion of their faith, and not according
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19843:28"/>
to their pilgrimage vnto Ierusalem.</p>

Martyrs, that in S. <hi>Augustins</hi> and
S. <hi>Ambroses</hi> time, the custome of bringing
victualls in memorie of the martyrs, was
forbidden by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> himself: that in
the ages ensuing, they haue attributed too
much honour vnto the memorie of the
Saincts, that some men of noe note, had
perswaded the simple, to place a false confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in a superfluous &amp; fond seruice, and
had added many other euils vnto it, to
wit, that the priestes &amp; monkes coveteous
of dishonest gaine, haue counterfeited reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
&amp; preached false miracles, to nourish
superstition in the hearts of men, and drew
them, rather vnto the admiration of their
miracles, then vnto the imitation of the
Saincts. Finally, that the Devill making
vse of the superstition of these men, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
euery day new reliques, when he saw
that the Bishops of the Romish church, were
so earnestly giuen to enquire foorth the
inventers and promoters of those reliques,
and they should finde therein (as he saith)
abuses, &amp; deceits, as great and as abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
as that was which S. <hi>Martyn</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couvered,
who passing by the sepulchre &amp;
reliquaire of a Martyr greatly renowned in

hee was throughly and seriously informed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19843:32"/>
thereof) that it was the tombe of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
caused it to be demolished, and cast
downe, that noe more mention might bee
made thereof, nor that they might vse it
any more after that superstitious manner. I
say, I shall not get much more, by repeating
Cassanders wordes vpon this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Iesuites who dommineere at this
present in the Romaine Church, approue
not all what this Catholique Doctour hath
writ, but according to the authority which
was giuen them by the Council of Trent,
commaunds al Readers to cancel &amp; deface

from the holy Scripture, and from the true
fathers and successours of the Apostles. As
for example, they commaund in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex

at Antwerp by <hi>Chrystopher Plantine</hi> Anno.

of the holy Sacrament of the Lordes

these Physitions make noe conscience, to
prescribe vnto Christians, that they should
apply their <hi>expurgatorie index</hi> vnto <hi>Cassander</hi>
books, to draw from them the pure blood
and vitall sappe, &amp; leaue nothing in them
but the corrupt and badd humours: haue

the limits of their rules and traditions in
his discourse abouesaid, &amp; so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they ought to cutt of what-soever they
judge therein vicious and superfluous?
Not-with-standing, there is the bodye of

that the Altars which are built vp and

of the Martyrs, In which one cannot
finde, that there hath ben enclossed the Bodies or
reliques of the Martyrs, should be cast downe if
it be possible by the Bishops of those places. But
if they cannot doe it because of the popular tumult,
Let them never-the-lesse admonish the people,
not to frequent such places, to the end, that those
which be wise, may not be carryed away with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.
And let them receiue noe where,

wherein their is some corps, and certaine reliques,

of some Martyr, or of his suffring: For wee haue

in giving eare vnto the dreames and
lies of all sort of Doters, hath opened the
way vnto many false reliques. Secondly,
that their foolish devotion made them lay
them vnder, and afterward neere vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.
Thirdly, that their obstinacie hath

from purging the Churches of them, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

We could also produce many sentences of

doing it, we should offend the Romanists,
who beleeue that Counsells cannot erre, to
alledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a proofe vnto the said Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
approoued long agoe by their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,

            <p>The fift abuse testifies,<note place="margin">THE fifth abuse.</note> that one supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

For as the Prelats of the Romane Church
make noe conscience to allure the silly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

to induce them the more, to put their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

permits their Idolaters to carrie them vpon

the way of his people from strangers, who

to wit,<note place="margin">Ier. 12. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord liveth:</hi> but the idolatrous
people which haue noe communior. with
him, sweare by <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beside, they are not ignorant that the
Apostle. S. <hi>Paul</hi> (according to the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the two &amp; seauentie interpretours)
translateth in his Epistle the word swearing
which the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> vseth in the 45.
Chapter of his prophesie, for a <hi>Confession,</hi>
from which exposition of the Apostles,
euerie man of a sounde judgment may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
by a necessary consequence, that as
the Apostle, calleth the swearing, made by
the name of God, a confession, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his divine Maiestie, and
of the Souveraine authority he hath ouer
all his Creatures: So on the contrary, wee
may tearme a deniall, and abiuration from
his name, euery oath which is sworne in the
name of the departed Saincts, or of their
reliques.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. For euen by their
owne consciences they are convicted. First,
by that testimonie which S. <hi>Peter</hi> giues vs,
in the booke of the Actes of the Apostles,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19843:36"/>
that there is noe saluation in any other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> neither is there any other name
vnder Heaven giuen vnto men, whereby
wee must bee saued. Secondly, by that of
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> in his Epistle to the Hebrewes, that
by the onely Sacrifice of Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note> wee haue
full deliverance, &amp; remission of our sinnes.
Thirdly,<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 12</note> by that of S. <hi>Iames</hi> in the fourth
Chapter of his Epistle, that there is but one
Law giuer, (to wit God) which is able to
saue, and to destroy. Who can then excuse
the malice and impietie of these Doctours,
which with holding the trueth in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
attribute to their Pope this diuine
aucthority, of forgiving and binding the
sinnes of men, according to his Law and
will, &amp; to the rotten reliques of dead bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the incommunicable power, onely
proper to Christ, who is able perfectly to
saue them, that come vnto God by him,
seeing he euer-liveth, to make intercession
for them? And how is it possible, that God
should bee so gentle and full of long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>france,
as to endure these sacriledges so
longe?</p>
            <p>The sixt abuse is, that the Monkes and
Priests of the papacy, more zealous in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a good fire in their kitchin, then the
ashes of the Martyrs and other deceased
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19843:36"/>
Saincts to make their reliques the more to
be respected, haue attributed to them the
power of doing many miracles, after the
manner and imitation of the Sorcerers, &amp;
false Prophets of the Heathen. For, as S.
<hi>Augustine</hi> reporteth in the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith,
and two and twentith booke of the
citie of God, that the Heathenish Sorcerers,
maintained heretofore night &amp; day (throw
a diabolicall slight, admirable to the eyes
of the ignorant) the light of <hi>Venus</hi> lampe, &amp;
bragged because they had the reliques of
<hi>Hercules, Romulus,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which had
done some miracles in the temples dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to their memory: so before that the
auncient pagans, went oftentimes on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
out of Egypt (witnesse <hi>Epiphanus</hi>)
vnto the Prophet <hi>Ieremias</hi> sepulchre, because
their Diviners made them beleeue, that
their Gods had revealed, that the bones of
this Prophet could preserue them from the
stinging of <hi>Aspes,</hi> and <hi>Crocodils.</hi> And that
<hi>Ptolomeus</hi> their king, was perswaded to
haue the corps of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into Aegypt, through the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Aristander,</hi> who tould them, that the
Countrey wherein the body of king <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
rested, should abounde in all riches,
and should bee preserved from the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19843:37"/>
of their ennemies, as <hi>Aelian</hi> gives vs
to vnderstand in the 12. booke of his sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Histories.</p>
            <p>If the Priestes of the Romane Church
vsed but this in comon with the abouesaid
Sorcerers and sooth sayers, that manie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
haue bene done, by touching and
worshipping the reliques of some great
personnages, renowned in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys:
then they would not be so much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with vs; because wee make noe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
of them. But they proceede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for some of their Sorcerers haue also
done miracles &amp; cured many diseases with
the braines of a Cat, the head of a Raven, &amp;
such like reliques of dead beastes, as <hi>Bodin</hi>
proueth in his third booke of Sorcerers, by
the testimonie of <hi>Idocus Damhouder</hi> of
<hi>Bruges,</hi> and other credible Historians. So
that there is noe more likelihood of truth,
in the one sort of miracles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other,
seeing that the former haue ben done with
asmuch shewe of devotion towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Saincts, and their reliques, as those
which at this present are so much esteemed
in the papacy. For Bodin reporteth in the
same booke, and second Chapter, how a
Sorceresse of Bruges cured an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of diseases, and that shee tould such as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19843:37"/>
came vnto her, that they must steadfastly be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leeue,
that she had the power to help them
of their sicknesses. Afterward, shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them to fast, and then to repeate
ouer certaine times a <hi>Pater-noster,</hi> or that
they should goe on pilgrimage to S. <hi>Iames</hi>
or to S. <hi>Arnoult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What an impudencie is it then, in these
Boasters of reliques, to bragg and vaunt
themselues, at there miracles, wherein often
times hath bene discouuered many deceits
and illusions. For behold how S.</hi> Augustin
<hi>answered the miraclers of his time, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the disciples of</hi> Donat,<note place="margin">August. l, de Vnit. Eccl. cap. 16.</note> Let not the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
(<hi>saith hee</hi>) tell mee that this or that is true,
because that <hi>Donat, Pontius,</hi> or some other,
hath done such and such like miracles, or because
some men, which pray vnto the memory of our
dead, are heard, or because that vpon it, there
comes to passe such and such like things, or that
this our sister hath seene waking such a vission, or
dreaming hath dreamed such a dreame. Away
with all these fictions of lying men, or shewers of
guilfull Spirits. For either that which they say
is false, or if the Heretiques doe some wonders, so
much the more ought we to take heede of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord after he had said, that there should
come many deceivers, which in shewing great
signes and wonders, should deceiue the Elect, If
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19843:38"/>
it were possible, addeth therevnto worthy of great
commandations, Behold, I haue tould you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>It were an endlesse labour then, to vtter
all the falacy and guiles, whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the people, yea, which their owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
haue found out &amp; amonge others,
that which <hi>Nicolas Lyra,</hi> heretofore percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the miracles, which the Priests of his
age <hi>feigned</hi> (as this writter speaketh) <hi>for
temporall gaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these jugling trickes of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Antichrist, are so much the more de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testable;
in regard they attribute not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the power of doing miracles to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
of Christ, of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of the
Apostles, of the holy Martyrs, and other
excellent personnages, renowned for their
good life &amp; purenesse in doctrine, but also
to the reliques of the greatest deceivers of
the world.</p>
            <p>To begin then with the reliques of S.
<hi>Francis,</hi> (who for his impiety was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. as a pervertour of
the Christian religion,) it is written in the
booke of <hi>Conformities,</hi> that a woman trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the bloody flix for the space of
thirteene yeeres, was cured thereof by tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the hemme of his gowne, and that a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19843:38"/>
blinde man recouvered his sight by tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of his hoode.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Gregory</hi> also rehearseth in the first
booke of his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> &amp; second Chapter,
That a provost of the monasterie of <hi>Funda</hi>
in Italie called <hi>Libertinus,</hi> having drawne
on a stocking of the Abbot S. <hi>Honorats,</hi>
mett a woeman that went to burie her
Sonne, who importuned him with many
prayers to raise him from the dead, &amp; this
good prouost graunting her her request,
laid the stocking ouer her said son, and put
life into him againe through the vertue
thereof.</p>
            <p>He likewise reporteth in the third booke
of his Dialogues, that in the time of a
drought, the Citizens of <hi>Spoleta</hi> made great
store of raine to fall vpon their Soile, by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp towards heauen the gowne of S.
<hi>Eutychus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee knowe also that some woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
Child, following the Counsell of their
Monkes, haue kissed S. <hi>Ioostlings</hi> breeches in
<hi>Flaunders,</hi> others lifted vp S. <hi>Arnoults</hi>—,
others haue stradled ouer S. <hi>Guerchilous</hi>
image, hoping by this meanes to bee the
more safely deliuered of their children.</p>
            <p>Wee are not ignorant likewise, that
many Idiots of the Romane Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19843:39"/>
that there is in the citie of <hi>Orleans</hi>
some residue of the marriage wine, of <hi>Cana</hi>
in <hi>Galile,</hi> which never diminisheth although
they drinke oftentimes thereof. And in our
Ladies Church at Rome, and at S. <hi>Salvader</hi>
in Spaine, some of the morcells of those
Loaues, wherewith Christ fed fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
persons in the wildernesse, which
neuer lesseneth, although they oftentimes
eate their bellies full thereof.</p>
            <p>Moreouer they beleeue, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of Rome haue in some of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
diverse reliques of a wonderfull force
and vertue, as at S. <hi>Iohn Latrans,</hi> the wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coate
of the Apostle S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which being
heretofore laid ouer three dead bodies,
made them to rise vp a liue in the field.</p>

            <p>At S. <hi>Iohn del' Isle,</hi> that image of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

of this Church.</p>
            <p>At S. <hi>Augustins,</hi> an image of the virgin

            <p>In S. <hi>Pontials</hi> Church-yeard an host con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
by a Priest, singing masse in the
Chappel, which because he doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was the body of Christ, sprung out
of his hand in a wonderfull manner; and
falling vppon the ground made a marke of
blood which is to be seene within a litle
grate of iron yet vnto this day. A jest not
vnlike to that of the Iesuits, and advocats
of that horrible conspiracie of <hi>Garnet,</hi> and
of his complices, against the Crowne of the
King of great <hi>Britanie,</hi> who were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
(as this wise King accuseth them,

And who would not mocke at these &amp;

Whereof we finde sundry examples in our

            <p>So then, <hi>Martinus Chemnicius</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in his treatise of reliques, made against
the decree of the Counsell of <hi>Trent,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the veneration of them, That a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Orator &amp; porter of the popes bulls,
vaunted vpon a day, that amonge other of
his reliques, hee had some of the feathers
of the holy Ghost, now a chiefe companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his consort, over hearing him, picked
cuningly his boxe and taking away his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
laid coales into it in stead of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. On
the morrow this Oratour was to make a

of the holy Ghost, and seing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
falne downe vpon their mariebones to

to pull foorth his feathers, found coales in
it, whereat he neither blushed nor was put
out of countenance, but presently chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his discourse, was so expect in his art
of lying, that he tould them he had mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his boxe, &amp; that those were the coales
taken vp from vnder the gridyron, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
S. <hi>Laurence</hi> had bene carbinadood.</p>
            <p>Another Germaine Divine named <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Herbrandus,</hi> auoucheth in his disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>de Sceloatriae,</hi> that a certaine priest of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenborough</hi>
neare vnto <hi>Nicre,</hi> called <hi>Pfaff
Isele,</hi> hauing bene at <hi>Rome</hi> and created the
popes Indulgentiar, returned from thence
into his Countrey furnished with diverse
reliques, amonge others one of the winges
of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel: Now to make
it the more beneficiall vnto him, he extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the vertues thereof in all his Sermons.
But vpon a Sunday, being loged in an Inn,
within the village of <hi>Altingue,</hi> and being
overcome with wine, he kept not his boxe
of reliques so carefully as hee had done
before. So that through this mischance,
his reliques were stolne: On the morrow
being got vp, &amp; perceiving the theft, spake
not a worde thereof to his Hostis, because
hee suspected that shee knew it: but went
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19843:44"/>
and fott a handfull of haye out of the next
cratch in the stable, &amp; laying it in his boxe,
called his Hostis and tould her. <hi>See, here
are my reliques,</hi> whereat she begann to laugh,
notwithstanding hee tould her, that when
shee came to church, to bee an assistant in
the holy service, shee should also kisse those
reliques, shee replyed vpon it shee would
not, but hee wagered that shee should. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this coming to Church, this priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann
to preach of the admirable vertues
of his reliques, and to declare vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he had a handfull of the hay of the
stable in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> wherevpon our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Iesus Christ had oftentimes slept, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee was a babe, which had the power to
preserue from the plague (wherewith <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi>
was then infected) all those which
did but kisse it, and to driue away all Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
and Adulteresses which came neere
vnto it: Now his Hostis that knewe full
well the deceit of this shamelesse Priest, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on the side to spare her monie, and
fearing on the other side to lose wholly her
good name, because her chastitie was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into question before, choose rather at
last after longe deliberation, to cast away
her money, then to bring her reputation
into a furder danger, so that shee was the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19843:44"/>
very last that came to kisse the reliques of
her owne stable, and the priest tould her in
her eare, <hi>What, art thou come too?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Doctour annexeth vnto this
storie, that many Germanies having heard
say of the vertue of his reliques, ranne in al
hast vnto this Priest to kisse them, but for
all that, they were not preserued from the
plague, but miserable a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>icted therewith.</p>
            <p>Beside, that Duke <hi>Everhard</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
of the cossenning trickes of this
Priest, commaunded the Divines of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binque</hi>
to call him in question before them
into their Vniversitie, to reprooue him
therefore: but hee too well vnderstanding
his craft, answered them impudentlie, that
he neither had lied, nor beguiled any man.
In fine, after a serious warning, which these
Divines gaue him, that it was more then
mainfest to all the world, that many which
had kissed his reliques, were notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
dead of the plague, he replyed in a
flouting manner at those poore superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people, that they had not kissed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;
but the glasse onely wherein he had
putt them.</p>
            <p>The eight abuse is noted in that they
place in the Catalogue of their religious
reliques, as worthy of Adoration the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments

and they of <hi>Amiens</hi> with those of S.
Iohn <hi>Angelique</hi> for having the forepart
with the gash of a knife, which <hi>Herodias</hi>
should giue him ouerthwart the eye, as the
hangman brought her his head, to present
it by her daughter in a platter to <hi>Herode</hi> &amp;
his frends, invited to the feast of his nativity
But who would not thinke it strange and
incredible, that the Euangelists, which haue
represented vnto vs in their historie, all the
markes, which could bee perceiued in this
incestuous strumpet of a cruell heart, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
after the innocent bloode of S. <hi>Iohn
Baptist,</hi> should haue forgotten to shewe vs
this last, which if it had bene true, would
haue bene more remarkeable then all the
rest.</p>
            <p>And although that <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and some
other Historians attest, that the body of
this Fore-runner of Christ, was burned to
ashes, yet: these forgers of reliques, would
make the Idolaters of the papacie beleeue,
that the finger wherewith Sainct <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
showed our LORD Iesus Christ
vnto his Disciples, in saying: Behold the
Lambe of God which taketh away the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the world, was miraculously preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the providence of the Lord, &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed

another at <hi>Bourges,</hi> the third at <hi>Bezanson</hi> in

            <p>As for the Apostles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
Albeit the Prelates of Rome say, that they
keepe in S. <hi>Iohn Latrans</hi> church their whole
heads, &amp; their bodies parted in the midst,
weighed, and divided in to equall shares by
S. <hi>Sylvester</hi> in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church: yet those of

they haue one of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> shoulders, those
of <hi>Trier</hi> that they haue manie of the bones
of these two Disciples of our Lord Iesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>Likewise those of <hi>Thoulouse</hi> shew one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

            <p>The Priests of <hi>Rome</hi> also wrangle with
those of <hi>Trier</hi> and <hi>Padoua</hi> for S. <hi>Matthias</hi>
body; because euerie one of these three
townes, thinke they haue his corps in his

            <p>The same presbiters striue for the body
of S. <hi>Iames</hi> the yonger, S. <hi>Phillips,</hi> S. <hi>Symons,</hi>
and S. <hi>Iudes,</hi> with those of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> which

that on maye plainely see, they mock at the

that the bloode of Christ could not
bee sheade in such an abundance, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To conclude, I could heare speake of the

through the craft of these <hi>Alcumists,</hi> of
her smockes, kerchiefes, phillits, girdles,
gownes, pantofles, combes, Needles,
Des kes, Linnen, pictures, and jewells: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
of the garments of Christ, of his
teares, of the Cupp, out of which hee
dran ke with his Disciples, of the linnen
girdle, wherewith hee girded himself when
hee washed their feete, of his purple gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19843:52"/>
of his speare, which wounded his
side, of the dice which in those daies were
not in request, of the stone pichers of <hi>Cana</hi>
in <hi>Galile:</hi> of the miraculous Loanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
our Saviour fed fiue thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
of his garment without seame, of the
reede which they put into his handes in
steade of a Scepter, of the spunge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they put gal into his mouth, of the
Crown of Thornes they set vpon his head,
of the pillar whervnto (according to their
tradition) they bound him to scourg him,
of the Staires of the Sessions-house of Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Pilate, besprinckled with the drops of
the bloode which fell from his body. In
like manner, of the bones, ashes, garments,
chaines, and other reliques of the Apostles
and Martyrs of Christ: but who is able to
number vp all the inventions of the olde
raggs found out in the shopps of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards
of the Romane church? For albeit
<hi>Calvin</hi> hath made a booke expressely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, yet he confesseth therein, that
the number of them is innumerable.</p>
            <p>I entreat therefore the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself at this present with the proofs
of these brasen-fac'd inventors of reliques,
which I haue vttered, and to consider the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
without passion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:19843:53"/>
By meanes whereof, I assure my selfe
hee will judge, that wee haue just reason,
to haue in abhomination these deceiuers
of the ignorant, and to hold the adoration
of their reliques for a heathenish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and Idolatrie, condemned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the Lord, and not to be
tollerated by those whose eyes God
hath opened to see the

of his Apostles, and other Christians well
instructed in the faith, which accounted all

and reprooued the Superstition of those
which condemned their bretheren in the

or of the Sabbath.<note place="margin">Hier. in Com. ad Gal. 2. 4.</note> Wherevnto, S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
having respect, acknowledged euery day
was alike, and that Christ was crucified, not
onely vpon the day of the preparation, or
rise againe vpon the Sunday: but ads that
his resurrection is alwaies, and that alwaies
we may liue by the flesh of Christ. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
morover, that after the decease of the
Apostles, some wise men instituted certaine
daies, for fasting and convocation, to the
intent, that such as waited more vpon the
worlde, then vpon God, who could not, or
at least would not assemble them-selves so
much as one day in their lives, to come &amp;
offer vp vnto God the sacrifices of their
praiers &amp; humane actions, might watch &amp;
pray vpon those daies if they would.</p>
                  <p>Whereby it appeareth painely, that the
observation of the Iudiciall feasts were not
instituted by our Lord Iesus Christ, or his
Apostles, but by the Doctors of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, to expresse and record more
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19843:61"/>
clearely vnto the common sort of people,
the principal benefits of our Redeemer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and to accustome them, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
some extraordinarie dayes in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vpon them. Wherevnto this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of <hi>Socrates</hi> may serue, as a sufficient
proofe, whereby he declareth, that neither
Christ nor his Apostles was of meaning, to
suspend their judgements touching Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
or any other feast: nor instituted any
lawes for them, that they should bee kept,
nor yet denounced any condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such as did not obserue them, or did
lay any cursse or penalty vpon them, as the
law of <hi>Moses</hi> vsually did: but the marke
whereat they aimed, was to recommend to
euery one that vertue and life, which was
pleasing to God.</p>
                  <p>And what an impudencie is it, in these
Canons of <hi>Awcon,</hi> to appropriate their
abuse vnto the feasts of the old Testament:
seing there is asmuch difference, betweene
their seventh yeeres Sabbath, &amp; that of the
Iewes, as is betweene light and darknesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For, that of the Iewes was neither conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
nor employed but onely to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God: whereas that of the Canons of
<hi>Awcon</hi> and their pilgrims, is dedicated
to the honour of the bones and raggs of
mortall men.</p>

Touching their pilgrimages vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the departed Saincts, they are in
noe wise grounded vpon any institution of
our Lord: neither from any example of the
aue Iewes: nor from the doctrine of the
Apostles, and first Doctours of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church. For Iesus Christ our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was so farr from commaunding his
disciples to transport themselves from one
place to another, to adore the ashes of their
predecessours, that on the contrarie, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

this Epistle falsifie his wordes, and wrest
them into a sence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his meaning:
For in the text which they cite of S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,</hi>
hee speaketh not there of any mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which it pleased God to worke by the
garments of any of the holy Fathers after
their departure, but whilst they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
to shew by this argument, that their
very garments which to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of men, were base and contemti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
were more precious in the sight of
God, then all the sumptuous rayment of
<hi>Achab</hi> and other infidell kings.</p>
                  <p>Touching the honour which it pleased
God to doe vno <hi>Moses</hi> his servant, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring
him, (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> saith) with his
owne handes, whosoever hath but any jott
of judgment or reason, will conclude from
this interrment of <hi>Moses</hi> corps, the cleane
contrary to that, which the Canons of
Awcon here inferre, to wit, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
intended to hide his bones in a place
vnknowne vnto the children of Israel, to
hinder them from taking them vp, &amp; least
they should abuse them with Idolatrie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the superstitious men of the Romish
church doe, who worship the bones, which
in times past haue bene taken out of the
graves of their ancestours.</p>

Concerning that which they alledge of
our Lord Iesus Christ, for commending
the faith of the woeman which was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the issue of bloode, because shee
said to her self, If I may touch but his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
onely, I shall be whole: I answere that
although her faith was so weake, that shee
quaked for feare when shee came neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, to confesse that shee had touched
the hemme of his garment, and by that
meanes was comforted by our Saviour
who commaunded her to bee of a good
courage, yet neverthelesse her faith was not
defiled with such a superstition as that of
the Romanists is. For when shee came
trembling towards our Saviour, shee fell
not done before him to kisse the hemme of
his garment, but to worship his person, &amp;
to shew him before all the people, for what
cause she had touched him, and how shee
was made whole immeadiately vpon it.</p>

               <div type="refutation">
                  <head>Refutation.</head>
                  <p>I finde in this discourse many faults,
the first is, that in accusing the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of this superstitious adoration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
they place in the first ranck of them
<hi>Eumonius, Vigilantius</hi> and <hi>Eustachius,</hi> who
were not so wel grounded in the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this Idolatrie, as wee are in ours.
For proofe whereof, because I will not bee
too teadious, I onely will alledge <hi>Vigilantius</hi>
censure vpon it, &amp; S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> answere vnto
it. <hi>Vigilantius</hi> censure then, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
propounds it was this. <hi>What needeth this,
not onely to honour with such a reverence, but
also to worship I knowe not what, caryed vp and
downe and enclossed within a small vessell? Wee
may se, that the pagans custome is almost brought
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19843:71"/>
into the Church, vnder the color of religion, and
that while the sunne shineth, they still light vp a
great nomber of Candells, and that some of them
kisse and worship a litle dust, wrapped vp in a
costly sheete, and putt into a litle vessell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs see on the other side, what answere
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> gaue him, <hi>Who hath euer worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the Martyrs? Who hath euer thought
man to be God, ô brainelesse head!</hi> If the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
should answere vs in that manner,
at this daye, Who hath euer worshipped
the Martyrs? Who hath euer thought man
to be God? may not wee justly reply, they
are euen your Doctours, who haue seduced
you, not onely to adore the Martyrs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but also their bones and reliques.</p>
                  <p>The second fault is, they ranck <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in the catalogue of their Heretickes,
who by S. <hi>Hierome</hi> his owne adversairy, was
called <hi>Holy Father,</hi> who feeling himselfe
mooued with the same zeale, as S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
was, condemned the vnprofitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
which was employed about the
garnishing of tombes and the reliques of
Saincts departed.<note place="margin">Epist ad Paulin</note> For as <hi>Vigilantius</hi> tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
this ceremonie of kissing the reliques
of the Saincts, and lighting vp of Candells
about them, <hi>a heathenish custome introduced
into the Church vnder a falsse pretext of religion:</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:19843:72"/>
So S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> calleth it in his 12. Setmon
vpon the first Epistle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">Chris. Hom. 12 1. Cor.</note> 
                     <hi>a
foolish devotion, a devillish observation, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
by the corrupt iugments of senselesse men
that did but suck,</hi> therefore, to turne them
from this superstition hee sheweth them,
that the Martyrs take no delight to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with their money, for which the
poore cry out, in that they did not rather
employ it for their reliefe, &amp; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of our Lords resurrection, who
rise naked from death, ought to learne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to leaue of from the foolish expence of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls.
For whereto is it good (saith hee)
seing it bringeth but losse to such as doe it,<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. 84 in Euang. Iohn.</note>
and noe benefit to the dead, but rather
harme.</p>
                  <p>The third fault is, they liken our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
vnto <hi>Eunomius, Vigilantius,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stachius,</hi>
wherein they are in noe wise to bee
compared. For the Eunomians were by the
holy fathers taxed of Heresie, because they
made it a difficult matter to enter into the
Churches of the Apostles &amp; Martyrs, who
haue taught in time past, that Christ is true
God &amp; equall to the Father: whereof they
cannot reproue our Doctours, seeing they
preach in the Churches, adorned with the
names of S. <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> &amp; other of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19843:72"/>
the Apostles and Martyrs, &amp; seing besides,
that they maintaine the doctrine of the
Godhead of our Lord Iesus Christ, against
the disciples of Eunomius.</p>
                  <p>Neither cann they charge our Diuines
(vnlesse wronfully) with that Crime where
with S. <hi>Hierome</hi> attached <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> (to
wit,) because he held vncleane the bones
of the Saincts departed, and would haue
had their ashes ignominiously cast vpon a
dunghill, to the end that he alone (though
drunck and a sleepe) might be adored, but
ours teach the cleane contrarie, that their
bodies ought to be buried honorably.</p>
                  <p>The fourth fault is, they accuse our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours
for hauing burned in France
the reliques of some departed Saincts, as
those of S. <hi>Ireneus,</hi> S. <hi>Hilaires,</hi> and S. <hi>Martins:</hi>
yet they cite not so much as one witnesse,
herein they doe not imitate their Cardinal

or that his ashes were cast into the <hi>Rosne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say againe, that this accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs
it false; because they impute to the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of our age (whom wronfully they
tearme Innovators of religion) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solences
committed by some vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
souldiers, in the beginning of the
troubles without their councel or avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For they were so farre from exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to burne the bodies of the Saints,
or to throw their ashes into riuers, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
they preached against such ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trages,
and admonished their anditorie,
therein to followe the example of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, and that euery man was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to lay them into the Earth, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to burie the bones and ashes of those
whom God had taken out of this world.</p>
                  <p>The fift fault is, they ranck amonge the
nomber of the first founders of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
religion, the Emperor <hi>Charles the
great,</hi> who approoued not all the point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

booke which he wrot, against the second

neere vnto that infidelitie, which alwaies
keeps her Adorers in errour.</p>
                  <p>Touching their allegation of the double
diligence, which many towns &amp; provinces
vsed in searching out, and in honoring the
reliques of the deceased Saincts, wee reply,
that wee are not bound to follow the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of men, but onely the rule of diuine

worshipping of reliques.</p>

joyfull contemplation of
the Saincts tombes, &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.
For this hath alwaies
ben found by experience,
&amp; confirmed by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all antiquity, that
through these pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
through this great floc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
and godlynes of the
people, a new zeale began
to kindle in our spirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with the piety &amp;
revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we bore to these

               <p>And loe, next vnto the
glory of God, the chiefest
ende of our pilgrimages,
which God so specially de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
of vs, was, because
as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Martirs haue
ben giuen vs, to awaken vs
vnto the excercise of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
through the admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nition
of the places, &amp; by
the presence of these holy
pledgs. For the holy place
(as this Father exhorteth
vs) reneweth &amp; encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19843:80"/>
our former affections,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as through the adver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisment

whome we are to imitate,

               <p>And therefore it hapned
perchance (as it were by di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uine

that almost all the

                  <p>As for their proofs of the ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of their fathers, in wrapping vp in
cloaths the reliques of the departed Saints,
of the donation of those clothes, to al sorts
of people (but especially to Emperours, &amp;
great parsonnages) of the miracles done
by touching them, I call them insufficent
because this custome is not grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the worde of God, nor from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Disciples of our Lord Iesus
Christ. For so farre was Ioseph of Arema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,
and Nicodemus, who wrapped vp the
body of Christ in a sheete (whom they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19843:82"/>
make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in their fine discourse) from
showing it, or giving it to some religious
men, that on the contrarie, they buryed it
with Christs bodie and sought to keepe it
from the sight of men. And suppose that
some miracles haue bene done, by the tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of such like clothes of the dead, wee
are not to wonder at it, seeing Sathan, when
it pleaseth God to lett loose his reignes, &amp;
permitt him to deceiue men with stronge
illusions &amp; errours, hath oftentimes done
the like miracles by touching the reliques
of dead beasts, as wee haue amply declared
in our disputation, in the discouvering it
the sixt abuse of reliques.</p>

by their Historie, nor any other authour
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19843:87"/>
worthy of beleefe, that the Virgin Marie

that shee did commaund, that they should

And whosoever will but conferre the In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dex
of these Canons of Awcon, with some
other registers of the Romane Church: they
shall soone perceiue how they contradict
one another. For those of <hi>Charters</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that they haue the same smock which
the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> had on, when shee was
delivered of our sauiour Iesus Christ, which
(according as men reporte that haue seene
it) is too long for a woman of a midle sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> was, and as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi>
witnesseth, that the hose of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
her husband, were too short for a man of
the same shape. For the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi>
smocke, which they shew at Awcon vnto
the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; credulous people, is so long
&amp; wide, that if shee had bene a Gyantesse
(as <hi>Calvin</hi> noteth in his treatise of relikes)
shee could scarcely haue worne it. One
the contrarie, <hi>Iosephs</hi> hose (which the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of Awcon haue forgott to put into
their Index) are so short and straight that
they will not serue a dwarfe, or a litle boy.</p>
                  <p>Besides these Chap-men of Rome, and
Salvadour in Spayne wrangle obstinately
with those of Awcon, which of them shold
haue the Swadling-bande where-with the
Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> swadled vp her litle Babe
Iesus Christ.</p>

But yet there is a farre greater contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene the Huckstars of the Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
church for the peeces of Christs crosse.
For there is almost not one Abbey or Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in the world, which makes not a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado
&amp; a superstitious showe therewith: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that <hi>Eusebius</hi> showes vs, in the life of

multiplied them into so manie, that they
shewe a great number of whole ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
manie peeces in diverse Countries of

                  <p>Morover, there are sundry Townes which
affirm, that they haue the whole Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cloth of our Lorde Iesus Christ: But
especially they of Rome, Byzanzon, and
Cadoin in Lymos. Is it not then a great
impudence in these Canons of Awcon, to
maintaine against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they haue some
of the peeces of it? And if other Townes
haue likewise some peeces of this Swearing
cloth (as they vant they haue) what aud audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
is it in those townes which I haue
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19843:88"/>
named to maintaine at this day, that they
haue his whole Sweating-cloth with the
impression of all the parts of Christs body
sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ped into the same cloth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crowne
of his head, vnto the sole of his foot: seeing
wee cann prooue the contrarie by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
which the jewes vsed in burying of
their dead, and also by a text of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
S. <hi>Iohns</hi> in his 20. Chapter and sixt &amp;
seuenth verses, that this sweating cloth, was
but the kerchief which <hi>Ioseph</hi> of Aremathea
and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had bound about his head,
and lay in a place by it felfe, from the other
linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clothes, wherewith his body had ben
wrapped vp by his two difciples <hi>Iohn and
Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the rest, if the Prelates of Rome
haue the whole chaine wherevnto S. <hi>Peter</hi>
was chained in his prison, doe not those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of Awcon bragg falsly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they

                  <p>If they of Rome haue also the whole
body of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> with all his bones, what
an impudencie is it in those of Awcon and
some Canons of other churches to say, as
it were in dispite of one another, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Concerning the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the
great, we confesse that the Historians of his
time witnesse, that he was buried at Awcon
in Germany: howbeit wee wonder much,
because they mingle the reliques of a politi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>que
man, who was giuen to whoredome (as
the Apostate <hi>Iohn de Serres</hi> withnesseth in
his <hi>Inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>torie)</hi> with those of Christs, the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Maries,</hi> and other holy personages
which led a blamelesse life in this worlde.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, If the most holy place be
at Rome in S. <hi>Iohn Laterans</hi> church, and if
the Byshope of Roome keepeth there-in
<hi>Aarons</hi> rod and the Heauenly <hi>Manna,</hi> doe
not the Canons of Awcon deserue to bee
controled, in that they attribute the propri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ety
of these reliques, and call their shoppe
furnished with all maner of false marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
<hi>the most holy place of the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Temple?</hi> For like as vnder the old Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
there was but one Tabernacle, one
Temple, and consequently one most holy
place, vntil the first coming of Iesus Christ.
So could it not represent vnto our Fathers
but one Temple of the God-head of Christ,
which is his body, &amp; one most holy place,
which is the Heauen into which this Souve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
and onely sacrificer hath tanspor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his body by his assention. Now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19843:89"/>
that that should be false (as it is not)
which the Apostle declareth in his Epistle
to the Ebrewes, to wit, that the Tabernacle
and Sanctuarie of the old Testament were
but figures of the true Tabernacle, and of
the true holy places, which are not made
with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hands (but is the body of Christ
&amp; the Kingdome of Heauen) &amp; that these
figures ought not to last but vntil the time
of their corectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; accomplishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, throgh
the death &amp; passion of our Redeemer Iesus
Christ: yet notwithstanding, to showe the
correspondence between the shadowes &amp;
the bodie which is founde in Christ, the
Doctors of the Romane church, ought but
to name vnto vs one Temple, &amp; one most
holy place, heretofore figured vnto our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
first by the Tabernacle, &amp; afterward
by the Temple of Ierusalem: in lieu of so
many Temples &amp; most holy places, which
in these later daies they shewe to the poore
ignorant people, to learne them to Iudais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and observe the Ceremonies abolish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d
long since through he sacrifice of Christ
Iesus, &amp; condemned by the doctrine of his
Apostles.</p>
                  <p>As for the rest, either there is noe likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of truth, that the auncestors of these
Canons of Awcon, haue had and showne
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19843:90"/>
heretofore vnto the common people the
true fore-skinne of Iesus Christ, or that
these canons their successours hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it from them, haue not kept it so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as the garments of our Sauiour Christ,
and the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts wherewith <hi>Pilates</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
serued their turnes to crucifie him,
seeing that they dare not name his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinne
in their Index, nor place it in the
ranck of his other reliques afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>And that which they make vp their tale
withall, concerning S. <hi>Catherins</hi> Oyle, and
S. <hi>Leopards</hi> corps, it is of the same coigning
as their inventoire is of the bones of the
ten thousand Martyrs, which maye not be
touched but onely seene vnder the altar of
the Church at Rome, called the Heauens
<hi>Ladder:</hi> and the eleuen thousand virgins
whereof they of <hi>Coullen</hi> gathered vp more
then a hundred carte loades. For euery
man of vnderstanding having regard to
that which these churchmen of Awcon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and compare it
with that which those of Rome say (who
maintaine they haue one of her fingers in
the temple of the holy Ghost, and in the
temple dedicated vnto her the milke which
gushed foorth of her necke, when shee was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19843:90"/>
beheaded, &amp; the oyle which sprang foorth
of her graue) will finde as much fraude and
deceit therein, as in that which they recite
of their Idol S. <hi>Christopher,</hi> to wit, that this
Gyant hauing bene a theese in his youth,
at last forsooke that wicked course of life, &amp;
to doe a publique pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for his sinnes, vn
dertooke to carie such as was desiours to
passe ouer a great water, from one banck
side to the other: Now vpon this occasion
Iesus being willing to try his faith &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
came &amp; presented himself with the
rest (as hee was readie to take them vp) in
the likenesse of a litle boy, and talking with
him, prayed him to carie him ouer as hee
did the others, the which this theefe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
agreed vnto, but after hee had sett
him vpon his shoulders hee found him so
heavie, that being in the midst of the river
he tould him that hee neuer had borne so
heauie a burden: and that hee should sinke
vnder him, if he did not presently ease him:
Now euer since they haue called <hi>Christofle,</hi>
or rather <hi>Christophorus</hi> that is, <hi>Christ bearer,</hi>
from which fable euery man may gather,
that these fine Doctours feede their wrech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
disciples, but with lies &amp; illusions, where
of I haue discovered a great number in

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19843:91"/>
that the vnpassionate Reader, and louer of
