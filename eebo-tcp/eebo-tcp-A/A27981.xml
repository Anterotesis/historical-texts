            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT would be superfluous to say any thing in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Psalms of David; every body knows in what ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration they have been with the whole Church of God in all times and places. Most of the holy fathers observe, that they alone containe the whole substance of the old Testament; for all that Moses delivers by way of history, or by way of precept; and all that the rest of the Prophets have writ to exhort to vertue, and to deterr from vices or to prophecy things to come, is to be found in the Psalms succinctly &amp; distinctly sett forth: And this, I may say, is not only the sense of all the
<pb facs="tcp:108461:3"/>
holy Fathers in generall, but even of Jesus Christ himself, and of his Apostles, who upon all occasions of establishing their Doctrine, And proving him to be the Messias, most usually cite texts out of the Psalms S. Basil says <hi>They are a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect summe of all Theologie,</hi>

                  </gap>e wought to live, and how wee are to be saved:</hi> Much more to the same purpose is said by that holy Father. S. Austin tells us that David was inspired by the holy Ghost to teach all the faithfull the language they are to use in addressing themselves to God:
<hi>They are to pray as he prays,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Aug. in Psal. 30.</note> 
               <hi>to greive as he greives, to rejoyce as he rejoyceth, to hope as he hopes, to fear as he fears, &amp;c.</hi> All the rest of the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Fathers are full of such
<pb facs="tcp:108461:3"/>
expressions as these, concerning the Psalms: For which reason it is, that the Church of God in all ages has made the Psalms to be the principall part of Christian devotion, by makeing dayly use of them in the publick liturgies, and by obliging all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks to recite them all over once every week, and allso by recommending them to the faithfull in generall for their privat devotions.</p>
            <p>The more generally they are used the more necessary it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be that they should be well understood; since light in the understanding contributes much to fervour in the heart and in the will, wherfor the labour (Gods grace assisting therunto) may prove not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable which hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in this present Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:108461:4"/>
of the Psalms out of the vulgate, to render them as clear and intelligible in our language, as the letter of the Texte will permitt: for in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Translation of sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipture ther is an obligation of sticking close to the Letter when ever it can be done without losing the sense of the Text; But so it is that in some places the Latine Text of the Psalms rigouroutly transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word by word would yeeld a scarse untelligible sense in the language, into which it is translated; and wher that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, it seems reasonable that such a latitude and liberty should be allow'd, as is necessary to make the sense of the Text, as it is generally understood by the most approved Authors, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to the Reader, espicially in a Translation intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:108461:4"/>
for the privat devotions of Lay persons. This Translater thought he could not chuse a better guide to direct him in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such passages their due sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, then the learned Card. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin in his excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise upon the Psalms; And that he has accordingly follow'd his Guide, may be seen by any who will take the pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one with the other. I may also add that this work has been revised and corrected by some persons who are the most propper judges of such writings; yet still it may very well be, that the faults were too many to be all of them spy'd and amended: however if the defects which still remain may prove a motive to some abler hand to undertake the work, and translate the Psalms in a
<pb facs="tcp:108461:5"/>
more exact &amp; perfect manner, this Translater will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self verz happy, and his pains well bestow'd.</p>

            <p>2 For they will soon wither like hay. And will fade like herbs in the feild.</p>

            <p>4 Place thy delight in our Lord, And he will grant thee the petitions of thy heart.</p>
            <p>5 Lay open thy way to our Lord; hope in him, and he will do <hi>for thee.</hi>

his ways, the man whose ways are full of injustice.</p>
            <p>8 Lay aside anger and indignation, And be not provoked to do evill.</p>
            <p>9 For the wicked shall be extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; but they who wait with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience upon our Lord, shall inherite the land.</p>

            <p>11 But the meek shall possess the land, And shall be delighted in the fullnes of peace.</p>
            <p>12 The sinner will watch and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the just, And grind his teeth at him.</p>

            <p>16 Let their swords pass into their own hearts, And let their bows be broken.</p>

            <p>24 The hopes of <hi>the just</hi> man shall be guided by our Lord, And he will be pleased with his way.</p>
            <p>25 When he falls, he shall not be bruised, because our Lord lays his hand under him.</p>
            <p>26 I have been young, and now I am old; And I have not seen a just man abandon'd, and his children begging bread.</p>

            <p>33 The law of his God is in his heart, And he shall not be supplanted in his way.</p>
            <p>34 The sinner watches, and observes the just one, And seeks how to destroy him.</p>
