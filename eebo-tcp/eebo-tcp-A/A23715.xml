            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise
unto salvation, throughx faith which is in
Christ Iesus.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words are part of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by which he presseth <hi>Timothy</hi> to hold
fast the truth he had receiv'd, and not let
evil men, seducers, work him out of what he had
bin taught: urging to this end both the authority
of the Teacher, himself, who had secur'd the truth
of his doctrine by infallible evidence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that, as if that were a more effectual enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
pressing him with his own education in the
Scriptures; how he had bin nurst up in that faith,
suckt the Religion with his milk, that it was grown
the very habit of his mind, that which would
strengthen him into a perfect man in Christ, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99615:3"/>
make him <hi>wise unto salvation</hi> if he did continue in
the faith and practise of it; which he proves in
the remaining verses of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the words read there are three things obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
            <p>1. Here is a state suppos'd, <hi>Salvation;</hi> and put
too as of such concernment, that attaining it is
lookt upon as wisdom; <hi>wise unto salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now since true wisdom must express it self both
in the end that it proposeth, and the means it
chooseth for that end to be pursued with and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by, and take care both these have all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that can justify the undertaking, and secure
the prudence of it, and this wisdom to salvation
therefore must suppose both these; in order to them
both we have here</p>
            <p>2. That which with all divine advantage does
propose this end, and alsox does prescribe most
perfect means for the attaining it; and that is
<hi>Holy Scripture through faith which is in Christ Iesus.
Thou hast known the holy Scriptures which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is
in Christ Iesus. Holy Scripture</hi> probably of the Old
Testament; for there was hardly any other <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
could know from a child, scarce any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99615:3"/>
written then. The faith of that then through
the <hi>faith which is in Christ Iesus,</hi> that is, together
with the faith of all things necessary to be known
concerning Christ, is meant. Now since St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
after the view of all that the other three Evangelists
had wrote concerning Christ, adding his story al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
says, that Christ<note n="*" place="margin">John 20. 30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>did and spoke more then what
is written,</hi> yet affirms most positively that <hi>those
things were written that we might believe that Iesus
is the Christ, the Son of God, and believing might have
life through his name;</hi> and so enough is written for
that faith which is in Jesus that is necessary to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life: therefore the Holy Scripture of the Old
Testament, together with the faith of what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the New, is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms is
<hi>able to make us wise unto salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Here is the advantage <hi>Timothy</hi> had above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as to Faith in these, and consequently the far
greater obligation to continue in it. <hi>He had known
them from a child. And that from a child thou hast
known the holy Scripture, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing that does offer it self to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
is the state suppos'd, <hi>Salvation.</hi> But
because my Text supposes it, I shall do so too, nor
shall think it needful to prove here, that there is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99615:4"/>
such a state, nor consequently that all those are
stupid, who propose not to themselves this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
safety for their main end, and by strict
care in the duties of Religion and Gods service
aime at it: for if that state be granted, nay if it
be but possible, it must be granted that there can
be no security but in doing so, nor consequently
any wisdom without being <hi>wise</hi> thus <hi>unto salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then if this were granted, that the wisest
thing man could propose to himself, were by strict
care in all the duties of Religion to design Gods
honor and his own salvation; still, as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of prudence which consists in the choice
of means, we are to seek for that Religion
we are to pursue this end by and attain it;
since there are so many and so opposite Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
in the word, that 'tis not easier to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them, then to make peace betwixt enemies and
contradictions. And it alwaies was so; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
that mankind agree'd still in the notion of
the necessity of Religion, that all had apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of invisible powers above us, and differ'd
not much in the rules of Justice and Morality, in
other things there was no nearness. Almost from
the beginning there was more variety of Gods then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99615:4"/>
Nations, I had almost said then Worshippers. Beasts
were their Sacrifices and their Deities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the votaries were certainly no better. Vices
also were their worships; things which their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and their Camps would not endure, found
Sanctuary in their Temples; and the actions which
were whipt in the Judgment-hall, were their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the holy places. And tho some wise men
among them found good reason to decry this, yet
they knew not what to take up in the stead. I need
not add the present differences of the world, even
that call'd Christian too, great part of which as
heretofore they seal'd their faith with their own
blood, now seal it in the blood of all that differ
from them; and by their persecutions hope to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
Heaven more, then those did hope to gain it by
their Martyrdoms. But these I need not add to
make up this into a demonstration, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for lapsed men, so far as they are left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and have no other guide to follow but their
reason, to find out what they are to believe of
God, and how to serve him, and save themselves.

himself is pleas'd to revele himself. His worship
also, how he will be serv'd, and what observances
he does require, or will admit, since it depends on
his own good plesure, therefore without his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
'tis in vain to hope to please him with
our Religious service whatever it be, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
impossible without his guidance and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
to acquire the end of all our Service and
Religion, <hi>the salvation of our souls.</hi> So that how wise
soever he be who does propose this blessed end to
himself, if yet withall he be not some way from
the Lord instructed by what means he must pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
that end, and do not make choice of, and use
those means, it is impossible he can be <hi>wise unto

expresly, here we may be furnished: For he saies,
<hi>The Holy Scriptures are able to make us wise unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
through faith which is in Christ Iesus.</hi>
And he does assert this on the very ground we

               </gap> inspir'd by
God; they come from him. All which must be
made out in the next place.</p>
            <p>That those Holy Scriptures which St. <hi>Paul</hi> first
mentions, those of the Old Testament were so, and
did contain sufficient revelation both of God, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99615:5"/>
of the way of worship of the Jews, that Nation
did so perfectly believe, that neither Sufferings nor
Miracles could perswade the contrary; neither the
Roman persecuters that destroy'd their worship,
nor the Son of God that chang'd it, could yet take
them off from <hi>Moses</hi> and his Scriptures. Now that
this <hi>Moses</hi> led that Nation out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with an

power by which these were wrought, was great
enough to give that Law, require obedience to it,
and reward it, and to punish all transgression ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tenor of these Scriptures: that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it was God; and he that wrote those Scriptures
must have had communication with, and bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
from, God to write them. But,</p>
            <p>2. Whether they were true or no according as
they are recorded in those Scriptures, that whole
people from the greatest almost to the least must
know; because they are recorded as all don, not
only in the presence of them all, but as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and the entertainments of their senses, every
one; so that if they were forg'd, not one of the
whole Nation could be ignorant of it. And then,</p>
            <p>3. If they knew them forg'd all; that<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 2. 32. Num. 11. 21.</note> 600000
men, besides their wives and families, should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
this <hi>Moses,</hi> having brought them forth only
into a wilderness, there to lay such a heavy Law,
and so severe a yoke upon them, with such penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
annext to every least transgression, and adjure
them to observe it on the account of all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
that had bin wrought among them, and
upbraid them with stiffneckedness, rebellion, and
appeal to their own senses for the truth of all this,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99615:7"/>
and record all to posterity in this Scripture, cause
all to be read before them; and that they should
bear all this from him they knew so impudent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
and conveigh that Scripture and the faith
of it to their posterity, ground their so strict, so
chargeable Religion on that book, which they were
certain had no word of truth in it: this sure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
belief and possibility.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain therefore, since the Jews of that
age did perform the services requir'd, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them according as that book directs, did
teach their children the great works that God had
don in their sight, therefore they believ'd those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and Scriptures. And since it was impossible
that they should be deceiv'd; if they believ'd them,
they were true: and their posterity receiv'd from
them the faith of this, and so deriv'd it on, that
neither Gods dread judgments, nor mans cruelty
can yet shake it. Now had they not bin don, and on
that account conveigh'd; when ever they were
broacht, and that book first appear'd, the men of
that age must needs know their Fathers never had
perform'd such services, had such a book read to
them constantly, nor told them of such Miracles
that had bin wrought: and therefore 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99615:7"/>
that they could have believ'd it had bin so
from <hi>Moses,</hi> if it had bin true that it had first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to be taught in their own time, or in theirs
with whom they liv'd. And this discourse must be
of force concerning every age, if we ascend until
we come to that of <hi>Moses</hi> wherein all was effected.
Yet besides this, they had also that perpetual Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in the High Priest's Pectoral, the Oracle of <hi>Vrim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that did keep alive their faith and
strengthen it: and they had Prophets constantly
foretelling, as from God, things that were somtimes
suddenly to come to pass, and somtimes not till
many ages after, the event of which depended of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on the will of those that would not of some
hundred years be born; others on Gods own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
will and hand: and therefore none but
God could look into, foretel, and bring to pass all
those events. Now such were <hi>Ieremies</hi> predictions
of the taking of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the captivity of the
people, and the express number of<note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 25. 11. 12</note> years it would

so as that they spoke all Languages immediatly, to
the amazement of the Jews of every Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven to which they were scatter'd, that
the Miracle might spread as far.</p>
            <p>Now if all this be true, he that did these must
have communication with a power above all that
we account the powers of Nature; such an one
most certainly as can perform whatsoever he in
this book promises, inflict what e're he threatens;
such as is divine. And since he wrought all these,
on purpose to evince he came commission'd from
that divine power, brought these Miracles as seals
of that commission, that we might believe him, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99615:10"/>
whatsoever he delivers must be embrac't by
us, as we hope for those blessed rewards that he
proposeth, and on pain of those eternal torments
if we do not; of both which it is not possible to
doubt if these accounts be true.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> Since the most and greatest of these must
be don but once; he could not be incarnated, and
born, and live, and preach, and dye, and rise again,
and go to Heaven every day, of every age, in every
place, to convince every man by his own senses;
to all those that did not see the matter of fact, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith of all these must be made by witnesses.
And</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> If we can be sure the witnesses that do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
a fact understand it exactly, if the things be
palpable, and they must certainly know whether
they were really don or no; and if we can be
sure too, that they are sincere, will not affirm that
which they do not know, and do not lye, their
testimony of it must be most infallible: because it
is impossible such witnesses can be deceiv'd, or will
deceive.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> The witnesses in this case, the Apostles and
the 70 Disciples (for I'le name no more) must
needs know most perfectly: For they not only saw
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99615:10"/>
the Miracles, but were<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 1. 14.</note> instruments and parties in
some of them; sent to cure diseases, cast out
Devils, and knew whether all this were in earnest.
And most certainly they saw (as all the Jews did
too) Christ crucified, his heart peirc't with a
spear, and his body buried; and whether they
did see him risen, handle him, and eat with him
they knew. And if they might mistake in his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
yet the fiery tongues, if such did light on
them, they must needs see; and whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who spoke no Languages, could then speak
Tongues, it cannot be but they must know. In these
there is no possibility they could err, unless they
did it wilfully: but then 'tis as impossible that
they could do it willfully, if they were sincere and
honest, such as would not lye.</p>
            <p>Now that they were such, I might urge their
simplicity and openness, without disguise, not
covering their own errors; men who seem'd to
live as well as preach against all artifice, and to
have no design on any thing but the amendment
and salvation of mankind. For he that can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it possible that they were otherwise, men of
art and finess, that they contriv'd the story,
must needs know; First, that such would not seal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99615:11"/>
their falsehood with their blood; design no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
to all their travels but contemt, and
hatred, persecutions, prisons, whippings,
wounds and death, to be the scum and the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouring
the world; lay out their lives against their
conscience to preach that <hi>Iesus,</hi> who did only
call them out to be a<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>spectacle to all the world,</hi>
just such as Malefactors when expos'd to fight with,
and to be devour'd of wild beasts. Their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are too known to stay upon: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> own
catalogue of his for five whole verses 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
is such, that to sustain them only for this end, to
put a cheat on mankind; count a so labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
vext, torn, miserable life and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
death gain, so the fable might be beleiv'd:
to think they could do this, is sure as great a
madness as to do it. But yet I will suppose that
possible; that those who wove the fable pleas'd
themselves so infinitely with the expectations of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
on mankind, as that those hopes could make
misery and death it self look lovely to them. But</p>
            <p>Then 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> that all and every of them should be
of that mind, that amongst so many that bare
witness of Christs Miracles and resurrection not
a man should discover the cheat; that when their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99615:11"/>
persecutors did with arts of torment as it were
examin them upon the rack, they should work
not one single confession out of them; that no
ones courage should be broke, nor have a qualm
so far as to acknowledg how it was, disclose the
plot, lay open the confederacy, the whole myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and the contrivance of it: When of twelve
Disciples one was so false to betray his Masters
person at a vile rate, yet that all of them, and
many more, in a feign'd story of his Miracles
should be so true to one another, that no engin of
mans cruelty ever could screw out the secret,
not one should betray the forgery and be a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
where he ought to be: no not that <hi>Iudas,</hi>
whose concern it was, whose treason to his
Master had bin justified had he bin an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor:
yet that he should stir no least suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, but should burst, choakt with his
grief because he had betray'd innocent blood:
This, if he knew it had all bin imposture, must
be most stupendous.</p>
            <p>But yet we will give them this too, that vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
hopes of drawing in the world to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, might make all of them obstinate in
secresy against all attemts of cruelty; or if some
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99615:12"/>
weak brethren did perchance discover, we may
not have heard of it. But</p>
            <p>For them 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> to begin their preaching at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
is yet more strange. To hope to draw men
into a perswasion, and to bottom that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon Miracles, and a resurrection don a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them there, where if discovery were made
it must be made, and where it could not but be
made if there were fraud. For to relate and
write those works with every circumstance of
persons, place, and time, where they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could examin every circumstance, but where
they rather then their lives would find them false,
if nothing else would, this must needs discover
it. They preach them to the face of the whole
multitude and of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and tell them they
were don before their eyes, somtimes 500 and
somtimes 5000 being by and the <hi>cheif Preists</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Doctors:</hi> so that 'twas most impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should not know if they were true or
false, as sure as there was never a Jew in all the
Land, but knew whether there were a darkness
over all the land when Christ was crucified. Now
if these were forg'd to hope to draw <hi>Iews</hi> out of
their Religion with apparent forgeries, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99615:12"/>
they knew such, speaks these Apostles men so
far from art to manage a design of changing the
Religion of the world, that they were mad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
recovery and president.</p>
            <p>But let us give them that too. Yet tis certain
4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> that the Jews, if any such were wrought on
by them, must be much more stupid to believe them
upon the account of such things don in all the
country, in their Cities, and the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Nation, when they could not choose
but know they were not don, if they were not
don, but were fain'd all. For what ever might
be motive to Christs followers and his Apostles,
with the certain danger of their lives to forge
the cheat, what possible temtation could there
be so great to incline <hi>Iewes,</hi> the most stiffnecked
people, the most stubborn in Religion in the
world, to embrace a faith which nothing but the
Cross and shame and misery attended, and which
they must know false too? Had they so great lust
to dye, as for that to bid farewel to their <hi>Moses,</hi>
their Religion and their Law? It is impossible had
they not known the truth of those things, that
in waters of affliction, in Jerusalem, <hi>ipsis perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutionum
fontibus,</hi> in that fountain, that springhead
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99615:13"/>
of persecutions, as the Fathers call it, they would
ever have bin baptiz'd into Christ.</p>
            <p>Yet suddenly in one day at one sermon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

have depopulated the whole earth. And this is as
notorious as that men do now profess that they
are Christians, and that these are holy Scriptures.
Therefore I shall need to go no further.</p>
            <p>Now among so many myriads who on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all these Miracles (whate're they were)
suffer'd themselves to be converted to the faith
of Christ, and then as if they car'd for nothing
but Religion and their Bibles, for them bore the
loss of goods, and life it self, and engag'd their
posterity to do so also; that not one of these should
know whether indeed any such miracles were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99615:14"/>
wrought, if any were restor'd to life or no: (for
if they knew, then they were true:) and that among
so numberless a crow'd of teachers, who
by assuming to speak languages, raise the dead,
work signs, drew in those Myriads to Religion
and the stake, and went before them, gave them
an example both in faith and death; that not one
of all those should believe either the Miracles or
himself that did them: for if any one that did them
did believe them, since he knew who did them,
they must needs be certain: but not one of them
to know it, sure is such a thing as neither could
be don nor be imagin'd.</p>
            <p>He therefore that requires strict evidence in
things of faith which cannot bear it, he that calls
for Mathematical demonstration, nor will believe
on easier terms, yet is so credulous and so unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that he can believe so many things which by the
nature and the disposition of mankind I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
not possible, which yet must be true,
unless these scriptures be from God: 'tis plain
he does not seek for certainty, but for a pretence
of not believing; would fain have his Infidelity
and Atheism look more excusable, and is not fit
to be disputed with but to be exploded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99615:15"/>
But if these scriptures be from God, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they affirm (with modesty I may conclude)
is true. And therfore when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke Acts. 1. 1.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
his <hi>former treatise contain'd all that Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
both to do and teach until the day in which he was
taken up:</hi> since Christ before he did ascend taught
every thing that was requir'd to be believ'd and
don in order to salvation, and more too; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if his Gospel did contain all that he taught,
and did, since it did not contain all abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly,
it must needs mean it contained all that
was necessary, or it must mean nothing. And since
the same S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> in the beginning of that Gospel
does affirm he wrot it,<note place="margin">Luc. 1. 4.</note> that <hi>Theophilus might know
the certainty of those things wherein he had bin instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi>
Tis plain he avers that the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of all those things wherein the having bin
instructed made <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Christian, might be
had out of that Gospel: and when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> says
here, that <hi>the Holy Scriptures are able to make us wise
unto salvation</hi> through faith which is in <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John in his 20 chap. v. 31. <hi>that tho he
had not wrot all the things that Iesus did, yet those
that he had wrot were written, that we might believe
that Iesus was the Christ the son of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99615:15"/>
we might have life through his name;</hi> Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
the Scriptures say that what was written
was sufficient to work that belief which was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to life and salvation, as far as the <hi>credend<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
do concur to it. And when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> in that verse
that succeeds my text, in most express particular
words sets down the usefullness of Scripture in
each several duty of a <hi>man of God,</hi> or preacher of
the Gospel, both for <hi>Doctrine</hi> of faith, for <hi>reproof</hi>
or <hi>correction</hi> of manners, and <hi>instruction unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
and tells you Gods express end in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring

inspir'd was, <hi>that the man of God might be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
throughly <hi>furnisht unto every good work</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to his whole office; tis most certain that
what is sufficient for that office to <hi>instruct, reprove,
correct</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> in, must needs be sufficient to
<hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> in for all men: <hi>i. e.</hi> what my
text affirms, they <hi>are able to make us wise unto
salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might call in Tradition universal to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to this truth for holy Scriptures, if having
once demonstrated that they are Gods word,
when that does affirm it, and bears witness to
it, there were need of any other. And this I dare
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99615:16"/>
boldly say, that if the Scripture did say as expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Pope had a supremacy or soveragni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over the whole Church, or that he or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church were infallible; their definition,
or the living voice of their present Church, a
most sure rule of Faith, as it does say Scripture
<hi>is able to make us wise unto salvation,</hi> those Articles
would suffer no dispute, it would be blasphemy
or sacriledg to limit or explain them by distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when those sayings of the perfectness of
Scriptures are forc't to bear many. Then we
should have no complaints of the obscurity of
those books; if those articles were either in the
Greek or Hebrew, they would never say the
Bible were not fit to be a Rule of Faith, because
the Language were unknown to the unlearned,
and they could not be infallibly secure of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
were they there they would account them
sure enough, who think them plain enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
there, and that we must believe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>Thou art Peter, Feed my sheep,</hi> and <hi>Tell the
Church,</hi> are there.</p>
            <p>And for him that shall affirm, all necessaries
that must make us <hi>wise unto falvation</hi> are not in
the Scripture, 'tis impossible to give a rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99615:16"/>
how it should come to pass that some are
there, the rest are not.</p>
            <p>It must be either on design, or else by chance.
Now 1. That God should design, when very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things that were not necessary were to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that the main and fundamental ones should
be omitted: and when of the necessaries most
he did design for Scripture, then He should not
suffer the Apostles to write the remainder of them:
and yet what he would not suffer them to write,
design'd that the Trent Fathers (who I hope
have perfected the Catalogue) should write all:
of these since 'tis not possible to give a reason,
'tis not therfore rational to affirm it was upon
design. But</p>
            <p>2. If he shall say it only happen'd so by chance,
he does affront both Scriptures, and Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, who, as they affirm, inspir'd them for
this very end, to bring men to the faith and to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
But there is no place for chance in those
things that are don in order to an end, by the
design, impulse and motion of the infinit wisdom
of Gods holy Spirit. He certainly does most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
reproch his Maker, who can think it
possible, that what he did design expressly and on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99615:17"/>
that account alone to attain such an end by (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that men should believe and be sav'd) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
it for that purpose, should yet fail, not be
sufficient for that purpose. And sure if it be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
it contains all necessaries, otherwise it were
deficient in the main; yea so clearly also, as that
they, for whose salvation they are intended, may
with use of such methods, as are obvious and agreed
upon by all men, understand them: for otherwise
they could not be sufficient: if men could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by them in things necessary both to faith
and life, they could not <hi>make them wise unto salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must confess the Scripture labors under a great
prejudice against this doctrine, from the different
senses and interpretations that are made of it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the most fundamental points, by them that
grant it is the word of God; when yet all use the
same means to find out the meaning, and no
doubt they seek sincerely after it. But yet I think it
evident this happens not from the obscurity of
Scripture, since it is not only in the most express
texts; but also if you should suppose the doctrins
were as plain set down there as words can express
them, yet there are such principles assum'd into
the faith of different sects, as must oblige them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99615:17"/>
to interpret diversly the same plain words. I am
not so vain as to imagin that no places are obscure
in Scripture, and I know that learned men have
arts by obscure places to confound the plainest,
just as the Philosopher did motion. Neither am I
so perverse and singular not to think that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
practise and profession of the Church does
much assure and confirm explications of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
whether obscure or plain. But this I say,
that the diversities of explication come, as I now
said, from the diversity of principles or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and that this only is the cause of it I thus
demonstrate.</p>
            <p>First in the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who interprets all those
Scriptures, which the Catholic world hath still
apply'd to the Divinity and satisfaction of Christ,
that I name no more points, otherwise then the
Church did alway; and I affirm he does it, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he thinks the words do favor his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but because his principle requires it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, To admit nothing into his faith but what
agrees with that which he counts reason, which
in a <hi>Socinians</hi> faith is judg of all points in the last
resort. And I mean reason upon natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and thus I prove it. <hi>Socinus</hi> speaking of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99615:18"/>
Christ's satisfaction, says the word is not in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<note place="margin">Ego quidem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiamsi non semel sed saepe id in sacris monimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis scriptum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taret, non ideir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co tamen ita rem prorsus se hub<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

believe it, because it does not consist with right
reason, that is with the arguments that he had
brought against it drawn from human principles.
And therefore he there adds; those things which
'tis apparent cannot be, <hi>(i. e.</hi> that appear such
to him who judges by the principles of natural
reason, which yet cannot judg of supernatural and
infinite beings,) tho the Holy Scripture does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
say they are, yet must not be admitted; <hi>&amp;

And so he therfore serves that great variety of

against the universal notions of those words,
not only which the Church of Christ, but which
the Jew's and which the heathen world had of
them. And when his reason told him that Christ
could not be <hi>God one with his Father,</hi> that he was
so far from having any being from eternity, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99615:18"/>
that he was not at all, till he had a being from the

those two expressly. Yea worse, when to prove

we urge from the first Chap. to the<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 1. 10. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Hebr.</hi> what

               <hi>Psalms,</hi> and does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to him most particularly. <hi>Thou Lord in the
beginning hast lai'd the foundation of the earth, and
the Heavens are the works of thine hands; they shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as
does a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them
up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same,
and thy years shall not fail.</hi> They explain it thus:
that God by Christ will at last destroy these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and this Earth, and change them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that saying in the Psalms; which altho the
Apostle produce at length, as it stood there, both
concerning the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> of the
world, yet he intended only to apply this last to
Christ. And tho he say as well of the same Lord,
<hi>Thou Lord in the beginning didst lay the foundation of
the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99615:19"/>
as, <hi>thou shalt change them;</hi> yet he meant no more
but that this change God would effect by Christ.
It is not possible that the text can give any the
least countenance to this interpretation. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
explication of this Scripture does not come
from the obscurity of any words in it; for in
the <hi>Psalm</hi> they and we understand the same words
in the same sense exactly: therefore that we
differ here, is not from any thing in the words quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but is wholly from the Principle. And we
may not wonder, for the plain sense will not sute
with their Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>There are no other that are instanc'd in as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from us in points of faith but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists.
I know not whether they account those
differences to be in things necessary to salvation.
<note n="a" place="margin">The reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position might be demonstrated if there were any need of it.</note>If that be true that they allow (for what cause
they know best,) some that are reconcil'd to their
Church to communicate with ours, that is, join
in our worship, and by doing so own the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our faith in distinction to that of others, or
at least espouse the scandal of the owning it; Then
one would think they must account that there is
nothing in our worship don that is unlawful, nor
omitted that is necessary, nor any thing Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99615:19"/>
profest, at least that there's no scandal in the
owning that profession. For if there were, they
did allow them only to profess and act gross sin,
which certainly they would not do. So that poor
Protestants when they are pleas'd to give leave may
be no Heretics, and therfore there is nothing of
it self in that profession faulty. But yet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side since we see they call us Heretics, and
when they have no power over us, damn us to Hell
fires, and when they have had power, damn'd us to
the fire and fagot also; sure they think the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to be in things necessary. But yet the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is easy, how not the obscurity of Scripture,
but a Principle or prejudice does cause this. For
We are bound in conscience to grant they believe
their own Principles. Now 'tis a Principle with
them, that their Church cannot erre, and therfore
that their present faith and consequent depending
practise was their faith and practise alwaies. That it
may appear so, they must seek for countenance
from Scripture: and if any thing there seem to
thwart their faith or practise, they must smooth and
disguise it, that it may look friendly. And 'tis
most certain if the Scripture should be never so
express against them, whilst they think it is not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99615:20"/>
possible that they can err, they cannot think it
possible Scripture can mean what it pretends to
speak. Twere easy to make instances. As first for
invocation of the Saints departed, which with
them is a point of faith,<note n="a" place="margin">L. 1. de Sanct. Beatit. c. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Bellar.</hi> and <hi>Cochleus</hi>
produce that of the Psalms, <hi>I will lift up mine eyes
unto the hills from whence cometh my help.</hi> Psalm. 121.
1. and altho the text directs that looking up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
to the <hi>Lord that made heaven and earth.</hi> v. 2.
and tho it be a Principle with them, that on those
everlasting hills there were no Saints in <hi>Davids</hi>
time that could be invocated, they were all in <hi>lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi>
then they say; yet as I said, they would have
countenance from Scripture, and for want of
better they are therefore forc'd to interpret those
words, <hi>I will lift up mine eys unto the Hills,</hi> thus, <hi>I
will invocate</hi> the Saints. Now will any say 'tis the
obscurity of this Scripture that does hinder Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
from seeing the bright evidence of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and not rather that it is the weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this practice that does make the Romanists
seek to build it on those mountains? So among those
several texts which in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Nicen general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
are produc't for adoration of the images of
Christ and of the Saints, and are expounded to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99615:20"/>
evince it, none is plainer then that which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
now from Bellarmin. I shall give one or
two examples from the Psalms:<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 27. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thy face Lord
will I seek:</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 4. 6.</note> and, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy

               <hi>the rich among the

of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peters patrimony, and it was thus gotten
by this doctrine, which they saw so cleerly in
these Scriptures; when they cannot see the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in those plain words, <hi>Thou shalt not make to
thy self any</hi> whether <hi>Graven image</hi> or idol it matters

'tis obscurity or plainness that makes them see or
not see doctrines in the Scripture: rather if it be
not meerly the necessity of prejudice. So again
we differ in the meaning of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chap. of the

yet to justify this practice they must make it have

               <hi>Drink yee all of it:</hi> and
<hi>this do,</hi> obliges them to find another meaning:

the drinking,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 25.</note> and the drinking to his lay Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.
Nor dare they say in truth it means the
other, for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

words are plain, ther's nothing in the text obscure
that makes us differ; but the practise had by little
&amp; little grown upon them, till it became Universal,
and so grew into their faith: and then since they
believe they cannot erre, they must expound
Christ's words so as they may not contradict
their practise; because that would overthrow
their Principle.</p>
            <p>But the Church that builds upon no Principle
but Gods word, can have no temtation to pervert
or strain it, since what ever does appear to be the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99615:22"/>
meaning of it, that their Principle must needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them to believe. And therfore if it say <hi>This is
my body,</hi> we believe it; if it saies too after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
it is<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27.</note> 
               <hi>bread,</hi> we believe that also: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it therfore says 'tis both, we so believe it
one that it may be the other: which since both
say it is impossible that it can be substantially,
neither hath God in express words told us which
it is substantially; therfore seeing when he calls it
<hi>body,</hi> he is instituting his <hi>Sacrament,</hi> there's all
reason in the world he should mean <hi>Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
since 'tis the most proper meaning: and by
consequence 'tis bread <hi>substantially,</hi> as all waies of
judging in the world assure us. Here's no stress
on Scripture, as there is no Principle to serve;
when as the other makes us differ, not in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
only, even where 'tis plainest; but tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too. For the most express and evident say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the primitive Fathers are on every head of
difference, as much the matter of contention as
the texts of Scripture are; as it were easy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
if that were my business. So that it is meer
deceit to lay our quarrels to defects in Gods
word, and particularly to its obscurity, which
a man would think were evident enough from

this that <hi>Children knew it.</hi> The last thing I am to

            <p>And that from a child thou hast known the holy
Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
salvation through faith which is in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
            <p>I cannot pass this, that it is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
that <hi>Timothy</hi> was nurst up in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
from his childhood. Yea and since his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was an Heathen, he must have bin taught them
by his <hi>Grandmother Loïs,</hi> and <hi>his Mother Eunice,</hi>
whose faith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 5. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
therfore then, and <hi>Women,</hi> and they sure are
<hi>Laics,</hi> read the Bible. Yea and since they knew
it, they must read it in a language which they
understood: and we know where that is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
now. If we consider the first prohibition that
appear'd in that Church with Synodical autority
against such mens having any Bibles in their own
tongue, we shall find it was immediately upon
the preaching of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> one of whose
doctrines it was,<note n="a" place="margin">Vsser. de Chris. Eccle. success. c. 6. §. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that the Scripture was the rule to
judg of faith by: so that whatsoever was not consonant
to that must be refus'd.</hi> This they preach't in France
and over Europe in the latter end of the<note n="b" place="margin">c. 8. §. 1.</note> 12 Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99615:23"/>
and that Council which forbad their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Bible, we find lately put forth by the
frier<note n="c" place="margin">Spicileg. tom. 2. p. 624.</note> 
               <hi>D. Achery</hi> as held at <hi>Tholouse</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century. It seems they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
then their doctrines hardly would abide that
touchstone: And they therfore had no surer, more
compendious way for its security then to prevent
such trial, taking care men should not know what
was or what was not in Scripture. And it is not
possible for me to give account why in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising
they leave out all that part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven
image,</hi> &amp;c. but this only, that they dare not let the
laity compare their doctrine and their practice
with that Scripture. But tho it is possible they
might conceive some danger if the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
should be expos'd, yet in those portions
which the Church it self chose out for her own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
the <hi>little lessons,</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi> and <hi>Gospels,</hi>
those sure one would think were safe: no, not their
<hi>Psalter, Breviary,</hi> nor their <hi>Hours of the Blessed Virgin</hi>
must they have translated in their own tongue;
as that<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 4.</note> Council did determin. And truly when
the Roman Missal was turn'd lately into French,
and had bin allow'd to be so by the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

it be otherwise) the mass is certainly a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
when 'tis made a burnt offering to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
his holiness's indignation: when that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Memorial of Christs passion again suffers, and
their sacred offices are martyr'd. To see the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of times; 'twas heretofore a <hi>Pagan Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian,</hi>
a strange prodigy of cruelty, who by his
edict did command all Christians to deliver up their
Bibles or their bodies to be burnt: 'Twas here
his <hi>Holiness, Christs Vicar,</hi> who by his Bull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
all to give up theirs, that is all of it that they
will allow them, and their praiers also, that
they may be forthwith burnt, or themselves to
be excommunicated, that is their souls to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to eternal flames. And whereas then those
only that did give theirs up were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
all Christians shun'd them as they would
the plague; and multitudes, whole regions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gave themselves up to the fire to preserve their
Bibles: now those only that have none, or that
deliver up theirs, are the true obedient sons of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99615:24"/>
that Church, and the thorough Catholics. I know
men plead great danger in that book: it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as the source of monstrous doctrines and
rebellions. I will not say these men are bold that
take upon them to be wiser then Allmighty God,
and to see dangers he foresaw not, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them by such methods as thwart his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments;
but I will say that those who talk thus
certainly despise their hearers; as if we knew not
Heresies were hatcht by those that understood the
Bible untranslated: and as if we never heard there
were rebellions among them that were forbid to
read the Bible. For if there were a <hi>Covenant</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them that had it in their own tongue, so
there was an <hi>Holy League</hi> amongst those men that
were deni'd it. While those that had the guidance
of the subjects conscience were themselves subject
to a forreign power, as all Priests of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
are, How many Kings and Emperors
have there bin that did keep the Scriptures from
their people, but yet could not keep their people
from sedition, nor themselves from ruine by it? In
fine when God himself for his own people caus'd
his Scripture to be written in their own tongue,
to be weekly read in public to, and day and night
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99615:25"/>
in private by the people; and when the Apostles
by the inspiration of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> indited Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for the world, they did it in the language
that was then most vulgar to the world: what
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> thus appointed as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
means for the Salvation of the world, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine

            <p>But to leave the controversy and speak to the
advantages which may be had from early institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Scripture; 'tis so evident that I need
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99615:25"/>
not observe how 'tis for want of principles imprest
and wrought into the mind in Childhood, that our
youth is so licencious. And 'tis not possible it
can be otherwise, when they have nothing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to constitution, when tis growing, and to
all the temtations both of objects and example;
no strict sense of duty planted in them, no such
notions as would make resistance to the risings
of their inclination, and seducements of ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
and they therefore follow and indulge to all
of them. And in Gods name why do parents
give their Children up to God in their first infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
deliver him so early a possession of them? as
if they would have Religion to take seizure on
them strait, as if by their baptizing them so soon,
they meant to consecrate their whole lives to Gods
service, make them his as soon as they were theirs,
as if they had bin given them meerly for Gods u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
And they therfore enter them into a vow of
Religion almost as soon as they have them: why
all this? if accordingly they do not season and
prepare them as they shall grow capable. Why
when they are but newly born their children, do
they take care they shall be regenerate and born
again Gods children? if they do not furnish them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99615:26"/>
with necessaries, educate them into all the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and hopes that appertain to the condition
of Gods children, as well as they do to that of
their own. That parent which not only, like
some delicate ones refuses her own breasts to her
own infant, but provides no other to sustain it;
that does only wash her babe from i'ts first blood
and uncleanness to expose it the more handsom
prey to wolves and tigers in the desert, is more
savage then those tigers:<note n="a" place="margin">Lam. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>even the sea monsters draw
out the breasts, they give suck to their young ones,</hi>
saith lamenting <hi>Ieremy,</hi> but he adds <hi>the daughter
of my people is cruel like the Ostrich in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 39. 14.</note>
               <hi>which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
that the foot may crush them, or that the
wild beast may break them, shee is hardned against
her young ones:</hi> such are they who when their
children are so born again to God, yet as they
shall wax capable provide not that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi>
calls the <hi>sincere milk of the word that they may grow
thereby:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> but from their being washt so in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of regeneration, take no more care, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them forthwith to such lusts and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as are much more wild and savage then those
beasts in the comparison; to which they cannot
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99615:26"/>
choose but be a prey. They strive indeed, they say,
to educate them into men betimes, that is, make
them conversible and bold: and since for that they
must engage them into frequent company, where
they see and hear mens follies, that I say no worse;
by that means they come to have their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
stor'd with nothing but the Modes, and sins
of conversation; fill'd with froth and puddle;
men betimes only thus, as they have forwarded
their inclinations to, and got an early understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and experience of, those vices, which one
would think men only could be equal for. But by
this means the mind, that only part that makes
us be men, is not only not improv'd, but dwarft.
They do not only still continue children in their
understanding, as to any thing that's real and solid;
but the hopes of reason are destroy'd in them,
and its growth kill'd, by turniug all its nurish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to feed the beast part; and the Christian
is quite starv'd. There needs no other cause be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the most part, why so many men have no
Religion, own being Libertines, and profess vice;
for want of education they have nothing in them
that does check this, for they had no principles
of a Religion instil'd into them. And if at any time
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99615:27"/>
it comes to pass that they think it is their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to take upon them the profession of some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they therfore, since they have no Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
nor rules to judg by, are most apt to choose
to profess that Religion, which is like to be most
gentle to the courses they have steer'd, and are
engag'd in. Now that men hope to find such an
one, (whether by its constitution I shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
but,) by i'ts practice is but too appaernt. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
when they go over to it, they carry with
them, and preserve in it the vices of their no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and by consequence they went not over
seriously for Religion: and are therfore so much
worse now then when they own'd no Religion,
that they do their wickednesses with certainty of
easy absolution, and so hopes of salvation; and
by this are likely to be made twofold more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Hell then before: and let them triumph
in such conquests. Ther's nothing in the world
that contributes so much to this as mens being not
acquainted early with, instructed in, those divine
rules and obligations to piety and virtue, which
this book the Bible does afford. If men had bin
season'd first with the knowledg and the sense of
duty, with the comforts that are in it, with the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99615:27"/>
apprehensions of great blessings that attend it; and
the mischiefs that are consequent, indeed essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to impiety and vice here; and their minds were
furnisht with examples of both, which this book
abounds with; and their hearts too rais'd with
expectations of far greater blessedness in a life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
and with the belief that both that blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and life shall have no end: and were made
sensible also of strange dreadful torments that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait
the breach of duty, which shall also last for
ever: If these impressions I say, did prevent all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and take up the mind, and had in them the
stamp and character of <hi>God,</hi> and so there were a
reverence and awe of him wrought in them, and
they lookt upon him as concern'd in all this; how
it was his word that said; and these sentiments
were grown into the very habit of their mind; as
it would not be easy to corrupt or soften such, so
'twould be much more difficult to shake them, since
their faith is founded on <hi>the rock of ages.</hi> Besides the
Holy Scriptures carry in them such an obligation of
adhering to them, and to them alone, since they are
sufficient <hi>to make us wise unto salvation,</hi> and are <hi>Gods
word,</hi> that men would not be apt to exchange them
for Legends, pious forgeries, for things that can make
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99615:28"/>
good no certain title from the Lord: for let them
shew an equal derivation of it, bring it down
through all the ages ae we have don the Scriptures
title to him. Otherwise it justly may provoke Gods
exclamation in the Prophet<note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 2. 13.</note>

O ye Heavens, and be horribly afraid, be

have committed two evils, they have forsaken
me the fountain of living waters, and hew'd
them out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold
no water:</q> cisterns therfore that may leave them
in a state to want a drop of water, when their
tongue shall be horribly tormented: whereas he
