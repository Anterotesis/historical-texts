            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

againſt the apparant practiſe of the

in the evidence of the ſpirit, upon the plaine

approved by Christ himſelfe in the very insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and haue no warrant from the word of
God for their ſo doing, do directly <hi>blaſpheme
the Lord;</hi> which place, that <hi>I</hi> be not cenſured
to abuſe, or any other at any time upon this
<pb facs="tcp:24639:4"/>
occaſion mentioned by me, this once for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
<hi>I</hi> doe in all humility deſire the godly
to conſider and remember, that howſoever eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place of Scripture hath a particular intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or ſpeciall reſpect, yet in the large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thereof (as it hath relation unto all ages,
Churches, and perſons) there is alſo, and that
warrantably a more generall drift and purpoſe
directly intended: though therefore <hi>I</hi> preſſe
them not in that ſpeciall or particular intent,
yet if according to the true Analogie of
faith, <hi>I</hi> uſe and urge them in the larger ſence,
and reſpectiue meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>I</hi>
hope <hi>I</hi> may ſaſely, yea in the aſſurance of faith
iuſtifie, that <hi>I</hi> erre not from the direct pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the ſpirit of truth. As for example,
the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>not to heare the
the voyce of Chriſt</hi> even in <hi>all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">heb. 3 13. 15 with Act. 3. 22.</note> will
harden <hi>the heart.</hi> Whence <hi>I</hi> conclude from
the large extent and generall ſcope of theſe
places. That not to heare and regard the word
of God (which is the voyce of Chriſt) which
plainly declares that Chriſt hath approued a
table-geſture, and no other, and yet to declare
and teach the people that any geſture ordained
by the Church, and in particular this in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
is lawfull and ought onely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to, or in caſes of extremity may bee
vndergone as a burden, though Chriſt haue
given no warrant for it, <hi>I</hi> ſay ſuch poſitions
and courſes taken and maintained, will <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
the wiſest, moſt learned, beſt diſpoſed,
and moſt zealous heart or hearts of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt
<pb facs="tcp:24639:5"/>
teachers and profeſſors in the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in the world. Againe, it is
ſaid, <hi>When Chriſt commeth hee will tell
us all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 25.</note> the particular intent of this
place concernes the publicke worſhip of God;
from the larger and generall ſcope whereof, <hi>I</hi>
hold it a moſt warrantable concluſion, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in his word hath certainly made
knowne what geſture we may conforme to in
the act of receiving the Lords Supper (being
eſſentially neceſſary in this part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
but in the whole Scrip. Chriſt hath not
given approbation to any but a Table-geſture:
therefore no other may bee conformed unto.
For theſe things were not written for them
of thoſe times onely,<note place="margin">Ro. 4. 23. ver. 24.</note> but for <hi>us alſo:</hi> yea for
all the churches to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Another thing I alſo deſire not to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in, namely that though I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
and therfore confidently affirme, that
Conformitie to any gesture of religious vſe in
the worſhip of God, being not warranted by
the word, is abſolutly vnlawfull and ſinfull,
yet do I not thereby Iudge, or hold all Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants,
to be vile and wicked perſons:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> or that
ſuch Congregations are not the true Churches
of Chriſt, for I know, it is <hi>God which works
both the will and the deede, euen of his
good pleaſure,</hi> as he ſees beſt, not alike at all
times, nor to all perſons, but ſome ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ignorant of ſome truths (yet not to be
therfore ſeperated from.<note place="margin">pſ. 119. 113.</note> Others <hi>hate all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi>
(yet not therfore to be runne after
<pb facs="tcp:24639:5"/>
as if they were the onely true churches, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <note place="margin">pſ. 119. 104. 120.</note> and yet both of theſe the true Churches
and faithfull ſervants of God. Onely my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
before the Lord is to ſtrip hypocrits of that
conceite which they haue of their wiſdom,
learning, authoritie, and great eſtimation
which they haue purchaſed or obtained in the
world, for nature, or the naturall man, putting
on the ſhew of grace, or the name and title of
the <hi>ſpirituall man</hi> (as the Aſſe in the lyons
ſkinne) is preſently conceated, that forthwith
they are Canonically holy, ſpirituall, or diuine,
becauſe ſuch traditionall titles, are ſucceſſiuoly
compounded for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (though none in the world
be more lycentious and profane then euen ſome
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) yea and that in theſe outward forms of
Godlines diviſed by man for Gods diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and ſervice, the verie ſubſtance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo farre as it is outward and ſubiect to
ſence, doth in a ſpeciall or principall parte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:
for they hold, that no man neede or ought
to make queſtion, but that theſe humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
being performed (not in ſuperſtition
but in a good Intention,) are moſt acceptable
&amp; well pleaſing unto God, and therefore ought
of verie conſcience to be conformed unto. In
which reſpect I do ſtryue gladly to dryue them
from this deceitfull and conceited kinde of
pleading, by a Iudicial proceeding to the triall
of their faith, for ſo ſhall wee quickely diſcern
<pb facs="tcp:24639:6"/>
what they are, <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Vnbeleevers;</hi> for
profeſſion of the truth (though never ſo fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall)
no nor practiſe of it alſo, makes
not a true beleever, though a true profeſſor,
for even that man of ſin himſelfe, and many
other of like ambitious humour, know and
acknowledge, profeſſe and practiſe many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
truths;<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2. with 3. 19.</note> but <hi>faith</hi> onely puts the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and proues who is for the Lord, and who
bolds on the other ſide againſt him. What
action or ceremony then ſoever of Religious
uſe is not conformed unto in faith, is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to in infidelity, unleſſe we muſt admit of
<hi>Agrippa</hi> his <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note> halfe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
halfe infidell, halfe Papiſt halfe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
halfe of God and halfe of the Divell,
halfe Turke and halfe Christian: not that
<hi>I</hi> aime at any other perfection but that which
is Evangelicall, even ſincerity and truth in all
things;<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 32</note> but to declare that <hi>all are ſhut up
under unbeliefe,</hi> though they be never ſo
wiſe and learned, great and many, till they bee
enlightned. But theſe men ſay and ſweare,
they haue faith, yea a iuſtifying, living, and
ſaving faith, as well as the beſt of them all, and
in their conformity do liue and walke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
This is ſoone ſaid, but not ſo ſoone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Let us therefore come to the tryall:
Faith conſiſts not in good opinion, or well
meaning, or preventing inconueniences. For
though I intend in kneeling before an image,
onely to ſtirre up my heart to devotion, that <hi>I</hi>
may with greater feeling and fervency call
<pb facs="tcp:24639:6"/>
vpon God in the confeſſion of my ſins, and
craving pardon for the ſame; yet this is not
done in faith, no though <hi>I</hi> finde that in my
conceit ſuch effect therein, even as <hi>I</hi> did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and deſire; for nothing that is in nature,
as wiſedom, reaſon, ſence, diſcretion, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
experience, or whatſoeuer can bee by
any poſſible meanes, in any reſpect the true
object of ſaving faith (for the learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
of all nations haue theſe, and yet all in
the true churches (though true profeſſors)
haue not faith) but onely the <hi>word of God</hi>
is the obiect of faith, yea true and ſaving
faith in all things of holy and religious uſe
in the divine ſervice of God, rejects not onely
what is forbidden therein, but conformes to no
thing but what in the evidence of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is plainly grounded on the Scriptures: for
without the warrant and commandement of
the word, ſubſcription to or approbation of
any thing of divine uſe cannot bee an act of
the faith of Gods elect, but of ſome other
counterfet faith, transformed <hi>I</hi> confeſſe into
the likeneſſe or appearance thereof, which (like
<hi>Will with wiſpe,</hi> ar <hi>Megg with Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi>

the boggs and quagmires of <hi>Armenius</hi> his
inherent grace, free-will, or other like deceiuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fables, and damnable errors. So that this
is not an argument of true faith, if <hi>I</hi> doe not

church overtbrowne, and the like, or it is not
forbidden in the ſcripture, therefore though it
be of religious uſe in the worſhip of God, and
be onely deviſed by man, yet thou mayest, yea
being commanded, oughteſt to conforme
unto it: but directly it is a plaine doctrine of
infidelity. For whereon I pray you is faith
grounded in ſuch a caſe, but onely upon meere
and wilde vncertainty (a ſea whereof this
ſluce will open.) As therefore it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of <hi>fooles</hi> to doubt of any thing which
the Scriptures teach;<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 25</note> ſo it muſt needes be a
ſpeciall branch of infidelity, in matters of
conformity to things of religious uſe in Gods
publicke worſhip, to ground our faith therein
(for hope they will not ſay but they doe it in
faith) on any thing but the ſacred Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now the Word telleth vs plainely that a
table geſture was ſanctified by our Lord in the

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
thereto is plainly grounded on the
ſcriptures? and ſeing no other gesture is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Scripture, is not the doctrine of
conformitie to any other whatſoeuer our faith
therein being grounded on vncertainty a direct
doctrine of Infidelity? may not the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſts

               <note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 1.</note> why ſo <hi>I</hi> pray you will ſome ſay,
what do they reporte? euen this, that in the

geſture in the act of taking or rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:24639:7"/>
the holy bread and wine, was onely a
table geſture and no other will the profeſſing
and beleeving many other truthes, though thou
willfuly (againſt the plane ouidence of the
truth) refuſe to beleeue this, euer prooue the to
be a ſound Chriſtian; hath Chriſt honoured a
table geſture, and do men onely honor another
geſture? will you ſay then conformity to them
is an action of faith and yet refuſe thereby that
geſture which Chriſt by his preſence &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
honored? is not this <hi>to loue the
praiſe of men</hi> (or that which men praiſe)
<hi>more then the praiſe of God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 43.</note> (or that
which his word commends) true it is <hi>I</hi> knowe,
that men do preferre thoſe that conforme vnto
them, and will not Chriſt doe ſo alſo? Yea, is
it not a marke of infidelity to <hi>receiue</hi> ſuch
<hi>honour one of another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 44.</note> 
               <hi>and ſeeke not the
honour that commeth from God alone?</hi>
Will you feare the diſpleaſure of man if you
doe not conforme? and will you not feare the
diſpleaſure of God if you do not conforme to
his geſture in the act of receiving? I ſay his
geſture, for ſo none can deny but it was in
the inſtitution, <hi>I</hi> meane of his direct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting;
and did he ever caſhiere it? or did
his Apoſtles or true churches ever diſlike or

And muſt a Table-geſture,

even chiefe pillars and arch-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
to lay that imputation upon it, &amp; ſo
by their canons to conclude and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
againſt it? I beſeech you rather to
to conſider, whether this diſgracefull
foundation thus openly laid upon the
divine doctrine of the holy ceremony,
preſage not (though they pretend the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:24639:11"/>
contrary) ſome evill intendment cloſely
to depraue and corrupt by degrees the

            <p>May any thing appropriated to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
uſe in the publick worſhip of God,
be prophane or carnall? And are not the
beſt deviſed devotions of the holieſt and

poſſibly can be, of this very nature? yea,
doth not the Scripture uſually ſet in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
oppoſition unto God himſelfe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
being eſſentially neceſſary in his
worſhip (as a geſture in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
is) which is not ordained by God,
or warranted by his word? ſtiling them
with the titles of <hi>Novelty</hi> &amp; <hi>Innovation,</hi> or
deviſes, imaginations of their own hearts,
new gods, ſtrange or other gods, &amp;c. not
that ever thereby (in the Church eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially)
any other Deitie was once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
or any foundation concerning the
doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity, ſhaken or
controverted: but, though they held the
doctrine of the inward ſubſtance ſound, as
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> did, yet in the outward actions
and ceremonies of his worſhip, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
manner of his ſervice they erred,
not onely from the particuler directions
of the ceremoniall law, but from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſcope of the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
viz. to ſerue God onely as hee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:24639:11"/>
requires in his word.</p>
            <p>Gods worſhip is either inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
that concernes the ſoule and is
contained in the firſt commandement:
this pertaines to the bodily exerciſes, and
is taught in the doctrines appertaining to
the ſecond commandement, forbidding
all other not required therein; not that
theſe may bee ſeparated, though diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed:
for as ſoule and body make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
perſon, ſo do theſe two make an entire
worſhip, and neither of them can in this
world be performed alone: for as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is the life and ſoule of the outward,
ſo the outward is the inſtrument of the
ſoule to expreſſe the inward; yea both
theſe without thoſe affections of the third
commandement, even <hi>holines to the Lord,
are in vaine;</hi> and all three (if poſſibly that
can be) without a conſcionable obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sabboth, are abhominable.
Now as all the inward graces of the firſt
commandement, are the meere and free
gifts of God, and not at a mans command:
ſo all things eſſentially neceſſary in his
outward worſhip (as a geſture in the act
of receiving the Sacrament is) are Gods
inſtruments for the edification of his
Church, even his conduits to convey thoſe
inward graces by: which ſupernaturall
vertue, or divine property they cannot
poſſibly haue from the canons or precepts
of men (though all the Chriſtian world
ioyne together therein) but onely from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:24639:12"/>
the free will of God in making choyce of
them, and ſo appointing and ordaining
them to ſuch holy ends and purpoſes. As
therefore nothing ought to bee confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
unto in his outward worſhip, but
what is for edification: ſo nothing can
poſſibly be for edification in any degree
or reſpect, but what the Lord himſelfe
hath appointed for that uſe and purpoſe.
Either then kneeling for matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as it is urged, is for edification (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is pretended) or elſe it may not bee
conformed unto: but for edification it
cannot be, unleſſe God haue commanded
it; and therfore either proue by the word,
that God hath commanded it in the act
of receiving, or elſe (though he haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it in other parts of his worſhip,
and though you ſay it is not forbidden
in this) it is a humane device (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
edifies but deſtroyes) and therefore
of abſolute neceſsity to conforme thereto
in the act of receiving the L. Supper, is ſin.</p>
            <p>The Iewes ſilled the outward worſhip
of God with actions, and ceremonies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
by them ſelves or by ſome other
bordring people whoſe affinity they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and whoſe conuerſion they perhapps

againſt them that of neceſſitie the
word muſt come to the elements, to
prooue and make it plaine that God hath
ordained theſe verie viſible ſigns to be his
inſtruments of grace for the edification of
his Church, or els (though they haue all
the devouteſt ſignifications that man can
deuiſe) there can be no ſacrament, and
haue your ceremoniall ſignes ſuch a ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame
prerogatiue as without direct war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the word they ought <hi>ipſo facto</hi>
to be conformed vnto? Indeed if a Reall
preſence (which in the ſcriptures ſence we
acknowledg) had deſtroyed the nature as
it changeth the vſe, of the elements then
the breaden geſture, or the geſture of
kneeling vſed to the breaden god, had
beene an vnavoidable conſequence.</p>
            <p>God is the God of the order, as well as
of the ſubſtance of his worſhip, yea the
verie outward order is a ſpeciall parte of
the ſubſtance of his outward worſhip, and
a principall parte of the proper ſubiect of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:24639:13"/>
the ſecond Commandement, which
honor of ordaining &amp; ordering his owne
ceremonies in his own worſhip he neuer
committed to Angell prophet or Apoſtle,
but laid the gouernment thereof only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Chriſt, and will not giue it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now Chriſts gouernment for order
in the act of receving, we ſee to be a table
geſture dare we then forſake this and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to your order of kneeling without
any warrant from the word of Chriſt, no
not ſo much as from an Angel, a prophet,
or an Apoſtle, or Apoſtolicall Churches?</p>
            <p>In the Inſtitution, the Ceremonies of
the ſacrament had the ſame warrant from
Chriſt that the ſignes had. If then it be
an infallible marke of Antichriſt to take
away or alter the Elementall ſignes, in
which ſpiritually Chriſt is Really exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
how can you Iuſtifie the alteration
of the ceremoniall ſigne by which euery
faithfull beleeuer doth really receaue
him; are not both theſe ſigns together ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
vnited, to be thoſe verie viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; grauen Images, or moſt liuely and
reall repreſentions, whereby as by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and predeſtinated inſtruments; God
the father doth giue Ieſus Chriſt his ſon,
&amp; all his graces to his children according
to the meaſure of euery man, by the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
working of the holy ghoſt; yea, are
not theſe together (for without both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be effected) I meane the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
and ceremonial ſignes, by Gods
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:24639:13"/>
owne ordinance efficient (inſtrumentally)
to exhibit and receaue whole Chriſt and
all his benefits? and yet will you (O
what will not the Rebellious will of man
preſume to do?) againſt his direct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<hi>make vnto your ſelues other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages</hi>
and alter theſe? Hereto you reply and
ſay they are but ceremonies; and thereto
ſay I no more was the calf in <hi>Horeb</hi> or
thoſe in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> yea theſe are
Chriſts Ceremonies, and the very Ark or
Cherubims were no more. Theſe are not
therefore Idle,or for ſtate and ornament,
or vpon any reſpect or conſideration to be
varîed, but purpoſely ordained and in the
moſt abſolute perfection of the divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in the verie inſtitution, for the help
and ſtrengthening of our weak faith, vſed
and eſtabliſhed: being therefore by Chriſt
vnited, and Ioyned with the word to make
a perfect ſacrament and a compleat maner
of pertaking ſpiritual food, how may they
by any humane authority ever bee altred?
doth not ſuch a graunt ſtrike mainly and
fundamentally at the authority of the
ſecond Commandement? yea is it not
high preſumption when the Lord offers
this heavenly food, not by peeces but in
fullnes, neither ſeuering his graces from
the ſubſtance, nor the ſubſtance from the
graces, but even whole Chriſt and all his
merits, for us to alter not the placing or
order onely, which himſelfe uſed (and
therefore being never repealed, thereby
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:24639:14"/>
eſtabliſhed) which yet were a fault foule
enough; but the very diſhes or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
themſelues, wherein this ſpirituall
food is prepared, tendred and received as
ſome in reſtraining the cup, others in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the very elements, and you in alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the geſture (for ſo much doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
profeſſe) wherewith it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
As therefore no one part of Chriſt
wrought our ſalvation, but whole Chriſt,
and as where there is no more but the
body and bloud of Chriſt received (if
that poſſibly could be, yea though really)
there is no Chriſt received, becauſe it is
the ſpirit or divine grace that quickneth
unto eternall life; and therefore the true
receiving muſt be ſpirituall and of whole
Chriſt, God and man, or elſe no benefit is
received: even ſo the viſible inſtruments
(corporall ſubſtances or bodily exerciſes)
which in the inſtitution our Lord united
for the exhibiting and receiving this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
food, may not be ſeparated, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
altered, or diſplaced. Seeing then the
Lord himſelfe for the effecting of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and ſpirituall worke, hath ioyned
them together, is it not high preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I ſay, to alter them, or put them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder:</p>
            <p>True it is, that the ſpirituall eye, hand,
and mouth, onely ſeeth, receiveth, and
pertaketh this heavenly food, and I dare
appeale to any who haue this eye to bee
iudge in this caſe, even which geſture is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:24639:14"/>
moſt decent and ſeemly, that which out
bleſſed Lord and Saviour in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacrament made choyce of,
as the very beſt of all other whatſoever
(for I hope you will not deny but that if
he had known a better, I mean would he
ever haue had his Churches to haue a
better opinion of any other as more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
or in any reſpect more uſeful or as fit,
he would either then haue choſen it, for
ſome of his diſciples to haue uſed, or elſe
left warrant in the word for our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thereto) or whether that geſture in
caſe of deprivation be rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto (for ſo much you inferre
notwithſtanding your diſtinctions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe,
and I know not what) which
many hundred yeares after was deviſed
by Antichriſt: were his doctrines, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Divels becauſe they were of
his owne deviſing, and are not his cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the ſame diſpoſition? And yet
muſt we conforme unto them, or by your
own confeſſion, to the likeneſſe of them?
Is there no tranſgreſsion in this, haue we
no precept for <hi>things of good report?</hi> Doth
no commandement forbid <hi>all appearance
of evill,</hi> yea the uſe of any thing (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commanded by God, for then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
indeed is onely to bee taken away)
which hath been an inſtrument of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry?</p>
            <p>This Sacrament was ordained, not to
nouriſh to a carnall or temporall life, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:24639:15"/>
to a holy and ſpirituall, that ſo in all the
occaſions and occurrences of this world,
we might liue by faith, and be made able
more and more to bring forth the fruits
thereof, it muſt of neceſſity therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that this ceremonial ſigne or geſture,
or any thing eſſentially neceſſary in the
act of receiving this holy nouriſhment,
may not be carnall, or of humane devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
but holy and ſpirituall, not onely in
the intention of the party (for ſo was
theirs to the Calfe) but of divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
or elſe whatſoever the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes
of it, it is moſt abhominable unto
God, and dare we then conforme unto it?
ſo that what geſture ſoever is propoſed,
if Chriſt haue not ordained it, it is ſtrange
and vnlawfull, and ſo not being holy,
conformity thereto is hatefull, for none
can make a geſture for the ſacrament ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but onely he that may ordaine a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>As the elementall ſigne being delivered
hath relation to the ſpirituall thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
ſo the ceremoniall ſigne or ſignificant
geſture in the act of receiving, hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the very true and aſſured parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of that heavenly feaſt and ſpirituall
food which is the thing ſignified, and
whereunto the Lord hath invited us as his
moſt welcome gueſts, and deerely beloved
friends, even to his owne Table to haue
communion and fellowſhip with him in
partaking of his divine nature in the act
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:24639:15"/>
of receiving this ſacrament. Therefore as
in caſes of extremitie to uſe other ſignes
herein, is erroneous, and wilfully to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
therein, is directly hereſie, and as the
Papiſts (in ordaining an other manner of
union or coniunction betwixt the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
ſignes and the ſpirituall things
ſignified, then the nature of them will
ſuffer) do deſtroy the Sacrament, and by
changing it into a ſacrifice, commit moſt
damnable Idolatry: ſo you in iuſtifying,
defending, or excuſing without warrant
from God, this geſture of kneeling as it is
urged) altogether diſproportionall to a
Feaſt, or Supper, and to a Table wherein
the viſible ſignes are ſet apart, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
(though you waſh your hands ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo often, to giue teſtimony of your
innocency) doe giue ſentence againſt
Chriſt his own practiſe in the inſtitution,
the ſole preſident of the whole action, and
doe directly inferre that you hane a more
fit and decent geſture then he could finde
out and make choyce of.</p>
            <p>As the ſacrament admits no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
betwixt the viſible ſignes and
the things ſignified then a ſacramentall,
which is not ſubiect to ſence and reaſon,
but is meerly miſticall, ſecret and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
ſo the geſture by the ſame ordinance
of Iuſtitution is of the very ſame nature,
and may not without grievous ſin vpon
any terms or conſideration whatſoeuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
admit of any Innouation or alteration
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:24639:16"/>
though all the reaſon wiſdome, learning
common ſence and vnderſtanding in the
whole world do neuer ſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
thereof, but muſt be miſticall,
ſecret, and ſpirituall perpetually, euen
hold proportion with and haue relation
vnto a table, and to a feaſt, and a great
ſupper ſet and to be communicated
thereon. Whoſoeuer therfore ſhall bnt ad
any other miſticall ſignification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
or tranſlate this to any other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
then was in the inſtitution ſeeme it
neuer ſo full of decencie, deuotion,
and humilitie, yea though the godly
themſelues proteſt they can as comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
receiue the ſacrament there with, as
with that of the inſtitution, yet ſhall they
be Iudged as thoſe that add vnto the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Chriſt, and therfore ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
an additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his indignation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no geſture but a ſacramentall (and
ſuch in this caſe is the table geſture only,
which our Lord him ſelf in the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
being author thereof) may vpon any
termes or in any reſpect, in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
be conformed vnto,</p>
            <p>Vnles you hold that Chriſts inſtitution
is herein defectiue, and therefore variable
without his own warrant, which we haue
for the alteration of the time) who but
that blaſphemous man of ſin and his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
or freinds dare profeſſe, they haue
power to ordaine a ſacramentall geſture,
or any other eſſentiall propertie of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24639:16"/>
for it that of the inſtitution by
Chriſt be ſufficient (and els you deny his
ſufficience in this) then any other is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
and therefore a humane additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
which admitted to haue dominion in
one thing will be reſiſted in nothing. Is
not this a ſpeciall parte of the foundation
of our Comfort and ſtay in all occaſions
that whatſoeuer God hath done muſt
needs be good and iuſt, and to open our
mouthes againſt it, is to call in queſtion
his wiſdom, goodnes and truth, and yet
dare fleſh and bloud with voyces of
trumpets, or the flaſhing report of a
thundring Canon proclaime, that though
Chriſt haue done it, euen approued of a
table geſture onely, in all his diſciples in
the inſtitution and neuer gaue warrant
for any other, yet kneeling is better, more
ſignificant and decent; yea do not the beſt
of you by your vnwilling conformity
willfully admit imperfection and defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the geſture of the inſtitution ſeing
you haue no warrant from Chriſt to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
from it?</p>
            <p>As the miſticall, ſpirituall and ſecret
Coniunction betweene the ſignes and
things ſignified, is not ſeene with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
eye, nor can poſſibly be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or demonſtrated by humane learning
wiſdom or ſence? ſo I do verely beleue
that they cannot choſe but grievouſlly err
(be they neuer ſo wiſe, learned, Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
zealous and holy) who take vpon them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:24639:17"/>
to Indge and diſcerne the fitnes, decencie
and lawfulneſſe of this ſacramentall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
or the geſture in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſacrament, by the iudgement of
reaſon and ſence, without warrant from
the word of God. For as the blind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
iudge of colours, no more can the
quickeſt or moſt learned and beſt qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſence in the world, diſcerne or iudge
of that which is ſacramentall, or is of a
ſignificant or ſpirituall uſe in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or publick worſhip of God, but as
the blinde eſteemes every colour alike, ſo
doth ſence thinke every geſture indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
onely the ſpirituall eye is able to
put this ſpirituall difference, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
of the miſtery or ſpirituall ſecreſie
of the Table geſture (which in and by the
inſtitution onely hath <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e ſeale and brand
of Chriſt ſet upon it) which muſt needes
be relatiue or reſpectiue, even according
to that which on the Table is tendred,
and by the gueſts or communicants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and ſo holds due Analogy, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or proportion therewith.</p>
            <p>There bee three things conſiderable
concerning this bleſſed ſacrament. Firſt,
that which goes before: ſecondly, the
action it ſelfe: thirdly, that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
after. Now as to omit any of theſe
is a grievous ſinne, ſo to diſplace them is
wicked and abhominable. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
preparation muſt go before, &amp; thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
is to come after, and meditation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:24639:17"/>
properly belongs to the action it ſelfe: he
that leaues his preparation, and doth not
examine himſelfe till after the action, is
an unworthy receiver, and eates &amp; drinks
iudgement; yet I confeſſe that theſe are
ſo united as they are inſeparable, and that
not any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be alone in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but that they are all mixed one with
another, onely the ſoule is properly to
haue reſpect unto theſe in this manner and
order; and ſo accordingly we are to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
the fitteſt and moſt proper time
for preparation to be before, for medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be in the time of the action, for
thankeſgiving after: which ſhewes, that
howſoever there is thankeſgiving in all
theſe, yet it cannot properly be ſaid, that
the whole action is a thankeſgiving, and
yet if it might, kneeling is not the fitteſt
geſture for thankeſgiving in this action.</p>
            <p>There be two ſorts of ſignes in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
Elementall that is bread and
wine, and Ceremoniall that is actions and
geſtures ſome of theſe concern, or are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the paſt or alone, ſome to the people
alone, ſome common to both, and euery
one of theſe haue divine ſignifications pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier
and ſeuerall to themſelues euen
haue a miſticall and ſeetet Relation to an
inviſible grace or heavenly thing, not by
the appointment of any morall power,
but by the ordinance of God for all the
Churches in the world cannot make or
ordain any thing of Religious vſe to haue
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:24639:18"/>
a ſpirituall ſignification, this power is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and peculiar vnto Ieſus Chriſt ſo that
howſoeuer, wyſe, honeſt, learned and
godly men thinke this or that, may very
well haue ſuch a holy vſe and ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that they can with as good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
and heavenly meditation receaue
with this geſture of kneeling, as with a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
geſture, and from their owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
profeſſe as much, yet all this is no
more then <hi>Ieroboams</hi> pretence for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues,
the inward ſubſtance he held and
eſtabliſhed, the outward ſubſtance of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ceremonie he mixed with theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes
of his owne, which yet had by his
appointment, reference and relation to the
ſame heauenly thing in their intention
that the arke had, euen to be the viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of God preſence, and not to
ſignifie or to haue relation to any other
thing els whatſoeuer. But yet the Lord
calls them deuils, and why becauſe they
did ſignifie any diueliſh thing? nothing
leſſe. But though they ſignified by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent and publicke decree and
Eccleſiaſticall canon the preſence of God
euen Iehouah, and many with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
and feeling made that comfortable
vſe of them as they thought, euen as well
as if they had gon to <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> yet becauſe
they were not warranted by the word of
the Lord, therfore they were deuills, &amp; all
the deuotion that the people Imagined
they found themſelves ſtirred vp vnto by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:24639:18"/>
their ſpirituall ſignification and myſticall
relation was meerly of a divelliſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
leading from God. Seeing then not
man but Chriſt himſelf, is author both of
the Elementall and Ceremoniall ſignes,
and alſo vnited them ſacramentally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this myſticall action, that by our
worthy pertaking thereof we might haue
an inſeperable vnion and euerlaſting fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
with him, how dare we conform
to any alteration or innouation herein? If
we reiect the geſture which Chaiſt vſed
or approved in the inſtitution, what right
can wee plead to the ſacrament which
then and therewith he ordained?</p>
            <p>Chriſt vnites and ioynes himſelfe to
his own ordinances in the adminiſtration
of the word and ſacraments, not fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
or doubtfully; but truly, really, and
verily, that partaking in ſincerity of them,
we might be aſſuredly conioyned unto
him, even as certainly as the elementall
ſignes are united unto us, and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
ſignes are performed by us. Let all
Chriſtians therefore who loue the Lord
Ieſus, and deſire to partake of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and ſpirituall union with him, take
heed that they never yeeld to conforme
to a fantaſticall geſture, or doubtfull ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
in the act of receiving, eſpecially
having ſo eſſentiall a property as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
hath, leſt by caſting off the Lords
geſture (or that geſture which our Lord
himſelfe cauſed his Apoſtles to uſe in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:24639:19"/>
inſtitution of the ſacrament) they caſt off
the benefit of the Lords ſacrament, or at
leaſt be found authour of an anti-geſture
which our Lord never warranted; and
therefore cannot to the conformers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
be ever ſanctified.</p>
            <p>It is our happineſſe to bee united unto
Chriſt in the ſacrament, and is it our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
to cleaue faſt to that geſture which
in the inſtitution thereof was by all his
Apoſtles uſed, and by himſelfe bleſſed
for that very end? Here is ſpirituall meat,
come thou with ſpirituall hunger: here is
a holy table, come thou with a holy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture:
and who can make a geſture holy,
or of holy uſe, but the Lord? Not that a
right geſture is ſufficient, unleſſe thou
come with a right heart alſo, examined
or prepared and purged, not onely from
Popery, Non-reſidency, Atheiſme, uſurie,
ambition, oppreſſion, murder, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
blaſphemy, whooredome, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and other bloudy and abhominable
vices; but from every worldly luſt, or
fleſhly pleaſure, which thy ſoule longeth
after: that I doll I ſay muſt be thruſt out
before Chriſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be let in. It is but folly to
profeſſe thy faith in him, and haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of that (I ſpeak not of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which of theſe is firſt, but of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparation.)
All therefore who haue
not this ſpirituall hunger, and ſee not in
the elementall and ceremoniall ſignes this
holy union, haue ſome inviſible Idoll in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:24639:19"/>
them, even ſome ſecret corruption or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſin which lies lurking in the heart,
the cuſtome or continuall fume whereof
hath ſo darkned the ſight, and flattered
the taſte of the ſoule, as it cannot diſcern
or iudge truly in this controverſie, but
eſteemes of one geſture as good as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that which Antichriſt deviſed, as
that which Chriſt approued &amp; hallowed.</p>
            <p>As Gods worſhip even for the ſubſtance
of it, is partly inward and partly outward;
ſo this ſacrament being a ſpeciall part of
his worſhip, is of the ſame nature. The
inward ſubſtance is the ſpirituall things
ſignified: the outward ſubſtance or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is the viſible ſignes ſignifying or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
relation to thoſe ſpirituall things
ſignified. Now whatſoever in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is conformed unto, as having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to theſe ſpirituall things ſignified
(whether it be purity or holineſſe of life,
or humility, devotion, or whatſoever)
muſt of neceſſity be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed to be (in the
acceptation of theſe that ſo uſe it) a part
of Gods outward worſhip, which conſiſts
of outward and viſible things, as actions,
geſtures and ceremonies, ſignifying, and
having reference unto ſome inviſible
thing ſignified. True indeed, every thing
uſed in the worſhip of God, is not I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
of this nature, as our uſuall apparrell,
places of aſſembling, ſeats in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the like, which therefore come
within the termes of indifferency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:24639:20"/>
but to ſay and defend that any
one thing of ſignificant uſe in the divine
ſervice of God is either not of the eſſenc
of his outward worſhip, or is indifferent
and variable, is I dare ſay, a fault more
then remarkeable: yet true it is, that he
who makes ſuch a part of Gods worſhip
of this or that ſpirituall uſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may verily vary and alter it. But as
no mortall or created power can giue the
ſpirituall gift or grace ſignified, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not deviſe the thing ſignifying:
ſo if God haue approved and ſanctified
any action, geſture or ceremony of ſuch
holy ſignificancie, none but he can alter
the ſame, and therefore to hold that ſuch
a thing is or can poſsibly bee indifferent,
or may in any caſe be conformed unto, is
ſin. But the Table geſture in the act of
receiving the ſacrament of the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and bloud, is of divine ſignification,
aſſuring us that as verily as we take and
partake of thoſe viſible ſignes, ſo verily in
that very action we by faith take and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the very body and bloud of
Chriſt ſignified and repreſented, yea true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exhibited in and by them. And this
geſture onely was hallowed by the Lord
in the inſtitution of the Supper, in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all his Apoſtles, who were the types
of all communicants to the end of the
world, to that very end and purpoſe:
therefore none but Chriſt may alter it,
who was authour of it, and to hold that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:24639:20"/>
it is variable (whatſoever ſence and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
babble for it) is a fearefull ſin.</p>
            <p>As the inward ſubſtance of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the outward ſignes elementall
or ceremoniall, having relation thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
even the whole ſacramentall action is
holy and heavenly (which nothing can
poſsibly be, but that which is of divine
inſtitution) ſo let thy care in partaking
thereof bee faithfull and zealous accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to knowledge and godlineſſe.
Look not ſo to the inward ſubſtance as
thou neglecteſt the outward ſignes and
ceremonies, as if divine reverence belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not to them, being Gods divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
or holy myſteries, and ſo might
be varied according to the will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
or determination of man. Neither
yet let it ſuffice, that thou commeſt with a
right geſture, unleſſe thou come with a
right heart alſo, leſt in ſtead of receiving a
bleſsing, thy heart be hardned, and thou
goe away with a curſe: for even as not to
uſe Gods ordinances with divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
is the mother of Apoſtaſie and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme,
ſo to uſe mans ordinances with
divine or holy reverence in Gods divine
ſervice (as every thing of divine ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ought) is the father of ſuperſtition
and hereſie: to conforme therfore to a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of divine ſignification, not being
eſtabliſhed by God, muſt needs be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and ſinfull.</p>
            <p>As no perſon may meddle with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:24639:21"/>
of a ſacrament, but ſuch as
are called by God in the word thereunto;
ſo may not they who are truely called of
God, preſſe to any thing therein, but what
the Lord hath in his word required or
commanded. For howſoever it is God
onely that giues the ſpirituall grace, or
heavenly things ſignified, ſo yet he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to uſe the miniſtery of man in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
thereof by thoſe meanes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
which himſelfe hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and as wee cannot haue the bleſſing
but from him, nor from him by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes then thoſe which himſelfe
hath appoynted: ſo to receiue the ſignes
at the hands of ſuch as he hath not ſent
or called, or to conforme to, or approue
of any ceremonies of ſignificancie in the
worſhip of God (though it bee at the
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds or by the adviſe of ſuch as are truly
called of God) which himſelfe hath not
ordained, is to be convocated or gathered
together againſt the Lord, as <hi>Corah,</hi>
(though not every one in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
for as the beſt miniſters in the
world can exhibite and giue no more but
the outward and viſible ſignes (and yet
even in ſuch their exhibition the inward
and inviſible thing and grace ſignified is
given by God through Chriſt by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
working of the holy Ghoſt) ſo to
profeſſe that either they haue power to
giue more then the ſigne, or haue warrant
to deviſe any ſigne to repreſent or exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:24639:21"/>
or to receiue grace by, is meere and
high preſumption againſt the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
therefore for the approbation
thereof, muſt needs be abhominable, upon
what tearmes, or in what caſe ſoever
it bee.</p>
            <p>Let vs content our ſelues with the
holy Counſel and determination of God
concerning the right adminiſtration of
this ſacrament, euen whatſoeuer is of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall
elementall or ceremoniall vſe

is without all exception, and ſeing it
was to be the verie patterne and preſident
to all Churches for euer (as Chriſt his

vs neuer conforme to any thing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of any of theſe therein, vnles wee haue

part of the word, Chriſts warrant ſo to
doe. And howſoeuer wee ſhall hereby
procure great dammage to our ſelues, yet
ſeing nothing that is in the fleſh (or is not
of Gods own ordaining and appointment
can poſſibly pleaſe God, let vs remember
it is farre leſſe danger to offend thoſe, that

conformity to kneeling intimate diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:24639:22"/>
in the inſtitutor, or inſufficiencie in
the inſtitution: for either is a blaſphemous
ſin.</p>
            <p>He that is ſole author of the ſacrament,
is ſole author of all the ceremonies and
ſignificant ſigns therein, either concerning
miniſter or people: for he that is the ſole
author of the bleſſing muſt needs be ſole
author of the means and inſtrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he wil giue it: therefor ſeing the Lord
onely giues the ſpiritual bleſſing ſignified,
repreſented, and verily exhibited by the
geſtures and ceremonies therein, and his
word neither by precept nor example
giues any warrant for any other geſture in
the act of receaving then that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
(which on all ſides is graunted
to be a table geſture) how dare wee by
conformitie varie from Chriſts owne prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
without Chriſts owne warrant.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid and that truly (but how fitly
and wiſely let others iudge) that God is
the author of kneeling euen in his divine
worſhip, therefore we ought to conform
vnto it in the act of receiving. I anſwere
that God is the author of images euen in
his diuine worſhip as the Arke and Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,
yea differing from the firſt inſtitution
as the braſen ſerpent, therefore wee may
conforme to the calues at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell</hi>
which are but images and conſecrated
onely to his worſhip and diuine ſervice,
but either let the Lord be God in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the outward ceremonies as well as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:24639:22"/>
in the inward ſubſtance of his worſhip, or
if you will conforme to <hi>Ball</hi> in the geſture
or in the order, follow him euen in all, for
God is the God of the order, as well as
the God of the ſubſtance of his worſhip
(Inward or outward) let him be therfore
either all in all, or els not God at all.</p>
            <p>By the word of God and by it onely
the miniſter knowes what to deliuer and
what not, how to deliuer and how not,
to whom to deliuer and to whom not;
the gueſts alſo or communicants doe
thereby vnderſtand, at whoſe hands to
receaue and at whoſe not, what to receue
and what not, and with what geſture to
receaue, and what geſture not to conforme
vnto in the act of receiving: for the word
of God is the life or ſoule (as I may ſay)
of the ſacrament, and that not onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
but even of euery particular, of
abſolute neceſſity required therein (as a
geſture is) ſo that whatſoeuer is ordained
to be of holy vſe therein (as the geſture
in the act of receauing is) if it receaue no
life or quickning warrant from the word
of God, it is abſolutely dead, or vncleane,
and defiles, and therfore may not vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

lawfull.</p>
            <p>The word of inſtitution ſets forth firſt
the precept of Chriſt, <hi>Doe this:</hi> ſecondly
the promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>This is my body:</hi>
Thirdly, the practiſe of the Apoſtles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

in their obedience, and in their faith
having reference to the word of promiſe,
now this being the type of all the true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
of this ſacrament to the end
of the world doth plainly and vndeniably
teach this truth that what ſoeuer is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity in the ſacrament (as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
in the act of receauing is) muſt, both
in miniſter and people haue relation to the
precept of Chriſt that ſo it may be donne
in obedience and alſo to the promiſe of
Chriſt, that ſo it may be donne in faith or
els it is abſolutely ſin? and then, though
kneeling which in that act &amp; manner as it
is vrged hath neither precept nor promiſe
of Chriſt would convert Turke and Pope
too, yet I hope you wil confeſſe we ought
not to conforme thereto;</p>
            <p>Is kneeling in the act of receaving the
ſacrament of the altar, the geſture of the
maſſe? let all that abhorre the groſſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of that, neuer conforme to the likenes
of this (vnleſſe they haue diſpenſation
from the ſcripture ſo to doe) becauſe in
ſimilitude though not in intention it holds
proportion with, and hath Relation to the
Coporall and Reall preſence locally. Yea
let all faithfull Chriſtians holde themſelues
onely to the name and geſture and to what

God is eſtabliſhed, and was therein by

The ſacraments (even whatſoever is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
were ordained of God, not to
giue any novelty or new thing by way of
tran- or con-ſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or like humane
deviſe, but having reſpect to our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to bee a helpe unto us in ſealing up
that righteouſneſſe which is by faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to increaſe that aſſurance of faith,
which we haue through the word in a
greater meaſure and degree then is had
by the miniſtery thereof (let every one
labour to haue the feeling of this uſe) if
then it be dangerous to add unto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the word, being the hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the King, even his moſt gracious
pardon for all our ſins and offences, and
his patent alſo for our liuelihood and

any reſpect be leſſe dangerous (ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the ſeale (I ſpeake herein after the manner

to the iudgement of the godly learned,
whether the wilfull perſiſting therein doe

time more and more the powerfull
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:24639:24"/>
effect, and comfortable benefit of this
bleſſed and moſt holy ſacrament. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the inſtitution this ceremoniall
ſigne hath relation to that ſpirituall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and moſt heavenly food, or divine
nouriſhment, it is moſt apparant to all
that will not winke leſt they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that in the very manner of a table
geſture, there is by intimation a grounded
expectancie and good aſſurance of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that holy and divine nouriſhment
viſibly repreſented unto us, a thing which
in the matter the Lord ſaw to be needful
for his bleſſed Apoſtles, and therefore
purpoſely cauſed them to uſe this very
manner to be a helpe herein unto them,
and ſo to every communicant though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo learned and well inſtructed.</p>
            <p>This ſacrament is called a communion,
ſealing up unto us our holy communion
with God in Chriſt, by the holy Ghoſt,
and our fellowſhip with all the Saints &amp;
faithfull children of God. Can there bee
(by any poſsible meanes) therefore any
good diſcretion or decencie, humilitie or
devotion, to leaue a Table geſture which
inferres thus much, and in this ſence is
ſo often mentioned in the ſcripture, and
conform to another, or the likeneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which inferres and intimates commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Antichriſt and his followers, or
well-willers, as kneeling doth? Whereof
therefore there is not onely no mention
in the holy Scriptures, but continuall inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24639:24"/>
both in this and in all things elſe
of religious uſe to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe it is very true, that neither
the viſible ſignes repreſenting, nor the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
ſignes or geſtures giving or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
haue any naturall or inherent
power, efficacie, or vertue to convey any
manner or meaſure of ſpirituall grace to
the receiver more then kneeling, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
geſture or ſignes whatſoever; but the
Lord was pleaſed to ſelect and make
choyce of theſe before all other, and
ſo it was his very will (which concludes
nothing without conſulting with his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and loue) to make theſe efficient (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally)
hereunto. As therefore our
Lords uſing the bread and wine in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and never approving of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made them the onely viſible ſignes,
and no other by any meanes may in the
act of giving or receiving, be conformed
unto, ſo his very uſing a table geſture in
the inſtitution, and never giving warrant
in the ſcripture for any other, is a direct
commandement to uſe this, and a plaine
prohibition to conforme to any other.</p>
            <p>If a table and viſible ſignes thereon, be
neceſſary in the adminiſtration of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
then the geſture of neceſſity both
in giving and receiving, muſt haue refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
thereunto: if there bee a feaſt for
the gueſts invited to that table to eate
and drinke that proviſion which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
&amp; ſet thereon, then a feſtivall geſture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:24639:25"/>
muſt needs be moſt ſeemly, as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to a feaſt (even as at weddings
wedding garments) yea if it had been left
to the wiſedome and diſcretion of the
Church, a table geſture by the naturall
Law of Correlatiues muſt needs of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be moſt fit and decent. Indeed ſeeing
the Papiſts haue altered the Table to an
Altar, and the feaſt of God unto man, to
a ſacrifice by men unto God, they haue
very wiſely enioyned ſuch a geſture, as
may hold correſpondency with, and hath
a moſt fit relation to an Altar, and to a
ſacrifice thereon. Of all the geſtures
therefore in the world, the likeneſſe of
theirs is moſt unlawfull for us to conform
unto.</p>
            <p>As the heavenly things ſignified, are
never received, if the earthly ſignes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall
meanes be neglected: ſo if the
ceremoniall ſigne or geſture, wherewith
the holy elements are received, bee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
innovated, and againſt our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
perverted from the order of the
inſtitution, ſuch conformity hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of a bleſsing from God; continuance
or cuſtome therein muſt needs therefore
harden the heart, which of all iudgements
and curſes in this world, is the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
            <p>

for conſidering the naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diuers education or cuſtomes of
thoſe ſeuerall nations with whom they
were mixed and deſirous to draw them
to the true religion and ſervice of God
and ſalvation of their ſoules they inclined
ſome thing to the ceremonies and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of theſe heathens in the actions and
geſtures of Gods outward worſhip, but
were moſt carefull to haue the doctrine
of the inward ſubſtance and ſpirituall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
concerning faith in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias
to come preſerued ſound, namely to
loue the Lord with all their heart and
with all their ſoule and to thinke no
thing too deare for him, whole Ryuers of
oyle, thowſands of Bullocks and Ramms,
yea the firſt borne of their children, and
there was neuer people killed no nor ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
or impriſoned for teaching this
inward ſubſtance, though hee were a ſon
of thunder, neuer ſo zealous and fervent
therein, but onely for refuſing conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to theire ſtate, ceremonies, wherein
yet many learned prophets, and reuerend
Leuits, and graue preiſts proteſted there
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24639:26"/>
was nothing intended, but the very ſame
decencie, humillitie, vnity, and ſtirring vp
of the heart to deuotion, which the Lord
aimed at &amp; required, and diuers of them
did vow vpon their ſaluation (I ſpeake
by way of ſuppoſition) that they having
had experience of both ceremonies or
formes of worſhip, haue found as much
inward comfort and heavenly conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and haue been rapt up with as divine
meditations in the ceremonies of <hi>Baal,</hi>
and of the Calues, as in thoſe at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
and they yeeld a ſufficient reaſon, which
will giue a ſatisfaction to any honeſt and
indifferent heart: for ſay they, it is true
that theſe ceremonies &amp; geſtures in their
originall among the heathens, were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,
damnable, and divelliſh, for they
uſed them to other gods, and not to the
true God. Now we haue put it into the
Magiſtrates head when he conſulted for
the ſetling of the ſtate in peace, that the
retaining of theſe being purged from
their Idolatrous abuſe, and the ſubſtance
of the worſhip of the true God, being
preſerved ſound, and ioyned with them,
and the myſticall ſignifications of Gods
ordinances being transferred unto theſe;
will be ſo farre off from confirming them
in their old ſuperſtitions, as it will proue
the onely meanes in all learned probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and wiſe experience to make them all
abſolute proſolites. But to this you ſay,
that notwithſtanding ſuch pretences, their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24639:26"/>
ſin is moſt fearfull and damnable, becauſe
they had the law of God as well direct
for every ceremony and geſture in the
outward ſervice of God, as either for the
intent of the outward, or for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the inward worſhip: and God
never left or referred any action, geſture,
or ceremony of religious uſe, eſpecially in
his divine ſervice to <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
but referred his Church ſtill to the
patterne which onely by the revealed
word was made known unto them, and
therefore though it be never ſo true that
they intended to ſerue God in theſe
things, and had very conſiderately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
painfully purged them (in a deviſed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory)
from their black-Mootes hue; yet
not being warranted by his word, they
offered their ſervice in them not unto
God, but unto Divels. For the Lord is
not therefore God unto men, becauſe they
ſuppoſe him ſo to be, or verily intend to
eſteeme of him thus or ſo, but becauſe by
his word, which is as true as his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty,
he hath manifeſted and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
known to be ſo; yea whatſoever do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning God in eſſence, nature,
perſon, property, or attribute, is other
then the word doth teach, is an Idoll of
their owne heart, a viſion of their owne
braine, an imagination of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing,
yea though all the learning and
wiſedom in the world do never ſo well
intend therby, or religiouſly eſteem therof.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:24639:27"/>
Even ſo this geſture, or that ceremony in
divine worſhip, is not therefore done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, becauſe in conformity thereto it
is ſimply and ſeriouſly intended to doe it
onely unto him; but if it be not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the word, it is wicked and Divel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
what good intent ſoever be in it.</p>
            <p>Hereto the better ſort of theſe graue and
reverend Rabbins reply and tell you, that
though it be true, that the law is as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
for the ceremonie as for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and that the Church is as ſtrictly
tied to the direction and warrant of the
word for every one of them as for the
moſt fundamentall poynt in the doctrine
of <hi>Iustification,</hi> or the ſubſtance or inward
worſhip, and may not vary one iot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
no not in any thing whatſoever,
without warrant thereof; yet ſeeing it is
not in their choyce to uſe or not to uſe
them, but a very great neceſſitie is layd
upon them by the Magiſtrate and the
Church, who for ſome ſecret cauſes, and
State conſiderations, haue in a moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne

by an vniverſall conſent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the lawfulneſſe and fitneſſe of the

therefore haue decreed, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will not conforme thereunto, ſhall
be (after Canonicall admonition) depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and no longer ſuffered to miniſter

Magiſtrate profeſſeth open deteſtation of
all manner of Idolatry in theſe things,
and the Church condemnes all Idolatrous
or ſuperſtitious uſe of them, and they
themſelues underſtand the uſe of them
in a ſincere ſence (which qualifies whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can be obiected againſt them.) Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather then they will be contentious
and breake (yea or diſturbe) the quiet
peace of the holy Church, and leaue their
flockes and charges ſo deere unto them,
unto woolviſh or ambitious or carnall
teachers, and ſo be deprived of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
as deere unto them as their liues,
they are perſwaded from theſe grounds,
that in this caſe they may very warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
undergoe conformity, doing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,
as the Lord in whoſe preſſence
they ſtand, beares them witneſſe, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it as a heavy burthen till it pleaſe
the Lord to viſit his Churches with his
ſalvation, and to take from the ſhoulders
thereof this heavy load, which even bends
the backe, and at length will breake the
necke thereof. For prevention whereof,
they will teach and maintaine, preſerue
and defend the ſubſtance and foundation
ſound and ſincere from error and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and therfore though the Magiſtrate
and Church do grivouſly ſin in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
yet they in conformity unto them,
are meere patients, and not agents, and
therefore in ſo doing incline rather to
martyrdome for God then rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:24639:28"/>
God. Hereunto you reioyne and
tell them in louing (yea in moſt wiſe and
learned termes, that if their caſe had been
indeed as yours is, they had well ſayd,
and moſt ſufficiently anſwered, and all the
Vniverſities in the whole world could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
haue confuted them, but they having
ſo direct lawes for all manner of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of religious uſe, and direct prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt any other, though an Angel
from heaven ſhould ioyne with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
they ought rather to haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
that holy, remarkeable, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
preſident of their zealous fellow-Prieſts,
and learned Levies, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout

very hearts to ſeeke the Lord, and with
them to haue left their ſuburbs and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
their livings and free-holds, and
ſo to haue gone to <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to
haue offered to the Lord God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
according to the warrant of the
word, and ſo to haue ſtrengthened the
kingdom both with peace and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
whereas the varying from the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the word in the doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of theſe ceremonies of religious uſe
in the worſhip of God, hath the cleane
contrary effect, and ſtrongly, yea ſtrangely
weakens the kingdom, and Church by
breeding diverſity of opinions, ſchiſmes,
diviſions, oppoſitions, heart-burnings and
grudges, with infinite other muddy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
according to the variety of

humor (which men experienced in fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can tell how to make uſe of, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

therefore conformity in ſuch a caſe,
though never ſo unwillingly undergone,
yea though with all reaſonable and wiſe
conſiderations tempered, and iudicious
expoſitions, and honeſt intentioms quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is ſo farre off from looking after, or
inclining unto martyrdom, as it opens the
very wideſt gate to mutinie and rebellion
both againſt God and man. If then wee
haue as direct warrant for the lawfulneſſe
of a table geſture, as ever the Iewes had
for their worſhip at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that
the word of the Goſpell bee as ſure and
certaine being ſpoken by Chriſt and his

under the Goſpell, as that by

without a direct precept or warrant
from the ſure word of God, though you
haue the ſame holy intent in ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
and the like reverend reſpect to
ſuch ceremonies as you haue to Gods

but in thoſe that doe it wilfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:24639:29"/>
their knowledge, it is dangerous to

worldly, yea divelliſh diſpoſitions and

opportunity ſhall call for the effectes
thereof.</p>
            <p>Will any man be content that his liuely
Image ſhall in any part thereof bee defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?
The whole action of this ſacrament
both in ſignes and ceremonies, and not
ſome parcels thereof without the reſt, is
the moſt liuely Image and repreſentation
of the moſt precious body and bloud of
our Lord Ieſus, as God the Father hath
ordained and appoynted to exhibit and
giue it to be the ſpirituall nouriſhment
of our ſoules (even meat and drinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed)
unto eternall life. Suppoſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
be but the meaneſt part of this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Chriſt, yet if without his warrant
it be altered from the firſt inſtitution (the
very patterne for the pourtraying of all
others afterwards) is there not iuſt cauſe
of offence? And dare any, by conformity
to any alteration therein, profeſſe &amp; vow
that though it doe directly differ in this
and that, yet if we thinke ſo, then it is his
very true Image, though ſomething bee
ſuperfluous, or out of the firſt order? Is
not every errour (though not in the ſame
degree) oppoſite to truth, and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
contrary to perfection?</p>
            <p>As there is difference betwixt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the ſacrament (Chriſt Ieſus our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:24639:29"/>
Lord) and the fruits and benefits of the
ſacrament (our holineſſe, ſanctification,
and redemption) ſo I confeſſe there is
difference betwixt the elementall ſignes
(bread and wine) and the ceremoniall
ſignes (the actions and geſtures) but as
the ſubſtance, and the benefits or vertues
are inſeparable (for where the one is in
truth, the other is alſo in power, and that
not in hypocriſie, though perhaps in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
great weakneſſe) ſo the ſignes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
or giving the ſubſtance, or in
which the ſubſtance is given or exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the ſigne in the act of receiving
or partaking the ſubſtance, or by and with
which the ſubſtance is taken and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
may not be parted, changed, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed,
leaſt by degrees the ſacrament it
ſelfe be perverted: for he that inſtituted
one, inſtituted all, even whatſoever is
ſacramentall: and a geſture in the act of
receiving is as eſſentially neceſſary, as the
viſible ſignes in giving or delivering, I
meane, there is as abſolute neceſsity of
that as of theſe. Now therefore, if you
can ſhew vs the like divine warrant for
kneeling, or any other geſture in the act
of receiving, as all the Chriſtian world
ſees there is for a table geſture, even by
our Saviours owne practiſe, and moſt
holy and matchleſſe example in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of all his Apoſtles, we will moſt
willingly and readily conforme unto you
therein: but if heaven and earth (true
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:24639:30"/>
Churches, nor falſe or counterfet Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
cannot poſsibly produce ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
conformity thereunto is not onely a
moſt heynous ſin in all that command it,
but a fearefull tranſgreſsion in all that
wittingly, though unwillingly yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>The geſture (as it is commanded and
uſed in Gods ſervice) in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
is either holy or unholy (though in
civill actions it may be indifferent) and
all holineſſe comes from the Lord (for
the Lords uſing or commanding any
thing, though it were never ſo vile and
uncleane before, makes it holy, and his
not uſing or commanding any thing,
makes it in his worſhip and ſervice ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
and unholy, what reverend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
ſoever men, yea good men, haue
thereof.) Either then you muſt proue
that kneeling as it is urged in this act of
receiving, comes from God, and was uſed
or commanded by him, or elſe it is unholy
(though all the holy men in the world
ſay to the contrary) and then conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereto is unholy and ſinfull.</p>
            <p>Not onely the outward ſignes and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſubſtance or elements, but the very
outward forme, and viſible order alſo of
the ſacrament, even a table geſture, was
ſanctified by Chriſt, and being never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
nor any other by divine warrant
eſtabliſhed (the ſacrament being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and a geſture in the act of receiving
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:24639:30"/>
therein eſſentially neceſſary) muſt needs
be of divine inſtitution (for it was once
divine, a face of braſſe cannot deny it) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
therefore you can proue it by divine
warrant repealed, or ſome other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
it is perpetually to be obſerved,
yea no other in any caſe, or upon any
condition to be conformed unto.</p>
            <p>The Church may not (though civill
authority for ſome urgent or weightie
occaſions neerely and deeply concerning
the welfare of the whole State, do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
thereof) appoynt Beefe or Lambe,
Bacon or Veale to be uſed in ſtead of
bread in the act of receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor Beare, Ale, Milke, or Water in
ſtead of Wine (the fruit of the vine) no
though wee hold and teach the doctrine
of the inviſible things ſignified never ſo
ſoundly and zealouſly, and free all the
poynts thereof from Popiſh Apoſtaſie, or
other humane abſurdity. And may any
pervert the order of delivering or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
theſe unchangeable ſignes without a
command from God, as to deliver firſt
the wine and then the bread (may Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in caſes of extremity conforme to
ſuch a Canon?) or to vary fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the geſture
of the inſtitution either in forme or in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
without a divine warrant? hath not
the Lord alwayes reſerved this honour of
deviſing all the parts, whether actions, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
or ceremonies of his outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to himſelfe? And though hee haue
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:24639:31"/>
given many high prerogatiues and very
great preferments unto his deputies and
vice gerents, yet hee never imparted this
to any creature, but was alwayes very iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of it, as the very top of his ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
yea doe they not by a direct conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
deſtroy or deny this eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
or attribute of God, who hold and
teach that the Magiſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate and Church
may deviſe the viſible parts, or actions
and geſtures of Gods outward worſhip,
even thoſe that are of abſolute neceſsity
therein (as a geſture in the act of receiving
is?) is not this the very proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
obiect of his burning and conſuming
iealouſie? Let them be conſumed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
then that herein riſe up againſt
him. Conformity therefore in this caſe is
the ready way to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is obiected, that the whole action of
the Sacrament is a th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nkſgiving and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(being the fitteſt geſture for thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving)
doth beſt beſeeme the whole
action, and therefore alſo this particular
act of receiving. The whole action can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid properly to be a thankſgiving
though it may be ſafely acknowledged,
that in the whole action, and every part
thereof there is thankeſgiving; but the
ſpeciall end of this Sacrament is to work
in us a more liuely feeling of our union
with God, the increaſe whereof he con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferres
in this Sacrament, and onely for
the effecting thereof did ordaine it: and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:24639:31"/>
howſoever he would not haue his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
unthankfull in the very act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo ineſtimable a bleſsing, yet in his
wiſedom (which is ſufficient for our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and a plaine proofe that this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is but a drugg of human wiſedom) he
conſecrated a table geſture for them in
the act of receiving, and not kneeling or
any other geſture proper to thankſgiving.
I confeſſe, to be unthankfull is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull:
but as the proper time for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
goes before, and according to
the truth and meaſure thereof, ſo is the
bleſsing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the fitteſt time for thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
comes after the act of receiving the
benefit and bleſsing: and according to the
truth and meaſure thereof, ſo is the true
comfort and ſpirituall conſolation. Let
the practiſe of Chriſt ſtop the mouth of
babbling <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence and iangling reaſon: and
howſoever in reſpect of the ſoule theſe
duties are ſo mixed, as they cannot be one
without another, but are inſeparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet there is a diſtinct propriety of
time peculiar to every one of them: the
ſenſible manifeſtation whereof giues true
denomination to the proper manner of
their ſeaſonable exiſtence and viſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.
Howſoever therefore the ſoule in
one and the ſame act and inſtant, can
heare, ſee, receiue, taſte, and be thankfull,
yet cannot the body poſsibly in one and
the ſame act and inſtant, performe and uſe
proper and fit geſtures to manifeſt and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:24639:32"/>
expreſſe the ſame: and if it could, yet the
patterne of the inſtitution proclaimes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to all the wit and learning in the
world, and therefore kneeling cannot bee
the fitteſt geſture in the act of receiving,
no though it ſhould be granted that the
whole action were a thankeſgiving.</p>
            <p>Nothing can poſſibly be conioyned or
united further, or in any other manner or
meaſure then the nature thereof will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
As therefore you moſt iuſtly and
religiouſly refuſe conformity to the reall
preſence either by tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
becauſe the nature of the
ſignes cannot poſſibly admit it, and there
is nothing but the bare opinions, and
Canons or precepts of men to warrant it?
euen ſo in the act of receaving no geſture
in the world can poſſibly in the nature
thereof hold proportion with, or haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
vnto our ſpirituall coniunction with
Chriſt and Communion and fellowſhip
with the Saints, in the pertaking of this
ſpirituall meat and drinke prepared and
ſet on the holy table in this divine action,
but onely a table geſture, and therfore
wee alſo, (according to your example in
the outward ſubſtance) do iuſtly refuſe
to conforme to any other geſture in the
outward Ceremonie.</p>
            <p>Reaſon muſt not be our guide in matters
of Religion, or in ceremonies of Religious
vſe in the publicke worſhip of God, for
take it at the verie beſt, without paſſion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:24639:32"/>
partialitie or preiudice, yea excellently
quallified with learning, wiſedom and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
yet is it ſtarke blinde in theſe
things and will verily miſleade vs. In
theſe controverſies therefore concerning
conformitie wee muſt to the law and the
Teſtimonie, and whatſoeuer hath not
warrant there from, by Gods owne doom
hath no true light in it, or divine warrant
for it, but black darknes abydes vpon it
for euer. What Angellical transformation
ſoeuer therefore you provide for your
ſignificant kneeling, you ſee from whence
ir comes and whither it goes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that manner as it is vrged, we dare
not vpon any terms or with any limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conforme vnto it.</p>
            <p>The coniunction in the ſacrament is
not ſencible, but meerly miſticall, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
&amp; inviſible: yet as the ſignes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the ceremonies therein (not by nature
or the ordinance and wiſe diſcretion or
learned pollicie of man but by the ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and will of Ieſus Chriſt) haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the things ſignified which are
heavenly and ſpirituall, and not to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
vnity, pretended humility, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of our corporall ſubiection to
the civil magiſtracie, (yea to brand them
with ſuch carnal relations or worldly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
is the verie high way to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie)
euen ſo theſe heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things by the ſame law of inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
haue Relation to thoſe ſigns onely which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:24639:33"/>
are ſet apart by Chriſt, and not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yea to holde that they either haue,
or poſſibly can haue relation to any other
ſignes either deuiſed by man; or not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by God for this verie end, is the
next way to hereſie and Atheiſme. For the
things ſignified and the things ſignifiyng
(either in the act of geving or in the act
of receaving) are verely vnited by this
mutuall relation or relatiue coniunction,
which no mortall power can ordeine or
alter, he that hath power to ordeine the
relatiue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely hath power to ordeine the
correlatiue, I meane he that hath power
to giue the ſpirituall things ſignified, onely
hath power to ordein ſings or ceremonies
ſignifying or having relation therevnto,
either in the act of giuing or receving. For
mortall power therfore to ordaine any
action or geſture of ſpiritual ſignification,
is ſpirituall adultery, and moſt groſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination.
Either proue then that the
ſign or Ceremonie you ſo eagerly preſſe vs
vnto, is in this verie action ordained of
God, and ſo hath a promiſe of a bleſſing
from him, or els wee dare not conforme
vnto it though for ſuch <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
nothing but Curſes from you.</p>
            <p>As the elementall ſigns (bread and
wine) receiue their heauenly vertue and
ſpirituall power onely from Chriſt, and
now differ from all other of the ſame kind
being truly and verely changed into holy
and diuine foode, not in their nature and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:24639:33"/>
ſubſtance (for then they could not be
ſigns if they were changed into that which
they ſignified) but in their vſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which is ſpirituall (and ſuch a change
no other creature but by Chriſts own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
can poſſibly admit or bee capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of) euen ſo the ceremoniall ſigns or
geſtures in the act of giving or receiving
theſe element<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll ſigns thus ſpiritually
changed, do differ from all other ſignes or
geſtures whatſoeuer, &amp; haue from Chriſts
inſtitution a heavenly or ſpirituall power
conferd vpon them, which no other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
can poſſibly be capable of though all
the humane power in the world beſtow
all their craft and cunning vpon it. For
this power is proper onely vnto Chriſt
and not communicable to a creature, yea
to intimate ſuch a power (without direct
warrant from the worde of God) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to band themſelues and to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
together againſt the Lord and againſt
his Chriſt. Either prooue then your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
to be warranted by Chriſt, or els
this banding diſpoſition aff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ights vs
from giving the leaſt approbation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>
            <p>They that admit or would countenance
any other coniunction, in, by, with, or
vnder the elementall ſigns then a ſpirituall,
muſt of neceſsity co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend for ſuch innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ceremoniall ſigne in the act of
receiuing, as may hold due proportion
with that conceited coniunction of their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:24639:34"/>
owne Imagination. And hence it comes
to paſſe that this carnall deuice in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie
is ſo eagerly preſſed and readily
conformed vnto, becauſe not onely the
ignorant, and the learned who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
and wicked, but euen the godly and
the learned that are holy, iudge of the
lawfullnes thereof by carnall ſence and
reaſon, and not by the rule of the word,
yea I would be hartily glad to meet with
one good and ſincere argument which is
not of this diſſpoſition, yet I doe confeſſe
I haue heard of many burniſhed with
the gloſſe of humane wiſdome and acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall
learning, which makes indeed
the verie droſſe of nature to ſtroute it ſelfe
out becauſe it gliſters, and ſo looking bigg
upon the matter ſeems to very many like
the verie golden truth. But can the beſt
quallified wiſedom of the world ſavor the
things that are of God? yea are not the
things which him ſelf taught and vſed or
ordained for the ſpirituall vſes of his
Church (&amp; therefore onely ſpiritually to
be diſcerned) meere foliſhnes, yea verie
enmitie vnto nature? and therefore if this
ceremonie haue not a diuine warrant how
dare wee conforme unto it;</p>
            <p>So much in the ſacrament of the Lords
ſupper as euery one ſees, ſo much he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues,
and no more, they that ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but with bodily eies, or perceiue
no further then naturall ſence and wiſe
or learned Iudgment giues vnderſtanding.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:24639:34"/>
Receaue no more but earthly things, euen
the elementall ſigne, &amp; not any thing that
is heauenly or ſpirituall, to make them the
more holy and vertuous, and any geſture
or ceremonie whatſoeuer, and whence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it comes, is comely and decent or
good enough for ſuch a peece of ſervice,
but all thoſe that ſee with ſpirituall eies,
yea they onely receaue ſpirituall things,
and they dare not conforme to any geſture
or ceremonie, but that which is of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
or holy uſe, and ſuch none can be,
but thoſe geſtures and ceremonies onely,
which are ordained by our holy God. In
all and euery one of which (being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vſed) as there is certeinly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
a bleſsing to be obtaind, ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
of religious vſe is known not to be
ordained by God, but onely by man, it
is at leaſt vtterly voide of all ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
if not filled with contrary effects, and
therefore not in any reſpect to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
vnto. But ſuch is this ceremony
and therefore vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>They that conforme to a right geſture
or ceremonie in the ſacrament, and want
the inward eye, mouth, and hand of the
ſoule, receiue onely the elements with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
&amp; not the ſpirituall things ſignified by
which vnworthines, they eate and drinke
their owne damnation, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
not the Lords body though they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcerne &amp; vſe the Lords geſture, &amp; wil
not by any means conforme to any other
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:24639:35"/>
for they trample vnder foote the blood of
Chriſt, as an unholy thing, not that they
eſteem it ſo in their minde (for this tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
is inward or ſpirituall) but where
faith is wanting there is unworthy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and faith is as neceſſary in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or geſture of taking, as in the act it
ſelfe: for this whole action of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(and not ſome ſpeciall or principall
parts therin) is the evidence or ſeal of our
aſſurance of partaking the divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or holy things ſignified; even of our
true and ſpirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Chriſt.
To conforme then to a wrong geſture ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no promiſe of any bleſsing, cannot
be an action of faith, aud therefore ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> are ſacramentall
phraſes, applying that to the ſoule which
is proper to the body, but doe neceſſarily
imply, that there muſt of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
be a ſpirituall eating and drinking in
the very act of the corporall eating, or els
no benefit or ſpirituall bleſsing can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be ſealed up by that action, which
neceſſarily inferres that ſuch a geſture is
onely lawfull in this action, as in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thereof holds proportion with ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking, and hath relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
which onely a table geſture doth,
and therefore was ſelected and choſen by
Chriſt the Lord of the ſacrament, and
ſanctified in the inſtitution, and ſo not
onely by his uſing preferred before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but no other being commanded in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:24639:35"/>
the word, it is thereby made onely uſefull
in the act of receiving, and no other to be
conformed unto.</p>
            <p>If a corporall or viſible and locall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
(which yet cannot profit the
ſoule) or any other learned device of the
ſpiritualtie were ſufficient to bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or with ſtrong imagination to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
then indeed any geſture or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of carnall deviſing were indifferent
or good enough, and might ſafely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto, but faith being inviſible,
lookes (according to the nature thereof)
not to reaſon and ſence, wiſedom and
diſcretion, or other like humane conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
but to the things that are inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and therefore in all the actions and
ceremonies of Gods worſhip, dare onely
conforme to ſuch as by his appointment
who is inviſible, haue an inſeparable rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(by his divine inſtitution) to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
things ſignified or repreſented, yea
and verily exhibited in them, and dare
not conform to any other, though by the

thereunto.</p>
            <p>Reaſon and Sence even in <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
cry mainly out, <hi>How can this be?</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible.
And in others, <hi>Can this man
giue us his fleſh?</hi> This is a hard ſaying, who
can chooſe but be offended at it? So alſo
in <hi>Naaman,</hi> Why ſhould not the rivers of
<hi>Damaſcus,</hi> being uſed with the like good
intention and purpoſe, be as full of vertue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:24639:36"/>
to waſh away ſin or leproſie, as that of
<hi>Iorden,</hi> it is but an idle conceit of guiddy
heads that makes this difference, yea what
good argument can any ſuch finde out,
that is able to aſſure their conſciences,
they do well in ſuffering for refuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
herein? Even ſo concerning this
bleſſed ſacrament, ſome cry out, How can
a peece of bread, or a ſuppe of wine nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
my ſoule, or increaſe my faith, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
humility and contentment. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(which is a branch ſpringing from
the ſame root) with open mouth exclaim,
Why ſhould not all geſtures in the act of
receiving be alike, or any geſture in the
worſhip of God, (though deuiſed by
man) be indifferent? What reaſon can bee
given that one ſhould be better then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?
and therefore why ſhould not
kneeling be as good as the table-geſture?
Here wiſedom, learning, diſcretion, reaſon,
and experience, in a temperate and graue
modeſty, lay hand upon their mouthes,
and for peace ſake, in this caſe of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
by ſilence doe ſubſcribe; but faith
knowes full well (as a thing never deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unleſſe by carnall and worldly minded
perſons) that every thing is therefore
onely good, and better then all other,
becauſe God hath commanded it, and that
nothing can poſsibly be of good or holy
uſe in the holy worſhip of our moſt holy
God, but that onely which himſelfe hath
commanded, inſtituted or ordained, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:24639:36"/>
therefore that whatſoever (of religious
uſe in his ſervice) is not in the word di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
commanded, is by direct conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
by the ſame word forbidden: my
reaſon is, becauſe every action of Gods
worſhip is either performed in obedience
or diſobedience: if it be in diſobedience,
though in a caſe of extremity and danger,
or in caſe of commodity and advantage,
is it not (if performed againſt our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
direct rebellion, as in <hi>Saul?</hi> And
you cannot for ſhame ſay, that your
conformity is obedience, unleſſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
from God go before. For if
our holy intentions and good conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and purpoſes, or zealous devotions,
could make our deviſed geſtures and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Gods ſervice, works of obedience;
which of all the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> had not
iuſt cauſe to puniſh and kill the Prophets
for reproving them for their inventions,
which had as many good intentions as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in theſe dayes can haue? But the old
rule holds, <hi>Whatſoever is not done in faith</hi>
(eſpecially in actions, geſtures, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of religious uſe) <hi>is ſinne.</hi> If then
you bring faith to make triall of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of theſe things in queſtion, it will
not hearken what Canons this Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made, nor regard what that Councell
decreed, or what ſuch a State comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or ſuch reformed Churches practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or thoſe reverent preachers &amp; godly
people conforme unto: but what God
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:24639:37"/>
commands, or what ſaith the Lord in his
word, and in this particular controverſie,
faith retires to the inſtitution, wherein is
ſet downe upon divine record what the
Apoſtles received of the Lord concerning
the geſture for their direction in laying
the foundation for the ceremony in the
act of receiving the Sacrament in any
Church whatſoever: yea faith dare not
conforme to any thing of divine uſe
in Gods publicke worſhippe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Gods direct warrant in the word,
though all the wiſe and learned men in
the world do never ſo highly commend
and extoll it. So that if it be not done in
obedience, it is not done in faith: and
then you will confeſſe it is ſinne, and then
you know we may not conforme unto it,
though we might prevent thereby never
ſo great and fearefull miſchiefes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
never ſo many benefits &amp; bleſsings:
&amp; it cannot be done in obedience of faith
unleſſe a commandement goe before (for
looke whom you obey, his ſervants you
are:) that therefore cannot be Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ſervice, which God doth not by his
divine word command: or that cannot
be an action of faith which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the word? and every action
of religious uſe, which is not of faith
is expreſſely forbidden. Try your ſelues
therfore whether in conforming to knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the act of receiving the Lords
holy Supper, you ſtand in the faith or no:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:24639:37"/>
if you ſay you looke to God, and haue
powred out your ſoules before him, as
your conſciences, and many other can
beare you witneſſe, and you dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to him how deere your miniſtery
is unto you, and how loath you are to
leaue your flockes to a company of roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
boyes, or raging beaſts, &amp;c. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
if you looke to God, then you muſt
look to him in his word: (for elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
you intend, he doth not intend to
be God unto you) if you haue not his
warrant therein, you do not looke to the
true God (no more then the Barbarian or
Turke doth) but do make a very Idoll of
him; I meane, our God doth not bleſſe or
approue of any thing of religious uſe in
his worſhip, as good and lawfull to bee
conformed unto, but onely thoſe things
which himſelfe requires in his word, and
he that will accept of any thing which is
not commanded in the word, is an Idoll,
and not the true God: for all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him or his worſhip, are onely
made known to his Church by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Churches never erre in
theſe things, but when they want the
commandement or warrant of the word,
the defect whereof all the learning, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wiſedom, authority, and zeale of the
whole world cannot ſupply. I confeſſe
you make goodly ſhewes for excuſing
your conformity, but what haue you
ſayd, or what can you prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:24639:38"/>
would not haue accepted at the
hands of thoſe Prieſts who left their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and charges, becauſe they would not
conform to the ceremonies of the calues?
And if it be lawfull in you, why not in
them? I confeſſe that which you obiect,
that their conformity overthrew the
very ſubſtance of Gods worſhip, but not
that (you will not ſay) which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but that only which was outward,
and which is required in the ſecond
commandement: for the doctrine of the
inward ſubſtance was (in the intention of
that proviſion) preſerued ſound, but the
forme of Gods outward worſhip was
mainly and diverſly I confeſſe perverted;
and I alſo acknowledge, that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is nothing ſo groſſe and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
as theirs, yet this I dare ſay and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
that it is of the ſame nature, and
that it corrupts and perverts this part of
Gods worſhip in the act of receiving the
body and bloud of Chriſt: ſo that though
they differ, and differ very greatly, yet it
is onely in the <hi>Species,</hi> and not in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
Without further contention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us bring it to the true rule.
Whence doth your conformitie come? It
is a matter concerning Gods outward
worſhip and divine ſervice, and ſo apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the ſecond commandement.
What muſt bee the cauſe of this: for if
the cauſe be good, the effect is good: faith
is the cauſe of all true obedience, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:24639:38"/>
that obedience or conformity which is
not an effect of faith, cannot by all the
trickes and deviſes in the world, ever be
made good (for where the cauſe is, there
is the effect, and where the effect is, there
is the cauſe, the effect can never bee in
truth, whatſoever is conceited or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
where the cauſe is not.) If therefore
kneeling as it is urged, bee an effect of
faith, then haue you a precept &amp; a promiſe
for it is in the word, upon which your
faith is grounded, and ſo your obedience
and conformity is holy: but if it bee not
in this very kinde required therein, it
cannot poſsibly be an effect of faith: and
therefore ſet the beſt face you can upon
it, it is but an Idoll of mans invention, and
therefore conformitie thereto upon what
pretence, or in what caſe of extremity ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is unlawfull and wicked.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed and profeſſed publikly
by ſome of you that the magiſtrate ſins
greevouſly in requiring this conformity.
but yet you do well in yeelding thervnto
rather then to ſuffer ſuch a world of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniences,
which you wiſely &amp; carfully
foreſee wil otherwiſe fall vpon Church &amp;
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare your caſe with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, <hi>Dauid</hi> ſinned grevouſly, though
not preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuouſly, as I think ſome of you
do not, in bringing the arke from Gibeah,
in a new Carte, this Arke or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worke (the glory of Iſraell) in
this iorney was ſo dangerouſly ſhaken by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:24639:39"/>
the oxen (at the threſhing floore of <hi>Ornan</hi>
as if <hi>Vzza</hi> had not put to his hand it was
like to haue bin broken all to peeces, did
not <hi>Vzza</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendably therfore in putting
forth his hand to preuent ſuch a miſcheif;
is not this your very argument? many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
euils cleaue to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence,
he was not ſtricken for touching the ark,
for that the Leuits might do, but onely
for the manner and order of touching it,
being in a cart which was not warranted
by God, and I tell you the beſt and moſt
learned men in the whole world are but
as oxen, and put the Arke of Gods word
into the moſt temperate Cart of their
neweſt and beſt reformed Invention, they
will grieuouuſly ſhake the verie ſubſtance
of it?</p>
            <p>Seing then the ſacraments and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is ſacramentall (as a geſture in the act
of receaving is) are ordeined not by man
but by God, not for any worldly, carnall
or civill reſpects as to teſtifie our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the magiſtrate which yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
muſt moſt cheerfully be manifeſted,
but meerly and properly for ſpirituall
vſes, euen to nouriſh our ſoules by ſealing
vp unto our hearts the aſſurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie
of the couenant of grace in the
free pardon of all our ſins through the
ſole merit of the moſt pretious blood
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, moſt liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
and truly or effectually exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to every faithfull beleeuer herein? let
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:24639:39"/>
vs hold faſt the right order and forme
of adminiſtration thereof in all the ſigns
elementall or ceremoniall, euen in all the
actions, geſtures, or ceremonies, which by
Chriſt himſelf in the firſt adminiſtration
being vſed, and neuer after repealed not
any other by his warrant eſtabliſhed come
within the compaſſe of diuine inſtitution?
Ieaſt wittingly, though wee pretend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
conforming to the alteration of
the ſigne (though but ceremoniall) wee
depriue our ſelues of that which ſtands in
relation therevnto (which is ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all).</p>
            <p>The ſacraments with all the eſſentiall
properties therein, together with the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the word truely adminiſtred, are
the vndoubted markes or proper Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances
of the Churches communion both
with Chriſt the head, &amp; with all the ſaints
making one entire miſticall body; and by
theſe they may be known? where theſe are,
is a true Church whoſoeuer ſay to the
contrary. Let vs therfore preſerue not
ſome fundamentall partes onely but all
things of eſſential vſe herein, uncorrupted
and vndefiled, euen pure and vnſpotted,
and therfore neuer conform to wordly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
carnall innovation, &amp; human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
in any part of Gods worſhip leſt
we decline from our firſt loue, wherein
we vowed and profeſſed to haue a ſincere
reſpect not to ſome principall, but to all
the parts of Gods worſhip, euen to all his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:24639:40"/>
commandements, and ſo ſhall wee rteaine
the infallible markes of the true Churches
of Chriſt vpon vs, but if wee forſake the
geſture or ceremonie of the pureſt Church
that euer was wherein the heavenlieſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp; diuineſt decency that euer was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth was by our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

ſanctified and propoſed for all
ſucceeding Churches to follow for euer
(as this neuer being repealed, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approued by the ſcriptures doth
plainly teſtifie) do we not beſpot and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
this marke of our viſibilitie, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by conforming to the ceremonie (or
the likenes thereof) of the falſeſt, moſt
perfidious, bloodieſt and moſt Apoſtate
Church that euer was, or can be? is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing which is of religious vſe in
Gods publicke worſhip being without
warant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word erronious? and doth
not error in any one part, though but in
the ceremonie, prooue a direct defect in
the whole ſacrament, being an entire and
an inſeperable action? if therefore we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
ſubſcribe to the lawfullnes of that
which we know wee are defectiue in,
we haue no promiſe of God for his bleſſing
vpon vs in our ſo doing, yea the very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of mercie in ſuch a caſe (I meane
where there is no ground for it in the
word but onely in our owne intentions)
is a main cauſe of Apoſtacie Atheiſme and
like abominable preſumptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:24639:40"/>
Rytes and ſignes of religious vſe in the
publike worſhip of God, which are not
ordained by him to be ſeales (for as all
the parts of the ſeale make but one ſeale,
ſo euery part not being deuided may
truly be faid to be the ſeale) of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and inſtruments of his grace, are not
the true marks of the true Church, though
the true Church vſe them to that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and indowe them with the verie
ſame properties and intentions: for none
can ordain a ſign in Gods worſhip, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
actions, geſtures, or any kinde of
ceremonie of holy or religious ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which indeed are peculiar marks of
Cogniſances) but he onely that is able
to giue that ſpirituall grace or heavenly &amp;
inviſible bleſſing which is repreſented
therein, or ſignified thereby. Seing then
the holy geſture in the act of receauing
the moſt pretious body and blood of our
Lord Ieſus ſacramentally, is on all ſides
confeſſed to be ſignificant (and a part of
the individuall ſeale, it cannot be denied,
that none (of what condition of quallitie
ſoeuer) may ordaine it, but hee onely
who is able to giue the thing ſignified or
receaved thereby. If then kneeling in this
very kinde, manner, &amp; order as it is vrged,
be not ordained by the Lord and yet haue
a ſpirituall ſignification (as all men agree)
though all the wiſdom of the world labor
to grace it with all the complements, than
art, wit and learning, or authority can
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:24639:41"/>
poſſibly conferre vpon it, wee may not
conforme vnto it, neither is it a marke or
ſeale of the true Church but a blot and
ſtaine thereof, for the precept and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Chriſt haue no relation therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but onely to thoſe geſtuers and other
ceremonies in his worſhip which himſelfe
hath ordained, and therefore no other
may be with ſafety of conſcience confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

            <p>Nothing, of religious vſe but what is of
divine inſtitution, can be holy, and all ſuch
are holy to the beleeuer though wicked
perſons adminiſter them, or be pertakers
of them, but if God haue not ordained it
to be of religious vſe, in that very manner
and order of his worſhip, it is profane to
the beleeuing receiuer, though the holieſt
men in the world adminiſter it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
thereof, for therefore onely is any
thing in divine ſervice Gods inſtrument,
becauſe he hath ordained it ſo to be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a ceremony of p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

of receiving a bleſſing or ſhewing thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
for the ſame, whether it be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
or of ioyfulnes, or whatſoeuer is
aimed at therein, there is no bleſſing to
be obtained where none is promiſed, for
if God had appointed the forme of the
altar of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> it had beene as good
and holy as that at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they were
both altars and the ſame ſacrifices to the
ſame God offered thereon, yet differing in
the very forme, made the whole worſhip
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:24639:41"/>
abominable: therefore thoſe who dare ſo
confidently affirm that God will bleſſe our
conformity to ceremoniall ſigns being
ſome in matter, ſome in manner of mans
meere deuiſing, is directly with the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
idolators to adiure the holy ghoſt to
ſanctify or make of holy vſe our, owne
carnall deuiſes, becauſe wee aime at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>The end of all Gods ordinances is to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
vs to himſelfe, not carnally, locally
ot naturally, but ſpiritually, myſtically, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
or holily, after the manner
of contracts or covenants. What beleeving
heart then dare conform to any eſſentiall
Ryte in this holy ſacrament (a moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
and effectuall inſtrument of increaſing
our aſſurance of this our ſpirituall vnion
with God through Chriſt) which is not
commanded or warranted by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
may mortall men, yea or Angels of

of Chriſt (and without a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
in the act of receiving, this whole
action of his remembrance vaniſheth) or to
put vs in mind of what he hath done for

and carnall abhominations, which our
forefathers and Churches, both Princes

workes of that infamous Beaſt? Is
conformity then to this humane devices
in the geſture, the very beſt way you can
deviſe to preſerue the Churches from ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine? Are carnall inventions, I ſay, in
this cleare light of the Goſpell, the very
beſt courſe to preſerue holy Aſſemblies
and Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery? will God
elſe quite forget to be gracious? Doth the
moiſture hereof onely preſerue his hand
(of helpe and power) from withring
and his arme of protection from being

to the liknes of Idolatrous &amp; vncleane ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies

(ſo long as we holde the doctrine of the

hauing no warrant from ſcripture but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>There haue been indeed ſignes or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and ceremonies of religious uſe
in the publicke worſhip of God, which
were variable and not perpetuall, but
differed from the firſt inſtitution, and
came in and went out as the times and
occaſions of the Church required, as the
rocke was called Chriſt, the ſea Baptiſme,
the brazen ſerpent was a figure alſo of
him, and divers other, as Manna and the
Rocke, but was it ever heard (unleſſe in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:24639:43"/>
the mouthes of falſe teachers) that the
Churches ought to conforme to any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
either ordinary or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or to any ſuch ſignificant Rite or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
as the queſtioned geſture is, which
are not expreſſely grounded on the word
of God? but as it ever was no great or
ſtrange thing that the Miniſters of the
Divell ſhould transforme themſelues, and
by their teaching many fundamentall
truthes, and by many pleaſing paſſages of
their life, deceiue the world; yea and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their abhominable workes,
and moſt damnable hypocriſie, yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
and taken for the Miniſters of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
(being growne ſo abſolute in
the trade of Deceitfulneſſe:) even ſo let
it not ſeem any wonder that men of your
parts and gifts having changed your
mindes, do labour to transform the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men, and ceremonies or rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the world into the very likeneſſe
of the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt: for
whoſoever liues ſhall ſee greater things
then theſe breake forth in you. But as
nothing in the worſhip of God can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
profit, unleſſe it be mixed with true
faith, ſo it is utterly impoſſible that iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith ſhould upon any tearmes, or
in any reſpect bee mixed with any thing
in the ſervice or worſhip of God, which
is not grounded on the word of God; if
then your contentious geſture be not in
that very manner and order as it is urged,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:24639:43"/>
warranted by the word of God, it is not,
neither poſſibly can bee of faith, and
therefore may not for prevention of the
greateſt miſchiefe in the world, bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto: for we may not do the leaſt
evill, though the greateſt good that could
be wiſhed, would come to the Church
thereby.</p>
            <p>Some pleaſe themſelues with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
evaſion from the phraſe of <hi>Supper,</hi>
earneſtly contending that we are no more
tied to Chriſts geſture, then to Chriſts
ſupper, which I willingly grant to be very
true, even that we are bound to both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like;
but yet let them alſo be pleaſed to
underſtand, that the purpoſe of the Holy
Ghoſt is not by this ſacramentall phraſe
to ſet forth the fitteſt time (in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition of the Church) for the
adminiſtration of this Sacrament, which
being to ſucceed and come in the roome
of the paſſover, was (as I may ſafely ſay)
by a caſuall neceſſity inforced to attend
the evening (or Supper) paſſover, but to
expreſſe for ever to all the Churches of
Chriſt, that this ſacrament is the ſolemne
&amp; great feaſt of the Lord IEHOVAH,
wherein he keepes open houſe, and ſets
forth his rich loue, exceeding bounty, and
admirable greatneſſe, yea immeaſurable
goodneſſe, by the ſurpaſſing excellency of
his all-ſufficient proviſion, and by the
hearty welcome, loving countenance,
kinde and familiar entertainment of his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:24639:44"/>
beloved gueſts, who are invited to his
owne table, not as ſtrangers, or by way of
curteſie, or to ſhew his magnificence and
bounty, but as his deereſt and moſt reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
friends, to whom onely he admits
this particular and ſpeciall familiarity;
muſt not therefore of neceſſity (I ſpeake
but by the way) their geſture in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hold correſpondencie with, and haue
relation unto a feaſt, and to a table, and
to beloved friends, of whoſe hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
this whole action (whereof the
geſture is a part) is a moſt certaine aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Yet the word <hi>Supper</hi> is not put in
at random, or accedentally, but purpoſely
and for ſpeciall inſtruction, to teach the
Church for ever, that as uſually their
greateſt and moſt ſolemne ſumptuous
feaſts, wherein they deſired to expreſſe
and manifeſt the ſuperabundance of their
loue, and entire good will, were not at
dinners but at ſuppers: ſo this great feaſt
or ſupper of the Lord doth affoord to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
worthy partaker a moſt plentifull
and abundant increaſe of all thoſe graces
and heavenly comforts, which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
or elſewhere obtained by any other
of Gods ordinances whatſoever: and that
there is no where the like proviſion to be
ſound againe (for even aske the father
what you can, here it is to be had) he that
neglects this, muſt never looke for the
like againe any where elſe. Now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you (I meane thoſe that ſtand ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:24639:44"/>
much upon ſence and reaſon) conſider
whether it be not very high, yea intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
preſumption for any invitant to
thinke any thing wanting in this princely
feaſt of this King of eternall glory, and ſo
to take upon him either to ad matter of
ſubſtance, or orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or order; &amp; having
ſeen the carriage and geſture of the kings
owne perſon, and of all his moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
gueſts, yet in a conceit of his owne
wiſedom, learning, and experience (having
perhaps been a farre traveller) undertakes
to ſet downe a more ſeemly and decent
ceremony for the geſture or behaviour of
the gueſts, then then the Lord himſelfe
by his owne preſence approved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
dare wee conforme to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of ſuch a device as lawful, &amp; good,
eſpecially being very like the behauiour
of the moſt mortall and deadly enemy
that the King hath? Your conformitie
therefore may bee farre fetcht and deere
bought, but yet not good for Lord nor
Lady, nor any Invitant, at this heavenly
banquet.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever of eſſenciall neceſſity was in
the firſt inſtitution, &amp; no alteration therof
is in the word of God recorded, nor any
varying therefrom warranted, or ſo much
as mentioned, muſt needs be for imitation:
yea the approbation therof by Chriſt our
Lord, is not onely a ſufficient warrant for
the lawfulnes, holines, or decencie and
goodneſſe thereof, but a direct binding
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:24639:45"/>
precept to uſe it, yea it onely, and a plaine
prohibition for ever, upon any occaſion
or condition whatſoever, to conforme to
any other. For as Chriſt his uſing it made
it holy and good, ſo none but hee onely
can either make it unſeemly, or any other
geſture lawfull or comely. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet not by reaſon and ſence (for they
though never ſo wiſe and learned, are but
blind Iudges in matters of Religion) but
by the unerring iudgement of true faith,
(which begins where theſe end) whether
any geſture can beſeeme a gueſt, a friend,
a familiar, yea a ſonne or daughter of
yeares and good underſtanding, at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and feaſt, yea at the great ſupper (of
the immortall King indeed, but yet) of
our deere, loving, and well pleaſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo well as a table geſture, being not
onely directly intimated in theſe myſticall
phraſes of ſignificant vſe, viz. <hi>Feast, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Table, Communion,</hi> and the like, but
purpoſely alſo recorded to be the practiſe
of Chriſt, and of all his Apoſtles in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and never altered or queſtioned,
till the manifeſt declaration of Antichriſt,
which was many hundred yeares after,
who indeed by ſolemne decree or canon,
did ordain that a table geſture ſhould be
left in the act of receiving, and having ſet
up another Chriſt in his breaden deviſe,
he appoints kneeling in the ſtead thereof
to bee onely conformed unto. Now as
Chriſt his uſing that geſture (the word no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:24639:45"/>
where commanding any other) is a divine
warrant for the goodnes thereof: ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts
ordaining this (and the word of
God not commanding it) is a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
never in the worſhip of God to
conforme unto it upon any tearmes, or in
any caſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Wee do not conforme to the bleſſed
Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or to our moſt
godly and learned paſtors, in vſing a table
geſture, but onely followe them becauſe
they follow Chriſt, whoſe moſt holy and
vnerring practiſe) not any where in all
the ſcripture altered) we hold to be his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
will, and directly contained in his
commandement, <hi>Doe this,</hi> wherein he left
it not to the diſcretion of the Apoſtles or
their ſucceſſors, to diſpoſe of the geſture,
as times or occaſions ſhould require, but
to prevent al colour of innouation (which
he ful well foreſaw matchleſſe Ambition
would audaciouſly preſume to bring in, &amp;
Machiuillian pollicie would arrogantly
contend to continue) he purpoſely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
this ſacrament firſt himſelf both in
the elements and geſture, that (as to the
verie beſt and moſte vnreproueable preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
in all controuerſies about this or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ceremonie herein) the Churches
might retire and haue recourſe, ſtill to his
owne practiſe for their ſafe direction and
full ſatiſfaction, for euer, ſo that as in
matter of doctrine you do moſt worthely
anſwer the papiſts, with <hi>Thus ſaith the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:24639:46"/>
Lord',</hi> or the Lord neuer required this, ſo
we ſay to you in the ceremonie, thus did
our Lord, he vſed a table geſture, &amp; there
is no mention in the ſcripture that euer
kneeling in the act of receiving was vſed,
therefore ſeeing, <hi>Non fuit ſic ab initio,</hi>
wee dare not with any limitation or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable
conſtruction conforme vnto it,</p>
            <p>It was not nowe a time in the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
to vſe geſtures at randome, or
ceremonies of indifferencie, but only that
which is primarily or principally, and
therfore (vnleſſe himſelf giue warrant to
the contrary) perpetually neceſſary, for
euen now was he to ſet vpon the greateſt
worke that euer he did. Hath he then at
this verie time, by his owne perſonall
practiſe, bequeathed to all his Churches
for ever (in this leagacie of his infinite,
eternall and incomprehenſible loue) the
ceremoniall ſigne of a table geſture?
where is then the faith and vnderſtanding
of theſe learned ſcribes, and the deepe
wiſdom of theſe great diſputers become,
who reuerently lapping vp the table ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
in a faire white Cloth, caſt it aſide
into a corner of their veſtrie (that if it
euer come in requeſt againe, they know
where to fetch it) and moſt eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for kneeling in the ſtead thereof,
which in the act of receaving this bleſſed
ſacrament was neuer approoued of in any
Catholike Church thorow the whole
world, till the darknes of the groſſeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:24639:46"/>
that euer was, or can be, had brought
confuſion into the whole publicke worſhip
and ſervice of God through the Ambitious
Tyranny, of that man of ſin, yet doe I not
by any means inferre, that thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of the abhomination that
lies lurking in this very geſture, and being
therefore perſwaded of the indifferency
or lawfulneſſe thereof, do conform there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
doe not alſo receiue comfortably and
effectually by the hands of faith, the very
things themſelues which are ſignified; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I hold it a ſin of their ignorance (which
God regardeth not) and therfore beſeech
them better to conſider of it hereafter,
ſeeing the table geſture had been indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
yea unſeemly, yet the practiſe of
Chriſt in the inſtitution, uſing onely it and
no other, makes it now moſt decent, and
without all exception, yea onely to be
conformed unto before all other, unleſſe
a divine warrant can bee brought to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe that all geſtures in the act of
receiving were indifferent, Chriſt he makes
choyce of a table geſture, and ſo by his
very uſing it, ſanctifies it, and makes it of
holy uſe: Antichriſt he miſlikes it, and
takes up in the ſtead thereof kneeling, and
by his very uſing of it profanes it, and
makes it uncleane; for he being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Idolater that ever was, appropriated
it ro the groſſeſt Idolatry that ever was.
Now I beſeech all you that are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:24639:47"/>
               <hi>utrum horum?</hi> Did CHRIST
our Lord bleſſe the whole action, or
ſome principall partes thereof onely?
Conſider therefore not by naturall reaſon,
but by the eye of ſupernaturall aith, how
far this precept, <hi>Do this,</hi> extends, whether
to the whole action of the ſacrament or
to the elemetall ſignes onely; or if ſo be,
to ſome of the ceremoniall ſigns, as ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aparte, breaking, powring out, and
giving, why not to the reſt alſo in taking
or receaving? or if to ſome of them as to
the conſiderate beholding or looking on,
reuerent taking, cheerful eating and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
drinking, why not to the very
geſture alſo; or if you cannot but grant,
that a geſture, or ſome geſture is included
within the compaſſe of this precept, why
then not that geſture which our Lord and
Sauiour vſed at the very time of geving
this precept, rather then that (or the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
thereof) which that man of ſin
the verie child of perdition invented and
ordeined, for this is a moſt undoubted
truth, looke how farre the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
extends, ſo farre doth the bleſſing of
the commander euen of Ieſus Chriſt our
Lord extend, and no further. Therefore
whatſoeuer in the ſame ſacrament you
haue not a commandement for (and is
of neceſſary vſe therein) you haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
from Chriſt for his bleſſing thereon,
dare wee then conforme to a geſture
which the Lord hath not promiſed to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:24639:47"/>
bleſſe, yea which being not warranted by
his word he will verely curſe and bring
contempt vpon though all the world bleſſe
it;</p>
            <p>I confeſſe the table geſture doth not ſo
liuely expreſſe and call to remembrance
the death of Chriſt, his torments and
breaking of his body, his greevous paſsion
and ſheading of his moſt pretious bloud,
as ſome other ceremoniall ſignes do, for
which cauſe it was not ordained to that
end, and the breaking of the bread and
powering out of the wyne, were appointed
as perfectly ſufficient for that purpoſe and
vſe, but no other geſture in the world can
poſsibly ſo liuely expreſſe our communion
with Chriſt our Lord through our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
pettaking truely and really the verie
things themſelues and the whole merit
thereof, which ſpiritually are repreſented
and exhibited to euery faithfull receauer
in the viſible elements, aſſuring vs that
they are as verely ours as if wee had done,
and ſuffered the ſame things our ſelues,
which are herein called to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
Let not conformity therefore to
any other geſture intimate a grevous indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in Chriſt, either in leauing this
waightie matter vncerteine, and to be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the humors of times, or if
making it certeine, then in chooſing, and
ſo cauſing, all his Apoſtles (repreſenting
all the communicants to the end of the
world) to conforme to a geſture in the act
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:24639:48"/>
of receaving nothing ſo de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rnt and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as that which Antichriſt ordained, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
nothing ſo comely and ſignificant
as the ſimilitude thereof, which others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
purged, haue alſo canonized.</p>
            <p>In the inſtitution of this holy ſacrament
there was nothing vſed or approued by
our bleſſed Lord, but what was holy &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and neuer being by him repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
is ſtill moſt pretious. Let all that loue
him labour to keepe it from the vile,
and neuer conforme to any humane deuiſe
in the ſtead thereof, which all the canons
of all the learned men in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſsibly make a holy or pretious vſe.
It is neceſſary for al that deſire to be ſaued
or to haue (by worthy pertaking this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament)
aſſurance of falvation, to haue
good aſſurance for their certeine perſvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in theſe things, vvhom therefore in al
hearty humility pray and beſeech, that
they labor and ſtriue to get the vvedding
garment, and it vvill quickly teach them
the ſupper geſture.</p>
