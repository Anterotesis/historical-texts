            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF <hi>Edward Buſhel, John Hammond, Charles Milſon</hi> and <hi>John Baily,</hi> Citizens and Free-Men of <hi>London,</hi> ſtated, and humbly preſented to the Honourable HOUSE of COMMONS Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>THat they with Eight others, being Empannelled and Sworn of a <hi>Jury,</hi> for tryal of divers Perſons indicted for ſeveral Criminal and Capital Offences, at the Seſſions of the Peace for the Goal-Delivery, held at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> for the ſaid City, in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1670. before <hi>Sr. Samuel Starling,</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Sr. John Howel</hi> Serjeant at Law, Recorder, and other Juſtices there, were (amongſt other Priſoners) charged with <hi>William Penn,</hi> and <hi>William Mead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſaid <hi>Jury</hi> having heard and conſidered the Evidence againſt the ſaid <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead,</hi> could not find them Guilty of the Indictment; thereupon they were threatned and menaced by the ſaid Mayor and Recorder to be Carted, and Marks to be ſet upon them, to have their Throats and Noſes cut, and be ſhut up cloſe Priſoners, and ſtarved to Death, unleſs they would comply: The Recorder adding thereunto, that he highly applauded the prudence &amp; pollicy of <hi>Spain</hi> in erecting the Inquiſition, and that it would never be well in <hi>England,</hi> till ſome ſuch courſe were taken here.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to which Threats, the <hi>Jury</hi> by their Order were preſently ſhut up, with expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they ſhould neither have Meat, Drink, Fire nor Candles, which was obſerved to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that they continued in this Impriſonment, <hi>Saturday, Sunday,</hi> and <hi>Munday,</hi> the ſaid Mayor and Recorder adjurning the Court from day to day, ſuppoſing, that the <hi>Jury</hi> in time, rather then endure ſuch heavy preſſures, would force their Conſciences and comply with them.</p>
            <p>But all this Illegal and Barbarous Uſage proving in effectual; after the ſaid <hi>Jury</hi> had with unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conſent brought in their Verdict, finding the ſaid Priſoners not Guilty, which Verdict not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſaid Court did accept and Record, yet the ſaid Lord Mayor and Recorder fined every of the <hi>Jury</hi> Men forty Marks a piece, and committed them Priſoners to <hi>New-Gate</hi> till Payment (of whom eight paid their fines and were ſoon diſcharged.)</p>
            <p>And the ſaid four <hi>Jurors</hi> being Merchants and Trades-Men of <hi>London,</hi> after they had been kept cloſe Priſoners about three Months, to their very great Dammage, rather then to betray the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Country, were inforced to their extraordinary Charge to ſue out their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> in the Court of Common-Pleas, which Court upon Return of the Cauſes of Commitment, and after ſeveral Arguments as well there, as before all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> conſulted in this Matter, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the great Oppoſition of the ſaid Lord Mayor and Recorder, did reſolve and declare according to the unanimous Opinion of all the ſaid Judges, that they, the ſaid four <hi>Jurors,</hi> were illegally Impriſoned and unjuſtly fined; and thereupon diſcharged them from their Impriſonments and Fines.</p>
            <p>All which unjuſtifiable Proceedings by the ſaid Lord Mayor and Recorder were done after, and in Contempt of that memorable Vote of this honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> made in the Caſe of the late Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Keeling,</hi> the 13th <hi>December,</hi> 1667. declaring, that the Preſedents and and Practice of Fining or Impriſoning <hi>Jurors</hi> for Verdicts was Illegal.</p>
            <p>And for that they, the ſaid four <hi>Jurors</hi> do humbly apprehend it may be of dangerous Conſequence for any inferiour Judicature, who are only to declare the Law made, to aſſume to themſelves an arbitrary Power of innovating and altering the ſame, eſpecially, when it doth tend to the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Overthrow of the antient and fundamental Laws of the Land, conſiſting in nothing more then in the Liberty the Subjects have in the Freedom of Tryals by their Peers. And foraſmuch as the ſaid <hi>Jurors</hi> have not only been great Sufferers in their Perſons and Eſtates by the ſaid arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and illegal Impriſonment; but they do alſo humbly conceive it hath been and ſtill is of very evil Conſequence to the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of his Majeſties Subjects; for ſuch Perſons (who have acted thus arbitrarily, directly contrary to and in Defiance of, not only the Laws of the Land; but alſo of the fore-ſaid Votes of the <hi>Houſe of Commons)</hi> to be ſtill continued in Places of ſo great Truſt and Authority, as Recorder, Juſtices of Peace and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to the great Terror and Diſcouragement of all <hi>Jurors</hi> in the Performance of their Duty. And foraſmuch, as they the ſaid Jurors are diſcouraged by their Counſel to ſeek Remedy or Satisfaction in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> for theſe ſo great Oppreſſions, the Reaſon alleadged, for that all the ſaid Acts were done by the ſaid Mayor and Recorder in a Court of Judicature, againſt which no Action can be brought: So that they are like to be left remidileſs, unleſs relieved by this <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe,</hi> unto whoſe Protection they do moſt humbly fly, and beſeech their Juſtice for their Relief.</p>
