         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter my kinde love presented unto
you and your good wife, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of your healths. I have received
your Letter and the news, for which I kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thank you, and will give satisfaction, for
what you lay out; For news with us there is
very good, for that Regiment which went
from hence under Sir <hi>Simon Harcot,</hi> hath
done much good: for he and Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
issued out of <hi>Dublin</hi> with two thousand
and set upon a Town called <hi>Swords,</hi> some
eight miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> which the enemies
had taken, and were there encamped about
five thousand of them, our men set on them
and slew three hundred of them with the
losse of three men, and put the rest to flight;
and took, as the report is, spoil worth six
thousand pound, and set fire of the Town.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62135:3"/>
Also Captain <hi>Bartly</hi> with a ship of Warre,
and foure other small ones, hath relieved
<hi>Tradarth,</hi> as he went up the River he played
with his Ordnance on both sides, fifteen
Peeces on a side; and when Sir <hi>Henry Tits<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>
heard him, he issued out to meet him
for joy, and when he was gone out, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
marched towards the Citie; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
back before them, and he bid them
come, he would deliver the Town to them,
and set open the gates. But when some eight
score of them were come in, Captain <hi>Jaxe</hi>
one of their Captains kissed his Sword and
said, God be thanked the Town was theirs.
But presently they discharged two peeces
of Ordnance, and a bullet hit him and dasht
out his brains, and they shut the gates, and
shot off the walls at the rest, and put those
eightscore all to the Sword, and when the
rest saw them shoot they fled; but they slew
some three hundred of them off the walls.
Captain <hi>Bartley</hi> as he came home he bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
a Town called <hi>Skerries,</hi> by the Sea
coast, and fired it where the Rebels lodged.
And very lately Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> and Sir <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62135:3"/>
Harcot</hi> issued out of <hi>Dublin</hi> again (they
were striving a day for preheminence) and
cast lots, and Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> got it, whether
should lead them to <hi>Dunboyne:</hi> and if they
had gone that day before, they had taken
the Lords of the Pile there, but they took
the Town, and got great spoils and fired it:
they brought with them foure hundred
head of cattell, besides other victualling. The
Lord <hi>Dungarbar</hi> is arrived in <hi>Ireland</hi> safe, he
hath taken <hi>Dungar</hi> now and victualled it.
Thus being in haste, I rest,</p>

                  <p>YOur kind Letter by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ralinson I safely
received, and whereas you desire to heare
of our present state in this poore Kingdom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I shall in briefe relate unto you our latest
Occurrences.</p>
                  <p>Three dayes since Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> and Sir <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Harcotte</hi> sallied out to Swords, six miles from
Dublin, where the enemy had their Campe, and
there had intrenched themselves. By break of day
our men set upon them, drave them out of their
Trenches, and put them to rout, they ran away,
about 120 were slain, divers taken prisoners, foure
of their Colours, Drummes, and Armes, our men
brought away, who are safely come againe, blessed
be God, onely wee lost foure men; whereof the
chiefe was Sir <hi>Lorenzo Cary,</hi> brother to the Lord
<hi>Faulkland,</hi> shot in the head, as it is thought, by one
of his Souldiers; he was brought to Dublin on
horseback, his footman behind him holding him
up in the saddle, which an <hi>Irish</hi> woman on the Key
seeing, said it was pitty that no more were served
so, which the Souldiers hearing, in a rage threw
the woman into the River, where she was drowned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62135:4"/>
The Rebels have burned all the Plantation
Towns in the County of London Derry, but Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Colraine stand out stoutly.</p>
                  <p>The last night they went out towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
beyond Tallow, and burnt two or three Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
whereby those Rebels should not have any
shelter so neare us, but when our men came, they
ranne away, and would not abide above two shot,
so that till we have supply from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
no good is to be done with them, whereby we
may follow them to the full; notwithstanding, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Papists curse the Jesuits, Priests, and Fryers,
and say in plaine tearmes, they have been the cause
of all this; and no question to the contrary; the
Lord in mercy convert or confound them.</p>
                  <p>Wee are all much bound to God for our Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
King, the Honourable Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
the mercifull and pious Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and the
whole Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland,</hi> for their
care and pitty upon us, although as yet wee have
but little help to this great work, but of that which
we have received, we are much comforted, and we
doe not doubt of the rest, which doth not a little
strike to the hearts of our enemies, as we heare; by
this you may see in part our calamities; but blessed
be God, our Lords, Justices, and Councell, have
provided for this Citie, that under God, we hope
to be safe as you in <hi>London,</hi> and so we hope of <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedah,</hi>
where a worthy Governour Sir <hi>Henry Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi>
holds out valiantly, although the Rebells
have made many assaults upon the Towne. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is sent by Sea to <hi>Drohedah,</hi> and wee trust in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62135:5"/>
God, it will be safely delivered to them, but if not,
they will be hard besteed, but if it please God to
send us more strength, we make no question by
Gods assistance but to cleer the passage by land to
succour them.</p>
                  <p>These miseries are great the Lord be mercifull
unto us: but this is not all, the most of our rich
men and great men are fled from us into England,
and have carried their estates with them, they have
not left one penny to succour the poore distressed
stript people who are come hither for relief, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have at this present neer three thousand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many hundreds are starved to death since
they came onely with want, for we are not able to
do more then we do, we do relieve them far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our abilities; for my own part, I pay much
weekly for billiting money, besides what I give to
the poore; the rich being gone, left their houses
without any help at all unto us, not so much as
common charges for the safety of this City, but
all lieth upon the poorer sort: The Lord in mercy
forgive them this sin, this great sin, that the blood
of so many hundreds which have perished by want
be not required at their hands. Thus with our best
respects unto you, I rest</p>
