         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The one of well-doing, and the other, of well-speaking.</p>
            <p>The Moderns have esteemed the latter lesse
considerable and more dangerous.</p>
            <p>As for me, I shall not undertake to judge, as if they had
done amisse.</p>
            <p>But for as much as I looke upon the one, ordained to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

of Wel-Speaking; not to make a vaine ostentation of its Art,
but as an Instrument and meanes to provide in Man the
desire of Well-doing, and to teach him the way to accomplish
<pb facs="tcp:46389:3"/>
the good which he hath propounded to himselfe.</p>
            <p>I have freely addicted my mind to teach in this your Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the Art of Well-Speaking, to this end only, in testimony
whereof, and for a full justification of my sincere intentions
I do humbly present you with the first Lecture in the which
I do but declare, that rich quality wihch is in Well-Speaking,
to wit; to be the Image and principall sensible argument of
what is in us, a Rationall, Intelectuall, and Inmateriall

Rules and Documents which shall be taught hereafter in your
Academy to the <hi>Lovers of Wel-Speaking,</hi> to incite them to
doe well, It shall bee in imitation of those who having little

               <bibl>Prov. 8. 6, 7.</bibl>
               <q>Audite nam praestantia eloquar, &amp; aperura labiorum
meorum eloquar recta; nam veritatem meditatam

               <q>Heare, for I will speake of excellent things, and the opening
of my lips shall be right things; for my mouth shall speake
truth, and wickednesse is an abomination to my lips.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>Lovers of vertue:</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall at this present declare the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
desire in man, to speake well.</p>
            <p>The difficultnies which it meetes
withall, and the meanes to overcome
them.</p>
            <p>What is sought for, is commonly the thing desired,
and hat which is most desired, is seldome attained; for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46389:4"/>
that the thing desired with the greatest eagernesse, is
the more difficult by us to be found.</p>
            <p>To prove this there will need but little labour, since
doubtlesse many of you in seeking what you earnestly
desire, have found what you sought not after; and
might easily perceive that what you aimed at, was in a
manner hidden from you.</p>
            <p>And the cause hereof may well deserve our inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
since doubtlesse the desire in us can be no other
then an effect of the matter by us desired.</p>
            <p>How then should it happen that our desire being in
its owne effect, neverthelesse doth seeme to withdraw
it selfe from us?</p>
            <p>Desire is the coveting of one and the selfe same
thing, yet notwithstanding its very strange that the
desire, and the object desired (as though they were two
contraries) seeme to shun, and be separated the one
from the other.</p>
            <p>Contraries (as is said) they are not, since betweene
the desire and the thing desired, there is a mutuall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
simpathie and correspondence, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
its so obscure, and disguised, that its very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to finde out its grounds.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as you may have had many and sundry
experiences of this doubtfull case; I shall (whilst you
may be pleased to meditate on its resolve) treat of
one of the greatest, powerfullest, and most common
effects of Appetites in this world, to wit, of well speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and give you the proofe thereof.</p>
            <p>For that desire is an appetite, all appetites are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into three sorts; as, a Naturall appetite, a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
appetite, and a Rationall appetite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46389:4"/>
The Naturall appetite, belongs only to a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a soule.</p>
            <p>The Sensitive appetite, is proper to a sensible body.</p>
            <p>And the rationall appetite, can only be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto man, indued with reason; nay all three are
proper to Man, as well the Naturall appetite, as the
Sensitive, and the Rationall; for that in man the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
nature co-opperates, and hath its naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
as you see man being heavie descends.</p>
            <p>The Sensible nature likewise is predominant in
man, and hath its sensible appetites; for man as a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Animall toucheth, feeles, heares, smells, and
tastes.</p>
            <p>And above all the rest, he is endued with a rationall
nature, which according to all reason is consequently
an appetite likewise.</p>
            <p>Now all the appetites which are universally sensible
being but three, and those three being perfectly placed
in man, he therefore, both by a naturall, sensitive, and
reasonable appetite, desires, seekes, passionates, and
runs with all his might after Eloquence, I meane the
Art and Science of well speaking; it is that he aimes
at, and what he fixeth on.</p>
            <p>True it is, that he doth not alwaies meet with that
which he seekes for; have I not told you so? And
more-over, I can assure you, that in a State there may
be found a great number of Philosophers, Speculatists,
and Morall men, nay Divines, Doctors in Law, and in
Physick; yet you will meet with a very few of all
these Professions, that have attained to the Art of well
speaking; and its more to be admired, that having so
little of this Art, they make no better use of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46389:5"/>
Whereof at the close of this Discourse I shall give
you the reasons, and likewise the meanes how we may
obtaine what we desire.</p>
            <p>Let me but represent unto you the extent of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and you will finde, that we shall not need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
in our successe.</p>
            <p>For my scope is to open unto you (in time) all the
wayes which may contribute to the accomplishment
of our desires.</p>
            <p>The appetite then is a desire, and the desire is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
appetite; this is very easie to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but not so easie to be understood, how that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
men incline to the Art of well speaking. For as I
take it, all men being of one kinde, doe generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to professe the Art of well speaking, because that
all men naturally long for the same thing, and Nature
cannot but desire its owne good.</p>
            <p>See you not how its appetite is universall, those
that serve God in his Church, are the first who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
to endeavour to attaine unto that gift; for that
its written, <hi>The lips of the Priests shall keep knowledge;</hi>
and who hath ever heard, or found that any other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is contained in the lips then that of well speaking;
for all other knowledge is in the Soule, and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of man.</p>
            <p>Well speaking doth depend on the Lungs, and the
channell which receives and issues forth the Ayre, it
depends of the Tongue, and of the Teeth.</p>
            <p>Observe the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose Language is the most
ancientest known to us; its Consonants and Vowels
are divided into letters depending of the throat, teeth,
and lips, and these three parts are most requisite, as
being the organs of Eloquence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46389:5"/>
But the Letters which are pronounced by the lips,
are such which are properly and distinctly pronounced;
and God in ancient times recommending the property
of the lips, saith, It was to teach men to speake cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and pronounce distinctly the Divine Mysteries.</p>
            <p>This Science may be properly compared unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in Monarchs, and Princes, as being most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to keep Subjects in a due obedience, and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary in the great Body of a State; for that well
speaking in a Princes mouth, is that which above all
other things captivates the hearts and affections of his
Subjects; and I dare say, that though a man were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the knowledge of severall Arts, and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that wanting the gift of expression he will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be regarded, nor esteemed of; for, <hi>Scire tuum ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
est, nisi tescire hoc sciat alter:</hi> And when this gift
meets in what Subject soever, either by Nature, or by
Art, its capable to make it sufficiently commendable.
Behold the Feminine Sex, and though silence be farre
more commendable in Women then Eloquence, yet
notwithstanding, when any of them excell in that Art,
she is so much the more to be admired as its unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from her: So that the speech of the Woman to
our Saviour, <hi>True Lord, but the doggs eate the crumbs that
fall from the table,</hi> &amp;c. ought to be remembred with
admiration, since it was observed by him who was the
eternall Word, and by which all things had their first
being: And ought we not to admire that transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
civill expression of <hi>Abigals,</hi> That she would be
the most humblest Servant of all her Husbands Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides,</p>
            <p>Certainly, the Art of well speaking, be it on what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46389:6"/>
subject soever (so it tends not to shift off the duty of
doing well) is very highly to be esteemed, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
greatly to be desired.</p>
            <p>No sooner is an Infant laid on its mothers lap,
but it strives to speake, and that well too; yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
speech, it cryes, whereby it may be conjectured to
have many things to say; even so, though contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
when man begins to lose his speech, its taken
for a signe of privation of life, for that we then say,
the man is dead, and gone.</p>
            <p>So that speech, and well speaking, being signes of a
livelihood in Nature, I therefore make no difficulty to
terme the desire of well speaking to be a Naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
common unto all men, extant in all men, at all
times, forasmuch as concernes the desire.</p>
            <p>The nature of man is not like unto that of Savage
creatures, retired and solitary; but its civill, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick,
nay familiar; and wherefore should she then
be bereaved of her universality?</p>
            <p>I hold for certaine, that among the Fowles, and
Beasts of the Earth, there is a common speech in their
severall kindes; for many times the Fishes have been
heard to utter a voyce: And there have bin learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
that have observed a kind of correspondence
in all Animals; in the Birds, Cocks, Hens, Sparrows,
Lenets, Canary Birds, and even the greater inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Fields; as Buls, Oxen, and Kine, seeme to
converse among themselves; And why should they
not? since they have inward sencible appetites, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
whereof depends of another individuall
of the same kinde.</p>
            <p>Universall Nature would have failed greatly, had it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46389:6"/>
not afforded them some externall instrument to cause
their desires to be understood; neither can we expect
that Birds, or Beasts should have so great a variety of
sounds, words, or termes; that they should need Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries,
or Vocabulers; the Greek, Latine, or Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean
Tongues, for their naturall discourse, as men have,
and the reasons hereof are only two or three; First,
that their familiar conversation is but with a few,
who are only capable of the same appetite they have.
But men converse with divers Nations, amidst which,
Nature fore-seeing, capacities of envie, jealousie, and
enmity one against the other; though all men are of
the same kinde. For though we see a man, or a Lady
of a faire, beautifully, Lilly, Rose-like complexion, as
we English generally are; or that we behold a black
Aethiopian, as those are who live under the Torrid
Zoane. We must not imagine to our selves that such
Creatures differ in their species, or kindes; and since
all, and each of us, and of them are possest with reason,
which distinguisheth the humane Creatures from all
other kindes.</p>
            <p>Now Nature (as I said) having fore-seene, that all
the singulars of one and the self-same kinde would not
love each other, hath not been only pleased for our
securities, to divide, and to separate us, by distances of
places, and other powerfull Mediums, as great Seas;
vast Forrests, and inaccessable Hills, but also by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Languages, as well as of termes, and of the
manner of speaking; and for my part, I have no other
reason why most expressing Nature hath provided so
many sorts of Languages, but only to distinguish a
friend from an enemy, fore-seeing that, <hi>Homo homini
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46389:7"/>
lupus,</hi> one man would be cruell to another.</p>
            <p>And here I shall take the freedome to say (reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
entire and uncontradicted what hath beene
said in the precedent Lecture, on all the Languages,
Sciences, Arts, and Noble exercises) that its almost a
wonder Nature hath not made a dialect, and common
proper Ideotisme to so great a Body as that of a whole
Nation.</p>
            <p>The diversity of speech (as a man may properly
say) serving man, as the guard about the handle and
pomell of a Sword. For that in these times a Father
is not in security among his owne Children, nor a
Wife in company of her Husband; so that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versnesse
of this Age might well require as many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
in a house as there are persons, for as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith, <hi>Frater venatur in fratrem.</hi> Therefore let no
lover of vertue thinke it strange, that amongst the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademicall
Orders, there is an Article inserted, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the speaking of any matters of State: lesse, the
discoursing of any passages of the times past, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for that the Academy is onely to instruct; and
not to entertaine Disputants, which onely cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
hatred, and enmity: Pardon this small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
            <p>Neither let us accuse Nature which hath taken care
for all common occurrences, nor was she obliged to
reflect on particulars, for the malice of particulars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
not a jot from universall wisdome.</p>
            <p>She hath not only provided in particular for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of generation, but also for the universall
good; which is the conservation of the Species, or
Kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46389:7"/>
There remaines yet a second consideration, Why it
is that in the Animalls of the Earth, the Birds in the
Aire, nor the Fishes in the Sea, wee find not such a
rich, or abundant explication of Language, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, and herein I shall venture to tell you a
thing; which may seeme to be a meer Paradox; or to
excuse my selfe better, you will beleeve, that I do but
alledge it by way of comparison, or by a Rethoricall
figure, by the which at the close of this discourse, you
will judge that all that I say is free from Amphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
            <p>Now, forasmuch as I know, the beasts have but two
or three applications, which they cannot accomplish
but by themselves. As the appetite of eating, for to
sustaine themselves: I would say (as you know very wel)
for to repaire that which it looseth in it selfe, of its
proper substance, and this appetite is the individuall
appetite.</p>
            <p>The other Appetite, is that of the kinde, to wit, its
conservation by it generation, which are all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
appetites I can perceive; the conservation of its spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
&amp; of its self, so that having but these two appetites
they have no need of any great eloquence to expresse
themselves. And the same would bee in the species of
man, if he had no other desires.</p>
            <p>My selfe having been so curious as to inquire, and
dive into the Languages of the Savage Nations, I
found that all their Rethorick was to be learned in one
houre, and by what one of them had set down in one
sheet of paper, I collected that it contained all their
tearms, their destinctions, phrases, and maner of speech,
And replying unto him, that it seemed to me a thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46389:8"/>
impossible, that in so smal a quantity of words, the Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and termes of those Savages should be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>He answered thus; and very much to the purpose:
That Nature had provided them with as many instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and words as they stood in need of, for as they go
naked, and need no cloathes, so they need not the words
requisite to expresse a hat, bands, cuffes, shirts, stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
shooes, and the like, belonging to accoutriments.</p>
            <p>And as they dwell in Huts, under trees, and Caves
under ground; so they need not those propper termes
in buildings, as the Foundation, Walls, the Roofe,
the Seeling, the Hall, Chambers, Parlour, Cabbinets,
Kitching and the like. And as they make no great
use of Kitching, so likewise need they not Larderies,
Pasteries, nor Lardry-houses, in that they foule neither
Table-cloathes, Napkins, nor any other linnen: And
thus hee made it appeare, that they needed not those
words, nor those offices, as things not in use with
them.</p>
            <p>So I remained satisfied of my Schoole-Master, and
the more, when I reflected on my selfe, as we may all
doe on our selves: the manner of our lives being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
For that in a moment I found, that if wee
should stand in need of as many tearmes, as we doe of
severall things, either of instruments, or the like, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in our owne preservation; then there would
be as many tearmes necessary, and words to expresse
our necessities, and desires, as there may bee drops of
water in the Sea. Now this will seem to be a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
and you will hardly beleeve it.</p>
            <p>But to instance herein, let one but enter the Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house

Budget of Tooles, and so make a generall progresse
through all the severall Trades, and vocations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, within and without doores, both by Sea
and Land, spare not Ladies Closets, and Cabinets,
wherein you will finde a world of things, the names
and properties whereof themselves hardly know,
nor remember; and then doe but consider with your
selves, what an eloquence, and what a superfluous abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of words there are requisite in these times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that both in men and women there daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
new desires, which to excuse, I shall terme new
necessaries, either invented by Nature, Art, or the
fond Conceit of people, the termes and names where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are so many, as that the Nationall languages cannot
sufficiently furnish the store as is requisite.</p>
            <p>Doe but observe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> as ancient as it is, it
cannot expresse Suger in its owne Speech, but calls it
Honey, Manna, not Suger; because that in those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times men had not tasted Suger.</p>
            <p>The Latines have no word for the Lute, only they cal
it a Viol, or Violin, because the Lute was not in use in
their dayes. And in some occasions the Greek borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Latine termes.</p>
            <p>Therefore we must, as aforesaid, apply the necessity
of termes, to the severall necessities of occasions,
and appetites; which are three in number, naturall,
sensitive, and rationall, all three in man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb facs="tcp:46389:9"/>
one particularly in man, as possessing an infinite
number of objects, of ends, means, and incessant occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for to expresse himselfe by.</p>
            <p>Now to purchase and make use of them, there must
be a Language, there must be words, and those words
doe signifie; and they are the more significant when
they are distinctly pronounced, methodically disposed
of, proper in their significations, gracefull in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and pleasing to the hearers, so that they may both
benefit the speaker and the hearer. And in this point
consists particularly the Art of well speaking, being
the greatest, the most eminentest, and common'st Art
and Science in the world, though the hardest to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and the most difficult to attaine to.</p>
            <p>And unlesse it be infused (as it were) into us by a
speciall grace of Nature, it will be very laborious to
attaine unto its perfection. By Art men become Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
Mathematicians by study, and Masters of
Art by exercise.</p>
            <p>But the Art of Eloquence, and of well speaking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
both Art and Nature together; as also reading,
studying and experience; as likewise a disposition in all
the Organs, abundance of fluent conceptions, memory
for the remembrance of the terms, cleernesse of throat,
volubility of tongue, freedome of expression, a moyst
pallate, teeth equally ranged, open lips; all these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as so many Naturall tooles, absolutely necessary;
besides Art, and Study.</p>
            <p>All lovers of this Art may be amply instructed in
this Science, so they be of a naturall good dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
since all the Art that can be taught, teaching to the
perfection of well speaking, requires such persons as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46389:9"/>
are endued with requisite Organs to utter speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Art of wel speaking can be taught unto them;
since Art only serves to accomplish the appetite of
Nature.</p>
            <p>Now what I have told you is but very little of the
excellency of well speaking, for that its in man an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
sensible appetite, and in this consideration it
surpasseth as farre the first, as the sensible Nature sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
the simple elementary Nature; or that of the
simple elements which are mixt.</p>
            <p>Well speaking, nay only speaking, is a sensible vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
action, I meane not the intellectuall speech which
is likewise proper unto God, as to Angels: Speech, is
the cogitation of the intellectuall, and is placed in
the ranke of the skilfull objects, as their Image is an
intellectuall expression; I meane that speech which
you now heare, proceeds from me, the vocall word;
and though this kinde of speaking is sensible, yet is it
not one of those five Senses, by us termed, the Sight,
the Hearing, the Smelling, the Feeling, and the Taste.</p>
            <p>Speech then being a sensible thing, though not a
sence, we doe perceive, and know its excellency by
that sence whereof speech is the object; and by the
nature of the object you may discover how that well
speaking is as pleasing, and icheth more the sences
then all other sensible things in the universall world.</p>
            <p>Speech hath its source in the bowels, and hath the
birth of its conception close unto the Lights, its refined
through the channell into its passage, I meane the
Throat, and maketh not its issue by the Nostrils, nor
by the Eares, nor by the Eyes; but it rubs against,
and joynes it selfe unto the Pallate, and is issued out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46389:10"/>
by the very selfe same way as the Taste is; which is
the most delicatest, most necessariest Sence in all
Animals.</p>
            <p>And this is worthy to be observed, how that some
instruments which doe serve for the Taste, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
necessary to the production of the speech, and
what a rich instruction may we all reape hereby? That
meats over hot offend the Pallate, too bitter distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, too flat stupifies it, too sharp disturbs it, too
salt offends it, too moyst hinders it, too dry retards
its operation, and quite abolishes the taste. By all
which arguments we may gather, that the too high
speech hinders, the too low profits not, too disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
offends, too sweet and amorous corrupts, too
harsh irritates; for as it is most necessary to season
that meat which is presented to the taste, most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely,
so its also very necessary to be verst in the Art
of preparing, and seasoning our desire, too much Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is vaine; ostentation savours of a Mountebank,
no Eloquence at all, is just like green Fruits, soure and
unpleasing.</p>
            <p>The taste is an equall sence with the feeling, though
according to our accompt we make them to differ;
which if they doe, its only in this, that the one is as a
perfect, and the other a more perfect thing; for that
the Taste is a sence more perfect then the universall
feeling throughout all the body. Now wherein I
pray consisteth this perfection? the Physitian will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you; That the perfection of feeling consists in the
temperature, to judge of all the extremities which it
toucheth; for were it excessively cold, it would not be
sensible of the cold matters which might touch the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46389:10"/>
same; and if it were extreamly hot, it would not be
moved by the hot objects; the action here is made by
some contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riety to the object, unto the power, so
that the sence which toucheth, ought to be very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in it selfe, for to discerne so many objects
which it doth touch.</p>
            <p>Above all the parts of Mans body, the palme of the
hand, and the sole of the foot are most temperate, and
fittest to feel withall; but above all, the place where the
taste is framed, for that is the Physitian of the stomack,
the judge of the meat, and the arbiter of all what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.
And since that Nature hath so mixt the taste
and the speech, thinke you not Lovers of vertue, that
it is a most faithfull advertisement, fore-warning us
how that all our discourses ought to be tempered;
and as health doth consist in the temperature of the
body, so likewise he that speakes well, is temperate in
his tongue, and the temper of the tongue, either in
matter of discourse, or of speech, is true eloquence.</p>
            <p>Therefore if it be ask'd, why a man ought to be
well instructed, and well informed, for to speake well,
I shall reply; Why must the taste be temperate? you
will say, that it is because of the nouriture which
doth first passe by the essay of the taste; and I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
that as the nourishment of the body ought to
passe by the proofe of the taste, which in its selfe is a
perfect and a temperate sence; that so likewise the
speech being a nourishment of the Soule, as Jesus
Christ our Lord and Saviour said to the Devils; <hi>Non
insolopane vivit homo, sed in omne verbo quod procedit exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Dei,</hi> must passe by the Art of well speaking; for
that the words by which well speaking is framed are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46389:11"/>
the food of the Soule. And wonder not though I tell
you more, that notwithstanding speech and well
speaking are all but words, <hi>Verba &amp; votes,</hi> as another
saith, yet those that speake a good word, <hi>id est,</hi> that
speake well, receive a sensible pleasure by their
mouthes.</p>
            <p>Of this I am certaine, and have a thousand witnesses;
I say not, that a man feeds on the good words of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for all that is but ayre; and its not only ayre
whereon our mixt bodies doe nourish themselves, but
the words are tasted by themselves; whereon you need
but to examine a Poet hereon, and doubtlesse he will
tell you, that he doth in a manner know, and eate his
words, there being somewhat in them agreeing with
the taste; and certainly, that person that hath spoken
somewhat amisse, cannot chuse but consequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
very much distasted.</p>
            <p>And for the greater demonstration of the delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of speech, I shall adde; That since well speaking
is conceived by so delicate a sence, as the taste is, and
that the mouth, where that sence resides, gives it its
birth; nay that in its very birth, and production, it
is received by another sence more delicate then the
former, to wit, hearing; <hi>Nam auditis per verbum,</hi> so
you need not to doubt of the delicacy of its temper,
since its that sence which judgeth of all the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reasonances in the universall world. Neither need
we to dispute on the largenesse of its ample Spheres ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
for that very often it doth not only heare that
which it regardeth not, but also those things which
are not seene by the eyes of man; neither need we to
question its power, both on the bodies, sences, and also
on the soule of mortalls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:46389:11"/>
True it is, that this sence is in the body of man, and
in that part of the head which we call the Eares; but
no sooner are they strucken with some noyse, but that
this sence is so powerfull, that it formes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
both its species and Images unto all the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
sences; and having once got a footing in the
Common-wealth of mans fancy, or cogitation, its
the sence which moves, stirres, imbroyles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all our passions unto their materiall being; and
to say more, even from their off spring, and formall
being.</p>
            <p>But on what grounds or consequences doth this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
parcell of sence move, and stirre all the body, since
it imployes not it selfe in the body of all Animals as
feeling doth? Certainely, no otherwise but by the
speech, and by a pronounced discourse; and this we
ought more to admire, that the Soule as substantially
intelectuall should only produce (though without it
selfe) Spirituall and intelectuall things, and that
likewise the Soule which receives all things, should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive proportionable ones, as Spirituall accidents;
but because the Soule in this state only receives by the
meanes of the sences, that is to say, such things which
one man may communicate to another; for doubtlesse
God may agitate immediatly in the Soule of man
without the sences.</p>
            <p>All what she receives for her Spirituall food was at
first sensible, as being made so by its passage through the
severall Organs; and therefore it must of necessity
follow, that one Soule agitating towards another, and
producing some sensible thing, must be so Spirituall, or
approach so neare unto a Spirituall being, that it may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46389:12"/>
even reach the Soule, and as it were touch it; for that
it belongeth not to that part which receives, for to
agitate, but only to receive, and to suffer.</p>
            <p>Now, that which my Soule can produce and forme
of it selfe, for to agitate towards another Soule, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this materiall condition, different to that which
shall be hereafter of the Spirituall bodies, is nothing
else but a speech, and a well composed discourse. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
I pray, and consider what I tell you; the Soule
doth not agitate towards another, but by well speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for that she cannot doe any other thing.</p>
            <p>One man touching anothers body with his, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
some alteration therein, but this happens not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soule; one may looke on another mans body,
but that only terminates it selfe on its superficies; but
let him doe what he will, he can only pretend to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on the intelectuall Soule of another, by the
speech which proceeds from his mouth; its that which
shakes a man, moves, alters, changes, turnes, and
windes him, and leades him to that which the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Soule pretends unto.</p>
            <p>This is that only sence, and that only part of the
body, to wit, the mouth, which by the Art of well
speaking animates, and excitates another mans Soule.</p>
            <p>I say not, that man is insensible of what he seeth,
toucheth, smells, and tastes, for I know that man is a
sensible Animall, and that the Soule (which by the
meanes of the sences attaineth to the knowledge of
things) makes use of the severall actions of the sences,
even for its owne instruction; and all those other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
doe only tend directly, immediatly, and totally
for to move the body; but another mans speech, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46389:12"/>
his formed discourse, is framed by the Tongue, for
to expresse the Soules meaning, and by its passage
through the Eares, it tends to informe, and instruct
the Soule.</p>
            <p>Now if it happens that the bodies be first moved,
and distempered by the hearing of another mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
it is because the Soule being either incitated,
or appeased by good words, doth afterwards by a
straiter union, and more entire communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the one and the others Soule, and Body, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile,
or separate it selfe; and hence it proceeds, that
mans body is sometimes distempered, that his blood is
over heated, that his heart beats and panes, and that
his Eights do I well beyond measure.</p>
            <p>Finally, speech is only proper unto Man, and in no
wayes unto Beast; which argueth, that speech is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expresse the Soule; and what regards the Soule
instructing the same, and nourishing it, according to
the lesson hereon read by the Master of true Eloquence,
Jesus Christ; I say, that lesson which he read to the
enemy of Mankinde, who willing his great Master to
change stones into bread, it was answered, that, <hi>Man
lived not only by bread, but by every word, &amp;c.</hi> and by
this terme Man, the Soule of man is meant, which
makes the man. Bread is directly and immediatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the bodies subsistance, but speech is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall,
proper, and sole food for the Soule; and not
all kinde of speeches neither, but the divine Word,
that which comes from God, which informes us of his
Will, which instructs us in the knowledge of his Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and serves to conduct us to him.</p>
            <p>And in this manner the Saviour of our Soules, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46389:13"/>
the Master of true Eloquence spake; and he spoke not
only well, but also did well; for it is said of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
workes, that <hi>never any man had cured those that
were borne blinde;</hi> And as concerning his Eloquence
we finde thus; that never any man spake so well, nor
in such termes, for that they were all words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
saving life.</p>
            <p>And since we have now attained to the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of perfection in this Science, we may say, that
well speaking proceeds either from an earnest desire,
or from an extreame reasonable appetite.</p>
            <p>Man desires to be known for what he is, and nothing
vexeth him more then that he should be misconstrued,
or taken for what he is not; and hence proceeds the
usuall saying, What? or for whom doe you take
me? for a Sot? a Beast? a brutall? a Knave? or a
man bereaved of his sences? To be poore, and to be
thought so, sick, old, or young, are things which should
not trouble us, though its very lawfull for us to desire
the contrary; as to wish for meanes without super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flulty,
as for to be poore, or rich; in health, or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
those are things which concerne the exteriour,
our interiour is that which troubles us.</p>
            <p>Nature hath given unto man, and placed in man no
other signe, nor a more certaine proofe of his being a
man, then that amongst men he is able to discourse.</p>
            <p>The Beasts they goe, gnaw, chew, eate, run, see, and
the like; and some labour with their bodies, since we
make use of them to Till our grounds, carriages, and
such like actions and functions, in the which they excell,
and farre surpasse men. For the Eagle hath a more
sharpe eye, and excels in sight; a Hound a stronger
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46389:13"/>
scent, a Cat a more subtile eare, and so surpasseth
man in hearing, and the like.</p>
            <p>Man he only speakes, the Beasts have a kinde of a
feigned naturall voyce, and understand one another,
each in their severall kinds; Parets, and such like, will
by Art utter some words, and not by reason; for that
speech appertaines only to God, from whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it; and to the intelectuall creatures, as to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and unto men; yet its disputable whether there
be a Spirituall and intelectuall reason in man, for that
man is endued with a body like as Beasts are; and how
shall we discover then whether in such a Vessell there
be Wine, Beere, and not simple water; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove that there is any more sence in men then in
beasts, save only by the speech; therefore Lovers of
vertue, you may see, that the sole argument to prove
ones selfe to be a man, is speech; the Tongue is the
sole instrument, which assures by what it utters, that a
man is reasonable; and if that should be taken from
him, I can hardly finde any other evidence: Since its
most apparantly true, that in the darke we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
whether we are near unto a Beast or a Man, for by
feeling of him we may be deceived, but never by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him speake.</p>
            <p>Consider but the Argument, how that we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
by the speech, not only that its a man, but also
distinguish of what Nation he is; as whether he be a
<hi>French-man,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> an <hi>English-man,</hi> and
the like. You may remember, how that in the Gospel,
a simple Mayden, in <hi>Pilates</hi> house, could discover <hi>Peter</hi>
to be a <hi>Galilean,</hi> and this by his speech; though he
protested, and swore the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46389:14"/>
You may all know, that not only Nations are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by their speech, which is no small benefit
in this world; to wit, the being verst in Languages,
thereby to discover a Stranger, who in all other
things can, or may distinguish himselfe; be it in his
cloathes, carriage, or in his manner of proceedings,
which he may suit very easily to the humour of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Nations he converseth with; but its impossible to
disguise a mans speech. Nay, besides this, by speech
one particular person may be distinguished from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though his features should be by us forgotten;
yet by speech even at the first meeting, he renewes his
old acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Speech therefore is the most assuredst marke, for that
men may be deceived in all other signes. Remember
the good old Patriarch, whose age had bereaved him
of his eye sight, leaving unto him only the other four
sences; when he was to give his blessing (by Nature
due to the first borne) unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> who by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of his Mother, under-tooke to defraud <hi>Esau</hi> of his
Birth-right; <hi>Jacob</hi> though disguised, for to deceive
all his Fathers remaining sences, yet he could not be
defrauded in all; for <hi>Jacob,</hi> we read, cloathed with his
Brothers rayments, embalmed by the Lillies, and
a sweet savouring scent of the Field, endeavoured to
deceive his scent, and thereby to oblige his Father to
beleeve that he was <hi>Esau.</hi> Secondly, by the taste, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had brought him the savoury meat he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in; and also by the feeling, though the good old
man apprehending as it were the deceit, said, that he
might be sure of it; <hi>My Sonne, come neare that I may
feele thee, and let me try, and assure my selfe whether thou
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46389:14"/>
art my very Sonne</hi> Esau <hi>indeed;</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> having cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his hands with skins, and <hi>Isaac</hi> touching them, and
finding them to be hairie as <hi>Esaus</hi> were, tooke <hi>Jacob</hi> to
be his eldest Sonne; though the good old Patriarch
seemed to doubt thereof, as he well might, and said;
<hi>The hands are indeed</hi> Esaus <hi>hands, but the voyce is</hi> Jacobs.
So that as you see, the voyce distinguisheth not only a
<hi>Socrates</hi> from a <hi>Plato,</hi> but likewise it discovereth the
disposition and composition of man, both in his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
humours, and in his Morall actions. A subtile
and a knowing man will discover the disposition of any
other, nay of any great Prince, so soone as he shall
have heard him but speake, and this farre better then
a Phisitian can judge of the constitution of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by the feeling of the pulse; as also by mens hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
their disposition may be guest at; the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
in divers, bearing a great resemblance with
their minde, for that its the Image and representative
picture of the voyce, or speech.</p>
            <p>But these are the first witnesses by the which the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
individuall qualities are discovered, when a man
speaks as well naturally as morally; That his discourse
be consonant to its subject, that his Phrases and termes
be proper, that his pronountiation be quick, slow,
cleere, or obscure, as the subject may require; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by his accent, manner, and the framing of his
voyce; doubtlesse all these above named particulars
may enduce much, to the discovering of a mans
minde; that great Lord and Master before named,
hath even taught us the same; saying, that the words
which proceed out of the mouth, doe denote the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
good, or bad qualities of any man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46389:15"/>
The Naturalists did thinke, that only the Ayre,
and the Water were capable to describe the qualities
of such grounds as they past through; if the Water
passeth through a Mine, either of Brimstone, Vitrioll,
or Salt-peeter, the Aire when the wind blows, will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
denote whence it comes.</p>
            <p>But the Morall Philosophers may object against the
Naturall ones, that a mans speech doth more assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifest, and cleerly declare that which is in the
entrailes of mans body, and the inward parts of a
mans Soule; then either the Ayre, or the Water doe
the inward substance of Mines.</p>
            <p>In man there are severall externall notions, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which argue either the perfections or imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the body; but the speech doth explaine the
temper of the Soule: Wherefore the speech framed
in the mouth of man, and proceeding from the Lights
and the Stomack, is in some kinde both corporall and
sensible, and in this manner it makes the temper of
that body which utters the voyce to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>But the life of a humane voyce, the very Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Soule of that voyce, that is to say, its sence, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirituall, and partly Intelectuall; its that which
enters into the pores by permission of the corporall
ayre, where it remaines; and having knockt at the
doore, and obtained entrance, the spirit then of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
speech, which is the speeches sence, bereaves its
selfe of that Corporeall robe, and is conveyed unto
our intelectuall parts, and there manifests it selfe, as in
a true draught, the very being, thoughts, conceptions,
desires, inclinations, and the other Spirituall passions of
him that speaketh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46389:15"/>
Speech, in a word, is the true interpreter, and a most
certaine witnesse of the Soule, which is not to be seene
in its selfe, being hidden under the clouds of the body;
but so soone as a man speakes, its just like unto Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Lightning that breakes forth.</p>
            <p>The eies of man which give attendance to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of another man, are not those placed in the front
of mans aspect; but they are his eares on the sides of his
head, which must serve to discerne him. Our eyes may
discover unto us our exterior parts in a Looking-glasse,
but our eares must conduce to the knowledge of those
we converse withall.</p>
            <p>Speech is the childe of the Soul, its owne first borne,
conceived in its selfe, though it be formed in the mouth
of man, and it comes not into this world to succeed
its Parents; but speech only produceth it selfe to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
its Father, and therefore we must all confesse it to
be a great benefit of Nature, in that having received an
intelectuall, Spirituall, and most Divine-like Soule,
though this Soule as it were hidden from our sight,
which is only capable of materiall, corporall, and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things; yet thus it is, that having received an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a medium, and a witnesse which doth assure us,
that in this body (though it be earthly) there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
celestiall, though our said bodies be materiall,
yet they containe something which is intelectuall;
though we be but Animals, yet there is something in us
which is Divine, to wit, an intelectuall, Divine, free,
and a reasonable Soule.</p>
            <p>And to manifest this truth, that is to say, that in our
bodies there is such a substantiall quality contained;
Nature hath given it a passage, and a meanes to make it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46389:16"/>
self both to be heard, and understood, to wit, by speech.</p>
            <p>The Angels are not environed with this corporeall
cover, for they have no bodies that hides them, and
makes themselves to be understood among themselves
without any vocall voyce; that they speak is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
for that an Apostle saith, <hi>Though he had the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of Angels, &amp;c.</hi> But they speake not as men doe,
with a moving tongue, with a shrill throat, their
speech is wholly Spirituall; but our Souls being in these
Bodies like as in a Prison, Nature having hidden and
enclosed it, hath neverthelesse left it that little passage
of the throat, and of the mouth, by which the Prisoner
calls for all he stands in need of, as also manifests his
justification, or cleerly confesseth his guilt, and want,
for that by his speaking he is knowne for what he is,
and his deserts or demerits are thereby laid open.</p>
            <p>If now all this, whereby I have entertained you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Eloquence, and the Art of well speaking, hath
not been capable to move you to an appetite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
it may be a question whether or no you have a
Soule, or whether there be any vertue in your Soules;
for since speech is the portraicture of the Soule, and of
all those beautifull excellent vertues which she posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
why should they be kept smothered and hidden?
since its most proper to vertue for to manifest her selfe,
and those vertues which are purely in the Soule; I
meane mysticall, and intelectuall vertues, which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are termed speculatives, and have no other meanes
to shew themselves unto the world, then by the Art of
well speaking. Let a man know all what may bee
possibly learnt, let him have the knowledge of God, the
skill of the heavenly revolutions of the Planets, of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46389:16"/>
Elements, of the simple and composed Bodies, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and imperfect ones. Finally, let him have an insight
in that universall Science, the Metaphisicks, who will
be able to judge whether or not he possesse all these
qualities, nay whether or no we have a Soule; if so be
we want the Art and manner to make it knowne, and
by what shall we give a sensible evidence that we are
men, that we possesse a rancke amongst them, unlesse
we give a testimony of this our knowledge, which of
it selfe is a bare nothing so long as others know not
that those gifts are extant in us; for as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er.</hi> Truly
I doubt not but that the desire to speake well, by the
infinitenesse of Nature, by the appetite of mans sences,
and by the suggestion of reason, possesseth a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on all men, as I have amply set before you.</p>
            <p>And though all that hitherto hath been alledged
should not suffice, what greater evidence can there be
given then the universall practise hereof; which is as
an infallible argument of a naturall reasonable desire.</p>
            <p>So soone as man is sensible of his being, and begins
to know himselfe, the first desire wherewith he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
is to learne for to speake, and for to obtaine this
Science; he despiseth the tendernesse of this Age, the
kinde usage of Parents, the ease of his house, and all
the other pleasures which his birth and condition may
afford him; he leaves his native Country, passeth the
Seas, crosseth the Hills, and puts himselfe within the
inclosure of an Academy, in which the Art of well
speaking is taught.</p>
            <p>Neither contenteth he himselfe with the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Masters, but he is continually busied in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46389:17"/>
the perusing of great Oratours; he speakes, writes,
and imployes his Pen in this Art, by noting the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and best succinct Speeches of Oratours and
Poets, and the Histories of all learned and famous
men, who have left behinde them a gage of their rare
qualities, to wit, their memorable workes. Hereby he
may attaine to the Art of well speaking, when any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
shall present themselves, wherein a Gentleman
may expresse himselfe with admiration.</p>
            <p>More-over, to speake well is a desire, which at all
times cleaves to all Lovers of vertue, and this desire
of theirs is so great, as that I dare say, there are divers
who are more curious of this then any other; for as all
men naturally have an ambition to speake well, so you
will finde the opinions of the most ablest and learnedst
men to joyne in this; That to know much, and to
want the Art of expression, is even nothing; and on
the contrary, that to know little, and to be able to
make ones selfe to be understood, is a great glory;
whence I doe conclude, that according to the esteeme
of most eminent persons, Eloquence is not only an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
to that which a man knoweth, but that it also
serves for a covering to disguise an ignorant man.</p>
            <p>How many are there that passe for able Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
excellent Logicians, experimented Physitians,
for great States-men, who all this while have no more
knowledge, nor understanding, but a bare way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
their superficiall conceits, imitating Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who endeavour to give a faire lustre to their
Wares, the better to put them off.</p>
            <p>It is not such an Art this Academy intends to teach,
but true Eloquence, Sciences to improve reason in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46389:17"/>
men, and Eloquence to maintaine reason before men;
Sciences for a mans owne government, and Eloquence
to serve the publick; Sciences to compose man, and
Eloquence to manifest ones selfe to be man: We must
seeke both after the one and the other, for to glorifie
God; since that the severall Sciences assist us to know
him, and Eloquence makes us able to dilate his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
unto others.</p>
            <p>Let us accompany Eloquence with Sciences, well
doing with well saying; the last without the first
serves for a mans condemnation, the first without the
last tendeth to our justification; and he that knoweth
as much as is necessary for himselfe, and who by his
good Language is able to instruct others, cannot chuse
but reape a great deale of contentment, satisfaction,
and glory.</p>
            <p>The Master of all Arts, Sciences, understanding and
knowledge, Jesus Christ our Lord, taught his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
first to doe well, discovered unto them at the same
time the Mysteries of eternall life, and immediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into them the Art of well speaking, the gift of
Eloquence, that is to say, he endued them with
his most holy Spirit, that their well speaking might
prove efficacious and usefull; and why thinke you that
the Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles in the
shape of Tongues? for no other reason but to assure
them that Eloquence, I meane true Eloquence is a
gift, that came downe immediately from Heaven, a
gift proceeding from the Holy Ghost, neither from
Nature, nor from Art.</p>
            <p>I doe not deny, but that a good disposition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the strength of study must contribute
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46389:18"/>
thereunto; but that Eloquence, or that Science is
meerly vaine, that hath not the glory of God for its
ayme, and his gift for a principle.</p>
            <p>Among the Gentiles there have been eloquent men,
among Worldlings there are great store at present;
but will you know the difference betwixt the heavenly
and earthly Eloquence? Its just like a Cannon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with a Bullet, and another only laden with a
Ball, which makes as great a noyse as the former, but
no impression at all.</p>
            <p>The ancient Oratours were only talking men, like
unto Parrets; but those that have obtained this gift
from Heaven, carry with them a speech, which not
only makes a noyse, but also a deep impression in the
Auditory; these men speake with knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and this is mans true speech; the sence,
and intelect of what we have said, is a perfect manner
of speech, both knowing and learned. In old times
they spake with a certaine knowledge, but not with a
perfect Science, a Science not to be compared unto
that which God gave unto his Apostles by the Holy
Ghost, for they were said to have the true science of
the Voyce, which is no other but a true sence of what
is said.</p>
            <p>In all our necessities and wants, let us alwayes have
our refuge to the Almighty, and especially that we
may obtaine this gift of well speaking; for none can
ever pretend to be a good proficient herein, or in
any other Science, except he receives the Grace from
Heaven.</p>
            <p>And since its a gift which we ought to desire
above all other gifts; yet all our desires, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46389:18"/>
will ever be able to make us attaine unto its
perfection; for as I have told you from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and you may have had the experience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
what we most desire, is that which we seldome
obtaine.</p>
            <p>The reason hereof you shall have in a word, and its
because we beleeve that we are not able to obtaine it,
by our owne industry, labour, and paines, by reading,
and by the helpe of good Tutors; but we shall come
farre short of our expectations, unlesse we have our
recourse and refuge to the true and only Teacher, the
Holy Ghost; for let us but accord our hearts unto the
Almighties Rules, and Ordinances, and doubtlesse
our tongues being our hearts interpreters, will utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
eloquent and pleasant things, &amp;c.</p>
