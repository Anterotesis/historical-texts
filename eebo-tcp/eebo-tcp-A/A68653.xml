            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that then, he would bee contented to receiue hym into

able to deſerue.</p>
               <p>The Duke all aſhamed to bee knowne what he was, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
made aunſwere, that he was borne in the Countrey of

had in the ridyng of Horſe, very deſirous to render his wife
ſome portion of his good fortunes, who had been ſo long tyme
partaker of his euill happes, crauyng leaue of his Lorde for a
tyme, came to <hi>Taryffa,</hi> where when he miſſed his wife, whoſe
letters were not yet come from <hi>Cherona,</hi> and therefore could
get no inteligence, but that ſhe was gone to <hi>Cayre,</hi> of purpoſe
to ſeeke hym: in a greate perplexitie he traueiled towardes
<hi>Cayre,</hi> where makyng greate inquirie could learne nothyng
of her, from thence he poſted from place to place, from Citie
to Citie, from Towne to Towne, but beyng neuer the neare
his purpoſe, he then began to double his dolours, and with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
words to curſe the celeſtiall Signes, and Planets, which
raigned at the daie of his Natiuitie, and howre of his birthe,
contented to yeeld hym ſelf a captiue to miſhappe, and to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
hymſelf a ſubiect to Fortunes frowarde frumpes.</p>
               <p>Beyng thus turmoyled with greate anguiſhe of mynde,
wanderyng to and fro, he was brought ſo lowe and bare, that
<pb facs="tcp:7038:8"/>
he was readie to begge an almes from doore to doore, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
to a poore Countrey Village, his penurie was ſuche,
that he was glad to become a ſeruaunt to hym that was the
Sexten of the Pariſhe, whom he had not ſerued long, but the
olde Sexten his maiſter died, and for that he had now learned
to ryng Belles, and had ſome cunnyng in the keepyng of a
Clocke: the Pariſhoners were contented to place hym in his
Maiſters rome; the Duke thinkyng hymſelf more then thriſe
happie to gett ſo greate preferment, thanked Ladie Fortune
that had ſo freendly dealt with hym, reſoluyng hymſelf to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the office while he liued, but Fortune findyng hym ſo
thankfull for a little, dealt more freendly with hym, as after
you ſhall heart.</p>
               <p>But I will firſt declare how it happened with his ſoonne
<hi>Aurelianus,</hi> who was taken vp in the woodes by the Duke of
<hi>Vaſconya;</hi> as before you haue heard.</p>
               <p>But here I muſte firſte remember you, that the Duke
chaunged his name from <hi>Aurelianus</hi> to <hi>Siluanus,</hi> whiche
name he gaue hym of purpoſe, for that he was founde in the
Woodes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluanus</hi> now hauyng been trained vp at Schoole, was
come to mans eſtate, and beſides that he had the knowledge
of good letters, he was comely in his perſonage, and of very
good proportion, and in all maner of actiuities, appertainyng
to a Gentleman, he exceeded euery other that was in the
Courte, beſides in his demeanours he was ſo courteous and
gentle, that he gained the good will and likyng, bothe of one
and other, but eſpecially of the Duke hym ſelf, who alowed
hym ſuche large expenſes, whereby to maintaine hymſelf as
braue as the beſt.</p>
               <p>Now this noble Duke hauyng no other children but one
onely daughter, whoſe name was <hi>Valeria,</hi> in whom it ſeemed
that bothe Vertue and Beautie had heelde ſome greate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
who ſhould beare awaie the priſe, for although that
in beautie and good grace ſhe exceeded euery other Dame
yet her vertues and good conditions ſurmounted more he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:9"/>
This Ladie now hauyng heard greate reporte of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
of <hi>Siluanus,</hi> who was ſuſpected to be but ſome poore
mans ſonne, by reaſon he was founde in the Woodes, began
yet to beare hym very good countenaunce, whiche at the firſt
proceeded but of the noble Nature, whiche euer was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be fauourable to ſuche, in whom was founde any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
deſarte: but as the fiſhe whiche by little and little ſucketh
vppon the baite, till at the length ſhe ſwalloweth doune the
hooke, wherby ſhe hangeth faſt, not able to free her ſelf, ſo this
Lady <hi>Valerya,</hi> contemplating her ſelf many tymes to behold
that young Gentleman <hi>Siluanus,</hi> was ſo farre intangled with
his ſweete and pleaſaunt, countenaunce, that now perforce
her will, ſhe was conſtrained to yeelde to Loue, and feelyng
her ſelf inſnared, and bereued of former freedome, beeyng by
her ſelf alone, ſhe began to complaine as followeth.</p>
               <p>Alas (ſaieth ſhe) is it poſſible, that now force perforce my
mynde ſhould bee ſo altered, that ſtraiyng from the boundes
and limites of vowed Chaſtitie: I ſhould now become amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and ſubiect to a certaine vnacquainted luſt, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
commeth this alteration? or how happeneth this vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
hewe? ah Loue Loue, how haſt thou tormented me, and
taken awaie the healthe and ſoundneſſe of my mynde, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
me to ſhewe my ſelf, as iſſued forthe of the noble houſe of
<hi>Vaſconya,</hi> and with the greater care I ought to take heede,
how I degenerate from the noble bloud whereof I am deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
rather then to ſette my mynde on a fondlyng vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
vnto whom peraduenture if I diſcouer my fondneſſe,
will not let to mocke me for my labour, and for all the beautie
or nobleneſſe of my birthe, will make me his ieſtyng ſtocke,
and ſolace hymſelf with the fondneſſe of my conceiptes. But
ſtaie ſtaie vnhappie tongue, that thundereth forthe ſuche hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wordes againſt my beloued <hi>Siluanus.</hi> Oh thriſe accurſed
wenche that can ſo vngently conceiue againſt hym, that in all
his demeanours, doeth ſhewe hymſelf as noble as the beſt, but
of what mettall are either Monarche, Kyng or Keiſer framed
of, otherwiſe then of naturall, and common earth, whereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men doe come? Or what maketh theſe differences, which
<pb facs="tcp:7038:9"/>
by ſottiſhe opinion we conceiue, either of gentle or vngentle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
otherwiſe then the ſhew of vertue and good conditions. Then
the partie whom I loue, is bothe vertuous, valiaunt, ſage, of
good grace, learned and wiſe. Vaunt thee then <hi>Valeria,</hi> that
thou likeſt no inferiour fondlyng, vnworthie of thy loue, but a
worthie Gentleman, indued with noble qualities, in whom
bothe Heauen and Nature haue forgotten nothyng, to make
hym equall to them that marche in formoſt ranke: It is <hi>Silua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
whom I loue, and of hym I pretende to make a lawfull
houſband, for otherwiſe I deteſt to lead the filthie life of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
luſt, but thus the bonde of Mariage beyng made, I maie
loue and liue without offence of conſcience, neither ſhall I do
any blot or blemiſhe to the greatneſſe of my houſe. But if any
bee ſo ſcrupulous, as to thinke by marriyng of hym, I ſhould
deminiſhe myne honour: It is the thyng that I doe leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme,
for what is honour worthe, where the mynde is voyde
of contentation, and where the harte is bereued of his cheefeſt
deſire, the bodie remaineth reſtleſſe, and the mynde is neuer in
quiet. <hi>Siluanus</hi> therefore ſhall be my loyall houſbande, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
thereby neither to offende God nor man.</p>
               <p>And now from hence forwardes, ſhe deuiſed with her ſelf,
how to make her loue knowne to <hi>Siluanus,</hi> not ſparyng when
ſhe was out of his preſence, before all men to praiſe his greate
perfections, wherewith he was enriched, and in his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſhe vſed ſuche louyng countenaunce towardes him, that
although <hi>Siluanus</hi> were but yong, and had neuer been trained
vp in the Schoole of Loue, yet he perceiued very well, that
thoſe frendly glances were lent him of good liking, and thoſe
louing countenaunces were grounded of good will, and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
he ſawe the inequalitie and difference betweene them both,
ſhe beyng ſorted out of royall race, and hymſelf altogether i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant
of his owne eſtate, and from whence he was ſprong,
yet beeyng now ledde by Loue, whoſe lawes haue no reſpect
either to eſtate or dignitie, he determined to followe his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and to ſerue her, whiche ſo louyngly ſhewed her ſelf, to
requite hym with the like, and the more he called to mynde
the diuine beautie of his Ladie, her graces, wiſedome, behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:10"/>
and curteſie, ſo muche the more increaſed his deſire, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng
hymſelf againſt all miſhappes, and perilles that might
ſucceede, and began to debate with hymſelf in this maner.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible that I ſhould be ſo fooliſhe, to deſpiſe a
duetie ſo rare and preciouſe, and to ſet light by that which the
nobleſt would purſue, with all reuerence and indeuour, I am
not the firſt, that hath obtained the loue of a Ladie: no no, I
ſee ſhe loueth me, and ſhall not I requite it by yeeldyng loue
againe, if I were ſo voyde of humanitie and good nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
I might worke myne owne ouerthrowe, in ſeemyng to
diſpiſe ſo noble a Ladie, ſo the Goddes would not let to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
reuenge, as thei did vpon <hi>Narciſſus.</hi> But ah ſillie wretche
that I am, what follie is this that I haue now premeditated,
with the perill of myne honour, and the hazarde of my life: ſee
ſee how farre my affections begin to ſtraie, through the hot
aſſaultes of fooliſhe fantaſie, inraged with an appetite riſing
on vaine hope, what madneſſe on me to thinke that <hi>Valerya</hi>
will ſo muche forget the greatneſſe of her houſe, or yet unbaſe
her ſelf in reſpect of me poore ſillie ſoule: but what if ſhe
would be contented, either in reſpect of mariage or otherwiſe
in reſpect of good will, to ſurrender her ſelf to ſatiſfie my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
how muche were I the neare my purpoſe, alas nothyng
at al, the firſt, I knowe ſhould be denaide me by the Duke her
father, and as for any other curteſie, although I knowe it bee
farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her thought, yet ſurely myne owne conſcience would
not ſuffer me, to proffer ſo greate villanie to ſo noble a Ladie,
neither the reuerence and duetie whiche I owe to her father
would permit me, to requite his gentilneſſe towards me with
ſo greate an iniurie. Ceaſe therefore <hi>Siluanus,</hi> ſubdue thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualitie,
that by vanquiſhyng thy ſelf, thou maieſt ſet open the
gate to Fame, who with her Trompe of euerlaſtyng glorie,
ſhe maie aduaunce thee renowmed to all poſteritie.</p>
               <p>But alas, ſhall I then giue ouer to loue my Ladie <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rya,</hi>
reaſon willes me ſo to doe, but loue hath ſo blinded al my
ſences, that reaſon giueth no maner of light, what helpe haue

be content. Herewithall he ſtaied his trauaile, reſoluyng

perceiuyng by his chaunge of colour, the fault proceeded of
vehement loue, takyng hym aſide into a windowe, Loue had

is modeſtie that commaundeth me, and honeſtie is the guide

this tyme I haue delaied to open, I beſeeche you Madame,
impute it to the greatneſſe of your eſtate, and to the duetie of
my callyng, but now for as muche as by your owne motion,
grace, courteſie, and greate liberalitie the ſame is profered,
and that of your owne bountie, it pleaſeth you to accept me
for yours: I humbly beſeeche you, not to diſpoſe of me as of a
houſbande, but as of one whiche both is, and ſhall be your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
for euer. Thus ſaied, he takyng her by the hande, kiſſed
it with greate deuotion, his tongue and wittes were ſo rapt
and tied, as the Ladie perfectly perceiued this alteration, and
ſeyng it to proceede of loue, replied on this maner.</p>
               <p>Then my <hi>Siluanus,</hi> there needeth at this preſent no farther
circumſtaunce, but for that I am well aſſured, there are ſome
that will be offended with my choice, but eſpecially the Duke
my father, who will conceiue ſome great diſpleaſure againſt

vntill it pleaſe God to appoint the tyme, that the reſt of
our determinations, maie without daunger bee conſummate

me, is founded vpon vertue, and to be concluded by Mariage,
receiue me for your Spouſe and lawfull wife, you ſhall haue

deuiſed with <hi>Siiuanus</hi> to conueigh her ſelf awaie, contented
rather to liue in the fellowſhip of an honeſt louing houſband,
with whom ſhe ſhould hold faithful and loyal companie, with
what eſtate and Fortune ſo euer it might pleaſe GOD to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincte,
then to liue without hym, beautified with the graces
and fooliſhe names of honour and preheminence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluanus,</hi> contented to ſatiſfie her deſire, with the hazarde

were expired, ſo cleanely conueighed hym ſelf and <hi>Valeria</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie,
that when thei were miſſyng, the Duke wiſt not which

daie was appoincted, where the poore Belringer takyng the
vewe of this newe maried couple, fell in a great likyng of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanus,</hi>
not for that he knewe him to be his ſonne, for thereof he
could haue no maner of ſuſpition, aſwell for that he deemed
he had been deuoured in the Woodes, by ſome wilde beaſt, as
alſo becauſe his name was chaunged, but whether it were by
the inſtigation or ſecreſie of Nature, or otherwiſe by the will
and pleaſure of God, to bring to paſſe that, which afterwards
happened in effect, this poore Sexten I ſay, lead by the ſecret
motion of his owne affections, proffered <hi>Siluanus</hi> that if his
ſeruice might any waies ſtande hym in ſteede (for that he was
a ſtraunger in the place) he ſhould vſe hym in any reſpect, and
ſhould finde hym readie to ſtande hym in ſuche ſteade, as his
poore abilitie might any waies permit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluanus</hi> in like caſe hauing forgotten his Father, beeing
ſeparated from hym in his infancie, yet nothyng deſpiſing his
freendly offer, craued his helpe for the hieryng of a Chamber,
for ſome reaſonable rent, till tyme that he might better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for hymſelf. The Sexten very glad that he had ſo good
oportunitie to pleaſure him, brought him with his wife to his
owne houſe, where he lodged hym in the beſt roome that he
had, profferyng not onely his houſe, but all that was in it to be
at their diſpoſition and pleaſure. This newe Married couple
now gladdyng and ſporting themſelues, with all ſuch ſweete
imbracementes, as thei can better deſcribe, whiche haue been
poſſeſſed with the like delightes: but as ſome wil ſaie, it is the
mans parte to bee firſt wearied in thoſe Venerall ſportes, ſo
<hi>Siluanus</hi> hauyng now well feaſted hymſelf, with that ſweete
repaſte, had leiſure to bethinke hym of his owne eſtate: began
inwardly to growe into great ſorrowe and heauineſſe, not ſo
muche for hymſelf, as for his wife, who for his ſake had diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
her ſelf from ſo greate honour, abandonyng her freendes,
contented to yeeld her ſelf a thrall to Fortune.</p>
               <p>Theſe cogitations did ſo nippe hym, that he could not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:7038:15"/>
well diſſemble his greef, but that his wife perceiued ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe
in his mynde, and therefore very greeuouſly ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of hym, to ſhew her the cauſe of his diſcontentment,
whiche by outward appearaunce, ſeemed inwardly ſo muche
to moleſt hym.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluanus</hi> hearyng his Ladies requeſt, aunſwered in this
wiſe, my deare wife, the ſweeteſt companion that euer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did
poſſeſſe, for ſo muche as you ſo earneſtly deſire to vnderſtand,
what it is that ſo much withdraweth my delightes, I will not
let to bewraie the truthe, whiche is this, when I conſider with
my ſelf, of your preſent eſtate and condition, who from the tip
and height of dignitie, haue not ſpared for my ſake to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your ſelf, to become a ſubiect to all miſhaps, beſieged on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ſide, with the future aſſaultes of ordinarie Fortune: It
maketh me therefore to haue the greater care, by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
I might endeuour my ſelf, to maintaine &amp; continue your
eſtate, though not according to your worthineſſe and calling,
yet according to your wel contentment and liking. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
conceiuing in my head diuers imaginations, no meanes
but one in my fancie ſeemeth beſt, whiche is, that I goe to the
Court of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> who at this preſent is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a great bande, to encounter the Turke, at whoſe handes
I doubt not, but to receiue ſome good entertainment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the honour and reputation, I maie gaine by good deſert,
I maie likewiſe reape ſuche liuyng and good likyng of the
Emperour, that in deſpight of Fortunes teeth, wee maie liue
hereafter a quiet and honourable life, to our greate ioye and

more then ſatiſfied of all that is paſt, by the onely enioiyng of
your preſence, contentyng my ſelf to bee a partaker of your
miſfortunes, and haue no doubt but that I can ſo moderat my
affections, that duryng my life, I will reſt better contented
with that which your abilitie wil permit be it neuer ſo meane,
then otherwiſe to be honoured with names and titles of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie

not your ſelf therefore, but perſeuer in your determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that ſorowe whiche ſhall aſſaile me by reaſon of your

of your valiant factes ſhal beguile my penſiue thoughtes,
hoping that our next meetyng ſhall be more ioyfull and glad,
then this our partyng ſhall be either heauie or ſad.</p>
               <p>The Ladies aunſwere did wonderfully quiet the mynd of
<hi>Siluanus,</hi> and callyng his Hoſte the Sexten vnto hym, whom
he had made partaker of his determinations, he departed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
his wife ſuche money and Iewelles as thei had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng:
And commyng to the Courte of the Emperour <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
he was very well entertained, and the rather for that the
Emperour had greate neede of men to ſupplie his Armie,
whiche had ſuſtained ſondrie conflictes, and diuers ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
for the Turke did wonderfully incroche vpon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and had taken ſondrie Cities, Tounes, and Caſtelles
from hym, and was like ſtill euery daie more to preuaile then
other, that now the Emperour beganne to repent him, of the
ſlender accoumpte he had made of Souldiours in the tyme of
peace, for that he had too few that were ſufficient to ſerue him
in his Warres: For in ſteede of Experience, Valiaunce, and
Policie (whiche three ought to be gouernours, commaunders
and cheef officers in a Campe) he was glad to preferre Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie,
Fooliſhhardineſſe, and Raſhneſſe: Simple ſottes that
were more fitter to waite in Gentlewomans chambers, then
to be made Captaines, or leaders in the Warres.</p>
               <p>The Emperour now ſtandyng in greate diſtreſſe for want
of men, for thoſe that he had made greateſt accompt of in the
<pb facs="tcp:7038:16"/>
tyme of peace, were now able to ſtande him in no ſteede in the
tyme of warres: and thoſe that had braued it vp and doune the
Courte in the newe cuttes, ſtraunge faſhions, their haire fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

lookyng with ſuche griſly and terrible countenaunces,
enough to make a wiſeman beleeue thei were cleane out of
their wittes, now in the tyme of Warres, were glad to runne
vnder a Gentlewomans Farthyng all to hide them.</p>
               <p>The Emperour (I ſaie) beeyng thus perplexed, called to
his remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the iniurie that he had doen <hi>Sappho,</hi> whom
he had baniſhed onely to ſatiſfie the willes of thoſe that were
about him, whiche he knewe did hate him more of ſpight, then
for any occaſion the Duke had giuen. Without any farther
delaie therefore, the Emperour ſent ſondrie meſſengers into
euery parte of Chriſtendome to make inquirie, that who ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
could finde the Duke, ſhould bee worthily recompenced,
and thoſe Proclamations were ſpread through euery Region,
in Citie, Towne, and Village. In ſo muche that in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe
where the Duke remained Sexten (as you haue heard)
the Prieſt made inquirie on Sondaie in the Churche, as the
cuſtome is) that where as about fourteene or fifteene yeres ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence,
the Duke of <hi>Mantona</hi> was baniſhed by the Emperor,
whiche was procured rather by enuie, then for any deſerte, as
now it was proued, who ſo euer therfore could giue any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the ſame Duke, ſhould be very liberally recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Emperour.</p>
               <p>The Sexten now hearyng theſe newes, did thinke it more
better to liue ſtill in his Sextens roome, where he remained
without enuie, then to become againe the Duke of <hi>Mantona,</hi>
ſubiecte to the ſpite of hatefull perſones. But callyng to his
mynde his wife and daughter, which he thought remained yet
aliue (although he knewe not where) and for the greate loue
that he bare to <hi>Siluanus,</hi> whoſe wife remained in his houſe (as
you heard) ſeyng that Fortune offered him ſo good oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to pleaſure them, onely for their ſakes, reſolued hymſelf to
goe to the Emperour. But firſt comfortyng his geſt <hi>Valerya,</hi>
whom for a time he ſhould leaue in his houſe, onely with ſuche
ſeruauntes as her ſelf had about her: he tolde her that he was
<pb facs="tcp:7038:16"/>
well aſſured where to finde this Duke, that was ſo muche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after, and that he doubted not, (if it were but in reſpect
of his good newes) he ſhould worke <hi>Siluanus,</hi> her houſbande
into ſome credite with the Duke, who might likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his better preferment with the Emperour.</p>
               <p>And thus the Sexten departed, and with all conuenience
came to the Courte of the Emperour, to whom when he had
made hymſelf knowne, he was moſt honourably receiued and
greate ioye and gladneſſe was made throughout the whole
Court: the Emperour now in conſideration of the iniurie he
had doen hym, did not onely reſtore hym to his former roome
and dignitie, but alſo aduaunced hym in honour and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be preferred before all other next vnto hymſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus after many benefites receiued of the Emperour, the
Duke prepared hymſelf, accompanied with many his freen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
to goe to the Emperours Campe, of the whiche he was
made Generall, where he knewe well how to behaue hymſelf,
and giuyng out new ordinaunces, he appointed certaine ſuch
as he hymſelf knewe worthie, and gaue them charge, amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
the reſt, ſeeyng <hi>Siluanus</hi> who all this while remained in
the Campe, whom the Duke did very well knowe, although
<hi>Siluanus,</hi> did little ſuſpecte that a poore Sexten of a Pariſhe,
ſhould become a Generall to an Emperours Armie. The
Duke perceiuyng hymſelf to be vnknowne to <hi>Siluanus,</hi> was
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented ſo to remaine for a tyme, but yet deſirous to ſée what
was in hym, he gaue hym the leadyng of certaine Horſemen,
with the whiche <hi>Siluanus</hi> ſerued ſo valiauntly, and there with
all had ſo happie ſucceſſe, that euery man extolled vp to the
heauens, the worthineſſe of <hi>Siluanus.</hi> This pleaſed the Duke
paſſyng well, and the Duke hauyng now ſondrie tymes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with the power of the Turkes, and had giuen them
many ouerthrowes, he was now preparyng a greate force,
for the recouerie of the Citie of <hi>Cayoe,</hi> the whiche the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
had taken before from the Emperour. And callyng <hi>Silua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
vnto hym, he ſaied: God graunt yong Gentleman, that
your ende agree with your good beginnyng, then makyng
<hi>Siluanus</hi> to kneele he dubbed hym knight, and made hym <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:17"/>
of twentie Enſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluanus</hi> after he had dooen his reuerence, thanked the
Duke of the honour and fauour, whiche it had pleaſed hym to
dooe hym, promiſyng to dooe ſo well in tyme to come, as he
ſhould not bee deceiued in his conceiued opinion, whereof he
gaue aſſured teſtimonie at the aſſaulte that was giuen to the
Citie before mentioned, where he behaued hymſelf ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he was the firſt that mounted vppon the walles, and by
his dexteritie and inuincible force, made waie to the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in the breach, whereby thei entered and tooke the Citie,
killyng and driuyng out their enemies before them. In many
ſuche like attemptes <hi>Siluanus</hi> ſtill ſhewed hym ſelf ſo noble
and valiaunt, that his praiſe and renowne was ſounded in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
place.</p>
               <p>The Duke now hauing recouered againe al ſuche Cities,
Townes, and other Fortes, whiche the Turke had before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Emperour, and there with all had baniſhed the
Turkes from out the boundes, and borders of the Empire,
and a League agreed vppon betweene the Emperour and the
Turke. The Armie beeyng broken vp, and Souldiours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charched,
euery man well recompenſed for his ſeruice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
as he had deſerued. <hi>Siluanus</hi> likewiſe, who by his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
hauing not onely made himſelf famous to the world,
but alſo had well lined his purſe with good ſtore of golde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkyng
hym now of his faire Ladie, came to the Duke to
haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his leaue, but the Duke mindyng now to performe
the good that he ment to <hi>Siluanus,</hi> was reſolued in his mynd,
that <hi>Siluanus</hi> with his wife ſhould bee his geſtes, as well at
<hi>Mantona</hi> where he was Duke, as thei had been before, where
he was but a Sexten, ſaied to <hi>Siluanus</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, what haſt is this, that you would ſo ſodainly
withdrawe your ſelf from out my companie, belike you haue
ſome faire wife, to whom you make ſuche ſpeede to bee gone,
but ſir content your ſelf to beare me companie to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Courte, where I doubte not but you ſhall receiue ſome
better recompence for your ſeruice ſo happely begunne, for it
is not requiſite, but that the vertue of valiaunce, ought to bee
<pb facs="tcp:7038:17"/>
rewarded and cheriſhed by Princes, that bee aided in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
with the diligence of ſuche vertuous and noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
as your ſelf. <hi>Siluanus</hi> greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted with theſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>des
of the Duke, was well pleaſed to waite vpon hym. Thus
thei tooke their iourney towardes the greate Citie of <hi>Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
whiche was in the vttermoſte borders of the Emperours
Dominions, there the Duke purpoſed to ſtaie a while, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
hymſelf with the reſt of his companie.</p>
               <p>Now it fortuned that the valiaunt actes, and hautie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
of <hi>Siluanus</hi> were ſo renowmed and ſpread, that the fame
therefore came to the eares of the Duke of <hi>Vaſconya,</hi> that
was father to <hi>Valerya</hi> the wife of <hi>Siluanus,</hi> who with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſpeede made ſuche haſte, that he came to <hi>Cherona,</hi> where
he found <hi>Siluanus</hi> in the companie of the Duke of <hi>Mantona,</hi>
to whom turnyng hymſelf, he ſaied as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sir Duke, the onely hope that I haue, that you will not
let to extende Iuſtice vpon the miſcheeuous and vngracious
actes of wicked men, doeth let me at this inſtaunt to forbeare
with myne owne handes, to auenge the wrong that I aſſure
my ſelf, to haue receiued of this Traitour <hi>Siluanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The companie were wonderfully abaſhed with theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
but eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Mantona,</hi> who loued <hi>Silua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
more dearely then any other.</p>
               <p>But the other goyng ſtill forwardes in his tale ſaied, if the
harte breake that afflicteth the ſoule of a wofull father, whoſe
houſe is made deſolate by looſyng his childe, by the miſchee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
inticementes of a Theefe, if this preſident I ſaie, moue
you not to miniſter ſuche ſpeedie reuenge, as the Lawe doeth
preſcribe, I ſuppoſe that all impunitie of vice and ſinne hath
place on your behalf. And there withall ſtaiyng his talke, but
yet by his geſture and countenaunce ſo inraged, that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
like a man that were beſides hymſelf.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantona</hi> now perceiuyng the matter, that
<hi>Valerya</hi> was the daughter of the Duke of <hi>Vaſconia,</hi> whom
he ſuppoſed to haue been of ſome meane birth and parentage,
was wonderfully ſorie for <hi>Siluanus,</hi> whoſe fact by the Lawe
deſerued death, and ſeyng the Duke in ſuche a furie, he wiſte
<pb facs="tcp:7038:18"/>
not by what meanes to worke <hi>Siluanus</hi> ſafetie, for to intreate
the Duke he thought it but vaine, and to bryng <hi>Siluanus</hi> to
aunſwere the fact, he knewe the Lawe would condemne him,
and therefore knowyng where <hi>Valeria</hi> did remaine, whom
he knewe did loue <hi>Siluanus</hi> as her owne life, and thinkyng
that her teares might lenifie and ſoften the hardened harte of
the Duke her father. He therefore priuely ſent for her, to bee
brought immediatly to the Citie of <hi>Cherona,</hi> in the meane
tyme he committed <hi>Siluanus</hi> into ſafe cuſtodie, and deſired
the Duke at his requeſt to ſtaie himſelf a while, and he ſhould
haue ſuche Iuſtice on <hi>Siluanus,</hi> as hymſelf would require.</p>
               <p>Matters beeyng thus pacified for a while, I will in like
caſe let them reſt for a time, and will now diſcourſe how it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell
to the Ducheſſe <hi>Meſſilina,</hi> with her daughter <hi>Phylene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You haue heard before how by conſtraint of weather at the
Sea, thei were driuen to this Citie of <hi>Cherona,</hi> where the
Duke now remained, and at her firſt comming, fallyng to her
woorke as before ſhe had doen at <hi>Taryffa,</hi> a riche Marchaunt
that dwelt in the Towne, takyng the vewe of this new come
workewoman, fell into ſo great a likyng with her, that onely
to haue acceſſe to come into her companie, he beſtowed more
money in cloath to make hym Shirtes and Handcarchifes in
one weeke, then he was able to weare out in three yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whiche he put to her to make, whereby he became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
well acquainted with her, but to the ende that ſhe might
thinke her ſelf ſomethyng the better beholdyng vnto hym, he
proffered her a more conuenient houſe then that ſhe was in,
whiche he would furniſhe with all maner of houſholde ſtuffe
for a reaſonable rent. She beeyng very glad of ſo good an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
became his Tenaunt. The Marchaunt now perceiuyng
his tyme did ſo well ſerue hym, without any greate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce,
declared vnto her the great good will he bare her, but
<hi>Meſſilina</hi> ſo delaied hym with ſuche wiſe and reaſonable aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
that from tyme to tyme the Marchaunt hymſelf could
not importunatly craue that whiche with ſuche modeſtie, ſhe
ſo honeſtly denaied hym.</p>
               <p>Now there laie in this Citie of <hi>Cherona,</hi> the old Dutches
<pb facs="tcp:7038:18"/>
of <hi>Petrona,</hi> who hauing inteligence of <hi>Meſſilina</hi> to be ſo good
a workewoman, ſhe ſent for her, to whom ſhe put ſondrie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles
of worke, whiche ſhe ſo well finiſhed to the liking of the
Dutches, that from tyme to tyme ſhe ſtill plide her with the
like, whereby <hi>Meſſilina,</hi> with her daughter <hi>Phylene,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
recourſe to the Pallas of the Dutches, where <hi>Arabia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
the onely ſonne of the Dutches of <hi>Petrona,</hi> (and inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the Dukedome, but that he was vnder age) did marke
and beholde the beautie and good grace of this yong Seame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Phylene,</hi> was ſo clogged and fettered in the bandes of
loue, that all other thoughtes ſeemed lothſome vnto hym, and
euery other ioye diſpleaſaunt, in reſpect of the pleaſure that
he ſuffered, by thinkyng of his faire <hi>Phylene,</hi> wherefore bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
himſelf with hope, and tickled onely by loue, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
what ſoeuer happened to loue her.</p>
               <p>Whiche beeyng perceiued by his Mother, ſhe began very
ſharpely to rate hym, blamyng hym that would ſo indiſcretly
place his loue, not waiyng his eſtate and birthe, as come of
Princely race, and now would make hym ſelf a fable to the
worlde, to like of ſuche a one ſo farre vnworthie his degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabianus</hi> fallyng doune vppon his knees, moſte humbly
deſired his Mother to beare with all that was paſte, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it were truth that ſhe had ſaied, that he deemed her for
her birthe to bee vnworthie his degree, yet ſhe deſerued for her
beautie to bee compared to the greateſt Dame, and braueſt
Minion els where. And whereas other girles by artificiall
meanes and trumperies, doe inforce that whiche the heauens
haue denaied them, yet <hi>Phylene</hi> had no other ornament then
that whiche Nature had inlarged in her: and otherwiſe for her
vertue, wiſedome, and modeſtie, he knewe it to be ſuche by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
of many, as ſhe might bee a Lanterne to the greateſt
Dame that liued.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtandyng Madame, for ſo muche as you doe take
my facte in ſo ill parte, conſideryng the reuerence, that I owe
to the place whiche you holde on my behalfe, and the duetie
and obedience that God will and hath commaunded, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhould beare to thoſe that haue begotten and borne them:
<pb facs="tcp:7038:19"/>
if it pleaſe you to pardon me of this that is paſt, I proteſt that
from henceforth, I will be more wiſe and better aduiſed, how
I enter into any thyng that might turne to any ſuche conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
or any maner of waies to offende you.</p>
               <p>The Dutches knowyng all to bee true that her ſonne had
ſaied, very well pleaſed with his ſpeeches, remained ſatiſfied,
thinkyng in her mynde in deede, that if <hi>Phylene</hi> had bin the
Daughter but of ſome meane Gentleman, her ſonne ſhould
neuer haue ſought farther for a wife.</p>
               <p>From this tyme forwards, although <hi>Arabianus</hi> by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of his Mother, had vowed to reuolt and let ſlippe the
loue that he bare to <hi>Phylene,</hi> yet he could not ſo clearely looſe
his likyng, but that he did manifeſt ſome part of his good wil,
by giftes and good countenaunces whiche ſtill he beſtowed
vpon <hi>Phylene,</hi> cauſing his Mother likewiſe to beſtowe many
liberall rewardes vppon <hi>Meſſilina,</hi> thus the Mother and the
Daughter perceiued them ſelues a thouſande tymes behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to the olde Dutches and her ſonne.</p>
               <p>In this meane ſpace the Marchaunt before mentioned had
buried his wife, and knowyng no other but that <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſilina</hi> his
Tenaunt had been a widowe, he began now a freſhe ſute, and
with greate importunitie requeſted her in the waie of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and ſo hardly he laied vnto her, that <hi>Meſſilina</hi> not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
otherwiſe how to rid hym, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>feſſed vnto hym that ſhe
had a houſbande aliue and therefore might not marie.</p>
               <p>The Marchaunt thinkyng theſe to be but delaies to ſhift
hym of, came to this point, that if hereafter he could proue her
by her owne confeſſion to bee a widowe, that then before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhe would take hym for her lawfull houſbande, and till
that tyme he would no farther trouble her till he had made his
proofe, ſhe beeyng glad to bee at reſt, thinkyng that he ſhould
woorke very wiſely to make her confeſſe her ſelf to bee a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
agreed to his requeſt, and witneſſe was had in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Marchaunt now lettyng his matter reſt a tyme for
his better purpoſe, in the ende comming vnto her, he told her,
that although ſhe were ſo diſcourteous to forſake his freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
in euery reſpect, firſt in the waie of good fellowſhippe,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:19"/>
and after in the waie of Marriage, whereby he was driuen to
goe ſeeke farther, but now hauyng found a wife in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to whom he was aſſured, and ment preſently to bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
yet for the old freendſhippe that he bare her, conſideryng
that he would preſently remaine in the Countrie altogether,
and forſake the Citie, therefore for her better ſecuritie, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce
of her dwellyng, he would make her a Leaſe of the
houſe that ſhe dwelt in, for one and twentie yeres, if it might
doe her any pleaſure, without paiyng any penie Income.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meſſilina</hi> giuyng hym greate thankes, tooke his offer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
courteouſly, and the Leaſe was put to making, whiche the
Marchaunt ſigned and deliuered, and herewithall deſired her
ſingle Obligation, for the performaunce of ſome ſmall rente,
were it neuer ſo little, that ſhe might acknowledge hym to be
her Landlorde, the whiche ſhe neuer denaied to giue.</p>
               <p>The Obligation was made in this maner, Knowe all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by theſe preſentes, that I <hi>Meſſilina</hi> Widowe, and ſo forthe,
with wordes in maner and forme of euery Obligation. This
Obligation thus made, was ſigned and deliuered by <hi>Meſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>
to the Marchaunte, who had now gotten that ſo long he
had ſought for, and by vertue of this Obligation, craued <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilina</hi>
to bee his wife, ſhe denaiyng his demaunde, but what
could that preuaile, when he had her owne hande and ſeale to
ſhewe, whereby ſhe confeſſed her ſelf a Widowe, and then by
her owne agrement (as you haue heard before) ſhe muſt yeeld
her ſelf to be his wife.</p>
               <p>This matter was long in fendyng &amp; prouyng, in ſo muche
that the Duke beyng now in the Toune, miniſteryng of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to ſuche as would craue it, the Marchaunte brought the
matter before the Duke, who hearyng the maner of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ſo many witneſſes to affirme the ſame, gaue Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that the Marchaunte ought in deede to haue her. But
<hi>Meſsilina</hi> fallyng at the feete of the Duke, deſiring him with
teares to deferre his Iudgement: the Duke now takyng bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vewe of the woman, knowyng her bothe by her voice, and
alſo by lookyng well on her face, perceiued aſſuredlie that it
was his owne wife, he called againe to the Marchaunt to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:7038:20"/>
obligation, whiche whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had receiued, he ſaid in this maner.</p>
               <p>Maiſter Marchaunt, this obligation whiche you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
me, now I haue peruſed with better aduiſe, I finde it
to bee neither ſufficient nor lawfull, for this woman that you
would make a Widowe, without doubt is Married, and hath
a houſebande, now ſhe beeyng vnder couert barne, you Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is vnpleadable, and I knowe not whom you ſhould
blame, whether your ſelf, or the Scriuener. And here withall
beyng replete with great ioye and gladneſſe, taking his wife
vp in his armes, verie louinglie imbraced her, he ſaied.</p>
               <p>Ah my deare and louing Wife, how muche am I bounde,
to render innumerable thankes to the almightie GOD, that
when all hope was paſte, haue yet againe recouered my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
hope and comfort. <hi>Meſsilina</hi> likewiſe perceiuyng her lord
and houſebande, claſping her handes aboute his necke, was
not able to ſpeake a woorde for ioye and contentation: The
companie that ſtoode by, amazed to ſee this ſodaine happe,
were likewiſe verie ioyfull to ſee this freendly meeting. The
Marchaunt ſeeyng how he had been deceiued, tare his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and departed all aſhamed. The Duke now deſirous
to ſee his Daughter <hi>Philene,</hi> cauſed her Mother to ſende for
her, who not knowyng her Father, otherwiſe then by report,
fell doune on her knees to craue his bleſſyng: The Duke ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her vp, kiſſing her with Fatherlie affectiou, could not
ſtay his teares, in remembring her brother <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> whom
he deemed to be dedde.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes were ſodainly ſpred throughout the Citie of
<hi>Cherona,</hi> in ſo muche that <hi>Arabianus</hi> hauyng now intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
that <hi>Philene</hi> was the daughter of the noble Duke <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,</hi>
certifiyng his Mother the truthe whiche he had learned,
without any greate deliberation, bothe the Mother and the
ſonne, comming to viſite the Duke and his companie, where
thei were verie well welcomed, but eſpecially to <hi>Meſsilina,</hi> to
whom the old Duches and her Soonne, bothe had been verie
bountifull: And when a while thei had paſſed the tyme with
pleaſaunt diſcourſes of all that had paſſed, the Duches of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trona</hi>
craued <hi>Philene</hi> in Marriage for her Sonne. The duke
<pb facs="tcp:7038:20"/>
beyng made priuie to the matter, knowyng <hi>Arabianus</hi> to bee
come of greate diſcent, and to bee indued with large and faire
poſſeſſions, ſeyng hym likewiſe to bee a toward yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne,
would not ſtande againſt it, but referred the matter to
his Daughters likyng. <hi>Philene</hi> who had been greatly bound
to the courteſie of the yong Duke, and had receiued many gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and good turnes at his handes, would not do as a nomber
of theſe niſe Dames, that will many tymes make daintie of
that thei would faineſt come by, gaue her free conſent. There
was then no more to dooe, but to prepare for the Marriage,
whiche was preſently ſolemnized with great pompe &amp; glory.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Valeria</hi> (whom as you haue heard before, the duke
had ſent for) was come to <hi>Cherona,</hi> who was priuely lodged
by the Dukes commaundemente, in a priuie place. The daie
now beyng come, that <hi>Siluanus</hi> was brought to his anſwere,
he could not denaie the facte wherewith he was charged, but
that he had ſtolne <hi>Valeria</hi> from her father, by whiche confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Lawe condemned hym to dye. There were many that
knewe the nobleneſſe of <hi>Siluanus,</hi> that began to entreat the
Duke or <hi>Vaſconia</hi> to remitt the facte, but all in vaine, for the
more thei entreated, the more he haſtened to ſee execution.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantona</hi> ſeeyng his greate obſtinacie, did
thinke it hye tyme to finde a remedie for <hi>Siluanus,</hi> if it might
bee, therefore he ſaied, ſir Duke, were it poſſible that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
manne, who is like (ſo farre as I can ſee) to beare the
whole brunte, and yet might bee enticed to this facte by your
Daughters meanes, or at the leaſt, your daughter muſte bee
halfe partner of this fault, and yeelded with her good will to
come awaie, for otherwiſe it had been unpoſſible for hym, to
haue brought her from out your Courte, whiche if it bee true,
if you will needes ſee Iuſtice ſo duely executed in the one, I
can not ſee how your daughter can goe quite, but muſt bee as
well partaker of the puniſhement, as ſhe was in the facte, by
yeeldyng her conſent.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vaſconia</hi> aunſwered, as it is the office and
duetie of euery good Iuſticer, to knowe the valour and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betweene vertue and vice, to the ende that all vertuous
<pb facs="tcp:7038:21"/>
actes maie be honoured, and the contrarie chaſtiſed and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
Otherwiſe he is not worthie the name of a righteous
Iudge, but of a cruell and traiterous Tiraunt, wherefore ſir
Duke, you ſittyng here in the place of Iuſtice, to miniſter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
and right, to euery one that calleth. Then I deſire that
I maie haue the Lawe extended vpon this wretche <hi>Siluanus,</hi>
as for my daughter that you ſpeake of, as I knowe not where
ſhe is, ſo I doe not deſire to learne what is become of her, but
this I proteſt, that if euer I maie finde her, rather then ſhe
ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed, I will not let with mine owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
to do execution vpon her, according to her demerites, and
the filthineſſe of her fact: from henceforthe denouncing her to
be any childe of mine, and make no better accoumpt of her, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then to be a filthie ſtrompet, vnworthie of me her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or to chalenge her deſcent from ſuche a ſtocke.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantona</hi> was now troubled worſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

where the Marriage bed and ioyned Matrimonie, is purſued
with like ſeueritie, as Murther, Thefte, Adultrie. But ſeyng

I moſte humblie beſeeche you, to mitigate your rage, and to

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vaſconia</hi> bending his browes, aunſwered:

No Traitour no, it is not thy life that ſhall appeaſe my furie,
but I will ſo coole the Whoriſhe heate of your Minion, for
whom you ſeeme ſo muche to pleade, that I will make her an
example to all others, for dooyng of an acte ſo deteſtable. But
what abuſe haue thei committed, vnder the title of Marriage,
thinkyng without remorſe of conſcience, by that meanes to
continue their miſcheef, and their promiſe and faithe, that was
made vnder a Buſhe, muſte ſerue for a cloake and Viſarde for
their moſte filthie Whoredome. But what if their Marriage
were concluded, and confirmed by God hymſelf? Is <hi>Siluanus</hi>
a manne worthie to be alied, or mingled with the roiall blood
of the houſe of <hi>Vaſconia,</hi> no, no, I vowe I will neuer take

               <p>
                  <hi>Valeria</hi> now knowyng how matters were ſorted out, and
hearyng this cruell Sentence, pronounced by her Father, fel

               <p>
                  <hi>Valeria</hi> once againe fallyng fruſtrate before her Father,

               <p>But her father no longer able for anger to heare her ſpeak,
crieth out to the Duke, to haſten the execution, the Duke of
<hi>Mantona,</hi> whoſe harte did bleede in his beallie for ſorrowe,
perceiuyng it follie to delaye longer tyme, gaue Sentence of
death, and preſent execution to be made, although he tooke ſo
greate ſorrowe for theim, as if his Daughter <hi>Philene</hi> ſhould
haue borne them companie: but he was not able to help it, the

permitt. And thinking to take his laſte farewell of <hi>Siluanus,</hi>
he ſaied: O <hi>Siluanus,</hi> the glorie and honor of all yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that euer wer, that be now, or ſhalbe hereafter this, whoſe
vertue, valliaunce, and worthie exploites, doe gliſter emongſt

               <p>The reſt of the companie that ſtoode by, hearyng the duke

meruailous greef and ſorowe, in ſo muche that euery one that
durſte ſpeake, cried to the Duke of <hi>Vaſconia</hi> for pardon, and
that he would remitt the offence, and what pitie it were, if he
ſhould ſeeke the death of ſo noble a Gentleman, as <hi>Siluanus</hi>

for a verlet of no reputation, whom he had found in the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

knowyng who was his Father, but by ſeemyng ſome poore
Countrie Cloune, and forgettyng himſelf from whence he
ſprong, neglecting ſo many benefites, which he had beſtowed
vpon hym, would enter into thoſe thinges, ſo farre vnſeemely
and exceading his degree.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantona,</hi> giuing good eare to this tale, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring

who in all thinges ſhewed a trothe as it was: He demaunded
farther, how he knewe his name to be <hi>Siluanus,</hi> or whether he
had any other name, yes (quoth the Duke of <hi>Vaſconia</hi>) his

running haſtely vpon <hi>Siluanus,</hi> imbraſyng him in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
criyng: O my ſonne, my ſonne, and with this ſodain ioy,
the teares trickling doune his cheekes ſo faſte, that he was
not farther able to ſpeake one worde.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vaſconia</hi> muche amazed to ſee this ſight,
but a greate deale more gladde, that <hi>Siluanus</hi> had founde out
ſuche a father, and now nothing at al offended with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters

               <p>

               <p>This <hi>Pontus</hi> that was Lorde and Gouernour of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

aſwell for her beautie as for the nobleneſſe of her birth.
This <hi>Silla</hi> hauing heard of the worthineſſe of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> this
yong Duke, who beſides his beautie and good graces, had a
certaine naturall allurement, that beyng now in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in her fathers Courte, ſhe was ſo ſtrangely attached with
the loue of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> that there was nothing might content
her but his preſence and ſweete ſight, and although ſhe ſawe
no maner of hope, to attaine to that ſhe moſt deſired: knowing
<hi>Apolonius</hi> to be but a geſte, and readie to take the benefite of
the next Winde, and to departe into a ſtraunge Countrey,
whereby ſhe was bereued of all poſſibilitie euer to ſee hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and therefore ſtriued with her ſelf to leaue her fonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:25"/>
but all in vaine it would not be, but like the foule which
is once limed, the more ſhe ſtriueth, the faſter ſhe tieth her ſelf.
So <hi>Silla</hi> was now conſtrained perforce her will to yeelde to
loue, wherefore from tyme to tyme, ſhe vſed ſo greate familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
with hym, as her honour might well permit, and fed him
with ſuche amourous baites, as the modeſtie of a maide could
reaſonably afforde, whiche when ſhe perceiued, did take but
ſmall effect, feelyng her ſelf ſo muche out raged with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie
of her paſſion, by the onely countenaunce that ſhe
beſtowed vpon <hi>Apolonius,</hi> it might haue been well perceiued,
that the very eyes pleaded vnto him for pitie and remorſe. But
<hi>Apolonius</hi> commyng but lately from out the fielde, from the
chaſing of his enemies, and his furie not yet throughly deſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
nor purged from his ſtomacke, gaue no regarde to thoſe

<hi>Silla</hi> his daughter, departed with his companie, and with a

               <p>But <hi>Silla</hi> the further that ſhe ſawe her ſelf bereued of all
hope, euer any more to ſee her beloued <hi>Apolonius,</hi> ſo muche
the more contagious were her paſſions, and made the greater
ſpeede to execute that ſhe had premeditated in her mynde,
whiche was this: Amongeſt many ſeruauntes that did attend
vppon her, there was one whoſe name was <hi>Pedro,</hi> who had a
long tyme waited vpon her in her Chamber, whereby ſhe was
well aſſured of his fidelitie and truſt: to that <hi>Pedro,</hi> therefore
ſhe bewraied firſt the ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of her loue borne to <hi>Apolonius,</hi>
coniuryng hym in the name of the Goddes of Loue her ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:26"/>
and bindyng hym by the duetie that a ſeruaunt ought to haue,
that tendereth his Miſtreſſe ſafetie and good likyng, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiryng
hym with teares tricklyng doune her cheekes, that he
would giue his conſent to aide and aſſiſt her, in that ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
whiche was for that ſhe was fully reſolued to goe
to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where ſhe might againe take the vewe of
her beloued <hi>Apolonius,</hi> that he accordyng to the truſt ſhe had
repoſed in hym, would not refuſe to giue his conſent, ſecretly
to conuaie her from out her fathers Courte, accordyng as ſhe
ſhould giue hym direction, and alſo to make himſelf pertaker
of her iourney, and to waite vpon her, till ſhe had ſeen the end
of her determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pedro</hi> perceiuyng with what vehemencie his Ladie and
Miſtreſſe had made requeſt vnto hym, albeeit he ſawe many
perilles and doubtes, depending in her pretence notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng,
gaue his conſent to be at her diſpoſition, promiſyng her
to further her with his beſt aduice, and to bee readie to obeye
whatſoeuer ſhe would pleaſe to commaunde him. The match
beyng thus agreed vpon, and all thynges prepared in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for their departure: It happened there was a Gallie of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> readie to departe, whiche <hi>Pedro</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
came to the Captaine, deſiryng him to haue paſſage for
hymſelf, and for a poore Maide that was his Siſter, whiche
were bounde to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> vppon certaine vrgent affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
to whiche requeſt, the Captaine graunted, willyng hym
to prepare aborde with all ſpeede, becauſe the Winde ſerued
hym preſently to departe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pedro</hi> now commyng to his Miſtres, and telling her how
he had handeled the matter with the Captaine: ſhe likyng ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well of the deuiſe, diſguiſyng her ſelf into very ſimple at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
ſtole awate from out her fathers Courte, and came with
<hi>Pedro,</hi> whom now ſhe calleth Brother aboorde the Gallie,
where all thinges being in readineſſe, and the winde ſeruyng
very well, thei launched forthe with their Oores, and ſet ſaile,
when thei were at the Sea, the Captaine of the Galleye ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
the vewe of <hi>Silla,</hi> perceiuyng her ſingular beautie, he
was better pleaſed in beholdyng of her face, then in takyng
<pb facs="tcp:7038:26"/>
the height either of the Sunne of Starre, and thinkyng her
by the homelineſſe of her apparell, to be but ſome ſimple mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
callyng her into his Cabin, he beganne to breake with
her after the Sea faſhion, deſiryng her to vſe his owne Cabin
for her better eaſe: and duryng the tyme that ſhe remained at
the Sea, ſhe ſhould not want a bed, and then whiſperyng ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in her eare he ſaied, that for want of a bedfellowe, he hym
ſelf would ſupplie that rome. <hi>Silla</hi> not being acquainted with
any ſuche talke, bluſſhed for ſhame, but made hym no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
at all, my Captaine feelyng ſuche a bickeryng within
himſelf, the like whereof he had neuer indured vpon the Sea:
was like to be taken priſoner aboorde his owne Shippe, and
forced to yeeld hymſelf a captiue without any Cannon ſhott,
wherefore to ſalue all ſores, and thinkyng it the readieſt waie
to ſpeed, he began to breake with <hi>Silla</hi> in the waie of mariage,
telling her how happie a voyage ſhe had made, to fall into the
likyng of ſuche a one as hymſelf was, who was able to keepe
and maintaine her like a Gentlewoman, &amp; for her ſake would
likewiſe take her brother into his fellowſhip, whom he would
by ſome meanes prefarre in ſuche ſorte, that bothe of them
ſhould haue good cauſe to thinke them ſelues thriſe happie,
ſhe to light of ſuche a houſband, and he to light of ſuche a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But <hi>Silla</hi> nothyng pleaſed with theſe prefermentes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
hym to ceaſe his talke, for that ſhe did thinke her ſelf in
deede to be too vnworthie ſuche a one as he was, neither was
ſhe minded yet to marrie, and therefore deſired hym to fixe his
fancie vpon ſome that were better worthie then her ſelf was,
and that could better like of his curteſie then ſhe could do: the
Captaine ſeyng hymſelf thus refuſed, being in a great chafe,
he ſaied as followeth.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeyng you make ſo little accompte of my curteſie,
proffered to one that is ſo farre vnworthie of it, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe
I will vſe the office of my aucthoritie, you ſhall knowe
that I am the Captaine of this Shippe, and haue power to
commaunde and diſpoſe of thinges at my pleaſure, and ſeyng
you haue ſo ſcornfully reiected me to be your loiall houſband,
I will now take you by force, and vſe you at my will, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:7038:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
long as it ſhall pleaſe me, will keepe you for mine owne ſtore,
there ſhall be no man able to defende you, nor yet to perſwade
me from that I haue determined. <hi>Silla</hi> with theſe wordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
ſtroke into a greate feare, did thinke it now too late, to
rewe her raſhe attempte, determined rather to dye with her
owne handes, then to ſuffer her ſelf to be abuſed in ſuche ſorte,
therefore ſhe moſte humbly deſired the Captaine ſo muche as
he could to ſaue her credite, and ſeyng that ſhe muſt needes be
at his will and diſpoſition, that for that preſent he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and ſuffer her till night, when in the darke he might take
his pleaſure, without any maner of ſuſpition to the reſidue of
his companie. The Captaine thinkyng now the goole to bee
more then halfe wonne, was contented ſo farre to ſatiſfie her
requeſt, and departed out leauyng her alone in his Cabin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silla,</hi> beeyng alone by her ſelf, drue out her knife readie to
ſtrike her ſelf to the harte, and fallyng vpon her knees, deſired
God to receiue her ſoule, as an acceptable ſacrifice for her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
whiche ſhe had ſo wilfully committed, crauyng pardon
for her ſinnes, and ſo forthe continuyng a long and pitifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
to GOD, in the middeſt whereof there ſodainly
fell a wonderfull ſtorme the terrour whereof was ſuche, that
there was no man but did thinke the Seas would preſently
haue ſwallowed them, the Billowes ſo ſodainly aroſe with
the rage of the winde, that thei were al glad to fall to heauing
out of water, for otherwiſe their feeble Gallie had neuer bin
able to haue brooked the Seas, this ſtorme continued all that
daie and the next night, and thei beeyng driuen to put romer
before the winde to keepe the Gallie ahed the Billowe, were
driuen vppon the maine Shore, where the Gallie brake all is
peeces, there was euery man prouiding to ſaue his owne life,
ſome gate vpon Hatches, Boordes, and Caſks, and were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with the waues to and fro, but the greateſt nomber were
drouned, amongeſt the whiche <hi>Pedro</hi> was one, but <hi>Silla</hi> her
ſelf beeyng in the Cabin as you haue heard, tooke holde of a
Cheſt that was the Captaines, the whiche by the onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of GOD brought her ſafe to the Shore, the whiche
when ſhe had recouered, not knowyng that was become of
<pb facs="tcp:7038:27"/>
                  <hi>Pedro</hi> her man, ſhe deemed that bothe he and all the reſt had
been drouned, for that ſhe ſawe no bodie vppon the Shore but
her ſelf, wherefore, when ſhe had a while made greate lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
complainyng her miſhappes, ſhe beganne in the ende
to comforte her ſelf with the hope, that ſhe had to ſee her <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi>
and found ſuche meanes that ſhe brake open the Cheſt
that brought her to land, wherin ſhe found good ſtore of coine,
and ſondrie ſutes of Apparell that were the Captaines, and
now to preuent a nomber of iniuries, that might be proffered
to a woman that was left in her caſe, ſhe determined to leaue
her owne Apparell, and to ſorte her ſelf into ſome of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
that beeyng taken for a man, ſhe might paſſe through the
Countrey in the better ſafetie, and as ſhe chaunged her appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
ſhe thought it likewiſe conuenient to chaunge her name,
wherefore not readily happenyng of any other, ſhe called her
ſelf <hi>Siluio,</hi> by the name of ther owne brother, whom you haue
heard ſpoken of before.</p>
               <p>In this maner ſhe trauailed to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where ſhe
inquired out the Pallace of the Duke <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
her ſelf now to be both fit and able to plaie the ſeruyng
man, ſhe preſented her ſelf to the Duke, crauyng his ſeruice,
the Duke very willyng to giue ſuccour vnto ſtraungers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng
hym to be a proper ſmouge yong man, gaue hym en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment:
<hi>Silla</hi> thought her ſelf now more then ſatiſfied,
for all the caſualties that had happened vnto her in her Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that ſhe might at her pleaſure take but the vewe of the
Duke <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and aboue the reſt of his ſeruaunts was ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
diligent and attendaunt vppon hym, the whiche the Duke
perceiuyng, began likewiſe to growe into good likyng with
the diligence of his man, and therefore made hym one of his
Chamber, who but <hi>Siluio</hi> then was moſt neate about hym, in
helpyng of hym to make hym readie in a mornyng, in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his ruffes, in the keeping of his Chamber, <hi>Siluio</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Maiſter ſo well, that aboue all the reſt of his ſeruaunts
about him, he had the greateſt credite, and the Duke put him
moſte in truſt.</p>
               <p>At this very inſtaunt, there was remainyng in the Citie a
<pb facs="tcp:7038:28"/>
noble Dame a widowe, whoſe houſbande was but lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed,
one of the nobleſt men that were in the partes of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
who left his Ladie and wife large poſſeſſions and greate
liuynges. This Ladies name was called <hi>Iulina,</hi> who beſides
the aboundance of her wealth, and the greatneſſe of her reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
had likewiſe the ſoueraigntie of all the Dames of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
for her beautie. To this Ladie <hi>Iulina, Apolonius</hi>
became an earneſt ſuter, and accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of woers,
beſides faire woordes, ſorrowfull ſighes, and piteous counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces,
there muſt bee ſendyng of louyng letters, Chaines,
Bracelettes, Brouches, Rynges, Tablets, Gemmes, Iuels,
and preſentes I knowe not what: So my Duke, who in the
tyme that he remained in the Ile of <hi>Cypres,</hi> had no ſkill at all
in the arte of Loue, although it were more then half proffered
vnto him, was now become a ſcholler in Loues Schoole, and
had alreadie learned his firſt leſſon, that is, to ſpeake pitifully,
to looke ruthfully, to promiſe largely, to ſerue diligently, and
to pleaſe carefully: Now he was learnyng his ſeconde leſſon,
that is to rewarde, liberally, to giue bountifully, to preſent
willingly, and to write louingly. Thus <hi>Apolonius</hi> was ſo
buſied in his newe ſtudie, that I warrant you there was no
man that could chalenge hym for plaiyng the truant, he follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
his profeſſion with ſo good a will: And who muſt bee the
meſſenger to carrie the tokens and letters to the Ladie <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi>
but <hi>Siluio</hi> his man, in hym the Duke repoſed his onely
confidence, to goe betweene hym and his Ladie.</p>
               <p>New Gentlewomen, doe you think there could haue been
a greater torment deuiſed, wherewith to afflicte the harte of
<hi>Silla,</hi> then her ſelf to bee made the Inſtrument to woorke her
owne miſhapp, and to plaie the Atturney in a cauſe, that made
ſo muche againſt her ſelf. But <hi>Silla</hi> altogether deſirous to
pleaſe her Maiſter, cared nothyng at all to offend her ſelf, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his buſineſſe with ſo good a will, as if it had been in her
owne preferment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> now hauyng many tymes, taken the gaze of this
yong youth <hi>Siluio,</hi> perceiuyng hym to bee of ſuche excellent
perfecte grace, was ſo intangled with the often ſight of this
<pb facs="tcp:7038:28"/>
ſweete temptation, that ſhe fell into as great a likyng with
the man, as the Maiſter was with her ſelf: And on a tyme <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uio</hi>
beyng ſent from his Maiſter, with a meſſage to the Ladie
<hi>Iulina,</hi> as he beganne very earneſtly to ſolicet in his Maiſters
behalfe, <hi>Iulina</hi> interruptyng hym in his tale, ſaied: <hi>Siluio</hi> it is
enough that you haue ſaied for your Maiſter, from henceforth
either ſpeake for your ſelf, or ſaie nothyng at all. <hi>Silla</hi> abaſhed
to heare theſe wordes, began in her minde to accuſe the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Loue, that <hi>Iulina</hi> neglecting the good will of ſo noble
a Duke, would preferre her loue vnto ſuche a one, as Nature
it ſelf had denaied to recompence her likyng.</p>
               <p>And now for a tyme, leauyng matters dependyng as you
haue heard, it fel out that the right <hi>Siluio</hi> in deede (whom you
haue heard ſpoken of before, the brother of <hi>Silla,</hi>) was come to
his Fathers Courte into the Ile of <hi>Cypres,</hi> where vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that his ſiſter was departed, in maner as you haue heard
coniectured, that the very occaſion did proceed of ſome liking
had betweene <hi>Pedro</hi> her man (that was miſſing with her) and
her ſelf, but <hi>Siluio</hi> who loued his ſiſter, as dearly as his owne
life, and her rather for that as ſhe was his naturall ſiſter, bothe
by Father and Mother, ſo the one of them was ſo like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in countenaunce and fauour, that there was no man able
to deſcerne the one from the other by their faces, ſauyng by
their apparell the one beyng a man, the other a woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluio</hi> therefore vowed to his Father, not onely to ſeeke
but his ſiſter <hi>Silla,</hi> but alſo to reuenge the villanie, whiche he
conceiued in <hi>Sedro,</hi> for the carriyng awaie of his ſiſter, and
thus departyng hauyng trauailed through many Cities and
Townes, without hearyng any maner of newes, of thoſe he
went to ſeeke for, at the faſt be arriued at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
where as he was walking in an euenyng for his owne recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
on a pleaſaunt greene yarde, without the walles of the
Citie, he fortuned to meete with the Ladie <hi>Iulina,</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
had been abroade to take the aire, and as ſhe ſodainly caſt
her eyes vppon <hi>Siluio,</hi> thinkyng hym to bee her olde acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
by reaſon they were ſo like one an other, as you haue
heard before, ſaied vnto hym, ſir <hi>Siluio,</hi> if your haſte be not the
<pb facs="tcp:7038:29"/>
greater, I praie you let me haue a little talke with you, ſeyng
I haue ſo luckely met you in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluio</hi> wonderyng to heare hymſelf ſo rightly named, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
but a ſtraunger, not of aboue two daies continuaunce in
the Citie, very courteouſly came towardes her, deſirous to
heare what ſhe would ſaie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> commaunding her traine ſomething to ſtand backe,
ſaied as followeth. Seyng my good will and freendly loue,
hath been the onely cauſe to make me ſo prodigal to offer, that
I ſee is ſo lightly reiected, it maketh me to thinke, that men
be of this condition, rather to deſire thoſe thinges, whiche thei
can not come by, then to eſteeme or value of that, whiche both
largely and liberally is offered vnto them, but if the liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of my proffer, hath made to ſeme leſſe the value of the thing
that I ment to preſent, it is but in your owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how many noble men there hath been here before, and be
yet at this preſent, whiche hath bothe ſerued, ſued, and moſte
humbly intreated, to attaine to that, whiche to you of my ſelf,
I haue freely offred, and I perceiue is diſpiſed, or at the leaſt
very lightly regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluio</hi> wonderyng at theſe woordes, but more amazed that
ſhe could ſo rightly call hym by his name, could not tell what
to make of her ſpeeches, aſſuring hym ſelf that ſhe was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and did miſtake hym, did thinke notwithſtandyng, it had
been a poinct of greate ſimplicitie, if he ſhould forſake that,
whiche Fortune had ſo fauourably proffered vnto hym, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng
by her traine, that ſhe was ſome Ladie of greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and vewing the perfection of her beautie, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of her grace and countenaunce, did thinke it vnpoſſible
that ſhe ſhould be deſpiſed, and therefore aunſwered thus.</p>
               <p>Madame, if before this tyme, I haue ſeemed to forget my
ſelf, in neglecting your courteſie whiche ſo liberally you haue
ment vnto me: pleaſe it you to pardon what is paſt, and from
this daie forwardes, <hi>Siluio</hi> remaineth readie preſt to make
ſuche reaſonable amendes, as his abilitie may any waies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
or as it ſhall pleaſe you to commaunde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> the gladdeſt woman that might bee, to heare theſe
<pb facs="tcp:7038:29"/>
ioyfull newes, ſaied: Then my <hi>Siluio</hi> ſee you faile not to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
at night to ſuppe with me at my owne houſe, where I
will diſcourſe farther with you, what amendes you ſhal make
me, to whiche requeſt <hi>Siluio</hi> gaue his glad conſent, and thus
thei departed very well pleaſed. And as <hi>Iulina</hi> did thinke the
tyme very long, till ſhe had reapt the fruite of her deſire: So
<hi>Siluio</hi> he wiſht for Harueſt, before Corne could growe, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
the tyme as long, till he ſawe how matters would fall
out, but not knowyng what Ladie ſhe might bee, he preſently
(before <hi>Iulina</hi> was out of ſight) demaunded of one that was
walkyng by what ſhe was, and how ſhe was called, who ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>Siluio</hi> in euery poinct, and alſo in what parte of the toune
her houſe did ſtande, whereby he might enquire it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluio</hi> thus departing to his lodging, paſſed the night with
very vnquiet ſleapes, and the next Mornyng his mynd ranne
ſo muche of his Supper, that he neuer cared, neither for his
Breakfaſt nor Dinner, and the daie to his ſeemyng paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
ſo ſlowlie, that he had thought the ſtatelie Steedes had
been tired, that drawe the Chariot of the Sunne, or els ſome
other <hi>Ioſua</hi> had commaunded them againe to ſtande, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
that <hi>Phaeton</hi> had been there with a whippe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> on the other ſide, ſhe had thought the Clocke ſetter
had plaied the knaue, the daie came no faſter forwardes, but
ſixe a clocke beyng once ſtroken, recouered comforte to bothe
parties: and <hi>Siluio</hi> haſtening himſelf to the Pallace of <hi>Iulina,</hi>
where by her he was frendly welcomed, and a ſumpteous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
beeyng made readie, furniſhed with ſondrie ſortes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
diſhes, thei ſatte them doune, paſſyng the Supper tyme
with amourous lookes, louyng countenaunces, and ſecrete
glaunces conueighed from the one to the other, whiche did
better ſatiſfie them, then the feedyng of their daintie diſhes.</p>
               <p>Supper tyme beeyng thus ſpent, <hi>Iulina</hi> did thinke it very
vnfitly, if ſhe ſhould tourne <hi>Siluio</hi> to goe ſeeke his lodging in
an euenyng, deſired him therefore, that he would take a bedde
in her houſe for that night, and bryngyng hym vp into a faire
Chamber, that was very richly furniſhed, ſhe found ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that when all the reſt of her houſholde ſeruauntes were
<pb facs="tcp:7038:30"/>
a bedde and quiet, ſhe came her ſelf to beare <hi>Siluio</hi> companie,
where concludyng vpon conditions, that were in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, thei paſſed the night with ſuche ioy and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as might in that conuenient tyme bee wiſhed for, but
onely that <hi>Iulina,</hi> feedyng too muche of ſome one diſhe aboue
the reſt, receiued a ſurfett, whereof ſhe could not bee cured in
fourtie weekes after, a naturall inclination in all Women
whiche are ſubiect to longyng, and want the reaſon to vſe a
moderation in their diet: but the mornyng approching, <hi>Iulina</hi>
tooke her leaue, and conueighed her ſelf into her owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and when it was faire daie light, <hi>Siluio</hi> makyng hymſelf
readie, departed likewiſe about his affaires in the Toune, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batyng
with hymſelf how thynges had happened, being well
aſſured that <hi>Iulina</hi> had miſtaken him, and therefore for feare of
further euilles, determined to come no more there, but tooke
his iourney towardes other places in the partes of <hi>Grecia,</hi> to
ſee if he could learne any tidynges of his ſiſter <hi>Silla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>Apolonius</hi> hauing made a long ſute, and neuer
a whit the nerer of his purpoſe, came to <hi>Iulina</hi> to craue her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
aunſwere, either to accept of him, and of ſuche conditions
as he proffered vnto her, or els to giue him his laſt farewell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina,</hi> as you haue heard, had taken an earneſt penie of an

was at a controuerſie in her ſelf, what ſhe might do, one while
ſhe thought, ſeyng her occaſion ſerued ſo fit, to craue the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
good will, for the mariyng of his man, then againe, ſhe
could not tell what diſpleaſure the Duke would conceiue, in
that ſhe ſhould ſeeme to preferre his man before hymſelf, did
thinke it therefore beſt to conceale the matter, till ſhe might
ſpeake with <hi>Siluio,</hi> to vſe his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how theſe matters ſhould
be handled, &amp; herevpon reſoluyng her ſelf, deſiryng the Duke
to pardon her ſpeeches, ſaied as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sir Duke, for that from this tyme forwardes I am no

               <p>The Duke hearyng theſe wordes, aunſwered: Madame, I
muſt then content my ſelf, although againſt my will, hauyng
the Lawe in your owne handes, to like of whom you liſt, and
to make choiſe where it pleaſeth you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> giuyng the Duke greate thankes, that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with ſuche pacience, deſired him likewiſe, to giue
his free conſent and good wil, to the partie whom ſhe had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to be her houſbande.</p>
               <p>Naie ſurely Madame (ꝙ the Duke) I will neuer giue my
conſent, that any other man ſhall enioye you then my ſelf, I
haue made too greate accompt of you, then ſo lightly to paſſe
you awaie with my good will: But ſeyng it lieth not in me to
let you, hauyng (as you ſaie) made your owne choiſe, ſo from
hence forwardes I leaue you to your owne likyng, alwaies
willyng you well, and thus will take my leaue.</p>
               <p>The Duke departed towardes his owne houſe very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
that <hi>Iulina</hi> had thus ſerued hym, but in the meane
ſpace that the Duke had remained in the houſe of <hi>Iulina,</hi> ſome
of his ſeruauntes fell into talke and conference, with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts
of <hi>Iulina,</hi> where debatyng betweene them, of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of the Marriage, betwéene the Duke and the Ladie, one
of the ſeruantes of <hi>Iulina</hi> ſaied: that he neuer ſawe his Ladie
and Miſtres, vſe ſo good countenaunce to the Duke hymſelf,
as ſhe had doen to <hi>Siluio</hi> his man, and began to reporte with
what familiaritie and courteſie, ſhe had receiued hym, feaſted
hym, and lodged hym, and that in his opinion, <hi>Siluio</hi> was like
to ſpeede before the Duke, or any other that were ſuters.</p>
               <p>This tale was quickly brought to the Duke himſelf, who
makyng better enquirie in the matter, found it to be true that
was reported, and better conſideryng of the wordes, whiche
<hi>Iulina</hi> had vſed towardes hymſelf, was very well aſſured that
it could bee no other then his owne man, that had thruſt his
Noſe ſo farre out of ioynt, wherefore without any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
cauſed hym to be thruſt into a Dongeon, where he was
<pb facs="tcp:7038:31"/>
kept priſoner, in a very pitifull plight.</p>
               <p>Poore <hi>Siluio,</hi> hauyng gott intelligence by ſome of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
what was the cauſe that the Duke his Maiſter did
beare ſuche diſpleaſure vnto hym, deuiſed all the meanes he
could, as well by meditation by his fellowes, as otherwiſe by
petitions, and ſupplication to the Duke, that he would ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende

wherby the Duke had cauſe to take any greefe, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
hymſelf worthie not onely of impriſonment, but alſo of
moſte vile and ſhamefull death: with theſe petitions he daiely
plied the Duke, but all in vaine, for the Duke thought he had
made ſo good proofe, that he was throughly confirmed in his
opinion againſt his man.</p>
               <p>But the Ladie <hi>Iulina,</hi> wonderyng what made <hi>Siluio,</hi> that
he was ſo ſlacke in his viſitation, and why he abſented himſelf
ſo long from her preſence, beganne to thinke that all was not
well, but in the ende, perceiuyng no decoction of her former
ſurfette, receiued as you haue heard, and findyng in her ſelf,
an vnwonted ſwellyng in her beallie, aſſuryng her ſelf to bee
with childe, fearyng to become quite banckroute of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
did thinke it more then tyme to ſeeke out a Father, and
made ſuche ſecret ſearche, and diligent enquirie, that ſhe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the truth how <hi>Siluio</hi> was kept in priſon, by the Duke his
Maiſter, and mindyng to finde a preſent remedie, as well for
the loue ſhe bare to <hi>Siluio,</hi> as for the maintenaunce of her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
and eſtimation, ſhe ſpeedily haſted to the Pallace of the
Duke, to whom ſhe ſaied as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sir Duke, it maie bee that you will thinke my commyng
to your houſe in this ſorte, doeth ſomethyng paſſe the limites
of modeſtie, the whiche I proteſt before GOD, proceaded of
this deſire, that the worlde ſhould knowe, how iuſtly I ſeeke
meanes to maintaine my honour, but to the ende I ſeeme not
tedious with prolixitie of woordes, nor to vſe other then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
circumſtaunces, knowe ſir, that the loue I beare to my
onely beloued <hi>Siluio,</hi> whom I doe eſteeme more then all the
Iewelles in the world, whoſe perſonage I regard more then
<pb facs="tcp:7038:31"/>
my owne life, is the onely cauſe of my attempted iourney, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeechyng
you, that all the whole diſpleaſure, whiche I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
you haue conceiued againſt hym, maie be imputed vnto
my charge, &amp; that it would pleaſe you louyngly to deale with
him, whom of my ſelf I haue choſen rather for the ſatiſfaction
of mine honeſt liking, then for the vaine preheminences or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
dignities looked after by ambicious myndes.</p>
               <p>The Duke hauyng heard this diſcourſe, cauſed <hi>Siluio</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to be ſent for, and to be brought before hym, to whom he
ſaied: Had it not been ſufficient for thee, when I had repoſed
my ſelf in thy fidelitie, and the truſtineſſe of thy ſeruice, that
thou ſhouldeſt ſo traiterouſly deale with me, but ſince that
time haſte not ſpared, ſtil to abuſe me with ſo many forgeries,
and periured proteſtations, not onely hatefull vnto me, whoſe
ſimplicitie thou thinkeſt to bee ſuche, that by the plotte of thy
pleaſaunt tongue, thou wouldeſt make me beleeue a manifeſt
vntrothe, but moſte habominable bee thy doynges in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and ſight of God, that haſt not ſpared to blaſpheeme his
holy name, by callyng hym to bee a witneſſe to maintaine thy
leaſynges, and ſo deteſtably wouldeſt forſweare thy ſelf, in a
matter that is ſo openly knowne.</p>
               <p>Poore <hi>Siluio</hi> whoſe innocencie was ſuche, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               <p>Moſte noble Duke, well vnderſtandyng your conceiued
greefe, moſt humbly I beſeeche you paciently to heare my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
not mindyng thereby to aggrauate or heape vp your
wrathe and diſpleaſure, proteſtyng before God, that there is
nothyng in the worlde, whiche I regarde ſo muche, or doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
ſo deare, as your good grace and fauour, but deſirous
that your grace ſhould know my innocencie, and to cleare my

accuſed, whiche as I vnderſtande ſhould be in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Ladie <hi>Iulina,</hi> who ſtandeth here in place, whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitance
for my better diſcharge, now I moſt humbly craue,
proteſting before the almightie God, that neither in thought,
worde, nor deede, I haue not otherwiſe vſed my ſelf, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to the bonde and duetie of a ſeruaunt, that is bothe

willyng and deſirous, to further his Maiſters ſutes, which if
I haue otherwiſe ſaied then that is true, you Madame <hi>Iulina,</hi>
who can very well deſide the depthes of all this doubt, I moſt
humbly beſeeche you to certifie a troth, if I haue in any thing
miſſaied, or haue otherwiſe ſpoken then is right and iuſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> hauing heard this diſcourſe which <hi>Siluio</hi> had made,
perceiuyng that he ſtoode in great awe of the Dukes diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
aunſwered thus: Thinke not my <hi>Siluio,</hi> that my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
hether is to accuſe you of any miſdemeanour towards
your Maiſter, ſo I doe not denaie, but in al ſuche Imbaſſages
wherein towardes me you haue been imployed, you haue vſed
the office of a faithfull and truſtie meſſenger, neither am I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to confeſſe, that the firſt day that mine eyes did behold
the ſinguler behauiour, the notable curteſie, and other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
giftes wherewith my <hi>Siluio</hi> is endued, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde
all meaſure my harte was ſo inflamed, that impoſſible
it was for me, to quenche the feruent loue, or extinguiſhe the
leaſt part of my conceiued torment, before I had bewraied the
ſame vnto hym, and of my owne motion, craued his promiſed
faithe and loialtie of marriage, and now is the tyme to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the ſame vnto the worlde, whiche hath been doen before
God, and betweene our ſelues: knowyng that it is not neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to keepe ſecret that, whiche is neither euill doen, nor hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to any perſone, therefore (as I ſaied before) <hi>Siluio</hi> is my
houſbande by plited faithe, whom I hope to obtaine without
offence, or diſpleaſure of any one, truſting that there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that will ſo farre forget hymſelf, as to reſtraine that, whiche
God hath left at libertie for euery wight, or that will ſeeke by
crueltie, to force Ladies to marrie otherwiſe, then accordyng
to their owne likyng. Feare not then my <hi>Siluio</hi> to keepe your
faith and promiſe, whiche you haue made vnto me, and as for
the reſt: I doubt not thynges will ſo fall out, as you ſhall haue
no maner of cauſe to complaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluio</hi> amaſed to heare theſe woordes, for that <hi>Iulina</hi> by her
ſpeeche, ſeemed to confirme that, whiche he moſt of all deſired
to be quite of, ſaied: Who would haue thought that a Ladie of
ſo greate honour and reputation, would her ſelf bee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:32"/>
of a thyng ſo preiudiciall, and vncomely for her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
what plighted promiſes be theſe whiche be ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ignoraunt vnto me, whiche if it be otherwiſe then I
haue ſaied, you Sacred Gods conſume me ſtraight with fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyng
flames of fire. But what woordes might I vſe to giue
credite to the truth, and innocencie of my cauſe? Ah Madame
<hi>Iulina,</hi> I deſire no other teſtimonie, then your owne honeſtie
and vertue, thinkyng that you will not ſo muche blemiſhe the
brightneſſe of your honour, knowyng that a woman is or
ſhould be, the Image of curteſie, continencie, and ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
from the whiche ſo ſoone as ſhe ſtoopeth, and leaueth the
office of her duetie and modeſtie, beſides the degraduation of
her honour, ſhe thruſteth her ſelf into the pitt of perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie,
and as I can not thinke you would ſo farre forget your
ſelf, by the refuſall of a noble duke, to dimme the light of your
renowne and glorie, whiche hetherto you haue maintained, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
the beſt and nobleſt Ladies, by ſuch a one as I know
my ſelf to be, too farre vnworthie your degree and callyng, ſo
moſt humbly I beſeeche you to confeſſe a trothe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

thoſe vowes and promiſes you ſpeake of, whiche ſpéeches
bee ſo obſcure vnto me, as I knowe not for my life how I

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> ſomethyng nipped with theſe ſpeeches ſaied, and
what is the matter that now you make ſo little accompt of
your <hi>Iulina,</hi> that beeyng my houſbande in deede, haue the
face to denay me, to whom thou art contracted by ſo many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
othes: what arte thou aſhamed to haue me to thy wife?
how muche oughteſt thou rather to bee aſhamed to breake thy
promiſed faithe, and to haue deſpiſed the holie and dreadfull
name of GOD, but that tyme conſtraineth me to laie open
that, whiche ſhame rather willeth I ſhould diſſemble and
keepe ſecret, behold me then here <hi>Siluio</hi> whom thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with childe, who if thou be of ſuche honeſtie, as I truſt for
al this I ſhall finde, then the thing is doen without preiudice,
or any hurte to my conſcience, conſideryng that by the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
faithe, thou diddeſt accoumpt me for thy wife, and I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thee for my ſpouſe and loyall houſbande, ſwearing by the
<pb facs="tcp:7038:33"/>
almightie God, that no other then you haue made the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt
and triumphe of my chaſtitie, whereof I craue no other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then your ſelf, and myne owne conſcience.</p>
               <p>I praie you Gentlewomen, was not this a foule ouerſight
of <hi>Iulina,</hi> that would ſo preciſely ſweare ſo great an othe, that
ſhe was gotten with childe by one, that was altogether vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
with implementes for ſuche a tourne. For Gods loue
take heede, and let this be an example to you, when you bee
with childe, how you ſweare who is the father, before you haue
had good proofe and knowledge of the partie, for men bee ſo
ſubtill and full of ſleight, that God knoweth a woman maie
quickly be deceiued.</p>
               <p>But now to retourne to our <hi>Siluio,</hi> who hearyng an othe
ſworne ſo deuinely that he had gotten a woman with childe,
was like to beleeue that it had bin true in very deede, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membryng
his owne impediment, thought it impoſſible that
he ſhould commit ſuche an acte, and therefore halfe in a chafe,
he ſaied. What lawe is able to reſtraine the fooliſhe indeſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a woman, that yeeldeth her ſelf to her owne deſires,
what ſhame is able to bridle or withdrawe her from her mynd
and madneſſe, or with what ſnaffell is it poſſible to holde her
backe, from the execution of her filthineſſe, but what abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is this, that a Ladie of ſuch a houſe ſhould ſo forget the
greatneſſe of her eſtate, the aliaunce whereof ſhe is deſcended,
the nobilitie of her deceaſed houſbande, and maketh no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to ſhame and ſlaunder her ſelf, with ſuche a one a I
am, being ſo farre vnfit and vnſeemely for her degree, but how
horrible is it to heare the name of God ſo defaſed, that wee
make no more accompt, but for the maintenaunce of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chifes,
we feare no whit at all to forſweare his holy name, as
though he were not in all his dealinges moſte righteous true
and iuſte, and will not onely laie open our leaſinges to the
worlde, but will likewiſe puniſhe the ſame with moſte ſharpe
and bitter ſcourges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina,</hi> not able to indure hym to proceede any farther in
his Sermon, was alreadie ſurpriſed with a vehement greefe,
began bitterly to crie out vtteryng theſe ſpeeches followyng.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:33"/>
Alas, is it poſſible that the ſoueraigne iuſtice of God, can
abide a miſchiefe ſo greate and curſed, why maie I not now
ſuffer death, rather then the infamie whiche I ſee to wander
before myne eyes. O happie and more then right happie had
I bin, if inconſtant fortune had not deuiſed this treaſon where
in I am ſurpriſed and caught, am I thus become to be intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with ſnares, and in the handes of hym, who inioiyng the
ſpoyles of my honour, will openly depriue me of my fame, by
making me a common fable to all poſteritie in time to come:
ah Traitour and diſcourtious wretche, is this the recompence
of the honeſt and firme amitie which I haue borne thee, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
haue I deſerued this diſcourteſie, by louing thee more then
thou art able to deſerue, is it I arrant theefe is it I, vppon
whom thou thinkeſt to worke thy miſchiues, doeſt thou think
me no better worthe, but that thou maieſt prodigally waſte
my honour at thy pleaſure, dideſt thou dare to aduenture vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

               <p>Here withall the teares ſo guſhed doune her cheekes, that
ſhe was not able to open her mouth to vſe any farther ſpeech.</p>
               <p>The Duke who ſtoode by all this while, and heard this
whole diſcourſe, was wonderfully mooued with compaſſion
towardes <hi>Iulina,</hi> knowyng that from her infancie ſhe had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo honourably vſed her ſelf, that there was no man able to
detect her of any miſdemeanour, otherwiſe then beſeemed a
Ladie of her eſtate, wherefore beyng fully reſolued that <hi>Siluio</hi>
his man had committed this villanie againſt her, in a greate
furie drawyng his Rapier he ſaied vnto <hi>Siluio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How canſt thou (arrant theefe) ſhewe thy ſelf ſo cruell and
careleſſe to ſuche as doe thee honour, haſt thou ſo little regard
of ſuche a noble Ladie, as humbleth her ſelf to ſuche a villaine
as thou art, who without any reſpecte either of her renowne
or noble eſtate, canſt be content to ſeeke the wracke and vtter

that thou art not able to make her the leaſt parte of amendes,
or I ſweare by God, that thou ſhalt not eſcape y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death whiche
I will miniſter to thee with my owne handes, and therefore
aduiſe thee well what thou doeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siluio</hi> hauyng heard this ſharpe ſentence, fell doune on his

might be ſuffered to ſpeake with the Ladie <hi>Iulina</hi> aparte, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing

               <p>Well (ꝙ the Duke) I take thy worde, and there with all

               <p>But now <hi>Iulina</hi> had conceiued ſo great greefe againſt <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uio,</hi>
that there was muche a doe, to perſwade her to talke with

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulina</hi> did now think her ſelf to be in a worſe caſe then euer

reduced to great pouertie, then her

(ſir) beſeeche you as I haue doen before, that the matter maie
paſſe ſecrete, and not to bee imparted to any other then to vs

               <p>At this deuiſe the yong Prince pauſed a while, thinkyng
it ſtraunge that he ſhould goe to a yong maide, that not onely
was vnwillyng, but alſo not ſo muche as made priuie of his
commyng, did what he could to refuſe that meane, and to
perſwade the mother to deuiſe ſome better. But at the laſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
none other could be founde more fitte for the purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
pricked forwarde with the vehemencie of that appetite,
whiche loue had ſtirred vp in him, conſideryng himſelf to be a
Prince, and a gallant yong Gentleman, and that he ſhould be
alone with his loue, thought that it ſhould not be hard for hym
to winne her to his will: and ſo content to doe as the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
had deuiſed. And beyng parted each from other, he
began to attende the commyng of the nexte mornyng and all
that night, whiche ſeemed longer vnto him then a hole yere, he
lay with his thoughtes and imaginations, in the armes of his
<hi>Lucilla.</hi> As ſone as the daie began to peepe, <hi>Don Hercules</hi> all
alone as he had promiſed to the mother, went to the houſe of
<pb facs="tcp:7038:40"/>
his Ladie, and findyng the doores open according to promiſe,
entered into the Chamber wherein <hi>Lucilla laie,</hi> and hauyng
barred the doore, approched nere the bedde wherein ſhe laie.</p>
               <p>It was in the Moneth of Iulie, whiche ſeaſon in that
Countrie is extreame hotte: by reaſon whereof <hi>Lucilla</hi> tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng
from one ſide of the bedde vnto the other, had rolled of
all the clothes wherewith ſhe had been couered: ſo as ſhe had
left her ſelf all naked, and in that ſorte he found her, with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles
about her necke and her armes, whiche with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their ruddie colour did ſett out and beautifie greatly
the excellent faireneſſe of her white bodie. She laie a ſleepe
vpon her backe, with her handes caſt ouer her head, (as for the
moſte parte yong women are wont to doe): ſo that forthwith
the yong Prince diſcoured her from toppe to toe: and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with a greedie eye all her whole bodie, not onely he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her to hym ſelf ſo naked, as he had doen whileſt ſhe
was apparailed, but alſo did ſo ſingulary well like her in that
ſtate, that he thought he ſaw rather ſome diuine thing, or ſome
Goddeſſe come doune from Heauen, to heape hym with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
then a mortall creature: and beganne to allowe and
commende his owne iudgement, in that he had placed his
loue vppon ſo excellente and rare a peece. And therewith bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
doune hym ſelf to giue her a kiſſe, and ſo to awake her.
Beholde ſhe opened her eyes, whiche right well reſembled
two faire ſhinyng Starres. And where ſhe was vſed to ſee
none other bodie in that Chamber but her mother when ſhe
waked, now ſeyng this yong Prince ſtandyng this ouer her,
and findyng her ſelf in that ſorte all naked, ſhe gaue a greate
ſkritche, and ſaied.</p>
               <p>Out alas ſir (for ſhe knewe hym ſtraight waie) what euill
happe hath brought you hether at this tyme? And in ſo ſaiyng
as one wonderfully aſhamed to bee ſeene in that plight, ſhe
wrapped about her one of the ſheetes, and began with a loude
voyce to call her mother.</p>
               <p>But perceiuing that her mother would not heare, and that
ſhe called in vaine, ſhe began to imagine that ſhe was conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
vnto his commyng thether, and lamentyng with teares
<pb facs="tcp:7038:40"/>
that trickled doune her cheekes, like drops of dewe hanging
vppon Roſes, in a Maie mornyng, ſhe ſaied: Alas now I ſee
my mother alſo hath betraied me. Whiche thyng the young
Prince vnderſtandyng, ſaied vnto her. Trouble not your ſelf,
nor greeue not (faire Damſell) at my comming hether, but
rather reioyce, that your ſinguler beautie, hath ſo inflamed
me, as one in a maner forgettyng my eſtate, haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to come hether all alone, as a priuate man to enioye
your companie, if it will pleaſe you to accepte my good will,
whiche though a thouſande other Dames of this Citie, doe
wiſhe and would be glad of, yet haue I deemed none of them
worthie thereof but your ſelf. And ſeeyng your Mother, who
hath that power ouer you, that in reaſon ſhe ought to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
her childe, and knoweth beſt what is for your good and
commoditie, doeth conſent herevnto: you (in my iudgement)
are not but to ſhewe your ſelf in like ſorte content. For in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
your ſelf to me, you doe not abaſe or caſt your ſelf awaie
vpon any vilde perſone: but ſhewe your ſelf courteous vnto a
Prince, whom your beautie hath made thrall: and in whom
you ſhall finde nothing but gratefull curteſie, to your benefite
and ſatiſfaction.</p>
               <p>And with theſe and other like woordes ſtetched forthe his

               <p>Sir I beſeech you, by the Princely nobilitie that is in you,
and by that loue whiche you ſaie you beare me, that it will
pleaſe you, not to force me, or to ſeeke at my handes any thing
againſt my will: and that ſince my mother, who ought to haue
been the cheef defender of myne honeſtie, hath abandoned and
forſaken me, you will yet of your courteſie vouchſafe, to giue
me the hearyng of a fewe wordes, whiche the ſpeciall care I
haue of myne honour doeth force me to expreſſe.</p>
               <p>The courteous yong Prince at this requeſt, ſtaied hym
ſelf proceedyng any further: and not beeyng deſirous to haue
her, but with her owne good will, ſtoode ſtill to heare what it
was that <hi>Lucilla</hi> would ſaie vnto hym: yet euer hopyng, with
<pb facs="tcp:7038:41"/>
faire meanes to winne her at the laſt. And ſhe weepyng very
tenderly, beganne to ſaie vnto hym in this ſorte.</p>
               <p>I am very ſorie (moſte noble Prince ꝙ ſhe) that Fortune
hath been ſo muche myne enemie, that ſhe hath made me a
woman, farre vnworthie and vnmeete for you: For that you
being ſo great a Prince as you are, and I ſo meane a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman:
I ſee ſo greate a ſpace and diſtaunce betweene your
high eſtate, and my lowe degree, that betweene vs there can
bee no portion, or conuenient equalitie: For the whiche cauſe
(ſir) I conſidering myne owne eſtate, and not mindyng to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
my calling, haue a good while ſince choſen <hi>Nicander</hi> to
be my Louer, who in reſpect of his bloud, though he be richer
then I, is no whitte nor more nobly borne then my ſelf am.
By reaſon of whiche conformitie of bloud and birth, our loue
is likewiſe growne to bee equall, and equall the deſire in vs
bothe, he to haue me to his wife, and I to haue hym for my
houſbande. But the couetouſneſſe (let it bee lawfull for me to
ſaie ſo) of his father is ſuche, that although he knoweth me to
be a Gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne, yet becauſe I am not of that wealth
as to bryng hym ſo greate a dowrie, as his riches perchaunce
require, he deſpiſeth me, and will not yeeld by any perſwaſion
his good will and conſent, that wee maie matche together ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to our deſire. Neuertheleſſe (ſir) I conſideryng how
feruently this yong Gentleman loueth me, and that alreadie
we are in mynd vnited and knit together, with conſent, faithe
and loue, doe yet beleeue aſſuredly, that GOD of his ſpeciall
goodneſſe and fauour, will graunt vs his aſſured grace, that
we maie one daie bee ioyned together in the holy ſtate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.
Which thyng if it ſhould happen and come to paſſe,
I not hauyng any thyng els to bryng with me for my dowrie
but my virginitie, am determined &amp; fully reſolued (by Gods
help) to giue it vnto hym, as pure and vnſpotted as I brought
it from my mothers wombe. And if my vnhappie chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and
Fortune be ſuch, as that I cannot haue <hi>Nicander</hi> to my houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
I haue concluded with my ſelf (by the grace of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to couple my ſelf to any man liuyng: but to giue and vowe
me wholie vnto almightie GOD, and in his ſeruice to ſpend
<pb facs="tcp:7038:41"/>
my daies a virgine, in continuall Faſting and Praier. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(moſte excellent Prince) if Honeſtie, if Iuſtice, if Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
haue that power and force in your noble mynde, whiche in
reaſon thei ought to haue, I do beſeech you, and for that loues
ſake that you ſaie you beare me, that you will preſerue and
keep vnſtained my honeſtie, and that it would pleaſe you with
the ſound diſcourſe of reaſon, to temper that feruent appetite
whiche hath brought you hether, to the preiudice and breache
of my honeſtie and credite. In doyng whereof you ſhall ſhewe
your ſelf to be, in deede that noble Prince that the highneſſe of
your birthe and bloud doeth promiſe you ſhould be, whereas if
you ſhould force and violate me a Virgine, and a weake mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

whiche I acknowledge to bee ſo greate, that I am bounde to

But for aſmuche as wordes doe faile me wherewith I might

               <p>And hauyng cauſed the two thouſande pounde to be paied

his father, and tolde hym all that had paſſed betweene <hi>Lucilla</hi>

               <p>This yong Prince required his father, to ſende for <hi>Nican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>

might match with <hi>Lucilla,</hi> ſince that ſhe was prouided and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

did with a very good will, for that he knewe that if his ſonne
ſhould haue taken in hande, to perſwade the olde man to any

why the Prince ſhould ſo doe? And hauing ſent for hym accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyngly,

who aſwell for her birthe, as for the rare giftes of her mynde,
(as he had learned) was worthie to be wife to any great Lord.
The olde Gentleman aunſwered, that although ſhe had thoſe
vertues and giftes whiche he ſpake of, and were very well
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his wealthe, whereby ſhe might deſerue to bee matched with
his ſonne. Yes Marie ſaied the Duke, for I my ſelf becauſe I
would not haue ſo greate vertue as is in her, to bee oppreſſed
by Fortunes ſpight, haue beſtowed vppon her two thouſande
pounde to ſerue for her dowrie.</p>
               <p>The olde man hearyng of ſuche a ſomme, was very well
content to doe as the Duke would haue hym, and the nexte
daie through the liberalitie of the Prince, the mariage was
concluded and knitte vp, whiche had ſo long been delaied and
hindered by the coueteouſneſſe of the olde man, and the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

               <p>What vertue, or what continence of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>

<hi>Alexander</hi> from <hi>Darius</hi> his daughter. But it was very eaſie
for either of them ſo to doe: aſwell becauſe thei were in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

<pb facs="tcp:7038:43"/>

as it were in bliſſe, liuing at his eaſe and pleaſure, in the
flower of his youthe, and in the heate of his amourous flames,
had a yong Gentlewoman of a rare beautie, not of ſtraunge
Nation, or any otherwiſe to be hated, but extremely beloued,
in his handes, and voluntarily yeelded, and committed vnto
him by her owne mother: and yet not onelie tempered himſelf

liberallie her dowrie vppon her, to the ende that an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might enioye her, and bee her houſebande, whom ſhe had
choſen to loue and like of: did without all queſtion farr excede
all humaine courteſie, in ſo Noble and ſo vertuous an acte.
Whereby he made apparaunt, that although he were pricked

yet was he of that highneſſe of courage, and of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But for all that the father could do, or any other of her fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

ſlaked no whit at all, but ſtill increaſed, bothe hopyng in

knaue aſſured her, that he would doe in all pointes,
as ſhe would haue hym. Wherefore, when all the reſte of the
houſe were in their firſte fleape, the Damſell with this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Moore, went out of her fathers hous, and gather into the
Boate, and the weather beyng verie faire, the knaue began to
rowe, and make ſaile along the coaſte toward <hi>Ligorno,</hi> from
whiche by breake of the daie, thei were not verie farre. When
this yong gentlewoman, ſawe that ſhe was now ſo farr from
home, that ſhe needed not to feare, to be driuen backe again to
<hi>Genoua,</hi> ſhe willed the Moore to rowe to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſhore, and to land
himſelf, and then to ſhoue of the Boate againe: for that her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
was ſo to dye, ſwallowed vp with the waues of
the ſea, as ſhe ſuppoſed her <hi>Fineo</hi> to haue been. But the wicked
knaue, who had a father fetche in his hed, and thoughtes farre
differed from the Gentlewomans, made her beleeue that thei
were yet nere vnto <hi>Genoua,</hi> and aduiſed her to bee contente,
that thei might goe ſomewhat farther, to the ende that her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:7038:46"/>
if he ſent after them, might not ouertake them.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, ſhe hauyng often tymes vrged hym to doe
as ſhe erſte bad hym, and he ſtill protracted the tyme, and ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
her of with one tale or an other: ſhe began to ſuſpect his
drift. The Mornyng therefore beyng well ſpent, ſhe made as
though ſhe would haue looked ouer the Boate ſide, into the
Water, or haue waſhed her handes in the Sea, and on the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
would haue caſte her ſelf ouer boarde. But the craftie
Moore ſuſpectyng her intente, caught holde of her aboute the
middle, and not onely held her from throwing her ſelf into the
Sea, but alſo bound her faſte hande and foote, and wheras ſhe
of her courteſie, had bothe ſet hym at libertie, and liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
good ſtore of wealthe vppon hym, he as a treacherous
Infidell, bereued her of her libertie, makyng her an vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Slaue vnder his diſpoſition, and beeyng moued with a
greedy couetous minde, thought that too little whiche ſhe had
giuen hym, and therefore determined (as is afore ſaied) to ſell
her perſone, and to encreaſe his goodes by that meanes.</p>
               <p>The deſolate Damſell, when ſhe ſawe her ſelf ſo vſed by
that villaine, full of woe and greefe, ceaſed not to rebuke the
vilde Caitiue, that little regarded her ſpeeches, the breach of
his Faithe and promiſe, and blamyng her ſelf for truſtyng of
hym: and then repented when it was too late, that ſhe had not
obeied her Father, and followed the aduiſe of her freendes, ſhe
beganne to curſe her Deſtinie, and her cruell Fortune, and to
crie out vpon the Heauens, that had made her become the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunateſt
yong woman, that euer loued man.</p>
               <p>And whileſt ſhe was thus lamentyng her harde happe, and
the Moore as faſte as he could with his Owres, labouryng to
ſpeede his voiage: A little Foiſte or Galley of Moores, that
wente prollyng vp and doune the Coaſte, hauyng eſpied the
ſmall Boate, drewe nere vnto it, and boorded it. And hauyng
founde this yong Gentlewoman beeyng bounde therein, thei
would haue taken her awaie: but the old knaue offeryng to
reſiſt them, and to kepe her out of their handes, thei toke her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
from him perforce, and wounding him very ſore. And aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of her in their language, from whence ſhe came, and what
<pb facs="tcp:7038:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhe was: but ſhe not vnderſtanding them, could make them no
aunſwere, but onely with teares and weepyng, make them to
vnderſtande, that ſhe was a wofull and vnfortunate damſell.
But the old Moore feelyng hymſelf wounded to death, before
he died tolde theim, bothe of what place and Parentage ſhe
was, and laied before theim by plaine reaſon, how greate a
bootie thei might accoumpte thei had made that Mornyng, if
thei did carrie her vnto the king of <hi>Tuniſe</hi> (as he had thought
to haue doen) and ſell her vnto hym. He beyng dedde, thei diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled
him, and tooke from hym all that, whiche <hi>Fiamma</hi> had
giuen, and ſo he hauyng thought by treacherie, and breakyng
of his faithe, to make greate gaine, loſte bothe his life, and all
that whiche he had gotten, of the vnaduiſed and euill counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
yong Gentlewoman. And hauyng placed her in their
Foiſte, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted her as well as thei could, thei tooke their
waie ſtraight toward <hi>Tuniſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It fortuned that the other Fregate of Moores, that had
founde and taken <hi>Fineo</hi> (as is alreadie ſaied before) met with
this other. Foiſte or Gallie, wherein <hi>Fiamma</hi> was, and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Fregate wherein <hi>Fineo</hi> was) who in the encounter, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the fight, had ſhewed greate valour emong the reſt) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the other, and tooke from them all that thei had: ſo that
<hi>Fiamma</hi> and <hi>Fineo</hi> were bothe now together, in the compaſſe
of one ſmall veſſell. And although in that extreamitie of bothe
their euill fortunes, it was a great comfort for theſe twoo Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
to ſee one the other, and that bothe longed and deſired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
to imbrace eche other, and to tell the one to the other
their accidentes, and vnfortunate aduentures. Neuertheleſſe
<hi>Fineo</hi> made ſignes to <hi>Fiamma,</hi> that in nowiſe ſhe ſhould take
knowledge, or acquaintaunce of him, and accordyngly ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
and made no ſhewe, but as one had neuer ſeen hym.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fineo</hi> for the valoure and courage, whiche he had ſhewed
in the battaile, was deliuered of his chaines, and muche made
of emong the Moores, vntill ſuche tyme as thei had conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
bothe him and her (as thei did verie ſhortly after) vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:7038:47"/>
kyng of <hi>Tuniſe.</hi> Who hauyng ſeen and conſidered <hi>Fineo,</hi> and
vnderſtoode by the Pirates, that his comely perſonage was
accompanied with greate valour, brought him, and tooke him
to his ſeruice, in good place nere his owne perſone. And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
moued with the beautie of the yong Gentlewoman, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
for her likewiſe, for a greate ſomme of money, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her to be put in the <hi>Cube,</hi> whiche is a place where he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his Concubines (as the Turke dooeth his in his <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qlio</hi>)
emong a greate many of other women, and eſteemed her
verie muche, for that the Rouers (who had learned of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that thei ouercame) all that whiche the olde Moore had
declared vnto theim, of her callyng and condition, did aſſure
hym that ſhe was a Gentlewoman, borne of a noble Familie
in <hi>Genoua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fineo</hi> by his ſeruice and diſcrite behauiour, became in
ſhorte tyme verie deare vnto the kyng, ſo that in leſſe then the
ſpace of one whole yere, the kyng of ſpeciall truſt, gaue hym
the charge of the gate of the <hi>Cube,</hi> whiche office the kynges
of <hi>Tuniſe</hi> are neuer wont to giue, but vnto ſuche as are in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
fauour about them: In the whiche <hi>Fineo</hi> to his greate
contentmente, had the commoditie daiely to ſee his <hi>Fiamma,</hi>
and ſhe had no leſſe comforte and ſatſfaction, to beholde and
looke vpon hym, whiche oportunitie thei enioyed, and hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſo diſcritely, that thei neuer gaue any cauſe of ſuſpition to
any perſone, of their feruent good will and affection.</p>
               <p>The maner or cuſtome of the Kyng, was to cauſe his
Concubines to come vnto hym, and to lye with them by order
as thei had been bought, or come to his handes: By reaſon of
whiche cuſtome, for that there were verie many bought before
the commyng thether of <hi>Fiamma,</hi> there was alreadie a whole
yere and halfe, well nye paſte after her ſale, and yet her turne
was not come to be called for. But remainyng now but three
others, to be brought vnto the kyng before her. <hi>Fineo</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
to his intollerable greef, that ſhe was ere it were long,
to bee likewiſe called for, began to bee tormented with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
paſſion, and an guiſhe of minde: and his woe increaſed
ten thouſande folde, by feare and imagination whiche he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:48"/>
that ſhe beyng aboue all the kinges Concubines farre
the faireſt, when he had once enioyed her, he would take her to
bee one of his wiues, whiche feare did no whit leſſe tormente
and afflicte <hi>Fiamma,</hi> then it did her Louer.</p>
               <p>Whileſt bothe theſe yong Louers liued in this ſorte, there
chaunced to arriue at <hi>Tuniſe</hi> a Ship of <hi>Sauona,</hi> with certaine
Marchauntes of that Citee: who ſeyng <hi>Fineo</hi> there, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
hym, were wonderfully amcruailed findyng hym aliue,
for that he had been lamented at <hi>Sauona,</hi> of all his frendes for
dedde. <hi>Fineo</hi> likewiſe knowyng thoſe Marchauntes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
aucthoritie and meanes to pleaſure them in the Court,
welcomed them, and made muche of them in frendly ſort: and
demaunding of the ſtate and welfare of his father, and brother
and other freendes, thei certified hym that thei were all well,
and that when thei ſhould vnderſtande that he was aliue, and
in ſo good a caſe, thei would be verie ioyfull, and thinke theim
ſelues happie, if thei might hope to ſee hym once come again,
as thei doubted not but one daie he would and might.</p>
               <p>Theſe Marchauntes hauing diſpatched their buſineſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
thence, and by them <hi>Fineo</hi> wrote letters to his Father,
and to his brother, certifiyng them of his beyng at <hi>Tuniſe,</hi> and
how that <hi>Fiamma</hi> was with him, and that he deſired to deliuer
hymſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

thought he might eaſily bryng to paſſe, if his brother would
come thither, and withall deſcribed vnto them a plot, whiche
he had caſte for the execution of his intent and deſire.</p>
               <p>Thei beyng retourned ſafe vnto <hi>Sauona,</hi> deliuered the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vnto the father and brother of <hi>Fineo,</hi> who with the reſt of
of his freendes, and in effecte all the whole Citee, were verie
glad that his Fortune had not been altogether ſo froward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hym, as thei had ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>And his brother accordyng to his inſtructions, prepared a
verie pretie Fregate, verie well appoincted and furniſhed
with Marchaundize, emong whiche there were many trifles,
and thynges of price meete for Ladies and Gentlewomen.
And beyng arriued therewith a <hi>a Tuniſe, Fineo</hi> brought them
vnto the Kyng, whom thei preſented with ſome thynges of
<pb facs="tcp:7038:48"/>
ſmall price, whiche were verie gratefull, and acceptable vnto
him, and emong other ſpeeches thei ſaied, that thei had aborde
many pretie thinges for Dames and Ladiee, which thing the
kyng vnderſtandyng, commaunded <hi>Fineo</hi> that the cheefeſt of
them might be brought into the <hi>Cube,</hi> to ſhewe ſuche thinges
as thei had vnto his Concubines: by whiche occaſion he gatte
that oportunitie which he looked for, to confer and deale more
priuately with them without ſuſpition, and to giue the better
order, for the accompliſhement of aſmuche as he had deuiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fineo</hi> and his brother therefore beyng come into the <hi>Cube</hi>
ſhewed forthe emong thoſe women, ſuche wares as thei had
brought, to pleaſe their fancies, and gaue vnto them all, ſome
one trifle or an other, as a gentle preſent to the firſte, and the
brother of <hi>Fineo</hi> preſented <hi>Fiamma</hi> emong the reſt, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
faire Purſe, richelie embrodered with Golde and Pearle,
in the whiche there was encloſed a letter, written by <hi>Fineo,</hi> by
the conrentes whereof, ſhe might vnderſtande at large, al that
whiche he did wiſhe, and would haue her to doe, to make their
eſcape together, and to ridd themſelues out of that thraldome
and captiuitie. Aſſone as the twoo brethren had doen that thei
came for, and were departed, <hi>Fiamm</hi> by their maner gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng,
that the gifte of that Purſe, contained ſome Miſterie,
withdrewe her ſelf into a ſecret place, and hauyng opened it,
ſhe found therin the letter, whiche when ſhe had read, ſhe than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Almightie God, that of his goodneſſe had ſhewed her the
waie, to deliuer her ſelf out of Captiuitie, and from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
diſhoneſtly the Concubine of an Infidell kyng.</p>
               <p>And when this appointed daie, for the performyng of their
purpoſe was come: <hi>Fiamma</hi> in the night when all was ſilent,
and others ſlept, came to a windowe barred with Iron, where
<hi>Fineo</hi> and his brother were attendyng for her: Who with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
inſtrumentes, whiche thei had brought for that purpoſe,
brake and wreſted the Grate of the windowe, and takyng her
awaie with them, thei gott her into their Barque, and hoiſſed
ſaile, and directed their courſe with a merrie Winde, toward
the coaſte of Italie, whiche ſerued theim verie faire all that
night long, &amp; the moſte part of the next daie. In the mornyng
<pb facs="tcp:7038:49"/>
                  <hi>Fiamma</hi> beyng miſſed, and <hi>Fineo</hi> likewiſe, the kyng (was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed
of their eſcape) who perceiuyng the Marchauntes to
bee gone alſo, reſted aſſured that it was a ſet matche made, for
the ſtealyng <hi>Fiamma</hi> awaie. And beeyng full of rage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
towardes them all, cauſed certaine Galleis and other
light veſſelles to be armed in all haſte, and to be ſent after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
giuyng ſtraight charge and Commiſſion to his Captaines,
that either thei ſhould bryng <hi>Fineo</hi> and the Damſell, with the
cheefe of the Marchauntes aliue vnto hym, becauſe he would
cauſe them all three to bee buried aliue: or that thei could not
get them aliue, thei ſhould bring their thre heddes, for that he
would haue them bee ſet ouer the <hi>Cube,</hi> for an example and a
terrour to all others.</p>
               <p>But before thoſe Galleis and other veſſelles, could be in a
readineſſe to depart: Fortune not hauyng yet her fill of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutyng
and afflictyng theſe twoo poore Louers, cauſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
winde, with an extreame ſtorme and tempeſt to ariſe, by
force whereof, the veſſell wherein thei were, was not without
greate daunger, driuen backe again to <hi>Tuniſe,</hi> with ſo muche
greef and ſorrowe of all them that were in it, as thei maie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that knowe the crueltie and barbarouſneſſe of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But in the beginnyng of the ſtorme, the brother of <hi>Fineo</hi>
diſpairyng of his life, as he that was aſſured, either to be drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by rage of the winde and ſeas, or els to die in torment, if he
returned into the handes of thoſe Infidelles, gat hymſelf into
his Cockboate, and therein hazarded his life: and after muche
adoe, and a thouſande perilles of preſent death, recouered the
coaſte of Italie at the laſte, and retourned home to <hi>Sauona</hi> ful
of woe with heauie tidynges, declaryng vnto his father, that
either the Fregate would bee loſte, or els driuen backe again
to <hi>Tuniſe,</hi> where he was well aſſured, that bothe his brother,
and the yong Damſell his Louer, ſhould bee murthered in
moſte cruell maner.</p>
               <p>At whiche dolefull newes, the father, as if he had ſeen his
ſonne lye dedde before him, began to weepe and lament, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of his hard Deſtinie, that cauſed him to liue ſo long,
or reſerued him to ſee thoſe cruell and bitter daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:49"/>
                  <hi>Fineo</hi> ſeyng himſelf brought to ſo hard an exigent, for that
their veſſell was now driuen backe nere vnto <hi>Tuniſe,</hi> and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
that he ſhould feele the ſmarte of his faulte, and the
kynges anger in ſharpeſt maner and ſorte: beyng determined
to liue no longer, and to preuent the crueltie of the kyng drew
out his ſworde, and would there with haue ſtroken him ſelfe to
death. But <hi>Fiamam</hi> catchyng hym by the arme: Alas <hi>Fenio</hi>
(quoth ſhe) what ſhall become of me if you bee dead? Shall I
remaine behinde to endure the cruell tormentes, that I know
this Infidell hath prepared for me? Yet rather ſince that death
muſt needes deliuer vs of our miſfortunes, before you execut
vppon your ſelfe this your determination, ride me out of the
worlde, and deliuer me from the paines, whiche alreadie I
feele in my imaginacion, wherewith I aſſure my ſelf thei wil
bryng me to a ſhamefull death. And with theſe woordes offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
her breaſt vnto him, ſhe requeſted him to ſtrike her with
his Sworde. But <hi>Fineo</hi> bad her bee of good comfort, for your
beautie (my <hi>Fiamma</hi> ſaied he) beeyng ſo ſingulare as it is, I
knowe will ſaue you, and therefore you neede not feare, and I
alone ſhould be the man that thei would plague, and torment
to death for vs bothe, and therefore (my deare) ſuffer me to dye
before, and content thy ſelf to liue, and vouchſafe ſometyme to
remember thy vnfortunate <hi>Fineo</hi> when he is dedde.</p>
               <p>Whileſt thei were thus talkyng and debatyng, whiche
ſhould firſte dye, the people whiche the Kyng had ſent out to
apprehende them, came and boorden their Fregate, and tooke
theim bothe, whom thei bounde in Chaines, and brought on
lande to the preſence of the kyng. Who as ſone as he behelde
the beautie of <hi>Fiamma,</hi> felt his former wrath and crueltie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to relente, and in muche milder maner, then the twoo
Captiues hoped or looked for, he ſaied vnto her: tell me what
moued you, I praie you faire Damſell to run awaie, and flie
from me, at whoſe handes you had no cauſe to looke for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entreatie, then louing and freendly? <hi>Fiamma</hi> who in that
yere and a halfe, that ſhe had been in the <hi>Cube,</hi> had learned the
language indifferently well: made aunſwere vnto him. That
no cauſe or meanyng to flie from hym, but her earneſt deſire
<pb facs="tcp:7038:50"/>
to enioye <hi>Fineo,</hi> whom ſhe had loued, and choſen for her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
many yeres before, had forced her to doe that whiche ſhe
had doen: And herewith ſhe told hym, the beginnyng of their
acquaintance and loue, and how many perilles and daungers
thei had run through, ſtill hopyng one daie, to come vnto that
happie hower, wherin their troubles ſhould haue an ende, and
that thei might bee honeſtly vnited, and enioye one an other:
And finallie, caſtyng her ſelf doune at his feete, with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
of teares, ſhe beſought hym with all humilitie to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
her, if ſhe had offended him, and withall to forgiue <hi>Fineo</hi>
ſince that long and faithfull loue, had made them to procure
the accompliſhement of their deſires.</p>
               <p>The teares of <hi>Fiamma,</hi> and the onely name of Loue were
of ſuche force and vertue, in the harte of the kyng, though he
were barbarous, and cruell of Nature, that the Ire and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whiche he had conceiued againſt theim before, was then
conuerted and chaunged into pitie, and compaſſion of their
miſfortunes: and where before he had appointed a cruell death
to bee their puniſhementes, he now determined to ouercome
with his courteſie, the frowardneſſe of their peruerſe Fortune
and to make theim, after ſo many perilles and daungers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
and happie, and to ſee an ende at laſte of their miſeries
by makyng theim to enioye their longe hoped for deſires.
Wherfore, hauing cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be bothe forthwith vnbound,
he tooke from his owne finger, a meruailous faire and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rubie, and giuyng it vnto <hi>Fineo,</hi> he ſaied vnto him: ſince
your Fortune hath been ſuche, that after ſo many ſtraunge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures,
and through ſuche daungers, you are fallen into my
handes: I for my parte will not bee he, that will extinguiſhe,
or quenche the flames of ſo feruent and conſtaunt Loue, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe
or diſſolue the bandes, wherewith your hartes be bounde
and knitt together. And therefore <hi>Fineo,</hi> I doe not onely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
you bothe, but alſo I will haue thee, before thou departe
hence, to wedde this Damſell with this Ring, and to cake her
for thy wife, and that ſhe henceforthe enioye thee for euer as
her houſebande. It is not to be demaunded, whether the twoo
Louers, (who looked for none other of the kynges courteſies
<pb facs="tcp:7038:50"/>
then death) were glad to heare hym vſe thoſe ſpeeches, yea or
no. But bothe beeyng fallen on their knees, and in humbleſt
maner, hauyng yeelded their thankes vnto his Maieſtie. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi>
in his preſence Wedded <hi>Fiamma,</hi> and tooke her for his
wife, to the vnſpeakable ioye and contentation, of bothe their
hartes and mindes. And the kyng to honour their Mariage,
cauſed a ſumptuous feaſt to bee prepared, with no leſſe charge
and aboundaunce of all thynges, then if he had Married a
Daughter of his owne, to ſome greate Lorde, or cheef manne
of that Countrey.</p>
               <p>And after certaine daies, the twoo yong Maried Louers,
beyng deſirous to returne into their owne Countrey, he gaue
theim verie riche and coſtlie preſentes, and ſent theim honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
accompanied home to <hi>Sauona:</hi> Whoſe arriuall was no
leſſe meruailous, then ioyfull to the Father and Brother of
<hi>Fineo,</hi> and to all the Citee, thei hauyng been aſſuredlie eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and accoumpted as dedde. Afterwardes thei ſent to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi>
to <hi>Fiammas</hi> Father and Brother, certifiyng of all that
had happened, who then perſwadyng themſelues, that God &amp;
Nature had created thoſe twoo yong folke, to be matched and
ioyned together in Wedlocke, were wel contented with that,
whiche thei ſawe was Gods will ſhould bee. And beyng gone
bothe to <hi>Sauona,</hi> the Father embraced and accepted <hi>Fineo</hi> for
his Sonne in Lawe, and the Brother for his Brother in law.
And the twoo yong Louers liued euer after, in greate happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and felicitie: giuyng by this ſucceſſe of their hard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

any farther in this Hiſtorie,
I muſte deſire you to arme your
ſelues with pacience in readyng
hereof, that if you finde any thyng
that might breede offence to your
modeſte myndes, take it in this
ſorte, that I haue written it onely
to make you merrie, and not to
ſette you a ſnarryng or grudgyng againſt me, for although I
meane to preſent you with a Chapter of Knauerie, yet it ſhall
be paſſable, and ſuche as you maie verie well permit, and the
matter that I mynde to write, is vpon this queſtion, whither a
man were better to be maried to a wiſe Harlot, or to a fooliſhe
ouerthwarte and brauiyng woman, this queſtion I knowe
will ſeme very doubtfull vnto ſome, and yet in my opinion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
eaſie to be anſwered, and to ſpeake my minde without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation
of bothe thoſe euills, I thinke the firſt is leaſt, and
therefore is to bee choſen: and herein I could alledge for my
better proofe, an example of the auncient <hi>Romaines,</hi> who in al
their gouernmentes were moſte wiſe and politique, emongſt
<pb facs="tcp:7038:51"/>
whom the infirmitie of the firſt was borne withall, becauſe it
proceeded of the frailtie of the fleſhe, but the courage of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was euer condemned, for that it did abound fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wicked
and miſcheuous mynde. And in common reaſon, it is not leſſe
noyſome for a man, to liue accompanied with a wife, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe will ſome tyme flie out, can ſo wiſely, diſſemble
with her houſbande, that he ſhall neuer ſo muche as ſuſpecte
her, whereby he ſhall receiue no diſcontentment in his minde,
then to be bedfellowe with <hi>Xantippa</hi> a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſcold, who daie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and hourely will be checking, taunting, and railing at him,
in ſuche ſorte, that he ſhall thinke himſelf moſte bleſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
when he is fartheſt from her companie, but for your better
confirmation, I haue ſet forthe this Hiſtorie of two brethren,
the one of them married to a wenche, that could ſo cunningly
behaue her ſelf towardes hym, that he had thought ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
there had been no other God but himſelf, &amp; yet by your
leaue, ſhe would take reaſon when it was proffered her, but
what of that: the harte neuer greeues, what the eyes ſee not.
The other was married to a Dame, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her nauill doune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
was more chaſt and continent, but otherwiſe of her tong
ſuche a deuill of Hell, that the poore man her houſbande could
neuer enioye merry daie nor houre, although he deuiſed many
a pretie remedie, as by the readyng of the proceſſe of this tale
you ſhall better perceiue, whiche followeth in this ſorte.</p>
               <p>There was ſometyme remaining in a famous Citie twoo
brethren, the eldeſt (according to the cuſtome of the place) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
his fathers goods and poſſeſſions after his death, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he was wel able to liue, the yongeſt had neither landes nor
liuynges, ſauyng that his Father had trained hym vp in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng,
whereby he was able to gouerne hymſelf, in all maner
of companies where ſoeuer he became. Theſe two brethren
beyng wearie of their ſingle liues, diſpoſed themſelues to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
The eldeſt beyng of hymſelf well able to liue, ſought a
wife onely for her beautie, without any other reſpect either to
her conditions or riches, and as the prouerbe is (he that ſéekes
ſhal finde) ſo in the ende he lighted on a Gentlewoman, called
by the name of Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> whoſe beautie in deede was
<pb facs="tcp:7038:52"/>
very excellent, and there withall has a paſſyng readie witte,
Marie her trainyng vp had not been after the beſt, nor worſt
maner, but as a man might ſaie, after the common ſorte: this
gentlewoman he Married, who could ſo wel handle him with
kiſſynges, cullynges, and other amarous exerciſes, that her
houſband thought himſelf, the moſt fortunate man that liued,
to light on ſuche a wife, although ſhe cunningly armed his
head with hornes, as after you ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>The ſecond brother left (as you haue heard) without main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
or liuyng, ſought for a wife onely to releue his want,
and fortuned to hit of a widowe in deede with greate wealth,
but in conditions ſo ouerthwart, and ſo ſpiteful of her tongue,
that the poore man had not been Married fully out a moneth,
but he more then a thouſand tymes, curſed the Prieſt that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
hym, the Sexten that opened the Church doore when he
went to bee married, yea, and his owne vnhappie legges that
had carried his bodie to bee yoked to ſo great a miſcheef. But
becauſe I doe minde more orderly to tell you the maners of
theſe twoo Gentlewomen: I will firſt beginne with Miſtres
<hi>Doritie,</hi> whoſe houſbande after thei had been a while maried,
fortuned to fall ſicke, and then accordyng to that Countrey
maner, a Doctor of Phiſicke was preſently ſent for, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
many tymes to viſite his pacient, began to beholde and
contemplate the liuely beautie of this gentlewoman, and lent
her many rowling looke, and ſecrete countenaunces, in ſuche
ſorte that Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> beyng well practiſed in the Arte of
Loue, and ſeyng Maiſter Doctor to be a man as ſufficient, to
content a Gentlewoman in her Chamber that was whole, as
to miniſter Medicines to thoſe that were ſicke, did not onely
requite him againe with looke for looke, but ſhe yeelded hym
a large vſurie, and paied him more then fortie in the hundred:
Maiſter Doctor who was likewiſe ſkilful enough, could wel
perceiue whereto thoſe lookes did tende: Vpon a tyme beyng
alone in her companie, he ſaied vnto her as followeth.</p>
               <p>Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> if the experience whiche I haue learned
in Phiſickes arte, might craue credite, and make my tale to
bee the better beleeued, aſſure your ſelf then that I minde to
<pb facs="tcp:7038:52"/>
ſaie nothyng, but that that ſhal bee to your owne behoofe, and
the reaſon that makes me to enter into this diſcourſe, is the
pitie that I take to ſee ſo proper a gentlewoman as your ſelf,
ſhould be ſo deceiued in a houſbande, who although you ſhall
finde hym bothe honeſt, gentle, and louing, yea, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
maie content you with ſuch rightes, as appertaine to the
Marriage bedde, yet aſſure your ſelf he ſhall neuer be able to
get you with child, conſideryng your Natures and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be ſo farre different the one from the other, whereby you
are like for euer to remaine without iſſue, and one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
comfortes that maie happen vnto vs in this worlde, is to
ſee our ſelues as it were regenerate and borne a newe in our
children, and barrenneſſe in the auncient tyme, hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
not onely infamous, but alſo moſte hateful amongſt
women, in ſo muche that Sara gaue her owne Handmaide to
her houſband, becauſe ſhe could not her ſelf conceiue a childe:
but I would wiſhe women more witt then to followe Saras
example. God defende their ſhould bee ſo fooliſhe to giue their
Maidens to their Houſbandes, I would wiſhe them rath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

them ſelues to take their men: it hath been euer holden for the
greater wiſedome, rather to take then to giue, and ſure thei
ſhall finde it more for their owne profites, that if their houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
want be ſuche, that he is not able to get a child, to take
helpe of ſome other, that maie ſupplie his imperfections, but
I truſt I ſhall not neede to vſe many perſwaſions, conſidering
that euery wiſe woman will thinke, that I haue reaſon on my
ſide: Thus Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> you haue heard the ſomme of my
tale, proteſtyng, that if my ſeruice maie any waies ſtande you
in ſteade, I am as readie to obeye, as he ouer whom you haue
power to commaunde.</p>
               <p>Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> who all this while had well pondered his
woordes, knewe very well how to whett Maiſter Doctor on,
and the more to ſet his teeth on edge, aunſwered hym thus: I
perceiue Maſter Doctor you are ſomething pleaſantly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and hereafter when I ſhall finde my houſbandes infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to be ſuche as you haue ſaied, I meane to ſende for you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiryng
you, that you would not be out of the waie, to helpe me
<pb facs="tcp:7038:53"/>
when I haue neede.</p>
               <p>The Doctor knewe not well how to vnderſtande theſe
wordes, whether thei were merily ſpoken, or otherwiſe in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
of his former talke, aunſwered thus. Alas Miſtres <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi>
pardon me if my wordes ſeeme any thyng offenſiue vnto
you, aſſuryng you that in this meane ſpace, that I haue made
my recourſe to your houſbande, (whoſe healthe by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God, I haue now well reſtored) am my ſelf falne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Feuer ſo extreame, as neither <hi>Galen, Hypocrates, Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,
Plinij,</hi> nor any other that euer gaue rules of Phiſicke,
could yet preſcribe a Medicine for the malladie, or diet to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the humour that feedes it: I ſhall not neede to vſe long
circumſtaunce in the matter, knowyng your wiſedome to bee
ſuche, that you can well conceiue the ſomme of all my greef, it
is your beautie that is like to breede my bane, and hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
driuen me into the greateſt depth of daunger, vnleſſe ſome
plaintes of pitie maie preuaile, to yeeld remorſe to hym, that
vowes hymſelf to doe you ſeruice duryng life.</p>
               <p>Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> ſeing the matter ſorted out as ſhe looked
for, could tell wel enough how to handle maiſter Doctor, and
to make hym the more eger, ſhe delaied him of with doubtfull
ſpeeches, but yet fedde hym ſtill with ſuche entiſing and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt
countenaunces, that miniſtred greate hope of comforte
to his deſeaſe, ſhe aunſwered thus.</p>
               <p>And could you then finde in your harte (Maiſter Doctor)
to deceiue your very freend of his deare and louyng life, how
can you offer hym ſo manifeſt an iniurie, to whom you are ſo
lately linckt in ſo great a league of freendſhip, as is betweene
my houſband and your ſelf, I can not thinke maiſter Doctor,
that it is good wil that hath cauſed you to moue this ſute vnto
me, but rather to ſee how I were diſpoſed, or peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture you
vſe theſe wordes for exerciſe ſake, knowing the faſhion of you
men to bee ſuche, as by praiſyng of our beautie, you thinke to
bring vs into a fooles paradize, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we wil giue credite ſtraight
waie, that you loue vs ſo ſoone as you ſhall but tel vs the tale:
but for my part (Maiſter Doctor) although I want wit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter
you with words, ſo likewiſe I want will to beleue any
<pb facs="tcp:7038:53"/>
thing that you haue ſaid, to be otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wordes of courſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpeeches did ingender ſuche a nomber of ſwetee and
ſowre alterations in Maiſter Doctor, that for his life he wiſte
not how to vnderſtand them: one while thei were like to driue
hym to diſpaire: an other while thei ſomethyng quieted hym
with hope, but in the ende determining to follow what he had
begonne, he ſaied.</p>
               <p>Sweete Miſtres, moſt humbly I deſire you to accompt of
me, not according to my deſertes, which as yet are none at al,
but according to the dutiful ſeruice, whiche hereafter I vowe
faithfully to doe vnto you, and for the better teſtimonie of my
words which (as you ſaie) ſeeme to be of ſuch ordinary courſe,
I deſire no other credite maie bee giuen them, then ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to my deedes, when it ſhal pleaſe you to commaund:
but alas for the iniurie whiche you ſpeake of, that I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to your houſband, who in deede I make accompt to be my
very freende, what is he I praie you, that is able to preſcribe
lawes to loue? And as loue is without law, ſo is it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
either of freende or foe, father or brother, riche or poore,
mightie or weake, vertuous or vicious: the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
&amp; generall, that I ſhould but waſte the time to repeate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But (Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi>) I proteſt the very cauſe that maketh
me to moue this matter vnto you, is for no ill wil that I beare
to your houſband, but for the good will I beare to your ſwete
ſelf, you maie vſe your houſbande as your houſbande, and me
as your freende, glad to ſtande at reuerſion, when your houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
maie take his fil of the banket, and be glutted with more
then enough: farther, if you make ſo greate accompt of your
houſbandes good likyng as you ſaie, what wiues be euer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beloued, or more made of by their houſbandes, then thoſe
that haue diſcretion to helpe their frendes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei need. But
what ſottiſhe opinion is this, whiche ſo many doeth holde, that
thei thinke it ſo great an iniurie for a man, to ſeeke the wife of
his freende, when he is attached by loue, whoſe arreſt, neither
Goddes nor men haue bin euer able to reſiſt. But I praie you
(Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi>) if I might aſke you this queſtion, would
you not thinke your good wil better beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
<pb facs="tcp:7038:54"/>
freende then his foe, if you loue your houſbande, I am
ſure you wil ſaie I haue reaſon, what ſhould I longer trouble
you then with circumſtances: I knowe you are wiſe, and now
I deſire you for the good will that you beare to your houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
to pitie me his freende, whom I truſt you will reſtore
with one drop of mercy, &amp; the rather for your houſbands ſake.</p>
               <p>How thinke you Gentlewoman, bee not theſe gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
to be vſed by a Doctor, Marie he was no Doctor of
Deuinitie, and therefore you neede not followe his doctrine,
vnleſſe you liſte your ſelues, but this pitifull Gentlewoman,
ſeyng Maiſter Doctor at ſuche deſperate pointes, for feare of
damning of her owne ſoule, that ſo deare a freend to her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
as Maiſter Doctor was, ſhould periſhe and bee ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
caſt awaie through her default, ſhe receiued hym for her
freend, and ſo I praie God giue them ioye.</p>
               <p>But it fortuned afterwardes, this Gentlewoman to light
into the companie of a Lawyer, who perceiuing this Dame to
be of ſuche excellent beautie, ioyning himſelf ſome thing nere
her, he ſaied: Gentlewoman, although I haue no ſkill in the
arte of Paintyng, yet aſſure your ſelf, your forme and paſſyng
beautie, is ſo ſurely engrauen and fixed in my mynde, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
your ſelf were abſent, I could draw your perfect cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfecte,
ſauing that I thinke all the Apothecaries in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
were not able to furniſhe me with colours, to make the
perfect diſtaine of the beautie in your face.</p>
               <p>Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> knowing whereto theſe ſpeeches preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
aunſwered: In deede ſir, it ſhould ſeeme you would proue
a paſſyng Painter, that can ſo cunnyngly Painte foorth with
wordes, that whiche I knowe is too farre vnworthie of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
a floriſhe, as you would giue it. Miſtres (ꝙ the Lawier)
if I haue committed any offence, in theſe woordes whiche I
haue ſpoken, it is in that I haue taken vpon me to praiſe your
beautie, and not able to giue it ſuche due commendations, as
I ſee it doeth deſerue, the ſight whereof doeth ſo captiuate my
affections, and hath ſo creepled all my ſences, that it hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me in maner to forgette my ſelf, no maruaile then though
my tongue doth faile, and is not able to expreſſe the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:54"/>
of you, vnto whom with vowe of continuall ſeruice, I ſubiect
my life, liuing, and libertie, if it pleaſe you to accept of it.</p>
               <p>This Gentlewoman, that had yet but one freend to truſt
vppon, beſides her houſbande, beganne to thinke that ſtore
was no ſore, and therfore determined not to forſake his frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
offer, but firſt ſhe demaunded of hym of his facultie, and
what trade of life he vſed, to which he aunſwered, that he was
a Gentleman appertaining to the Lawe. It maie well bee ſo
(ꝙ ſhe) for I perceiue by your experience, that this is not the
firſt Plea that you haue framed. And yet beleeue me (ꝙ the
Lawyer) I was neuer brought before to pleade at Beauties
barre, but ſith my happe is ſuche, I humblie holde vp my han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
deſiryng to be tried by you courteſie and myne owne Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
contenting my ſelf to abide ſuche dome and iudgement,
as it ſhall pleaſe you to appoinct, beeyng the cheef and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Iudge your ſelf, ſhe repliyng, ſaied: Seeing you haue
conſtituted me to giue Sentence at my pleaſure, it is not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

office of a good Iuſticer, to be parciall in his owne cauſe, and
therefore this is the hope you ſhal looke for at my handes, that
if hereafter in your deedes, I ſhall ſee as plaine proofe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
good will, as your woordes by pretence importe likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of earneſt Loue, you ſhall finde me ready to render ſuche
recompence, as ſhall fall out to your owne contentation and
likyng. This comfortable aunſwere, very well pleaſed hym,
and within a very little ſpace after, he ſo handeled the matter,
that he had entered his action in her Common place. Thus
what betweene Maiſter Doctor on the one ſide, who was ſtill
miniſtryng of Phiſicke vnto her, ſo long as there were any
Drugges remainyng in his Storehouſe, and the Lawyer on
the other ſide, who ſufficiently enſtructed her with his Lawe:
thei vſed ſuche hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto this Gentlewomans companie, that
the one beganne to growe ſuſpicious on the other, and eche of
them deſirous to haue her ſeuerall to hymſelf, beganne in the
ende to enuaigh the one againſt the other: the Doctor againſt
the Lawier, and the Lawier againſt the Doctor, and to tel her
to her face what thei ſuſpected, the one againſt the other. But
Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> beeyng very angrie with them bothe, that
<pb facs="tcp:7038:55"/>
would ſo narrowlie looke into her doynges, did thinke it had
been ſufficient for reaſonable men, that ſhe had receiued them
into her fauor, and as often as it had pleaſed them to come, ſhe
welcomed them as themſelues did deſire, and what can a man
deſire any more, then to drinke ſo often as he ſhall be a thirſt?
But with faire ſpeeches ſhe contented them bothe for a tyme:
but ſhe thought in the end, to finde a remedie for that miſchief.</p>
               <p>And thus it fell out, that a Souldiour, who was lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned

feelde, to ſee the Enſignes of his enemies, and was ſo farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharged
with her loue: that but for feare to haue been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by the paſſers by, he would haue ſtoode ſtill gazyng and
lookyng vpon her: but learnyng in the ende, that ſhe was the
Miſtres of the houſe, he began to deuiſe how he might make
her vnderſtande the feruencie of his Loue, on whiche he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to write vnto her: But then he knewe not how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
his Letter, becauſe Souldiours are very ſeldome accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to endite, eſpecially any of theſe louyng lines: And to
ſpeake vnto her, he was likewiſe to learne how to vſe his tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
neither wiſte he how to come into her preſence, but you
ſhall ſee Fortune fauoured hym: For in an Euenyng as he
paſſed through the ſtreate, ſhe was ſittyng alone in her doore
to take the aire, and commyng vnto her, not knowyng for his
life how to begin his tale: In the ende, Miſtres (ꝙ he) I praie
you is your houſbande within? No ſurely ſir (ꝙ ſhe) he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade
in the Toune, but I knowe not where: And I would
gladly haue ſpoken with hym (ꝙ the Souldiour) if he had bin
within: Beleeue me ſir he is not within (ꝙ ſhe) but if it pleaſe
you to leaue your arrande with me, at his commyng home I
will ſhew hym your minde. In faith Miſtres (ꝙ the ſoldiour)
<pb facs="tcp:7038:55"/>
my arrande is not greate, I would but haue craued his helpe
in chuſyng me a wife, becauſe I perceiue he hath ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in the facultie, or els I think he could neuer haue choſen
ſo well for hymſelf. If your arrande be no other then this (ꝙ
Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi>) you may at your owne leiſure come and doe
it your ſelf, and as for my houſbandes experience that you

beſtowe on me, accordingly as you ſhould ſee me able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
it. Why ſir (ꝙ Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi>) I doe not vnderſtande
wherevnto your ſpeeches doeth tende, neither what parte you
would haue me to giue you, when I haue alreadie beſtowed
of my houſbande, bothe my hande, my harte, my minde, and
good will. Alas Gentlewoman (ꝙ the Souldiour) theſe bee
none of them that I would craue, there is yet an ouerplus
whiche you haue not yet ſpoken of, whiche if you pleaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
of a Souldiour, I ſhould think my ſelf the happieſt man
aliue, whoſe loue and good likyng towards you is ſuche, that
I truſt in tyme to come, your ſelf will iudge me worthie, for
my well deſeruyng zeale, to haue deſerued hire. Souldiours
are ſeldome ſeene (ꝙ Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi>) to marche vnder the
banner of <hi>Venus,</hi> but what ſo euer you bee, doe you thinke to

or would you make me beleeue that you loue me as
you ſay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue no more reſpect to the hurt of my ſoule.
Gentlewoman (ꝙ the Souldiour) I am not able to encounter
you with wordes, becauſe it hath not been my profeſſion, nor
trainyng vp, but if you doubte of my loue and good likyng:
Pleaſe it you to make triall, commaund any thyng that your

where you thinke that I goe aboute to ſeeke the preiudice or

               <p>Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> who had been wel acquainted before with
many ſuiters, had neuer been appoſed with ſuche a rough he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
fellow, that was ſo blu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and plaine, aſwell in his geſture,
as in his tearmes: Began to think with her ſelf, that he might
well be a Souldiour, for ſhe knewe that thei had little ſkill in
the courting of Gentlewomen, yet ſhe perceiued by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce,
the vehemencie of his loue he bare vnto her, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
his plainneſſe, ſhe began to thinke him more fitter for
her diet, then either Maiſter Doctor, or Maiſter Lawier, that
could not be contented the one with the other, when ſhe gaue
them bothe ſo muche as thei could craue, and therefore thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
with her ſelf, that to looſe any longer tyme were but a
poinct of folly, takyng the Souldiour by the hande, ſhe ledde
hym vp into a Chamber, where other ſpeeches were paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them in ſecrete, whiche I could neuer yet vnderſtand,
and what thei did farther when thei were by themſelues, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
I praie geſſe you, but this I muſt aduertiſe you of,
that before thei came forth of the Chamber againe, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour
had pleaſed Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> ſo well, that bothe Maiſter
Doctor, and Maiſter Lawier, were put quite out of conceipt,
fo that from that tyme forwardes when thei came of their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the Gentlewoman was not wel at caſe, or ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with her, or ſhe was not at home, that thei could no more
ſpeake with her: whiche tourned them bothe into a wonderful
agonie. The Doctor had thought ſhe had forſaken him for the
loue of the Lawier: The Lawier he thought as muche by the
Doctor, that in the ende not knowyng otherwiſe how to ſpit
out their venime againſt her, thei deuiſed eache of them a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whiche thei ſent her. The firſt of theſe letters deliuered
vnto her, came from the Doctor, whiche letter he left vnpoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of purpoſe, becauſe that in the readyng of it, it might bee
poincted two waies, and made to ſeeme either to her praiſe or
diſpraiſe, but Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> her ſelf in the readyng of it,
poincted it as I haue ſet it doune, and followeth in this ſorte.</p>
               <p>And who would haue thought miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> that for the
<pb facs="tcp:7038:56"/>
louyng aduertiſementes giuen you by your freend, you could
ſo lightly haue ſhaken hym of, if I burdened you with any
thyng that might ſeeme greeuous vnto you, thinke it was
Loue that ledde me vnto it, for that I proteſt inwardly in my
mynde, I neuer did eſteeme you otherwiſe then for as honeſt
a gentlewoman as lines this daie in Bridewell. I haue heard
ſaie ſome haue been ſcourged more vpon euill will, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deſertes whereof thei might iuſtly be accuſed, ſo if it be my
happe to ſuffer vndeſerued penaunce, I muſt impute it to my
owne miſfortune, but yet contrarie to my expectation, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deryng
how I haue euer taken you to bee giuen in your codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to practiſe vnſeemely, filthie, and deteſtable thynges: I
knowe you haue euer abhorred to liue chaſtly, decently, and
orderly: you haue euer been trained vp to be wanton, proude,
and incontinent: you neuer tooke delight in that was good,
honeſt, or conmendable: you wholie gaue your ſelf to leude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
luſt, and Lecherie: you were an open enemie to vertue:
a freend to vice. What ſhould I ſaie, I doe but waſte the time
in the ſetting of you forth, and therefore will leaue you like as
I found you.</p>
               <p>This Letter brought Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> into ſuche a furie
when ſhe had peruſed it, that ſhe ſware by no Beggers ſhe
would be ſo reuenged vpon the Doctor, that ſhe would make
hym a ſpectacle to all the Phiſitions in the worlde, how thei
ſhould abuſe an honeſt gentlewoman while thei liued. And in
the middeſt of her Melancholie, her deareſt freende the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour
happened to come in, whom ſhe made partaker of all
her ſecretes, ſhewyng him the Letter whiche Maiſter Doctor
had ſent her: and as thei were deuiſyng how to vſe reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Meſſenger was knockyng at the doore, to deliuer a
letter from the Lawyer, the tenure whereof followeth in this
maner,</p>
               <p>Maie this bee the rewarde of my true and faithfull Loue,
whiche ſo firmely I haue borne thee? Or is this the delight of
thy daliaunce, whiche ſo many tymes thou haſte vſed with
me? So careleſly to ſhake me of, as though I had committed
ſome notable abuſe, when in deede I haue loued thée a greate
<pb facs="tcp:7038:57"/>
deale more, then I perceiue thou art worthie of. Oh feminine
flatterie. O fained faunyng. O counterfect courteſie. O deep
diſſimulation: But what hope is otherwiſe to be looked for in
theſe Kites of <hi>Creſſides</hi> kinde. Or what conſtancie maie any
man thinke to finde in a woman? No no, if a man maie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſpeake of their ſexe, you ſhall neuer finde them but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfect
in their courteſie, fained in their frendſhip, diſſembling
in their deedes, and in all their actions moſte daungerous, for
men to deale withall? For if ſhe haue a faire face, it is euer
matched with a cruell harte, their heauenly lookes with hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
thoughtes: their modeſt countenaunces, with mercileſſe
mindes: thei haue witte, but it is in wiles: if thei loue, it is too
vehement: when thei hate, it is to the death. But good God,
with how many fopperies are thei accuſtomed to feede fooles,
I meane ſuche as bee Louemakers and Suiters vnto them,
whom thei delaie with as many deuiſes, as thei be in number
that ſeekes to ſerue them. Some thei lure with lookes: ſome
thei practiſe with promiſes: ſome thei feed with flattery: ſome
thei delay with deliance: ſome thei winde in with wiles: ſome
thei keepe with kiſſes: ſome thei diet with diſſimulation. One
muſt weare her Gloue, an other muſt weare her Garter, an
other muſt weare her Coulers: an other ſhall weare the ſpoile
of as muche as ſhe can get from all the reſt by couſonage, and
yet to ſee how daintie theſe darlinges, wil ſeeme to thoſe that
bee not acquainted with their cuſtomes, were able to daſhe a
yong man out of countenaunce: I warrant you, thei can make
it more nice then wiſe: more coie then comely, more fine then
honeſt. And to whom doe thei make the matter moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deſerueth beſt to be rewarded: For where
thei ſee a man that is drouned in affection towardes them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him thei will triumphe, and can tell how to ride the foole
without a ſnaffle: one while thei will croſſe him with froward
language, then againe comforte hym with ſome fained looke.
Now ſhe driues him into deſperation with frounyng face, by
and by ſhe baites hym againe with banquettes of vncertaine
hope, ſuche is their euill nature (as I ſaie) that thei wil ſhewe
them ſelues moſte ſquemiſhe and daintie, to hym that loues
<pb facs="tcp:7038:57"/>
them moſte entirely, and him that ſeekes them leaſt diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly,
hym thei rewarde with their coldeſt courteſie. For better
proofe, lette a man ſeeke to winne one of theſe tender peeces,
that goes for a maide, honeſtly, and in the waie of Marriage,
and I warrant you ſhe will make the matter more coye and
nice to hym that meanes good earneſt, then to an other that
comes but to trie and proue them. And what ſignes of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe
wil thei ſeeme to make, when a man doeth but touch
them: fainyng them ſelues to be too young, when (in deede) if
thei once paſt the age of fifteene yeres (if thei were not a feard
of breeding of bugges in their belly) by their good willes thei
would neuer be without the company of a man. Thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
their nature is openly to ſcorne all men, bee their loues
neuer ſo honeſt, and ſecretly to refuſe no man be his luſt neuer
ſo leude. Full aptly did <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbes compare
you to Wine, that can make vs ſo dronken wich your deuiſes,
that notwithſtandyng we ſee the ſnares with our eyes, which
you haue ſette to entangle vs, wee can not ſhunne the baite,
which we knowe will breede our bane. Thus muche Miſtres
<hi>Doritie,</hi> I haue thought good to ſignifie vnto you, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie
at this tyme hath cauſed me ſo generally to enuaie
againſt your whole Sexe, not otherwiſe mindyng to accuſe
your ſelf perticularly, knowyng that if you ſhould otherwiſe
haue vſed me then you haue, you ſhould haue degreſſed and
ſwarued quite from your kinde, and ſo I leaue you.</p>
               <p>Gentlewomen I beſeeche you forgiue me my fault, in the
publiſhyng this infamous letter, I promiſe you I doe but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
it accordyng to the copie, whiche this vnhappie Lawier
ſent to Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> and when I had well conſidered the
blaſphemie that he had vſed againſt your ſexe, I cut my penne
all to peeces, wherewith I did copie it out, and if it had not
been for the hurtyng of my ſelf, I promiſe you I would haue
cut and mangled my owne fingers, wherewith I held the pen
while I was writing of it: and truſt me according to my ſkil,
I could well haue founde in my harte, to encounter him with
an aunſwere in your defence, but then I was interrupted by
an other as you ſhall well perceiue. For the Souldiour,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:58"/>
whiche you haue heard ſpoken of, that was remainyng with
Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> when he had peruſed this Letter, was put
into a wonderfull chafe, and in the middeſt of his furie, he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>Ah moſte vilde and blaſphemous beaſt, what art thou that
with ſuche exclamations, goeſt about to defame thoſe, whom
by all honeſt humanitie and manhood, we be willed ſpecially
to loue, honour, and reuerence, what art thou? A man, a deuill
or a ſubtill Lawyer, yea ſurely, and ſo thou maieſt well be, and
herein haſte thou ſhewed thy ſelf no whit at all to degreſſe
from thy profeſſion. For as at the firſt the Lawes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
to miniſter Iuſtice, and to giue euery one his right,
ſo now are thei made by the practiſe of a nomber of Pettie
foggers, the inſtrumentes of all iniquitie and wrong. Euen ſo
that worthie ſexe, whiche at the firſt were giuen vnto man by
the almightie God himſelf, to be his cheefeſt comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.
See here the practiſe of a wicked Caitife, who with
his eloquence would perſwade vs, that thei were our greateſt
ruine and deſolations: Ah wicked wretche that thou art, how
thinkeſt thou to eſcape, thus to blowe forthe thy blaſphemie,
againſt thoſe bleſſed ones, whom God hath perfited aboue all
other creatures. For at their firſt creation, thei were made of
the moſte beſt and purified mettall of man, where man hym
ſelf was framed but of ſlime and droſſe: what reaſon then that
beeyng at the firſt framed moſte pure and perfect creatures,
but that thei ſhould continue their firſt perfection to the ende
of the worlde. And like as at the firſt thei were made more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then man, where ſhould wee now ſeeke for grace, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and goodneſſe, but onely in the feminine ſexe, accordyng
to their ſinguler creation.</p>
               <p>I truſt this is ſo euident that there is no man able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naie
it, and enough to proue, that as women at the firſt were
created moſte perfecte, ſo thei haue ſtill remained the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
of all grace vertue and goodneſſe, and that if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thyng founde in vs men that is worthie of commendation,
we are onely to giue thankes to women from whom wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it, as being deſcended from out their entrailes: but with
<pb facs="tcp:7038:58"/>
how greate and manifolde miſeries, ſhould we men be daiely
afflicted, were it not for the comforte wee finde at womens
handes, for beſides that by their induſtrie we be notified, made
more clendly, and kept ſwete, who otherwiſe of our ſelues we
ſhould become to bee moſte filthie and lothſome creatures, ſo
at all tymes and ſeaſons thei be ſo neceſſarie and conuenient
aboute vs, that it were impoſſible for vs to bee without their
bleſſed companies. Firſt, in our health thei content vs with
their familiaritie, in our ſickneſſe thei cheriſhe vs, in our mirth
thei make it more abounde, in ſorrowe their companie doeth
beguile our penſiue thoughtes, in pleaſure thei be our cheefe
delightes, in paine their preſence breedeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort our grief,
in wealth what greater treaſure then to enioye our beloued, in
want what greater wealth then a louing and faithful wife, in
peace we labour ſtill to get their likyng, in warres thei make
vs ſhewe our ſelues more valiaunt: but how is it poſſible that
women ſhould behaue themſelues, but that there are ſome wil
finde fault with them: Firſt, if ſhe bee familiare, we iudge her
to be light, if ſhe ſeeme any thing ſtraunge in her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

ah we ſaie ſhe is a daungerous Dame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if merrie, wee thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her to be naught, if ſad, we ſaie ſhe is more graue then honeſt,
if ſhe be talkatiue, wee ſaie ſhe is a tatlying houſwife, if ſilent,
we ſaie ſhe is a ſheepe, if clendly in her apparell, we ſaie ſhe is
proude, if plaine or homely, we ſaie ſhe is a doudie or a ſlut, if
thei denaie vs their curteſie when we ſue vnto them, wee ſaie
thei be cruell Tigers, Beares, and Bugges, if thei haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of vs, we diſcredit them amongſt our companions.</p>
               <p>But ſee here the cunnyng of a Caitife, that would wreaſt
the wordes of <hi>Salomon</hi> to the diſpraiſe of women, becauſe in
his Prouerbes he compareth them to Wine, but to interprete
the wordes of <hi>Salomon</hi> by <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelf: in an other place
of the ſame Prouerbes, he willeth Wine ſhould bee giuen to
comforte thoſe that bee feeble and weake, now compare theſe
places together and ſee what harme he hath doen to women,
and in my opinion, he could not more aptly haue made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
for as Wine is a comforte to theſe that are feeble and
weake, ſo are women our greateſt ſolace, both in ſickneſſe and
<pb facs="tcp:7038:59"/>
in health: But if any wil ſaie that Wine maketh vs dronken,
and from reaſonable men to become more brute then beaſtes.
I aunſwere that the fault is not to bee imputed to the Wine,
but to the beaſtlineſſe of him that taketh more then enough,
for there is nothyng ſo precious for our behoofes, but by our
owne abuſe we make it ſeeme moſt vile &amp; lothſome: And thus
graunting maiſter Lawier his compariſon to be true, he hath
doen little hurt, ſauing he hath ſhewed himſelf a diligent ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to his Maiſter the deuill, who is father of all lyes, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſo manifeſt a lye againſt ſuche harmeleſſe creatures.</p>
               <p>There were many other ſpeeches pronounced by this
Souldiour in the behalfe of women, whiche I haue forgot to
recite. But I praie Gentlewomen how like you by this Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour,
doe you not thinke hym worthie a Sargantes fee for
his aunſwere: in my opinion, you ought to loue Souldiours
the better for his ſake.</p>
               <p>But to retourne to Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> thoſe two letters had
ſo vexed her, that there was nothing in her minde but how ſhe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ght be reuenged. Her freende the Souldiour promiſed for
her ſake, that he would ſo cudgill both Maiſter Doctor, and
the Lawier, that thei ſhould not in one moneth after be able to
lift their armes to their heades, ſauyng he wiſt not how to get
them into a place conuenient, for that it was daungerous to
deale with them in the open ſtreates. Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> giuing
him twentie kiſſes for his courteſie, told him ſhe would deuiſe
to bring them into ſome place where he might worke his wil.</p>
               <p>Preſently after, Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> ſent for Maiſter Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
whom ſhe knewe very well how to handle, and in a milde
maner ſhe began greatly to blame hym, that being wiſe as ſhe
knew him to be, would ſo raſhly iudge of her, for that he might
wel knowe that there was ſome greate cauſe, that moued her
to vſe him as ſhe had doen, otherwiſe then he had coniectured:
and thus with many other like ſpeeches, ſhe ſo ſmothed the
matter with Maiſter Doctor, that ſhe made hym beleeue her
houſbande had ſome ſuſpition in their familiaritie, and that
by his commaundement ſhe had abſtained his companie for a
tyme, the which (Maiſter Doctor ꝙ ſhe) I did for no euill will
<pb facs="tcp:7038:59"/>
that I beare you, but for a tyme to bleare my houſebandes
eyes, thinkyng in the ende ſo to haue handled the matter, that
wee might haue continued our accuſtomed freendſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any maner of ſuſpition: And then drawyng forthe the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whiche the Doctor had ſent her (ſhe ſaied): But ſee Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Doctor your good opinion conceiued in me, loe, here the
reward that I haue for my courteſie beſtowed of you, thus to
raile and rage againſt me, as though I were the moſte nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtrumpet in a Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Doctor knowyng in what forme he had wright the
letter, and deſirous againe to renue his late acquaintaunce,
aunſwered, that he neuer writte letter vnto her, whereby he
had giuen any occaſion for her to take any greef. No haue?
(quoth Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi>) read you then here your own lines,
takyng hym the letter, whiche the Doctor as I tolde you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had left vnpointed, and therefore in the readyng, he poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it after this maner.</p>
               <p>And who would haue thought (Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi>) that for
the louyng aduertiſementes giuen you by your freende, you
could ſo lightlie haue ſhaken hym of, if I burdeined you with
any thing, that might ſeme greeuous vnto you, thinke it was
Loue that ledde me vnto it, for that I proteſted inwardlie in
my mynde, I did neuer eſteeme you otherwiſe, then for as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
a Gentlewoman as liues at this daie. In Bridewell I
haue heard ſaie, ſome haue been ſcourged more vpon euill wil,
then for any deſertes whereof thei might iuſtlie bee accuſed:
So if it bee my happe to ſuffer vndeſerued penaunce, I muſt
impute it to myne owne miſfortune, but yet contrarie to my
expectation, conſideryng how I haue euer taken you to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in your conditions: to practiſe vnſeemely, filthie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
thinges, I knowe you haue euer abhored: To liue
chaſtlie, decently, and orderlie, you haue euer been trained vp:
to bee wanton, proude, and incontinente, you neuer tooke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
In that was good, honeſt, or commendable, you wholie
gaue your ſelf: to lewdneſſe, luſte, and Lecherie, you were an
open enemie, to vertue a freende, to vice: what ſhould I ſaie, I
doe but waſte the tyme in ſettyng you forthe, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:7038:60"/>
will leaue you like as I founde you.</p>
               <p>I praie you Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi> (quoth the Doctor) where is
this railyng and raging you ſpeake of, I truſt I haue written
nothyng that might diſcontent you. Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
the Knauerie of the Doctor, and ſeeyng the matter fell
out ſo fitte for her purpoſe: Firſt giuyng him a freendly buſſe
ſhe ſaied. Alas my deare freende, I confeſſe I haue treſpaſſed,
in miſconſteryng of your lines: But forgiue me I praie you,
and now haue compaſſion of her, whoſe loue towarde you is
ſuche, that it is impoſſible for me to liue, without your good
likyng, and ſeyng that my houſebandes Ielouſie is ſo muche,
that you can haue no longer acceſſe to my houſe, but it muſte
needes come to his eare, by ſuche ſpie and watche as he hath
laied, neither my ſelf can goe abroade to any place, but I am
dogged, and followed by ſuche as he hath appoincted: But
now if your loue be but half ſo muche towardes me, as I truſt
I haue deſerued, and hereafter doe meane to requite. I haue
alreadie deuiſed a meane, how for euer I might enioye my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
freend, without either let or moleſtation of any one, ſeme
he neuer ſo muche to be offended at the matter.</p>
               <p>The Doctor the gladdeſt man in the worlde to heare theſe
newes, aunſwered: And what is it then that ſhould make you
ſtagger, or doubt of the fredndſhip of your louyng Doctor, no
not if thereby I ſhould hazard the loſſe, bothe of life &amp; goodes.</p>
               <p>Alas (quoth Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi>) GOD defende I ſhould
woorke you ſo greate a preiudice, and I beſeeche you vſe no
more ſuche ſpeeches vnto me, that I ſhould goe aboute to put
you into any ſuche perill, the remembraunce whereof is more
greeuous vnto me, then if I had felte the force of a thouſande
deathes, and now behold my determination, and what I haue
deuiſed: You haue a houſe not farre hence ſtanding in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
whiche you keepe for your ſolace, and recreation in the
time of Sommer: to this houſe I haue deuiſed, how you maie

to your owne vſe, and to my greate contentation, where
I maie at pleaſure enioye hym, more dearly beloued vnto me,
then the balles of mine owne eyes. And herewithall ſhe gaue
<pb facs="tcp:7038:60"/>
hym an other Iudas kiſſe, that the Doctor deſired her of all
frendſhip, not to be long in her determination, for that he was
readie to followe her direction, when ſoeuer it would pleaſe
her to commaunde: yea, if it were preſentlie he was readie.</p>
               <p>Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie,</hi> who haue driuen the matter to that paſſe
ſhe looked for, ſaied: Naie Maiſter Doctor, there reſteth yet
an other thyng, my houſebandes Ielouſie (as I tolde you) is
ſuche, that there muſt bee greate circumſpection vſed, in the
conueighyng of me awaie, and therefore giue eare to that I
haue deuiſed: I haue in my houſe a certaine Male with ſtuffe,
that is left with me, to be ſent by the Carriers into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
whereof my houſebande dooeth knowe verie well, this
ſtuffe I will cauſe to be ſecretly taken forthe, and to be ſent to
the Carriers, truſt vp in ſome other thing, without any know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
to any, ſauyng to my Maide, that ſhall worke this feate
her ſelf, whoſe truſtineſſe I knowe to bee ſuche, as there is no
ſuſpition to bee had in the matter, the whiche when ſhe hath
doen, ſhe ſhall truſſe vp me in theſame Male, then ſee that you
faile not to morowe in the Euening about eight of the clocke,
diſguiſed in a Porters weede, to come to my houſe to enquire
for theſame Male, whiche you ſhall ſaie, you will beare to the
Carriers, my Maide who ſhall of purpoſe, bee readie to waite
for your commyng at the hower, ſhall make no bones to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
you this Male, and thus without either doubt or Ielouſie
of any one, you maie carrie me into the feeldes, where for your
better eaſe you maie take me forthe, and diſguiſing our ſelues
wee maie walke together, to your houſe aforeſaied, where I
maie remaine without any maner of ſuſpition, or knowledge
to any, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe your ſelf.</p>
               <p>O moſte excellente deuiſe (quoth the Doctor) I haue this
matter alreadie at my fingers endes, and I warraunte you,
you ſhall ſee me plaie the Porter ſo cunninglie, that how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſo euer I meete, there ſhall none of them be able to ſuſpect
me: Thus with a feined kiſſe that ſhe againe beſtdwed of him,
for that time thei departed.</p>
               <p>Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie,</hi> in like maner ſent for the Lawier, whom
ſhe handled in like ſorte, as ſhe had doen the Doctor, makyng
<pb facs="tcp:7038:61"/>
hym beleeue, that her houſebandes Ielouſie was ſuche, as ſhe
durſt no more come in his companie: But of her ſelf ſhe loued
hym ſo entirely, that ſhe would hazard any thyng for his ſake,
and becauſe he ſhould the better beleeue it, to morrowe (quoth
ſhe) in the after noone, my houſebande will be forthe of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
wherefore I praie you faile not about three of the Clocke
to come and viſite me, when wee ſhall haue laiſure to diſporte
our ſelues, to our better contentation: Many like enticyng
woordes ſhe vſed, whiche ſo perſwaded the Lawier, then drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
no bad meaſure at all, he promiſed her not to faile, but he
would keepe his hower: and thus departed verie ioyfull, that
he had againe recouered his Miſtreſſe. And the nexte daie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as it had ſtroke three of the Clocke, he was knockyng at
the doore of this Gentlewoman, who lookyng for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng,
was readie to receiue hym, and vp thei goe together to
a Chamber, whiche ſhe had appoincted for the purpoſe: where
for a tyme ſhe dalied hym of with deuiſes: And ſodainlie her
maide (according as her Miſtreſſe had giuen her inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s)
came haſtelie to the Chamber doore, callyng her Miſtreſſe,
ſaiyng: that her Maiſter was come in, and had aſked for her:
Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie,</hi> who was not to learne to plaie her parte,
ſemed to be ſtriken into a wonderfull feare, alas? quoth ſhe to
the Lawier) for the loue of GOD keepe your ſelf ſecret for a
time, that I maie go doune and rid him awaie, if it be poſſible,
and thus goyng her waie doune, ſhe ſhuttes the dore after her.</p>
               <p>The Lawier who was readie to beraie hym ſelf for feare,
crepte vnder the Bedde, where ſhe lette hym alone, the ſpace
of an hower, and then commyng vp into the Chamber, and
could not ſee hym, ſhe beganne to muſe what was become of
hym: he hearyng one was come in at the Chamber doore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to prie out vnder the Beddes feete, and perceiuyng by
the ſkirte of her goune who it was, with a faint voice he ſaid:

Citee, and this Chamber is appointed for twoo of them to lie
in, that for my life I knowe not what ſhifte to make, nor how
to conueigh you hence.</p>
               <p>Alas (quoth the Lawier) then am I vtterlie vndoen, for the
loue of GOD, deuiſe ſome meanes tonueigh me out of the
houſe, for I would not remaine all night in this perplexitie,
no not for all the golde in the worlde. Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
a little pauſe, ſodainlie as though ſhe had an inuention,
but euen then come into her hedde, ſhe ſaied.</p>
               <p>I haue this onely remedie left, here is in the houſe a Male
full of ſtuffe, whiche ſhould this night be ſent to the Carriers:
my deuiſe is therefore to take forthe the ſtuffe, and laie it aſide
till ſometime the next weeke, when I will make ſhift to ſend
the ſtuffe awaie verie well, and you ſhalbee preſentlie packed
vp in this Male, whiche my Maide ſhall doe while I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
with my houſebande and his freendes, and ſo cauſing a
Porter to bee ſent for, he ſhall carrie you to your Chamber, or
to any other place, where it ſhall pleaſe your ſelf, ſo that my
houſebande ſeyng this Male goe forthe of doores, will thinke
it is the ſtuffe, whiche he knoweth this night ſhould be ſent.</p>
               <p>No better deuiſe in the worlde (quoth the Lawier) and let
the Porter conueigh this Male to my Chamber, you knowe

               <p>The matter thus determined, Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi> ſent vp her
Maide with this emptie Male, wherein ſhe truſſed vp the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wier,
and there ſhe left him liyng from fiue of the Clocke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it was paſt eight, and in the Sommer ſeaſon the weather

for a Male that ſhould goe to the Carriers, yea a Marie (quoth
the Maide) if you pleaſe to come in, it is readie for you, the
Doctor beyng a good ſturdie lubber, tooke vp the Male verie
<pb facs="tcp:7038:62"/>
eaſilie for feare of bruſing the Gentlewomans tender ribbes,
whom he had thought he had vpon his backe, and thus forth of
doores he goes, takyng the next waie towardes his lodgyng.</p>
               <p>Miſtreſſe <hi>Doritie</hi> with her beloued Souldiour (whom ſhe
had made priuie to her deuiſe) ſtoode where ſhe might ſe Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Doctor in his Porters weede, goyng with his carriage,
whereat when thei had awhile ſported them ſelues, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
followed maiſter Doctor an eaſie pace, but onely to kepe
the ſight of him, and the Doctor he tooke his waie through the
ſtreates with a maine pace, till he had recouered the feeldes,
where looking about him, to ſee what companie was ſtirryng
ſawe no bodie nere hym but the Souldier, whom he did not
knowe, and then croſſyng the waie from the common pathes,
he came to the ſide of a Bancke, and beeyng wearie (as he
was not to be blamed, conſideryng the knauiſhe burthen that
he had borne vpon his backe) he laiyng doune the Male ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie
vppon the ſide of the Bancke) ſeeyng no bodie but the
Souldier, who was but a little diſtaunce from hym, ſaied. Ah
my ſweete wenche, I can ſee no creature ſtirryng in all the
feeldes, but one man whiche is commyng this waie, who ſo
ſone as he is paſte, I will vndoe the Male.</p>
               <p>The Lawier in the Male, when he felt the Porter laie him
doune, was in a good hope, that he had been in his own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but hearing by theſe ſpeeches, that he was in the feeldes,
began to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture aſſuredly, that the Porter had ſpoken thoſe
wordes to ſome woman that was in this companie, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he was confederate, for the ſtealyng of ſuche thinges as thei
ſhould finde in the Male, and that when thei ſhould open the
Male and finde hym there, thei would not ſticke to cutte his
throte for feare, leaſt he ſhould bewraie them, and for the onely
ſpoile of ſuche thinges as he had aboute him, that the Lawier
was in ſuche a perplexitie, that he wiſt not for his life what he
might doe: one while he had thought to haue cried out for help
then he thought it would the ſoner bring him to his ende, and
as he continued thus in the middeſt of his muſe, the Souldier
was come to the place, and ſpeakyng to the Doctor, he ſaied:
Porter it ſeemeth thou haſte been knauiſhlie loden, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:7038:62"/>
thou art very hot, but what haſt thou in the male, I pray
thee, that thou art carriyng his waie ſo late in the Euening.
Marie (quoth the doctor) I haue ware there ſuche as it is, haſt
thou ware knaue (quoth the Souldier) is that a ſufficiente an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
what ware is it, mennes ware, or womens ware. Sir I
knowe not (quoth the Porter) I haue but the cariyng of it to a
gentlemans houſe that is here hard by, well (ꝙ the Souldier)
vndoe your truſſe, for I will ſe what wares you haue there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you and I departe, why ſir (ꝙ the Porter) ſhould I bee ſo
bold to vndo a gentlemans male, that is deliuered me in truſt
to be caried, no ſir you ſhall pardon me, if you were my father,
and herewithall he tooke the male vpon his backe, and began
to go his waies. But the Souldier knowing better what was
in the Male, then the Porter himſelf that caried it, and beyng
prouided for the purpoſe with a good Cudgell, let driue halfe
a doſen blowes at the Male, as it laie vpon his backe ſo ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that the Lawier cries out, alas, alas, alas. Why Porter
(quoth the Souldier) haue you quicke wares in your Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
meruaile you were ſo daintie in the ſhewyng of it.</p>
               <p>Here withall the Doctor laied doune his Male, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
doune to the Souldier, ſaied. Ah ſir for the loue of God
bee content, and I will not let to confeſſe the whole truthe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you: I haue a Gentlewoman in my Male, whiche I haue
ſtolne from her houſebande, and ſeyng you to be a gentleman
but yong in yeres, and impoſſible but that you ſhould loue the
companie of a faire woman, beholde, I will deliuer her vnto
you, to vſe at your pleaſure, and when you ſhall ſee tyme, to
reſtore her vnto me againe, deſiryng you ſir of all curteſie, to
ſeeke no other diſpleaſure againſt vs. You haue ſaied well (ꝙ
the Souldier) but is ſhe ſuche a one as is to bee liked, faire,
freſhe, and yong. Truſt me ſir (ꝙ the Doctor) if ſhe bee not as
faire, and well liking as any Dame within the walles of this
Citee, make me an example to all other, how thei ſhal diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with a Gentlemanne ſuche as you are. Thou ſaieſt well
(ꝙ the Souldier) and now I thinke long till I haue a ſight
of this Paragon, whiche thou haſte ſo praiſed vnto me. You
ſhall ſee her ſtraight waie (ꝙ the Doctor) and herewithall he
<pb facs="tcp:7038:63"/>
beganne to vnlaſe the Male with greate expedition, whiche
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had vnloſed at the one ende, that he might come to the
ſight of this Gentlewomans face (as he had thought) he ſaied
to the Souldier, ſee here the ſight which you ſo muche deſire,
and pullyng the ende of the Male open with his handes, the
Lawier thruſte forthe his hedde, and looked with ſuche a pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
countenaunce, as though he had been readie to be turned
of the Ladder: But the Doctor ſeeyng a face to appeare with
a long Bearde, was in ſuche a maze, that he could not tell in
the worlde what he might ſaie. The Souldier who had neuer
more a doe then to forbeare laughter, to ſee how theſe twoo,
the one beheld the other: Saied to the Doctor, and is this the
faire Gentlewoman that thou haſte promiſed me, haſte thou
no bodie to mocke but me, that with ſuche commendations
thou giueſt praiſe to a woman, whereby to ſette my teeth an
edge, and then in thende thus to delude me? But I will teach
thee how to plaie the knaue againe while thou liueſt, and here
withall he laied on with his Cudgell, ſparyng neither hedde,
ſhoulders, armes, backe, nor breaſt, and ſo bee bumbaſted the
Doctor, that for the ſpace of a quarter of a yere after, he was
not able to lift an Eurinall ſo hie as his hedde.</p>
               <p>The Lawier who had nothyng out of the Male but his
hedde, ſeeyng this fraie, ſtruggeled ſo muche as he could, to
haue gotten forthe, and to haue runne awaie, while the Porter
was a beatyng, but it would not bee, his armes were ſo ſurely
laced doune by his ſides, that for his life he could not get them
forthe.</p>
               <p>The Souldier, when he had throughlie requited Maiſter
Doctors Knauerie, that he had vſed againſt his beloued Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
in his letter, lefte hym, and beganne to bende hymſelf
towardes the Lawier: The Lawier ſeyng the Souldier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
had thought verely that he had been ſome good fellowe
that was walkyng there ſo late, to haue taken ſome prey, ſaid:
Oh ſir, for the loue of God ſpare my life, and take my purſe, to
whom the Souldier aunſwered: naie villaine, my commyng
is neither to take thy life nor thy purſe, but to miniſter reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemente
for thy large ſpeeches, whiche like a diſcourteous
<pb facs="tcp:7038:63"/>
wretche thou haſte vſed againſt a woman, and there with all
laied vpon hym ſo long as he was able to fetch any breath, and
then callyng the Porter vnto hym, he ſaied: Let theſe wordes
whiche I minde to ſpeake ſuffice for a warning to you bothe,
if euer I maie learne that any of you hereafter this do vſe any
miſdemeanour towardes any woman, either by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
aſſure your ſelues that although I haue but dallied with
you at this tyme, I wil deuiſe ſome one meane or other to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
reuenge, that all ſuche as you bee, ſhal take an example
by you. And thus I leaue you, goyng his waie to his ſweete
harte, tellyng her the whole diſcourſe how he had ſpedde, by
whom he was welcomed with a whole laſt of kiſſes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now to returne to thoſe two that were left in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
as you haue heard: the Doctor takyng good vewe of the
Lawyer, knewe him very well, but the Doctor was ſo diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in his Porters apparell, that the Lawyer did not knowe
hym, but ſaied vnto hym, a miſcheef light of al ſuche Porters,
that when thei bee put in truſt with carriages into the Citie,
will bring them into the feeldes to ſuche banquettes as theſe,
Marie ꝙ the Doctor a miſcheefe take all ſuche burthens, that
when a man hath almoſt broken his back with bearing them,
and then ſhall receiue ſuche a recompence for his labour as I
haue doen: Villaine (ꝙ the Lawyer) why diddeſt thou not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
me to my chamber as thou wert willed when thou diddeſt
receiue me, I would I had carried thee to the Gallowes (ꝙ
the Doctor) ſo I had eſcaped this ſcouryng, but I perceiue
this banquet was prepared for vs bothe, and here withall with
muche adoe he got of the Porters coate, and makyng hymſelf
knowne to the Lawyer, eache of them conferred with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how cunningly thei had been dealt withall, and did think
it not beſt for them any farther to deale in the matter, for feare
of farther miſcheefe, but with muche adoe got them home,
where the Lawyer kept his bedde very long after: But the
Doctor tooke <hi>Sparmaceti,</hi> and ſuch like thinges that be good
for a bruſe, and recouered hymſelf in a ſhorte ſpace.</p>
               <p>Now it fell out afterwardes that this Souldiour, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in greate credite with Miſtres <hi>Doritie</hi> (as he had well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued)
<pb facs="tcp:7038:64"/>
was imployed in the Kynges warres againſt forraine
fooes, with a greate number of others, where he ſpent his life
in his Princes quarrell, &amp; Miſtres <hi>Doritie,</hi> ſorrowyng a long
tyme the loſſe of ſo faithfull a freende, ſeeyng the diuerſitie of
men, that ſhe had made her choiſe amongſt three, and had fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
but one honeſt, feared to fall into any further infamie, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
herſelf to liue orderly, and faithfully with her houſbande,
all the reſt of her life, and her houſband who neuer vnderſtood
any of theſe actions, loued her dearely to his diyng daie.</p>
               <p>And now to ſaie ſomethyng of the other brother and his
wife, which as you haue heard was ſuche a notable ſcold, that
her houſbande could neuer enioy good daie, nor merie houre:
She was ſuche a deuill of her tongue, and would ſo croſſebite
hym with ſuche tauntes, and ſpightfull quippes, as if at any
tyme he had been merrie in her companie, ſhe would tell hym
his mirthe proceeded rather in the remembraunce, of that ſhe
had brought hym, then for any loue that he had to her ſelf: if he
were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adde, it was for greefe ſhe was not dead, that he might
enioye that ſhe had. If he vſed to goe abroad, then he had been
ſpendyng of that he neuer gott hymſelf. If he taried at home,
ſhe would ſaie it was happie he had gotten ſuche a wife, that
was able to keepe hym ſo idely. If he made any prouiſion for
good cheare, or to fare well in his houſe, ſhe would bid hym
ſpende that whiche he hymſelf had brought. If he ſhewed hym
ſelf to be ſparyng, then ſhe would not be pincht of that whiche
was her owne. Thus doe what he could, all that euer he did
was taken in the worſt parte: And ſeyng that by no maner of
faire meanes he was able to reclaime her: in the ende he deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this waie, hymſelf with a truſtie freende that he made of
his counſaile, got and pinioned her armes ſo faſt, that ſhe was
not able to vndoe them, and then puttyng her into an old Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoate,
whiche he rent and tattered in peeces of purpoſe, and
ſhakyng her heire looſe about her eyes, tare her Smock ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
that her armes were all bare, and ſcratchyng them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
with a Bramble that the bloud followed, with a greate
chaine about her legge, wherwith he tied her in a darke houſe
that was on his Backſide, and then calling his neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:7038:64"/>
her, he would ſeeme with greate ſorrowe to lament his
wiues diſtreſſe, tellyng them that ſhe was ſodainly become
Lunatique, whereas by his geaſture he tooke ſo great greefe,
as though he would likewiſe haue runne madd for companie.
But his wife (as he had attired her) ſeemed (in deede) not to be
well in her wittes, but ſeyng her houſbandes maners, ſhewed
her ſelf in her conditions to bee a right Bedlem, ſhe vſed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wordes but Curſynges and Bannynges, criyng for the
Plague and the Peſtilence, and that the Deuill would teare
her houſbande in peeces: the companie that were aboute her,
thei would exhorte her, good neighbour forget theſe idle ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
whiche doeth ſo muche diſtemper you: and cal vpon God
and he will ſurely helpe you. Call vpon God for helpe (ꝙ the
other) wherein ſhould he helpe me, vnleſſe he would conſume
this wretch with fire &amp; brimſtone, other helpe I haue no neede
neede of. Her houſbande, he deſired his neighbours for Gods
that thei would helpe him to praie for her, and thus altogether
kneelyng in her preſence, he began to ſaie (<hi>Miſerere</hi>) whiche
al thei ſaied after him, but this did ſo ſpight and vexe her, that
ſhe neuer gaue ouer her railing, and ragyng againſt them all.
But in the ende, her houſband who by this ſhame had thought
to haue reclaimed her, made her to become from euil to worſe,
and was glad hymſelf in the ende, cleane to leaue, and to get
hym ſelf from her into a ſtraunge Countrey, where he conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the reſt of his life.</p>
               <p>Thus to conclude, beſides the matter that I meane to
proue, Men maie gather example here, when thei goe a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng,
not to chooſe for beautie without vertue: nor for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
without good conditions. There bee other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was ſometyme in the Citie
of <hi>Siuill</hi> in Spaine, a Gentleman
named <hi>Gonſales,</hi> who though he

pranckes of youthfull follie.
Yet was he by nature ſo enclined
to followe his luſtes, and withall
ſo variable and ſo vnconſtant, that
<pb facs="tcp:7038:65"/>

knewe hym very riche, and her dowrie not to be very greate,
thei were well content to beſtowe her vpon hym: and thought
that thei had in ſo doyng placed her very well. But before the

               <p>For beeyng come to ſoiourne in that Streate wherein he
dwelt, a notable Courteſane, who to the outward ſhewe was
very faire, though inwardly ſhe was moſte foule, as ſhe that
vnder a goodly perſonage, did couer a wicked and dangerous
minde, corrupted with all vices (as for the moſt parte al ſuche
women doen.) It was <hi>Gonſales</hi> chaunce to be one of the firſt
that fell into thoſe ſnares, whiche ſhe had ſett for ſuche ſimple
mens mindes, as haunt after the exteriour apparance of thoſe
thinges, whiche their ſenſes make them to delight in, and not
conſidering the daunger wherevnto thei commit themſelues,
by followyng of their diſordinate appetites, doe ſuffer them
ſelues to be entrapped by ſuche leude Dames: Among which
this (forſoothe) was one that was of ſinguler ſkill to captiue
mens mindes, which by experience and by the naturall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of her mynde, bent wholy to deceipt and naughtineſſe:
had learned a thouſand giles and artes, whiche waie to allure
men with the pleaſauntneſſe of her baites. Wherefore after
he was once entangled with her ſnares, he fell ſo farre beyond
all reaſon, and paſt al beleef, to dote vpon this Strumpet that
<pb facs="tcp:7038:66"/>
he could finde no reſt, nor no contentment, but ſo long as he
was with her. But ſhe beeyng as diſſolute a Dame as any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the world, and as greedie likewiſe of gaine as euer any
was of her profeſſion, would not content her ſelf with <hi>Gonſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
alone, but yeelded vnto as many as liſt to enioye her, if thei
came with their handes full, and ſpared for no coſt to rewarde
her liberally. Whiche thyng was vnto hym, that was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted
on her, ſo greeuous and ſo intollerable, that nothyng
could be more.</p>
               <p>There was at that ſame tyme, a Scholer in the Citie that

as ſhe that was diſpoſed to keepe her ſelf honeſt: and that
ſhe could in that reſpect haue been very glad, that he would
forbeare to frequent her houſe. Yet knowyng her houſbande
to be a man of no very great ſubſtance, and but ſlenderly ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
in the hedpeece: and that he delighted greatly in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
of the Scholler, ſhe forced her ſelf to endure with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience,
the importunate moleſtation, whiche he ſtill wearied
her withall. Takyng from hym neuertheleſſe all hope, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
at any tyme any fauour at her handes, and cuttyng hym
ſhorte from all occaſions, as muche as ſhe could, whereby he
might haue cauſe to moleſt her, or to looke for any thyng to
proceede from her, that were leſſe then honeſt.</p>
               <p>The Scholler perceiuyng that his owne trauaile, to win
her affection was but labour loſt, thought beſt to trie if by the
allurement or perſwaſion of any other, he might happly moue
her to ſhew her ſelf more courteous, and fauourable vnto him.
Wherefore hauyng founde out an olde Mother Elenour, a

diſciple of the Spaniſhe <hi>Celeſtina,</hi> ſuche a one as was moſte
cunnyng and ſkilfull in mollifiyng of womens myndes, to

he cauſed her to take acquaintaunce of <hi>Agatha,</hi> and by
degrees (as though ſhe had been moued with pittie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

                  </gap>: and to ſhew her how vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
he was that ſhe ſhould be true vnto hym. And in the ende
paſſing from one ſpeech to an other, ſhe ſaied plainly vnto her,
that it was a great follie, ſince her houſband did take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
abroade with other women, to ſtand to his allowances,
and to take the leauyng of his Strumpets, and therewith to
bee content: and that, if ſhe were in her caſe, and had a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
that would ſtrike with the ſworde, ſhe would vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
requite hym and ſtrike with the ſcabberde, ſo ſhe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
her to doe likewiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agatha</hi> beyng a very diſcrete Gentlewoman, and louyng
her houſbande as an honeſt woman ought to doe, ſaied to her
in aunſwere of her talke, that ſhe would bee right glad to ſee
her houſbande to be ſuche a man as ſhe wiſhed hym to be, and
as he ought to be. But that ſince ſhe ſawe it would not be, and
that he could not frame hym ſelf thereto, ſhe would not take
from hym or barre hym of that libertie, whiche either the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the corrupted worlde, or the priuiledge that men had
vſurped vnto themſelues, had giuen vnto them. And that ſhe
would neuer for her parte violate or breake that faithe whiche
ſhe had giuen hym, nor ſlacke or neglect that care and regard
of her honour, whiche all women by kinde and nature ought
to haue, as the thyng that maketh them to be moſte commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
throughout the world, let her houſbande doe what he liſt,
and like and loue as many other women as pleaſed hym. And
that ſhe thought her ſelf ſo muche the rather bounde ſo to doe,
becauſe he did not in the reſt miſuſe her any waie, or ſuffer her
to want any thing that reaſonably ſhe could deſire or craue at
his handes: and for that ſhe had not brought hym in effect any
other dowrie worthie to bee accompted of then her honeſtie.
Wherefore ſhe was fully reſolued neuer to varie from that
<pb facs="tcp:7038:67"/>
conſtant reſolution. And finally ſhewyng her ſelf ſomewhat
moued and ſtirred with Choler, ſhe tolde her that ſhe maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at her not a little (that beyng a woman of thoſe yeres) that
ſhe ſhould rather reprehend and chide yong folke, if ſhe ſhould
ſee them ſo bent, then encourage them to euil, &amp; muſed muche
ſhe could finde in her harte to giue her ſuche counſell: whiche
ſhe aſſured her was ſo diſpleaſant and ſo vngratefull, as if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hence forthe ſhe durſt preſume to ſpeake thereof any more, ſhe
would make her vnderſtande perchaunce to her ſmarte, how
ill ſhe could awaie with ſuche pandarly practiſes.</p>
               <p>This olde Hag hauyng had her head waſhed thus without
ſope, departed from <hi>Agatha,</hi> and came vnto the Scholler and
tolde hym in breefe how ill ſhe had ſped, and in what ſorte the
honeſt Gentlewoman had cloſed her mouth, whereof the ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
was very ſorie: yet for all this, he thought he would not
giue ouer his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> imagining that there is no hart ſo hard
or fiintie, but by long loue, by perſeuerance, praier, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
maie in the ende be mollified and wrought to be tender.</p>
               <p>In this meane ſeaſon, <hi>Gonſales</hi> ſtill continuyng his olde
familiaritie with the Scholler, and hauyng made hym priuie
of the loue he bare vnto the Courtiſane, and what a greefe it
was vnto him to ſee her enioyed by any other then by himſelf:
one daie among other talke betweene them of that matter, he
ſaied bnto the Sholler, that it neuer grieued him ſo muche to
haue a wife as it did then, for that if he had bin vnmaried he
would haue taken <hi>Aſelgia</hi> (for ſo was the Courtiſane named)
to be his wife, without whom he could finde no reſt nor quiete
in mynde, and ſo long as euery man hath a ſhare with him in
her, he accompted himſelf as il as if he had had no parte in her
at all. And thereto ſaied further, that aſſuredly if it were not
for feare of the Lawe, he would eaſe hymſelf of that burden by
riddyng of <hi>Agatha</hi> out of the worlde. Thereunto replied the
Scholler, ſaiyng that in deede it was a greeuous thyng for a
Gentleman to be combred with a wife, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could not finde
in his harte to loue, and that in ſuche a caſe, he that did ſeeke
the beſt waie he could to deliuer himſelf of that yoke, was not
altogether vnexcuſable, though the rigor of Iuſtice had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted
<pb facs="tcp:7038:67"/>
ſeuere puniſhementes, for ſuche as violentlie ſhould
attempt, or execute any ſuche thing. But that men that were
wiſe, could well enough finde out the meanes, whiche waie to
woorke their intentes, without incurryng any daunger of the
Lawe for the matter. Whiche language in deede he vſed vnto
hym, but to feede his humour, and to ſee wherevnto that talke
in fine would tende: And according to his deſire before it was
long. <hi>Gonſales</hi> hauing vſed the like ſpeeches, twoo or three ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
and ſtill findyng him to ſoothe his ſaiyng, tooke one daie
a good harte vnto him, and brake his minde vnto the Scholer
at large, and in plaine termes, to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alonſo</hi> (for that was the Scholers name) I doe aſſure my
ſelf, and make full accoumpt, that thou art my faſte freend, as
I am thyne, and I doubte not but that the freendſhip, whiche
is betweene vs, doeth make thee no leſſe ſorie then my ſelf, to
ſee me greeue with this continuall trouble of minde, wherein
I liue, becauſe I can not compaſſe to take this woman, whom
I loue ſo dearelie to bee my wife, and by that meanes come to
haue the full poſſeſſion of her vnto my ſelf, whiche is the thing
I doe deſire aboue all other thinges in the worlde. And for as
muche as I dooe perſwade my ſelf, that by thy meanes, and
with the helpe of thy profeſſion, I maie happ to finde ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
for my greef. I haue thought good to tell thee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
whiche I haue thought on oftentimes: wherein I meane
to vſe thee and thy aſſiſtaunce, for the better accompliſhing of
my purpoſe in that behalfe. Aſſuring my ſelf that thou wilte
not refuſe, or denie me any furtheraunce, that thy ſkill maie
aforde me, or ſhrinke and drawe backe, from the performyng
of any freendlie offer, whereby I maie come by to finde ſome
eaſe of minde, and bee deliuered of that intollerable tormente
of ſpirite, wherewith I am oppreſſed, for the loue of this <hi>Aſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
in whom I haue fixed and ſet all my ioyes and delightes.
Thou ſhalte therefore vnderſtande, that I am determined as
ſone as I can poſſible, to ridde my handes of <hi>Agatha</hi> my wife
and by one meane or other to cauſe her to dye: And I haue
been a good while aboute the execution of this my intent, but
becauſe I could neuer yet deuiſe the beſte waie to performe it,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:68"/>
ſo that her death might not bee laied vnto my charge. I haue
delaied it hetherto, and perforce, contente to beare the heauie
burthen of my greeued minde till now, whiche hence forward
I am reſolued to beare no longer, if thou wilte accordyng to
my truſt in thee, and as the freendſhip whiche is betweene vs
doeth require, graunt me thy furtheraunce and helping hand.
Wherefore, knowing that through thy long ſtudie in Phiſick
thou haſte attained ſo greate knowledge, that thou canſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
a nomber of ſecretes, whereof any one might be ſufficient
to bryng my purpoſe to effect. I doe require thee to fulfill my
deſire in that behalfe, and to giue me thy helpe, to bryng this
my deſire to paſſe: Whiche if thou dooe, I will acknowledge
my ſelf ſo long as I ſhall liue, to be ſo muche bound vnto thee,
that thou ſhalt commaunde me, and all that I haue, in any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of thine, as freelie and as boldlie, as thou maieſt now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that is thine owne.</p>
               <p>The Scholer when he had heard <hi>Gonſales</hi> and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde,
ſtoode ſtil awhile, as muſing vpon the requeſt, and in
the meane while diſcourſed with himſelf, how by the occaſion
of his intent, and reſolution of <hi>Gonſales,</hi> he might perhappes
finde out a waie, to come by the poſſeſſion of <hi>Agatha,</hi> and to
haue her in his handes, and at his deuotion. But keepyng ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
his thoughtes and meanyng, he made hym aunſwere:
That true it was, that he wanted not ſecret compoſiſſions, to
make folke die with poiſon, ſo as it could neuer bee diſcerned
by any Phiſition, or other, whether the cauſe were violent, or
no, but that for twoo reſpectes he thought it not good to yeeld
vnto his requeſte. The one, for that Phiſicke and Phiſitions,
were appointed in the worlde, not to bereue men of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
but to preſerue them, and to cure them of ſuche diſeaſes,
as were daungerous and perillous vnto them: The other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he did foreſee, in what ieoperdie he ſhould put his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
life, whenſoeuer he ſhould diſpoſe himſelf to worke any ſuche
practiſe, conſidering how ſeuerelie the lawes haue preſcribed
puniſhmentes for ſuche offences. And that it might fall out,
how warelie ſo euer the thing were wrought, that by ſome ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or vnlooked for accident, the matter might bee diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:7038:68"/>
(as for the moſte parte it ſemeth, that God will haue it) in
whiche caſe he were like to incurre no leſſe danger then <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales,</hi>
and bothe (aſſured) without remiſſion to loſe their liues.
And that therefore, he would not for the firſt reſpect, take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hym to doe that, whiche was contrarie to his profeſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
nor for the ſeconde, hazard his life to ſo certaine a daunger, for
ſo hatefull a thing, as thoſe practizes are to all the worlde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gonſales</hi> verie ſorie to heare his deniall, told hym that the
Lawes and dueties of freendſhip, doeth diſpence well enough
with a manne, though for his freende he ſtraine ſometyme his
conſcience. And therefore, he hoped that he would not forſake
hym, in a cauſe that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne him ſo waightily as that did. And
that neither of thoſe twoo reſpectes (if thei were well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered)
ought to be able to remoue him from pleaſuryng of his
freend. For that now adaies, aſwell were thei accompted and
eſteemed Phiſitions, that killed their Pacientes, as thei that
did cure them: and becauſe the thyng beeyng kepte ſecrete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them twoo alone, he needes not to doubte, or feare any
daunger of his life by the Lawe. For if it ſhould by any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
happen, that he ſhould be imputed, or burthened with
poiſoning of his wife, he aſſured him that he would neuer whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
he had breathe, confeſſe of whom he had the poiſon, but
would rather ſuffer his tongue to bee pulled out of his hedde,
or endure any torment that might bee deuiſed.</p>
               <p>The Scholler at the laſte ſeemyng to bee wonne, by the
earneſtneſſe of his petition: Saied, that vppon that condition
and promes, of not reuealing him at any time, he would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente,
rather to ſhewe hymſelf freendlie vnto hym, then a true
profeſſour of his Science, or an exacte regarder of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and that he would doe as he would haue him.</p>
               <p>And hauyng lefte <hi>Gonſales</hi> verie glad and ioyfull, for that
his promes, he wente home, and made a certaine compoſition
of mixture of pouders, the vertue whereof was ſuche, that it
would make them that tooke any quantitie thereof, to ſleape
ſo ſoundlie, that thei ſhould for the ſpace of certaine howers
ſeme vnto all men, to be ſtarke dedde. And the next daie he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to <hi>Gonſales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and to deliuer it vnto him, ſaiyng: <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:69"/>
you haue cauſed me to dooe a thyng, I proteſte I would
not dooe it for my life: But ſince you maie ſee thereby, that I
haue regarded more your freendſhippe, then my duetie, or the
conſideration of that, whiche is honeſt and lawfull: I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
you eftſones to remember your promeſſe, and that you
will not declare to any creature liuing, that you haue had this
poiſon of me.</p>
               <p>Whiche thing <hi>Gonſales</hi> verie conſtauntlie vpon his othe,
did promiſe him againe, and hauyng taken the pouder of him,
aſked hym in what ſorte he was to vſe it: And he tolde hym,
that if at Supper, he did caſte it there vpon her meate, or into
her brothe, ſhe ſhould die that night following, without either
paine or torment, or any greeuous accidentes, but goe awaie
euen as though ſhe were ſleape. That Euenyng at Supper
tyme, <hi>Gonſales</hi> failed not to put the pouder into his wiues po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
who hauyng taken it, as ſone as Supper was doen, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
her ſelf verie heauie and drouſie, wente to her Chamber,
and gather to bedde (for ſhe laie not with <hi>Gonſales,</hi> but when
he liſte to call he, whiche had been verie ſeldome, ſince he did
fall into loue with the Strumpet) and within an hower after,
the operation of the pouder tooke ſuche force in her bodie, that
ſhe laie as though ſhe had been dead, and altogether ſenceleſſe,
<hi>Gonſales</hi> in like ſort when he ſawe his time went to his bedd,
and liyng all that night with a troubled mynde, thinkyng
what would become of <hi>Agatha,</hi> and what ſucceſſe his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
would take: the morning came vpon him, before he could
once cloſe his eyes, whiche beyng come he roſe, not doubtyng
but that he ſhould aſſuredlie finde his wife dedde, as <hi>Alonſo</hi>
had promiſed him. And as ſoone as he was vp, he wente out of
his houſe, and ſtaied but an hower abroad, and then he retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home againe, and aſked his Maide, whether her Miſtres
were vp or no. The Maiden made him aunſwere, that ſhe was
yet a ſleape: And he makyng as though he had meruailed at
her long liyng in bedde, demaunded her how it happened that
ſhe was ſo ſluggiſhe that Mornyng, contrarie to her cuſtome,
whiche was to riſe euery Mornyng by breake of the daie, and
had her goe and wake her, for he would haue her to giue hym
<pb facs="tcp:7038:69"/>
ſome thing, that laie vnder her Keyes. The wenche according
to her Maiſters commaundement, went to her Miſtres bedde
ſide, and hauyng called her once or twiſe ſome what ſoftelie,
when ſhe ſawe ſhe waked not, ſhe laied her hande vppon her,
and giuing her a ſhagge, ſhe ſaied withall, Miſtres awake, my
Maiſter calleth for you. But ſhe liyng ſtill, and not awakyng
for all that the Maide tooke her by the arme, and beganne to
ſhake her good and harde: and ſhe not vnderſtandyng, neither
aunſwering, nor ſtirring hande or foote. The Maide returned
to her Maiſter, and tolde hym that for aught ſhe could doe, ſhe
could not gette her Miſtres to awake. <hi>Gonſales</hi> hearyng the
Maide to ſaie ſo, was glad in his minde: But feinyng himſelf
to bee buſied about ſomewhat els, and that he regarded little
her ſpeeche, he bidde her goe againe, and ſhake her till ſhe did
waken. The Maide did ſo, and rolled and tumbled her in her
bedde, and all in vaine: wherefore commyng againe vnto her
Maiſter, ſhe ſaied vnto him, that vndoubtedlie ſhe did beleeue,
that her Miſtres his wife was dedde, for ſhe had founde her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
colde, and rolled her vp and doune the bedde, and that yet
ſhe ſtirred not. What? dedde ꝙ <hi>Gonſales,</hi> as if he had been all
agaſte and amazed, and riſing therewithall, he wente to her
beddes ſide, and called her, and ſhaked her, and wrong her by
the fingers, and did all that might be, as he thought, to ſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe were aliue? But ſhe not feeling any thing that he did,
laie ſtill like a dedde bodie, or rather like a ſtone.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, when he ſawe his purpoſe had taken ſo good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte,
to diſſemble the matter, he beganne to crie out, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to deteſt his cruell Deſtinie, that had ſo ſoone bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him of ſo kind, ſo honeſt, and ſo faithful a wife: and hauing
in th'ende diſcouered her bodie, and finding no ſpot or marke,
whereby any token or ſigne of poiſonyng might be gathered,
as one that would not ſeme to omit any office of a louing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
he ſent for the Phiſition to looke vpon her, who hauing
vſed ſome ſuche meanes, as he thought meete to make her
come to herſelf: finally, ſeyng her to remain vnmoueable, and
without ſence, concluded, that ſome ſodaine accident had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
her in the night, wherof ſhe had died, and for dedde he left her.</p>
               <p>

At whiche his reſolution, though <hi>Gonſales</hi> were very glad
yet to the outward ſhewe, declaryng himſelf to be verie ſorie,
and full of woe and heauineſſe, he behaued hym ſelf in ſnche
cunning ſort, as he made all the worlde beleeue, that he would
not liue long after her. And hauyng called her freendes, and
lamented with them her ſodaine death, and his miſfortune: in
fine, he cauſed her Funerall to bee verie ſumptuouſlie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablie
prepared, and buried her in a Vaute, whiche ſerued
for a Toumbe to all his aunceſtours, in a Churche of a Frie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

               <p>
                  <hi>Alonſo</hi> that was verie well acquainted with the place, and
had hymſelf a houſe, not verie farre from that Frierie, wente
his waie that ſame Night vnto his ſaied houſe, and when he
ſawe the tyme to ſerue for his purpoſe, he gatte hym to the
Vaute or Toumbe, wherein <hi>Agatha</hi> was laied, with one of
theſe little Lanterns, that thei call blinde Lanterns (becauſe
thei tourne them, and hide their light when thei liſte.) And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was a yong manne of verie good ſtrengthe, and had
brought with him inſtrumentes of Iron to open the Toumbe,
and lift vp the ſtone that couered it, he gat it open, and hauyng
vnder propped it ſurelie: He went into the Vaute, and tooke
the woman ſtraight waie in his armes, mindyng to bryng her
out, and carrie her awaie ſo a ſleape as ſhe was. But the force
and vertue of the pouder, beeyng finiſhed and ſpent, aſſone as
he moued her, ſhe awaked out of her ſleape, and ſeeyng her ſelf
clad in that ſorte, emong ragges and dedde bones, ſhe began
to tremble, and to cry: alas where am I? Or who hath brought
me hether, wretche that I am? Marie that hath your cruell

reuiue you, and call backe your ſoule by thoſe remedies, which
I had deuiſed vnto your bodie againe: Whiche if I could not
haue doen, as I intended, I was reſolued to haue died hereby

               <p>
                  <hi>Alonſo</hi> failed not with affectuall and manifeſt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
to perſwade her, that her houſebande had now no more right
or title to her at all, and that although he had, yet if ſhe were
<pb facs="tcp:7038:71"/>
wiſe, ſhe ſhould not commit her ſelf vnto his courteſie again,
ſince by this mortall token, he had giuen her a ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of his ranckor, and euil will towardes her, whereby ſhe
might well enough bee aſſured not to eſcape, when ſoeuer ſhe
ſhould reſolue, to put her ſelf againe into his handes: and that
therefore ſhe was not to make any accoumpte of hym, but to
ſhewe her ſelf thanckfull, for ſo greate a benefite as ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and to requite hym ſo with her fauour and courteſie,
as he might now in the ende, attaine to gather the frute of his
long and conſtaunt good will, and of his trauell ſuſtained for
the ſaffegarde of her life. And with thoſe woordes bendyng
himſelf toward her, he would haue taken a kiſſe of her lippes.
But <hi>Agatha</hi> thruſtyng hym backe, ſaied vnto hym againe. If
my houſebande (<hi>Alonſo</hi>) haue broken thoſe bandes, wherwith
I was knitte vnto hym by Matrimonie, through his wicked
and leude demeanour, yet haue not I for my parte diſſolued
them, neither will I at any tyme, ſo long as I ſhall liue. As
for committing my ſelf vnto his courteſie, or going any more
into his handes, therein I thinke it good to followe your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe:
not that I would bee vnwillyng to liue and dwell with
him, if I might hope to finde hym better diſpoſed: but becauſe
I would bee lothe to fall eftſones into the like daunger and
greeuous perill. And as for requiting you, for this your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
trauaile in my behalf, I knowe not what better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
I am able to giue you, then to reſt bound vnto you
for euer, and to acknowledge my ſelf beholdyng vnto pour
courteſie for my life: whiche obligation if it maie ſatiſfie you,
I will be as glad and as content, as I maie be in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtate wherein I am. But if your meanyng perchaunce be,
that the loſſe of mine honeſtie, ſhould bee the reward and hire
for your paines, I doe beſeche you to depart hence out of this

               <p>The Scholer by thoſe wordes, perceiued well enough the
honeſt diſpoſition of <hi>Agarha,</hi> whiche he wondered at, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
<pb facs="tcp:7038:71"/>
that the terror of death it ſelf was not able once to moue
her from her faithfulneſſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie of mind. And though
it were greeuous vnto hym to finde her ſo ſtedfaſt, yet hopyng
that by tyme in the ende he might ouercome her chaſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
purpoſe, aunſwered: that he could not but commende her
for her diſpoſition, though he deſerued a kinder recompence of
his long and feruent loue, and ſhe a more louing and faithfull
houſband. But ſince ſhe was ſo reſolued, he would frame him
ſelf to be content with what ſhe would, and not craue of her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thyng that ſhe would not willyngly graunt hym to haue.
And therewith helpyng her out of the Sepulcher, he led her
home vnto his houſe, and left her there with an olde woman
that kept his houſe, to whom he recomended her, and whoſe
helpe he was aſſured of, to diſpoſe the good will of <hi>Agatha</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
hym, and the next mornyng returned into the Citie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gonſales</hi> after a fewe daies, ſeeming not to be able to liue
without a wife to take care of his familie, wedded that honeſt
Dame <hi>Aſelgia,</hi> and made her Miſtres of hymſelf and all that
he had. This his newe Mariage ſo ſone contriued, cauſed the
freendes of <hi>Agatha</hi> to maruaile not a little, and to miſdoubt
that the ſodaine death of their kinſewoman, had not happened
without ſome miſterie. Neuertheleſſe, hauing no token nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
or proofe, thei held their peace. But <hi>Gonſales</hi> hauyng
his deſired purpoſe and liuyng with his newe wife, it befell
vnto hym (through Gods iuſt Iudgement with this his ioly
Dame) as it chaunced to <hi>Agatha</hi> with hym before. For <hi>Aſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
that was neuer wont to feede with ſo ſpare a diet, as ſhe
that had neuer bin contented before without greate chaunge,
nor had not bin vſed to that kinde of ſtraigtneſſe (which <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales</hi>
growing ielous of her, began to keepe her in) but had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
liued at libertie, and with ſuche licenciouſneſſe, as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of her profeſſion are wont to doe, became in ſhorte ſpace
to ſhewe her ſelf ſo preciſe vnto hym, and to hate and abhorre
hym in ſuche extreme ſorte, that ſhe could not abide to ſee, or
heare hym ſpoken of. By occaſion of whiche her demeanour
towardes him: <hi>Gonſales</hi> to his greefe began at laſt, to knowe
and to diſcerne what difference there is betweene the honeſt
<pb facs="tcp:7038:72"/>
and carefull loue of an honeſt wife, and the diſſemblyng of an
arrant Strumpet. Wherefore one daie among the reſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainyng
of the little loue whiche he perceiued ſhe bare hym,
and ſhe aunſweryng hym thawartly. <hi>Gonſales</hi> fallyng into
heate of Choler, ſaied angerly vnto her: haue I thou naughty
packe poyſoned <hi>Agatha</hi> for thy ſake, that was the kindeſt and
the louingeſt wife that euer man had, and is this the rewarde
I haue and the requitall thou yeeldeſt me, to ſhowe thy ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
daie more deſpightefull and crabbed then other? <hi>Aſelgia</hi>
hauyng harde hym and noted well his wordes, tooke holde of
them, and ſtraight waie thought that ſhe had founde the waie
to rid her ſelf of <hi>Gonſales:</hi> wherefore ſhe reueiled his ſpeeches
vnto a Ribalde of hers, ſuch a one as ſupplied her want of that
which <hi>Gonſales</hi> alone nor ten ſuche as he were able to ſatiſfie
her withall, and induced hym to appeache hym for that facte,
aſſuryng her ſelf that the Lawe would puniſhe hym with no
lnſſe then death, and thereby ſhe to remaine at libertie to doe
what ſhe liſt againe, as ſhe had doen before. This companion
accuſed <hi>Gonſales</hi> vpon his owne wordes vnto the freendes of
<hi>Agatha,</hi> who hauyng had half a ſuſpition thereof before, went
and accuſed hym likewiſe before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge, or hed Magiſtrate

apprehended and put to their examinations, to ſearche out the

of the gentle peate his new wife, but chiefly grieued with the
worme of his owne conſcience, and to auoyde the torment of
thoſe terrors whiche he knewe were prepared for him, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
flatly, affirmyng that he had poyſoned her with a poyſon
whiche he had kept of long tyme before in his houſe, perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
yet therein the promiſe whiche he had made vnto the
Sholler. And vpon his owne confeſſion, ſentence was giuen
againſt hym that he ſhould looſe his hed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alonſo,</hi> when he vnderſtoode that <hi>Gonſaler</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to dye, was very glad thereof, ſuppoſyng that he beeyng
once dead, <hi>Agatha</hi> (who all this while for any thyng that the
olde woman could ſaie or alledge vnto her in the behalfe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo,</hi>
would neuer yeeld or conſent to any one point wherein
<pb facs="tcp:7038:72"/>

be put to execution, ſhe hauyng had inteligence of all that had
paſſed, and knowyng that he was appointed to dye that daie,
determined with her ſelf that ſhe would in that extremitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
her diſloyall houſebande, and giue hym to vnderſtande
how little ſhe had deſerued to bee ſo entreated by hym as ſhe
had been. Wherefore hauyng gotten out of <hi>Alonſo</hi> his houſe,
ſhe hied her vnto the Citie as faſt as ſhe could, and beeyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Iuſtice or Magiſtrate ſhe ſaied vnto hym. Sir, <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales</hi>
whom you haue condemned and commaunded to be put
to death this daie, is wrongfully condemned: for it is not true
that he hath poyſoned his wife, but ſhe is yet aliue, and I am
ſhe. Therefore I beſeeche you giue order that execution maie
be ſtaied, ſince that your ſentence is grounded vpon a falſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and confeſſion is vniuſt, and you maie plainely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

               <p>When the Gouernour heard <hi>Agatha</hi> ſpeake in this ſorte,
whom he had thought to haue beene deade and buried, he was
all amazed and halfe afraied to looke vpon her, doubtyng that
ſhe was rather her ſpirite or Ghoſte, or ſome other in her like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then a liuely woman in deede: for ſhe was apparelled in
a very plaine and black attyre, and was very wanne and pale
by reaſon of the affliction which ſhe had indured. Firſt, for her
owne il fortune, and then for the miſchaunce of her houſband.</p>
               <p>In this meane while, the Sargantes and Officers had
brought <hi>Gonſales</hi> before the Iuſtice or Magiſtrate, to the
ende that he (accordyng to the cuſtome of the Citie) ſhould
giue them commaundement to leade hym to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and there to fulfill his ſentence vpon him. But as ſone
as <hi>Agatha</hi> perceiued hym, ſhe ranne vnto hym, and takyng
hym about the necke and kiſſing him ſhe ſaied. Alas my deere
houſebande, wherevnto doe I ſee you brought through your

Beholde here your <hi>Agatha</hi> aliue and not deade: who
<pb facs="tcp:7038:73"/>
euen in that extremitie is come to ſhewe her ſelf, that louyng
and faithfull wife vnto you, that ſhe was euer.</p>
               <p>The Iuſtice or Gouernour ſeyng this ſtraunge accident,
cauſed execution to be ſtaied, and ſignified the whole caſe vnto
the Lorde of the Countrey, who at that tyme chaunced to bee
at <hi>Sciuill:</hi> who wonderyng no leſſe then the other at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
cauſed bothe <hi>Gonſales</hi> and his wife to bee brought before
him, and demaunded of them how it had chaunced that ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
bin buried for dead was now founde aliue. <hi>Gonſales,</hi>
could ſaie nothyng but that for the loue he bare vnto <hi>Aſelgia</hi>
he had poyſoned his wife, and that he knewe not how ſhe was
reuiued againe. But <hi>Agatha,</hi> declared how the Scholer with
his ſkill had deliuered her from death, and reſtored her life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, but how or by what meanes ſhe could not tell.</p>
               <p>The Lorde hauyng ſent for <hi>Alonſo,</hi> and demaunded hym
of the truth, was certified by hym, how that in ſteede of poiſon
he had giuen to <hi>Gonſales</hi> a Pouder to make her ſleape: Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
likewiſe that notwithſtandyng the long and earneſt
purſuite, whiche he had made to obtaine her loue, and the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
and iniurie whiche ſhe ſawe her houſebande had vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
her, to put her in that daunger and perill of her life, out
of whiche he had deliuered her, yet could he neuer by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion or entreatie winne her to fulfill his deſire, or bryng
her to make breache of her faithe and honeſtie. By whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
the Lorde knewe very well, that in an honeſt woman
the regarde and reſpect of her honour and chaſtitie, doth farre
exceede any other paſſion, for any miſerie be it neuer ſo great.
And commendyng highly the loue, and conſtancie of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
towarde her houſebande, and praiſyng the pollicie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo,</hi>
he tourned hymſelf vnto <hi>Gonſales,</hi> and ſaied vnto hym:
Full euill haſt thou deſerued to haue ſo good, and ſo verteous
a Gentlewoman to thy wife, and in reaſon ſhe ought now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be <hi>Alonſo</hi> his wife then thine: Neither wert thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of leſſe then that puniſhment, whiche the Lawe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
thee vnto, though ſhe be yet aliue, ſince thou, aſmuch
as in thee laie, haſt doen, to bereue her of her life. But I am
content that her vertue and goodneſſe, ſhall ſo much be auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:7038:73"/>
vnto thee, that thou ſhalt haue thy life ſpared vnto thee
for this tyme: not for thy owne ſake, becauſe thou deſerueſe it
not, but for hers, and not to giue her that ſorrowe and greefe,
whiche I knowe ſhe would feele, if thou ſhouldeſt dye in that
ſorte. But I ſware vnto thee, that if euer I maie vnderſtande
that thou doeſt vſe her hencefoorth, otherwiſe then louingly
and kindly, I wil make thee to thy greeuous paine proue how

               <p>
                  <hi>Gonſales</hi> imputyng his former offence, to want of witte
and Iudgement, made promiſe vnto the Lorde, that he would
alwaies doe as he had commaunded hym. And accordyngly
hauyng forſaken cleane that baggage Strumpet, that he had
wedded: He liued all the reſt of his daies in good loue and

come by the Kingdome of <hi>Toloſia:</hi> Knowing that there were
no more betweene hym and it but the Kyng, who loued hym
more dearely by a greate deale then he deſerued. But it fell
out the Queene <hi>Iſabell</hi> was knowne to bee with childe, the
Duke very lothe that any other heires ſhould ſteppe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene

thought to haue doen, by as many as the Kyng ſhould haue
taken to wife (if at any tyme thei proued to be with childe) but
by the prouidence of God, this poiſon tooke no great effect in
the Queene, ſauyng that when ſhe was deliuered of a ſonne,
the child was found to be in a notable Leproſie, and the Kyng
hauing intelligence of an excellent Phiſition, (but eſpecially
for the curyng of that deſeaſe) was remainyng in the Ile of
<hi>Candy,</hi> prepared a Shipp preſently to ſende the child, which
by the extreamitie of a contrary winde, was driuen into Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,
and the Shippe caſt awaie vppon the maine, and all the
men drouned exceptyng the childe, whiche beeyng in a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
was carried to the Shore as it laie. Where a Fiſherman
founde it, with ſuche ſumptuous furnitures aboute it, with
a very riche Iewell hangyng about the necke. He tooke it vp
in his armes, and carriyng it home, with Bathes and homely
Oyntmentes of his owne deuiſing, within a very little ſpace,
the childe was reſtored to perfecte health, whom he called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramanthus,</hi>
and brought hym vp as his owne Soonne, the
childe knowyng no other in deede, but that the Fiſherman
had been his father, and as <hi>Aramanthus</hi> grewe in yeares, ſo
he proued of a very comely perſonage, but of a moſt excellent
and perfecte witte, although he had no other trainyng vp, but
<pb facs="tcp:7038:75"/>
vſed to goe to the Sea with his father a fiſhyng.</p>
               <p>Now it fell out that the Turke was leauiyng a mightie

twoo children, a ſonne and a daughter, the daughter her name
was <hi>Florella,</hi> whoſe beautie was very excellent, and mindyng
to match his daughter with ſome noble Prince, he pretended
that ſuche Countries, Cities, Townes, Caſtelles, Fortes,
or what ſo euer he could by conqueſt get from the Chriſtians,
to giue them all for his daughters dowrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aramanthus</hi> hearyng of this preparation to the Warres,
would needes become a Souldiour, where at his father the
Fiſherman was greatly diſpleaſed, and beganne to preache
vnto his ſonne of the incommodities of warre, and with how
many miſeries Souldiers are beſieged. <hi>Aramanthus</hi> whoſe
baſeneſſe of his bringyng vp, could not conceale the nobilitie
of his birth, would in no wiſe be perſwaded but goe he would,
and beyng preſſed for an ordinarie Souldiour, when he came
to the place of ſeruice ſhewed hymſelf ſo valiaunt, and in very
ſhorte ſpace became to be ſo expert, that that Captaine vnder
whoſe Enſigne he ſerued, bare awaie the credite from all the
reſt: and in the ende was hymſelf preferred to charge, whiche
he gouerned with ſo great diſcretion, and ſtill conducted with
ſuche celeritie and ſleight, that who but <hi>Aramanthus</hi> and his

gaue hym counſaill in all his affaires, and there with all had
ſo good ſucceſſe, that his practiſes ſtill preuailed, and came to
happie end, that the Turke by his aduiſe, had doen wonderfull
ſpoyles vpon the Chriſtians, and had taken from them many
Cities, Tounes, and Prouinces.</p>
               <p>And thus leauyng them in the warres for a ſeaſon, I will
conuaie my tale againe to <hi>Iſabell</hi> Queene and wife to <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,</hi>
who was now the ſecond time knowne to be with child,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:75"/>
whereat the Duke of <hi>Caria</hi> beeyng wonderfullie wrothe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendyng
to finde a quicke diſpatche for all together, he ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
accuſed the Queene of Adulterie, to the King his brother,
and with ſuche allegations, and falſe witneſſes as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
ſo informed the King that his tale was credited: and the
rather for that the king knowing his Queene to be with child
did thinke himſelf too farre ſpent in yeres, to do ſuche a deede.
And yet the King was repleniſhed with ſo greate pitee, that
he could not indure to heare of her death: He therefore by a
meſſenger, commaunded her preſentlie to depart the Court:
and in paine of her life, neuer after to come in his preſence.
Theſe newes did wonderfullie amaze the Queene, who with
many piteous interceſſions, deſired to knowe her accuſers,
and that ſhe might but ſpeake for her ſelf before his Maieſtie,
and then as he ſhould finde her, to vſe her according to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes.
But all in vaine, for the Duke had ſo throughlie incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the King, that he would neither abide to ſee, nor heare her.
The duke vnderſtanding how matters had paſſed, came to the
Queene, and ſemed muche to lament her caſe, perſwading her
to hold her ſelf contented for a little ſeaſon, not doubtyng but
in tyme, that he hymſelf would ſo perſwade with his brother,
that ſhe ſhould bee heard to ſpeake in her owne defence, in the
meane ſeaſon, if it pleaſed her to vſe his houſe in the Countrie
he would prouide for her all maner of neceſſaries, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſhe ſhould wante, and for her better comforte, if ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aſſured freend, whoſe companie ſhe deſired, that ſhe might
ſecretelie ſende for them, to holde her fellowſhip, and to paſſe
the tyme: and that he hymſelf would many tymes viſite her,
and daiely informe her, how matters did paſſe in her behalfe,
with the King his brother.</p>
               <p>The poore Queene, thinkyng all had to proceede of good
will whiche this Traitor had proffered, gaue him more then a
thouſand thankes, repoſing her ſelf, and the innocencie of her
cauſe, onely in this Iudas, who practized nothyng els but her
death, and the death of that ſhe went withall.</p>
               <p>The next daie he prouided a couple of Ruffians, ſuche as
he knewe were for his purpoſe, whiche ſhould haue ſecretelie
<pb facs="tcp:7038:76"/>
conueighed her to the Dukes houſes (as ſhe had thought) but
as the Duke had willed them, as thei rode ouer a Foreſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thei came to the ſide of a woode, thei tooke her from her horſe,
ſpoyled her of ſuche thynges as were aboute her, and mynded
to haue killed her, and throwne her in ſome Buſhe: But it fell
out that there were certaine baniſhed menne in the Woode,
whiche liued in that deſarte in maner of Outlawes, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
the piteous complainte of the Queene, thei came to her
reſcue, but the villaines that would haue ſlain her, perceiuing
them, fledde, and lefte the Queene, where theſe Outlawes
came vnto her: vnto whom from poinct to poinct ſhe declared
euery thing, how it was happened vnto her, the Outlawes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
greate compaſſion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei knewe her to be the Quene
for that thei had euer heard her to bee Noblie reported on,
brought her with theim to their Caue, where thei miniſtered
ſuche releef to her diſtreſſe, as menne might doe that were in
their eſtates. The Queene thinkyng that God had preſerued
her life, to ſome better purpoſe, contented her ſelf for a ſeaſon,
to remaine emongeſt theim: Where ſhe learned to plaie the
Cooke, and to dreſſe their meate, ſuche as thei brought in, or
could prouide for in the Foreſt. And thus leauyng the Quene
with theſe Outlawes, I will retourne againe to ſpeake of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramanthus,</hi>
who was now deuiſyng to frame a plotte, how he
might betraie the Citee of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> whereof his Father was
Kyng, as you haue heard.</p>
               <p>For the Turke hauyng intelligence, of the pleaſauntneſſe
of this Citee, and of the wonderfull wealthe and riches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it did abounde, and therewithall had learned, that it was
of ſuche force and inuinſible ſtrengthe, that there was no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of hope, how it might be ſubdued, whereat the Turke was
verie ſorowfull and ſadde.</p>
               <p>But my yong Fiſherman <hi>Aramanthus,</hi> whoſe cunnyng
neuer failed, where courage could net help, cauſed the Turke
with his whole armie by ſea, to come before this Citee, which
is ſituate faſt vpon the ſea ſide, and there to come to an anker,
where <hi>Aramanthus</hi> hymſelf; as a meſſenger appoincted from
the Turke, came to the kyng of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> to whom he told this
<pb facs="tcp:7038:76"/>
tale: That the Turke his Maiſter, hauyng been in diues par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Chriſtendome, where he had made warres a long ſpace,
and vpon diuers conſiderations, mindyng to departe with his
Armie, into his owne Countrey for a ſeaſon, and beyng vpon
the Seas: one night as he was liyng vpon his bedde, behold,
a viſion appeared vnto hym in a Dreame, whiche ſhewed hym
how greeuouſlie he had offended the God of the Chriſtians, in
the perſecutyng, ſpoilyng, and the murtheryng of them, as he
had doen in this iourney, and for that he ſhould know, that the

                  </gap> his limmes from that tyme forthe, till his

and giuyng a piteous grone, ſuche as was about hym
commyng vnto hym, found hym in a wonderfull maze, and ſo
benummed in all his partes, that he was not able to ſtir hande
nor foote: The nexte daie callyng his Counſailers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
about hym, not able of hymſelf to come forthe emongſt
theim, but as he was brought out of his Cabbin on mennes
backes, he declared vnto them the whole circumſtaunce of the
premiſſes, and beyng ſtriken with a wonderfull remorſe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
he determined to ſaile backe againe, not mindyng to
depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out thoſe partes of Chriſtendome, till he had made
ſatiſfaction of all ſuche ſpoiles and outrages, as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the Chriſtians, and hymſelf with his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to become Chriſtened, and there to bee inſtructed in the

behold, a contrary winde hath driuen vs on theſe parts, where
hearyng of the Fame of this Noble Citee of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> he hath
ſent me vnto your grace, deſiryng nothing but your ſaffe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducte
for hymſelf, and certaine of his cheef Lordes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailors
that be about hym, that in this noble Citee thei might
be Baptized, and receiue the Chriſtian faithe, promiſing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
not onely to ioyne in league, and perfect amitie with the
Chriſtians, but alſo to lincke with them in Religion, hymſelf,
his Countries, Kyngdomes, and Prouinces.</p>
               <p>This tale was not ſo ſmoothly told, but there was greate
<pb facs="tcp:7038:77"/>
doubte and ſuſpition had in the matter, in the ende thinkyng
thei could receiue no preiudice, by receiuing of ſo ſmal a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
gaue ſafe condite for the Turke hymſelf, and for fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of his companie, ſuche as it pleaſed himſelf to appoincte.</p>
               <p>The next daie, the Turke was brought into the Citee on
mennes ſhulders, with his appointed companie, where he was
worthely receiued by the king himſelf, with the reſt of his lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and brought into a Pallace of purpoſe, very richely furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
where beyng laied doune vpon a bedde, as though he had
been able neither to ſtande nor ſit, and giuyng the King, with
the reſt of his companie, great thankes for his entertainment
he deſired him with the Duke his brother (according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome)
to be his Godfathers when he ſhould be Chriſtened, to
whiche requeſt thei bothe willyngly agreed: the next daie the
Turke hymſelf was the firſt that receiued Chriſtendome, and
then all the reſt of his noble men that wer with him, the which
beyng finiſhed, many godlie exhortations were preached vnto
theim by learned menue. The Turke ſeemed in verie grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
maner to take this curteſie, wherewith the King had vſed
him: and thus taking his leaue himſelf with all his companie,
departed againe aborde the ſhippes: the Turke himſelf beyng
caried vpon mennes backes, making ſhowe as though he had
been ſo feeble and weake, that he had not been able to haue
moued, or ſtirred any one ioynte without helpe, fainyng that
he would haue departed with his companie into Turkie.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Toloſia</hi> with all his people and Citezens, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
with what deuotion the Turke with the reſte of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
had receiued Chriſtendome, began to thinke aſſuredly,
that onely by the Diuine prouidence of God, the Turke was
ſo conuerted, and doubted nothyng of the tale, whiche <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus</hi>
before had told them, whiche tourned in the ende to
their vtter ſubuerſion. For the nexte daie <hi>Aramanthus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
againe to the Kyng, brought woorde of the death of the
Turke, and with a piteous diſcourſe vttered, with a nomber
of fained ſighes, ſaied: that about twelue a clocke of the night
paſt, the Turke deceaſed, and deſired at the houre of his death
that as in this worthie Citee, he had receiued the true and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb facs="tcp:7038:77"/>
faithe, ſo likewiſe that he might bee entoumbed, and
receiue Chriſtian buriall in the Cathedrall Churche, to the
whiche he had giuen by his will fourtie thouſande Frankes,
more to the common Treaſure of the Citee, an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
Frankes, to the King himſelf as a preſident of his good
will, a riche Iewell, whiche hymſelf did weare of greate eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
to the Duke his brother, his owne Armour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.
Item, to the releef of the poore within the Citee, tenne
thouſande Frankes. Many other thinges (ꝙ <hi>Aramanthus</hi>) he
hath bequeathed, that I haue not ſpoken of, the whiche God
willyng, ſhalbe performed to the vttermoſte.</p>
               <p>The king ſemed greatly to lament the death of the Turke
and began to coniecture aſſuredly, that it was the will of God
but to preſerue his life, till he had receiued Chriſtendome, but
the time of his buriall, was deferred for certain daies, til thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
might be prouided, and more readie for the pompe, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniſing
of his Funerall, and wonderfull coſt was beſtowed
by <hi>Aramanthus,</hi> who had the onely ordering of the matter, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in the ende to receiue the whole commoditie: and alſo to
be rewarded with a large and bountifull intreſt. The daie of
buriall beyng at hande, <hi>Aramanthus</hi> deſired the king, that for
ſo muche as the Turke had finiſhed his daies in the middeſt of
his armie emongſt his Souldiers, that he might likewiſe bee
buried like a noble captain, and according to the maner of the
feeld: he might be brought to his graue with certaine bandes,
trailing their weapons, as the cuſtome of ſouldiers is to burie
their dedde. This requeſt ſeemed to bee verie conuenient, and
therefore was the readilier graunted: but what ſhould I ſtand
with long circumſtance, to diſcipher all the Ceremonies that
wer vſed in this treaſon. The daie was come, that this practiſe
muſt be put in vre, and an emptie coffin ſolempnly brought to
the citee, vnder ſhewe of greate ſorrowe, when thei were al fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with greate ioye and gladneſſe, to ſe what happie ſucceſſe
was like to followe, of that thei had premeditated, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
as <hi>Aramanthus</hi> had giuen order, 5000. of their choſe
men were appoincted to marche, the one halfe before, and the
other half after the Coffin, trailyng their Enſignes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:78"/>
and in this maner thei entred the Citee, where the king
with his nobles and principalles of the Citee, were readie in
mournyng weedes to accompanie the Corſe. When <hi>Arama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nthus</hi>
ſawe his tyme, the Alarum was giuen, and he hymſelf
was the firſt that laied handes of the king his Father, the reſt
of his nobles were ſo encloſed, that there could not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
eſcape: Defence there was none to bee made, for the one ſide
were in Armes, killyng and murtheryng of as many as thei
could ſee ſtirryng in the ſtreates: The other ſide vnprouided,
glad to hide theim ſelues, for the ſauegard of their liues: The
reſte of the fleete were likewiſe in a readineſſe, and commyng
a lande, entred the Citee, where there was no man to repulſe
them. And thus the famous Citee of <hi>Toloſia</hi> was taken by the
Turkes, euen in a moment, without any maner of reſiſtance:
the churches and priſons were filled full of Chriſtians, where
thei were whipped, racked, and tormented to the death, vnleſſe
thei would forſake their Faithe. The kyng hymſelf with his
brother, and all the Lordes, were committed to priſon, there to
bee fedde with breade and water (and yet to be ſcantled with
ſuche ſhort allowaunce, as it was not able to ſuffice Nature)
and ſo to be dieted, vnleſſe thei would forſake their Faithe.</p>
               <p>Now the Turke, who onely by the meanes of <hi>Aramanthus,</hi>
had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered from the Chriſtians ſo many citees and tounes,
for the loue he bare vnto hym, and in reſpect of his ſeruice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to make <hi>Aramanthus</hi> his ſonne in lawe, and to giue
hym his daughter <hi>Florella</hi> for his wife: and for her dowrie, all
ſuche partes as he had taken from the Chriſtians by conqueſt
and vnderſtandyng that the father of <hi>Aramanthus</hi> was but a
poore Fiſherman, he pretended likewiſe to make hym a duke,
and to giue hym liuyng to maintaine his eſtate. The Turke
therfore with allpoſſible ſpeede, haſted meſſengers with ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng,
to bryng his daughter, with the old Fiſherman, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Father of <hi>Aramanthus,</hi> to this Citie of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> where
he minded to performe that he had determined.</p>
               <p>Now it fell out, that the miſerable Queene <hi>Iſabell</hi> (whom
you haue heard was lefte with child, remainyng with certaine
Outlawes) was deliuered of a Daughter, whiche ſhe her ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:7038:78"/>
nurſed in the Caue, where ſhe had remained, and hearyng that
the Turke had taken the Citee of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> would needes goe
ſee what was become of the kyng her houſebande: her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whiche was not yet fullie a yere olde, ſhe committed to the
Outlawes, to bee foſtered with ſuche homelie Iunkettes, as
their could prouide, wo ſeeyng her determination, promiſed to
drie Nurſe the child, ſo well as thei could, till ſhe ſhould make
retourne. Thus preparyng her ſelf in a verie ſimple attire,
with a bondle of Broomes on her hedde, ſhe came to the Citee
of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> where romyng vp and doune the ſtreates to ſell her
Broomes, ſhe learned all that had happened to the Kyng, and
how he was ready to periſhe, for want of foode and ſuſtenance
wherefore myndyng to giue ſuche ſuccours, as her habilitie
would ſerue: She deuiſed in the maner of a poore ſeruaunt, to
gette into the ſeruice of the Turke, who was the Iailer, and
had the cuſtodie of the Kyng, where euery Night, as oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
would ſerue, ſhe conueighed to hym through a grate, ſuche
fragmentes as ſhe ſpared out of her owne bealie, whiche were
verie ſhorte, and there withall muche more homelie, but
ſomthyng the better to amende his cheare. She would leane
her ſelf cloaſe to the grate, and thruſtyng in her Teate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Irons, the king learned againe to ſucke, and thus
ſhe dieted him a long ſeaſon. Neither wiſte the kyng what ſhe
was, that beſtowed on hym ſo greate grace and goodneſſe:
yet he bleſſed her more then a thouſande tymes a daie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there were many of his companie, that died for wante
of ſuſtenaunce, yet he again with theſe banquettes recouered
himſelf, and beganne to waxe ſtrong. Whereat the Turke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to ſuſpecte ſome parcialitie in the Iailer, and cauſed a
priuie watche to bee kept: but <hi>Iſabell</hi> ſuſpectyng nothyng, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her accuſtomed maner, at night when it was darke
came to her Nurſeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, where her order that ſhe ſo long vſed,
was eſpied, and beeyng apprehended by the watche, the nexte
daie ſhe was preſented to the Turke, and in what maner thei
had founde her, whereat the Turke wonderfullie agreeued:
Sware by <hi>Mahounde</hi> hym ſelf, that ſhe ſhould preſently bee
tortured, with the greateſt tormentes that might be deuiſed.
<pb facs="tcp:7038:79"/>
And in the middeſt of his furie, woorde was brought hym that
his Daughter <hi>Florella,</hi> with the Fiſherman that was Father
to <hi>Aramanthus</hi> were arriued, and readie to preſent them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

<hi>Aramanthus</hi> likewiſe, although he were the greateſte
Counſailour, appertinent to the Turke, yet vſed that dutifull
reuerence to the Fiſherman his Father, as is to bee required
in a Childe. The Turke imbracyng his Daughter <hi>Florella,</hi>
tolde her the cauſe that he had ſent for her, was to eſpouſe her
to <hi>Aramanthus,</hi> who although the Deſtinies had denaied to
make Noble by place of birthe, yet through his Vertues, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunce,

               <p>And the Turke turnyng hym towardes the Fiſherman,
ſaied: And a thouſande times happie art thou old Father, that
haſt liued to ſee thy ſelf ſo highly exalted in thy ofſpryng: The
poore Fiſherman kneelyng doune, ſaied: Moſte mightie, and
magnificente Prince, not mindyng longer to conceale the
thyng, whiche might redounde ſo greatly to the contentation
of ſuche worthie perſonages, ſeeyng then that <hi>Aramanthus,</hi>
who onely through his own valiancie, hath aſpired to ſo great
dignitie and honour. How greatly were I then to be blamed,
and how worthely might I bee condemned? If I ſhould take
vpon me to be the ſire of hym, who by all likelihood, is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of Roiall and Princely race, for better teſtimonie, behold
this riche Mantell, and theſe other coſtly furnitures, wherein
I founde <hi>Aramanthus</hi> wrapped, and by ſeemyng ſaued by his
Cradell, whiche brought hym a Shoore, from ſome Shippe
that was wracked, where I founde hym by the Sea ſide (as
I ſaie) wrapped in theſe ſumptuous Furnitures, with this
riche and precious Iewell about his necke, beyng but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faunte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by coniecture not aboue the age of a quarter of a yere,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:79"/>
where takyng hym vp in my armes, I brought hym home to
my houſe, called hym by the name of <hi>Aramanthus,</hi> and thus
foſtered hym vp as my owne child, vntil the daie that he came
to ſerue your Maieſtie in the Warres.</p>
               <p>The Queene <hi>Iſabell</hi> whiche ſtoode by, and heard this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and ſeing the furnitures and the Iewelles, wherewith
ſhe had decked her childe, aſſuryng her ſelf that <hi>Aramanthus</hi>
was her ſonne, could no longer ſtaie her ſpeeche, but ſaid: And
doe I then beholde my ſonne with my vnhappie eyes, is he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
here in preſence, whom I deemed to be dead? Oh moſte
gracious Gods I yeelde you humble thankes, and would to
God my ſonne thy commyng had been but halfe ſo happie, as
thy preſence is ioyfull to me thy wretched mother. What ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
be theſe (ꝙ the Turke) whiche I heard, I thinke the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
be out of her wits: but what art thou that wouldeſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<hi>Aramanthus</hi> for thy ſonne, whoſe parentes now I well
perceiue, are no beggers like thy ſelf. Yes ſurely (quoth the
Queene) and muche more miſerable, then thoſe that goe from
doore to doore: and although his father ſometyme ſwaied the
ſword of gouernement, and ſatt in place and ſeate of Princely
Throne. Diſpatche then at once (ꝙ the Turke) and tell me
who is his father, and what is the miſerie wherwith he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed:
wherein if thou canſt perſwade me with a truth, aſſure
thee that onely for <hi>Aramanthus</hi> ſake, I am the man that will
miniſter releaſe.</p>
               <p>Behold then (ꝙ the Queene) Kyng <hi>Rodericke</hi> is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom thy ſelf keepeſt here in priſon, in this miſerable
maner, and I whom thou ſeeſt here am his mother, the wife
of the Kyng, and ſometyme the Queene of this wretched Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Toloſia,</hi> who beeyng deliuered of a ſonne, whiche by the
pleaſure of GOD was viſited in my wombe, and borne in an
extreame Leproſie: for helpe whereof he was ſent by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Shippyng to the Ile of <hi>Candy,</hi> and till this preſent
daie there was neuer tidynges heard, either of the Shippe, or
of any one man that was in her. And now behold I ſee with
myne eyes the furnitures wherein I wrapped my childe, and
the Iewell which I put about his neck, with my owne handes
<pb facs="tcp:7038:80"/>
at his departure: the Fiſherman verifying this tale to be true,
ſaied in deede that he founde hym in an extreame Maladie,
which he cured himſelf with medicines of his own prouiding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aramanthus</hi> hauyng heard how matters were ſorted out,
beganne to teare hymſelf, ſaiyng: Ah moſt wicked and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
wretche, what Furies haue ſaued thee, that thou wart
not drouned with the reſt, but that thou muſt bee preſerued as
an Inſtrument to worke thy Parentes wracke: Come come
you Helliſhe Hagges, and ſhewe your force on hym that hath
worthely deſerued it. But what hath <hi>Tantalus</hi> offended, that
he ſhould continually bee ſterued? Or how hath <hi>Siſiphus</hi> that
rowles the reſtleſſe Stone? Or what treſpaſſe hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by <hi>Prometheus, Ixyon, Titias,</hi> or <hi>Danaus</hi> ſillie daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
drawyng water at the Well: that maie bee compared to
that whiche I haue doen, is it poſſible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I ſhould eſcape
vnpuniſhed? Or that the ſacred Gods will bee vnreuenged of
my fact, no no, I haue deſerued to be plagued, and haue meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more worthely to be tormented then any of theſe afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.
<hi>Florella</hi> ouer hearyng theſe deſperate ſpeeches, fell
doune in a ſowne for greefe to ſee her <hi>Aramanthus</hi> ſo diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Turke after his daughter was come againe to her
ſelf, forrowed to ſee the heauineſſe of <hi>Aramanthus,</hi> cauſed the
Kyng his father, with the Duke of <hi>Caria</hi> preſently to be ſent

               <p>The Kyng was wonderfully amazed to heare theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

                  <hi>Emelia</hi> hearyng this cruell concluſion of her father, was
wonderfully abaſhed, and beeyng by her ſelf in her Chamber,
ſhe beganne to conſider of her fathers wordes, and for feare to
incurre any farther diſpleaſure, ſhe deuſed how ſhe might
frame her ſelf to the likyng of her louer, and with a yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
minde, ſhe firſt beganne to conſider of his wealth, of his
callyng, of the reuerence wherewith he was vſed in the Citie,
and that likewiſe in beyng his wife, ſhe ſhould alſo bee had in
eſtimation, and bee preferred before other women of meaner
credite, and to deſire ſuperioritie, it is commonly euery wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
ſickneſſe, and therefore this could not chooſe but pleaſe
her very well: then ſhe remembred how commodious it were
to marrie one ſo wealthie as <hi>Phylotus,</hi> whereby ſhe ſhould not
neede to beate her braines aboute the practiſing of houſewife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
but ſhould haue ſeruauntes at commaundment to ſupplie

ſhe would well perſwade her ſelf, ſhe beganne to coniecture
how ſhe ſhould ſpende the tyme to her contentment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe beganne to thinke what a pleaſure it was to bee well
furniſhed with ſondrie ſutes of apparell, that in the mornyng
when ſhe ſhould riſe, ſhe might call for what ſhe liſt to put on,
accordyng as the tyme and the faſſhion did require, and her

his wife, and this pleaſed her likewiſe very well, &amp; then when
ſhe were vp, ſhe might breake her faſt with a cuppe of Malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
or Muſkadine next her harte. It was very good for ill
Ayres in a mornyng, and this ſhe thought was but an eaſie
matter, and likewiſe pleaſed her very well: when ſhe had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her faſt, then ſhe might ſtirre about the houſe, and looke to
this, and ſee to that, and where ſhe found any thyng amis, not
to touche it with her owne fingers, for marryng the beautie of
her hande, but to call for <hi>Cicelie, Ione,</hi> or <hi>Cate,</hi> and to chide
them like Sluttes, that thei could not ſpie a fault but when

haue prouided for Dinner ſome iuncketts, that ſerued beſt her
appetite, her houſeba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de had good ſtore of coine, and how could
it bee better ſpente, then vpon themſelues: to make their fare
the better, this likewiſe pleaſed her verie well, now when ſhe
had dined, then ſhe might goe ſeeke out her examplers, and to
peruſe whiche woorke would doe beſte in a Ruffe, whiche in a
Gorget, whiche in a Sleeue, whiche in a Quaife, whiche in a
Caule, whiche in a Handkercheef, what Lace would doe beſte
to edge it, what ſeame, what ſtitche, what cut, what gard, and
to ſit her doune, and take it forthe by little and little: and thus
with her Nedle to paſſe the after nonne, with deuiſing of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for her owne wearyng, this likewiſe pleaſed her paſſyng
well: Then to prouide for Supper ſome ſhift of diet, and ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
ſauces; the better to help the ſtomacke, Oranges, Lemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
Oliues, Caphers, Salades of ſondrie ſortes, alas a Croune
will goe a greate waie in ſuche trifles. This likewiſe pleaſed
her verie well, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had ſupped, to vſe ſome exerciſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to the ceaſon: if it were in Sommer, to goe walke with
her neighbours to take the aire, or in her Garde in to take the
verdure of ſweete and pleaſaunt flower, this likewiſe pleaſed
her verie well, when ſhe was come in, and readie to goe to her
Chamber, a Cup of cold Sacke to bedward, is verie good for
digeſtion, and no coſte to ſpeake of, where ſuche abondaunce
doeth remaine, and this likewiſe pleaſed her verie well.</p>
               <p>But now although ſhe had deuiſed, to paſſe the daie tyme
with ſuche contentation, when ſhe remembred at Night, ſhe
muſt goe to bed to bee lubber leapt: and with what cold cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
ſhe ſhould be entertained by her graie hedded bedfelowe,
what froſen embracementes he was able to beſtowe of her, all
was marde, and quite daſhte out of remembraunce, and all the
commodities before ſpoken of, that ſhe ſhould receiue in the
tyme of the daie, would not ſerue to counteruaile that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie,
in the ſeaſon of the Night: Like as wee ſaie, one
vice ſpilles a greate nomber of vertues. Thus <hi>Emelia</hi> was
now to ſeeke, and could in nowiſe frame her ſelf to loue <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotus:</hi>
but when ſhe had flattered her ſelf with a thouſande de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes,
that ſhe ſhould receiue in the daie time by his wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:7038:83"/>
when ſhe remembred bedde tyme, ſhe was as newe to beginne
as before. Wherefore ſhe remained in great perplexitie, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
her happe to bee ouer hard, and the comforte verie bare,
where the beſte choice had ſuche aſſuraunce of doubtfull ende.
For to Marrie after her Fathers mynde, ſhe knewe would
breede her lothed life: and to gainſaie what he had determined,
would likewiſe looſe her fathers, likyng, that ſhe wiſte not for
her life whereon to reſolue, and thus from daie to daie, as ſhe
continued in this doubt. There happened to hit into her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
a yong <hi>Romaine</hi> gentleman, whoſe name was <hi>Flanius,</hi>
who ſodainly fell in Loue with <hi>Emelia,</hi> and takyng the tyme
whileſt his opportunitie ſerued: he let <hi>Emelia</hi> to vnderſtande, of
the greate loue he bare her. <hi>Emelia,</hi> accordyng to the cuſtome
of women, made the matter verie coie at the firſte, although in
her harte ſhe wer right glad, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideryng her caſe how it ſtood.
<hi>Flanius</hi> was ſo muche the more importunate vppon her, and
with ſuche nice termes as woers be accuſtomed: He ſo Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and followed <hi>Emelia,</hi> that ſhe perceiuyng his feruente af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
tolde hym a verie ſhort circumſtaunce, how her father
had diſpoſed her, to one that ſhe could not like of, and therfore,
if he would firſte promiſe to take her as his wife, and that he
could finde ſuche meanes, to conueigh her from her Fathers
houſe in ſecrete ſorte (for otherwiſe ſhe was ſure her Father
would bee a let to hinder their purpoſe) ſhe was contented to
harken to his ſpeeche, and yeeld to his demaunde. <hi>Flanius</hi> the
gladdeſt man in the world, to heare theſe ioyfull newes, ſware
vnto her, that all ſhould bee accompliſhed, and that with as
muche ſpeede as her ſelf would deſire.</p>
               <p>There was no more to conclude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but how ſhe might
be conueighed from out her fathers houſe. <hi>Flanius</hi> deuiſed that
late in an Euenyng, or in the Night tyme when euery one
were quiete in their beddes, if ſhe could finde the meanes to
gette forthe of doores, then he would be readie to receiue her.
But that could not be, for bothe her Fathe and Mather neuer
failed, to bee at home in the Euenynges, and at Nightes ſhe
was lodged in her Fathers Chambers, that it was impoſſible
for her to gett forthe. So that there was no remedie, but that
<pb facs="tcp:7038:83"/>
the feate muſt bee wrought in ſome after Noone, when bothe
her Father and Mother vſed to bee abroade, about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
And then ſhe knewe not how to come forthe alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe had not been accuſtomed ſo to dooe, and to followe a
ſtraunger, it would breede the greater ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Flanius</hi> to auoide all theſe ſurmiſes, deuiſed the nexte
euenyng, to conueigh her in at ſome backe windowe of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, a ſute of mannes apparell: wherein the next daie in
the after noone, her father &amp; mother beyng abroad, ſhe ſhould
ſhift her ſelf, and ſo come her waies vnknowne of any, to ſuche
a place: where he himſelf would be ready awaiting for her, and
ſo conueigh her home to his owne houſe. This deuiſe <hi>Emelia</hi>
liked paſſyng will, and accordyng as it was appoincted. The
next euening <hi>Flanius</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueighed this ſute of apparell in at the
windowe, where <hi>Emelia</hi> was ready to receiue it, and laiyng it
vp in ſafetie, til the next daie in the after noone, her father and
her mother beyng bothe forthe of dores, ſhe quickly ſhifted her
ſelf, into this manes apparell, and thus forth of dores ſhe goes
to her appointed place, wher <hi>Flanius</hi> was ſtaiyng, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to promiſe, conueighed her home to his owne houſe.</p>
               <p>This matter was not ſo cloſely handeled by <hi>Emelia,</hi> but
ſhe was eſpied by one of her Fathers ſeruauntes, who beeyng
on the backſide through a Windowe, ſawe her how ſhe was
ſtripping of her ſelf, and marked how ſhe put on the mannes
apparell, whereat the yong fellowe had greate meruaile, and
ſtoode ſtill beholdyng to ſee what would fall out in the ende,
But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſawe her goe forthe a dores, he haſtened after into
the ſtreate: But <hi>Emelia</hi> was ſo ſodainly gone, that for his life
hr wiſt not whiche waies to ſeeke after her, wherfore in a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
haſte, he came to his Maiſter, whom he founde in the
Citee, in the companie of <hi>Philotus,</hi> ſaiyng: Oh ſir, I haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
euill newes to tell you, what is the matter (ꝙ his maiſter)
is any thyng a miſſe at home? Yea ſir (ꝙ the ſeruaunte) your
daughter <hi>Emelia</hi> is euen now departed into the Citee, in the
habite of a man: But whiche waies ſhe wente, I could not for
my life deuiſe, for after ſhe gat once forthe of the place where
ſhe ſhifter her, I could neuer more ſet eye of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7038:84"/>
Is <hi>Emelia</hi> gone (quoth her louer <hi>Philotus</hi>) Oh God, what
euill newes bee theſe that I heare: And without any further
ſtaie, bothe the Father and the Louer, gat them out at the doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
together, and aboute the ſtreates thei runne like a couple
of madde men.</p>
               <p>Now it fell out, that <hi>Philerno</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Alberto,</hi> and
Brother to <hi>Emella,</hi> whom you haue heard before, was lefte at
<hi>Naples,</hi> beeyng an Infante, and had remained there till this

<hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to viſite his Father and Mother, of whom

And it fortuned that <hi>Alberto</hi> and <hi>Philotus,</hi> happened to

my <hi>Briſilla,</hi> and to abide your ſentence, whereto I doubte not,

               <p>No ſure (quoth <hi>Briſilla</hi>) I haue no maner of knowledge of

mynde to ſaie: Doe you not thinke it verie ſtraunge in deede,
that the one of vs ſhould bee made bothe mother and daughter

and vnbrideled affections, that to ſerue their owne appetites,
thei force not with what clogges of care, thei comber vs that

that will fall out ſo ouerthwarte to our behoofes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

in likyng, as flowers are ſeen to agree with Froſte, but
in plaine tearmes (my <hi>Briſilla</hi>) and to diſcipher a verie trothe
it is contracted betweene our aged parentes, that your father
(as you ſee) ſhould firſt take me to his wife, whiche weddyng
beyng once performed, then my Father in like maner, ſhould
chalenge you, accordyng as it is concluded betweene them.</p>
               <p>Alas (ꝙ <hi>Briſilla</hi>) theſe newes bee ſtraunge in deede, and it

it been, that we had neuer been borne.</p>
               <p>Alas my <hi>Briſilla</hi> (ꝙ <hi>Philerno</hi>) tormente not your ſelf with

But I would to God my <hi>Briſilla,</hi> that I were a man for your

where <hi>Alberto</hi> gaue <hi>Phylerno</hi> his ſonne, in the ſteede of his
daughter <hi>Emelia</hi> to <hi>Phylotus</hi> for his wife: when all the reſt of
the Marriage rites that are to bee doen in the Churche were
performed, thei paſſed forthe the daie with feaſtyng and great
mirthe vntill it was night. When the companie beganne to
breake vp, and euery one to take his leaue, and <hi>Phylotus</hi> with
his bride were brought into their Chamber, where <hi>Phylerno</hi>
deſiryng the companie to auoyde, and makyng faſt the doore
he ſaied to <hi>Phylotus,</hi> there reſteth yet a matter to bee decided
betweene you and me, and ſeyng we bee here together by our
<pb facs="tcp:7038:88"/>
ſelues, and that tyme and place doeth fall out ſo fit, I holde it
for the beſt that it be preſently determined.</p>
               <p>What is the matter then (ꝙ <hi>Phylotus</hi>) ſpeake boldly my
<hi>Emelia,</hi> and if there be any thyng that hanges in diſpence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs, I truſt it ſhall eaſely bee brought to a good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I praie God it maie (ꝙ <hi>Phylerno</hi>) and to reueale the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in breefe and ſhorte circumſtaunce, it is this. You are now
my houſebande, and I your lawfull wife, and for that I dooe
knowe the difference in our yeares, your ſelf beyng ſo old and
I very yong, it muſt needes fall out there wil be as greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
in our conditions: for age is commonly giuen to bee
frowarde, teſtie, and ouerthwart: youth againe to be frolique,
pleaſaunt, and merrie, and ſo likewiſe in all our other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wee ſhall bee founde ſo contrary and diſagreyng, that it
will be impoſſible for vs to like the one of the others doinges,
for when I ſhall ſeeme to followe my owne humour, then it
will fall out to your diſcontentment. And you againe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
that diet whiche your age doeth conſtraine, will be moſt
lothſome vnto me, then you beyng my houſbande will thinke
to commaunde me, and I muſt be obedient to your will, but
I beyng your wife will thinke ſcorne to be controlde, and wil
diſpoſe of my ſelf according to my owne liking, and then what
braules and brabbles will fall out, it were to muche to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed,
and thus we ſhall liue neither of vs bothe in quiet, nor
neither of vs bothe contented, and therefore for the auoidyng
of theſe inconueniences, I haue deuiſed this waie, that beyng
thus together by our ſelues, we will trie by the eares whiche
of vs ſhall bee maiſter and haue authoritie to commaunde: if
the victory happen on your ſide, I am contented for euer after
to frame my ſelf to your ordinaunce and will as it ſhall pleaſe
you to appoinct: if otherwiſe the conqueſt happen on my ſide,
I will triumph like a Victor, and will looke to beare ſuche a
ſwaie, that I will not be contraried in any thing, what ſo euer
it ſhall pleaſe me to commaunde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phylotus</hi> knowyng not what to make of theſe ſpeeches,
and thinkyng the tyme very long, till he had taken his firſt

fruites, ſaied: Come, come my <hi>Emelia</hi> let vs goe to bed, where
I doubt not but we ſhall ſo well agree, that theſe matters wil
eaſely bee taken vp, without any controuerſie, ſuche as you
haue ſpoken of.</p>

or I at yours.</p>
               <p>Why (ꝙ <hi>Phylotus</hi>) doe you ſpeake in earneſt, or would you
looke to commaunde me that am your houſbande, to whom
you ought to vſe all duetie and obedience.</p>
               <p>Then were I in good caſe (ꝙ <hi>Phylerno</hi>) that ſhould be tied
to vſe duetie or obedience, to a man of your yeares, that would
not let to preſcribe vs rules of your owne dotage, to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in ſteede of domeſticall diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Then I perceiue (ꝙ <hi>Phylotus</hi>) wee ſhall haue ſomethyng
adoe with you hereafter, that will vſe me with theſe tearmes
the very firſt night. But ſee you make no more to dooe, but
come on your waies to bed.</p>
               <p>And I perceiue (quoth <hi>Phylerno</hi>) the longer that I beare
with you, the more foole I ſhall finde you, and with this vp

Wherefore holdyng vp his handes he cried, Oh <hi>Emelia,</hi> I

               <p>

haue you promiſe me to confirme theſe conditions, whiche fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe

and what greef it was to her conſcience, that ſhe ſhould ſo farr
ſtraie from the duetie and obedience of a child, and to become

her further to proceede in her tale, ſaied: Alas deare daughter
