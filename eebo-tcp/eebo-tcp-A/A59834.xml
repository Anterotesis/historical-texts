            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> REPLY <hi>to the</hi> REFLECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS <hi>upon the</hi> ANSWER <hi>to the Papist Misrepresented,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Do not love to be behind-hand in Civility with any Man, and therefore, in the Name of the Answerer, I return the Reflecter his Complement, and that with some advantage: For I heartily thank him for the Civility of his Language, and more for the Civility of his Arguments; and having done this once for all, I shall apply my self to consider his Reflections, and will complement no more.</p>
            <p>His Reflections consist principally of two general Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. What concerns the Misrepresentation of a Papist.</item>
               <item>II. Concerning the Rule of true representing.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The Misrepresentation of a Papist. And here I confess, he has shewed some Art, but very little Honesty. He was told in the Answer, that some of those Misrepresentations which he had made of a Papist, and given out for the Protestant Character of Popery, were <hi>his own ignorant, or childish, or wilful
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50614:3"/>
Mistakes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> As that <hi>Papists are never permitted to hear Sermons, which they are able to understand; or, that they held it lawful to commit Idolatry; or, that a Papist believes the Pope to be his great God, and to be far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Angels.</hi> These, I think, may pass for Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations, and very childish and ignorant ones too: and hence the Reflecter craftily insinuates, that we grant all his Misrepresentations of a Papist, to be ignorant, childish, or wilful Mistakes; and is willing to end this Dispute (and I very much commend him for it)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon these terms, that <hi>his Character of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist misrepresented,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reflect.</hi> p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>should be confessed to be made up of false Apprehensions, ignorant, childish, and wilful Mistakes</hi>; and that he may <hi>use the Authority</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer <hi>to assure his Friends and Acquaintance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that wheresoever they shall for the future, either hear, or read such things charged upon the Papists, they must give it no Credit, and esteem it no better than the false Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, ignorant, childish, and wilful Mistakes of the Relators.</hi> This would be a great Point gained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and I am sorry we cannot oblige him in it.</p>
            <p>Especially, since he has taken the Pains to prove by great and good Authorities, that his Character of a Papist misrepresented, is not made up of such chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Mistakes; but is indeed what the best and wisest Men have believed of them; and this we thank him for.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toid. pag.</hi> 2.</note> He alleadges the Authority of <hi>the Homilies,</hi> a Book which we greatly reverence. <hi>Fox's Book of Martyrs,</hi> where we read, how many were burnt for not believing, as his <hi>Papist misrepresented</hi> believes. <hi>Bishop</hi> Ridly'<hi>s Writings,</hi> a very learned and holy Man, who may be supposed to have understood what Popery was, and that he was not so fond of misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting, as to burn for it. <hi>The publick Test,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50614:3"/>
authentick and lasting Proof of this Matter; with several other good Authors he mentions, whose Credit is never the worse, because he hath thrust one bad Man into the Company. Nay, he has been so civil, as to grant the Answerer to be as very a Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenter as the rest (and he had been a very strange Answerer, if he had not;)<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> which argues great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty in him, to desire leave to use his Name and Authority to condemn the Misrepresentation; that is, to confute his own Book, (which in all the material Points, proves what he calls the Misrepresentation (I wo'nt say not to be ignorant Mistakes, but) to be the avowed Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) which is the only way I know of, that it can be confuted; for unless he condemn it himself, I am sure this Reflecter can never confute it.</p>
            <p>Well, but what then is the meaning of all this pother and noise about this <hi>double Character of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist misrepresented and represented</hi>? Why are we so angry with what he calls the Misrepresentation, if it be true? or, what is the fault of it? This is a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which ought to be explained: and I doubt our Reflecter will have no reason to glory, that he gave the occasion of it. And I shall do these two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Show you what are the Faults of the Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation.</item>
               <item>II. That allowing for such Faults, the Papist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented (excepting some very few cases) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to believe all that the Papist misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is charged with.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. As for the Faults of the Misrepresentation, they are briefly these.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50614:4"/>1. That he puts such things into the Character of a Papist, as no Man in his Wits ever charged them with; and these the Answerer calls <hi>childish, and ignorant, or wilful Mistakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Opinions of Protestants concerning Popish Doctrines and Practices, and those ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents which are charged, and justly charged upon them, are put into the Character of <hi>a Papist misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,</hi> as if they were his avowed Doctrine and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; which is misrepresenting indeed, but is his own, not our Misrepresentation. We charge them with nothing, but what they expresly profess to believe, and what they practise, and we tell them what we think of such Doctrines and Practices, what their Nature, and what their Consequences are; but do not charge them with believing as we believe, concerning these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and therefore it is not fair to put such things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Protestant Character of <hi>a Papist misrepresented.</hi> As to give an Instance of a like nature; There are some dissenting Protestants, who think it lawful to resist their Prince, and take up Arms against him: this we say is Rebellion; and yet it would be a very ridiculous Misrepresentation of such Men, to say, they are those, who believe it lawful to rebel; for no Man believes Rebellion, no more than Idolatry, to to be lawful: and they no more believe taking up Arms in such cases to be Rebellion, than the Papist thinks his Worship of Saints and Images to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which shows how unjust it is, to put the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and Consequences of Mens Opinions and Practices, which they themselves disown, into their Character. And tho we never do this, the Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter has done it for us; which makes it a false Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, tho every thing which is said in it may be true.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50614:4"/>3. It is still so much the worse, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and Consequences, which are charged upon Mens Practices and Opinions, are set in the front of the Character, as first and Original Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. As, to keep to our former Instance. To say, that Men believe Rebellion to be lawful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make no scruple of taking up Arms against their Prince; is a very different thing from saying, that Men believe they may lawfully take up Arms in some Cases, and in doing so are guilty of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>These are some of the principal Arts our Author has used in drawing the Character of <hi>a Papist misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,</hi> as I will presently show in particular. But then on the other hand, to draw a fair Character of <hi>a Papist represented</hi>; He, (1.) as easily he might, denies that he believes those Interpretations and Consequences, which we charge their Doctrines and Practices with, and which the Misrepresenter has put into their Character, and charges them with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. But, (2) he generally owns the Doctrines and Practices, which we charge them with, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to vindicate them, and to put new Colours on them; so that the main difference between us is not in the Character, but whether their Doctrines and Practices be of so hainous a nature as we say they are, which is matter of Dispute, not of Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Though, (3.) in some Cases he disowns that to be the Doctrine and Belief of their Church, which manifestly is so, and has been proved on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all possibility of a fair Reply, by the Learned Answerer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50614:5"/>That this is the true State of the Case, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the two-fold Character of <hi>a Papist misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented and represented</hi>; I come now to show, which I shall do in these Characters, which he himself has given us of them: Only I must desire the Reader, for his own satisfaction, to compare what I write with his Characters, for I shall not transcribe them at large, both to save my Labour and Paper.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I. <hi>Of Praying to Images.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Misrepresentation here, as to the Matter, is every word true; but yet is a false Character by the second and third Rules of Misrepresentation. <hi>A Papist misrepresented, worships Stocks and Stones for Gods.</hi> We only charge them with worshipping Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and the fault of that, we say, is, (though we never charge them with saying or thinking so) that <hi>they worship Stocks and Stones for Gods.</hi> But now to misrepresent us in the Character of <hi>a Papist misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,</hi> he makes us charge a Papist with believing his Images of Wood and Stone to be Gods; and that this is the reason and foundation, (not meerly the true Interpretation) of their Image-worship; as he adds, <hi>And for this reason he erects stately Monuments to them in his Churches—falls down prostrate before them, and with his eyes fixed on them, cries out, Help me</hi> Mary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas we only charge them with worshipping Images, and do say, and prove too, that in the Scripture-Notion, this is to worship Stocks and Stones for Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50614:5"/>Now comes the Representer, and he says, That <hi>a Papist Represented, believes it damnable to worship Stocks and Stones for Gods:</hi> That is, he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that worshipping Images, (as we say, it is) is worshipping Stocks and Stones for Gods: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever said that they did believe this? But does he worship Images or not? This he grants, when he says, That <hi>the honour which is exhibited to the Images, is referred to the Prototypes, which they represent</hi>; which is all that can be possibly meant by worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Christ, or his Saints, by Images; that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all that worship, which they pay to Images, to Christ, or the Saints, whom those Images represent. Now if they refer that worship, which they give to the Image, to Christ, they must worship the Image; and this (Image-worship) is all we expressly charge them with owning. What the nature and true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this worship is, which we say, is <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Stocks and Stones for Gods,</hi> we will dispute with them when they please.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II. <hi>Of Worshipping Saints.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THus the Papist Misrepresented, is said to <hi>make Gods of dead men</hi>: Whereas we only charge them with Praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Saints departed; and this we say, is to make Gods of them, such Gods as the Heathens made of their Inferior Daemons, and Intercessors between God and Men. And does the Representer deny that they pray to Saints? No, but owns and defends it, as well as he can; and there we are ready to joyn Issue with him.</p>

And this we think (if Prayer be a sign of Honour) is to honour her ten times more, than they do her Son, or God the Father; and if Prayer signifie our belief of the power, or interest of that Being, to whom we pray to help us, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of our Prayers to the Virgin must signify, that we expect more help and relief from praying to her, than from directing our Prayers immediately to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50614:6"/>
God or Christ; for it is natural to pray oftenest to those, from whose power or intercession (which is power too) we expect most. But now our Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter has made a very false Character of this, by putting these consequential charges into the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and setting them in the first place as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not the Consequences or Interpretation of their frequent Prayers to the Virgin.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50614:7"/>
Idolatry to be lawful, but whether he be not guilty of Idolatry in worshipping the Host? and therefore this ought not to be put into the Character of a Papist; for those who believe that he worships nothing but Bread and Wine, and is guilty of Idolatry in it, do not charge him with believing so. And therefore, the Representer, who acknowledges the worship of the Host, might very truly deny all the rest.</p>
               <p>As for Transubstantiation, we charge them with believing no more, than what they themselves own; That the Consecrated Bread and Wine is changed into the natural substance of Christ's Flesh and Blood; which the Misrepresenter very fallaciously calls Christ's being <hi>really present under those appearances</hi>; that our People may not perceive the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> denies, and <hi>a real presence,</hi> which she owns, not under <hi>the appearances</hi> of Bread and Wine, but in the use of the Consecrated Bread and Cup; which differ as much as a Bodily and Sacramental presence. Now if this Doctrine of Transubstantiation be true, besides many other Absurdities, we say, Christ must have as many Bodies, as there are Consecrated Hosts; and that his Body must be on Earth, and that in fifty thousand distant places at the same time; though the Scripture assures us, That he ascended in his Body into Heaven, and is to continue there till he come to Judgment. But we do not charge the Papists with believing these Absurdities, (for we cannot guess what they believe); much less do we charge them with believing, that there are <hi>as many Christs, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Redeemers, as there are Churches, Altars, or Priests.</hi> For there is (we grant) some little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.

               <p>The Representer indeed qualifies this by saying, <hi>That through the Merits of Christ, the good Works of a just Man proceeding from Grace, are so acceptable to God, that through his Goodness and Promise, they are truly meritorious of Eternal Life.</hi> The Answerer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leages the 32<hi>d</hi> Canon, <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where no such Qualification is used, which yet is the Canon purposely designed to establish the Merits of goods Works.

of that Session, this Doctrine is explained at large, and there we may expect the fullest Account of it, which in short is this.</p>
               <p>That that Divine Vertue which flowes from Christ into justified Persons, as from the Head to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and from the Vine to the Branches, makes the good Actions of such Men acceptable to God, and meritorious; and that such good Works which are done in God, do satisfy the Divine Law, and truly and properly merit Eternal Life. That this is called our Righteousness, because we are justified by its inhering in us; and the Righteousness of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is infused into us by God, through the Merits of Christ: and that the Goodness of God as to this matter, consists in this, that he will have his own Gifts to be our Merits: And therefore in the 32<hi>d</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, they pronounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> against those, who shall say, that the good Works of a justified Man are so the Gift of God, as not to be his own Merits.

This we think injurious to the Grace of God, and the Merits of Christ: they think it is not, and we never said they did.</p>

The Absolution of the Priest remits the Eternal Punishment of Sin, and keeps Men out of Hell; but still the Temporal Punishment in Purgatory remains due: and this must be taken off, either by humane Satisfactions and Penances (of which presently) or by the Pope's Pardon, which surely is a differently thing from <hi>the Relaxation of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Penances,</hi> as the Representer states it; for I never heard before, that Purgatory Fire was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Penance, enjoyned by the Church; for sure the Decrees of the Church did not kindle Purgatory, and it is strange the Church should grant so many thousand Years Pardon of Canonical Penances, (if they concern this Life) as some Indulgences contain, when few Men live an hundred Years in this World, and then have no need of all the rest.</p>
               <p>We say the Popes have, and do to this day sell these Indulgences, at different rates, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Crime; and Men who have Mony, need not fear the Purgatory Fires, and Men who have none, must be contented to endure them: this we grant with the Representer to be a great Abuse, but it is an Abuse of their Popes, and hardly separable from the Doctrine and Practice <hi>of Indulgences.</hi>

The <hi>Papist Represented,</hi> owns the Authority of General Councils, as well as the other, and receives all their Definitions, and believes them as firmly; but though they define such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines for Articles of Faith, as were never heard of in the Christian Church, and least were never put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Christian Creed before, yet he will not believe them to be Additions to his Faith, or to what was taught by Christ and his Apostles: But Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> his Creed must be the Faith of the Church from the Apostles days. Now here I fancy our Author mistook his side, for the Papist Represented has much the worse Character, that he is so void of all sence, that he cannot tell which is most, twelve, or four and twenty Articles in a Creed.

The truth is, the Infallibility of the Church is the Faith of a Papist; but in whom this Infallibility is seated, whether in the Diffusive, Representative, or Virtual Church, in Pope or Council, or the whole Body of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is not agreed among them. But neither of these are Misrepresentations of a Papist, unless you tell, what particular sort of Papists you represent; and then, I am sure, you misrepresent a Jesuit, if you make him deny the Pope's Infallibility.</p>

That there is such a State, the <hi>Representer</hi> most industriously and zealously proves: Why then is the belief of Purgatory thrust into the Character of <hi>a Papist misrepresented?</hi> All that I can perceive is, That the Misrepresentation consists, not in charging them with believing a Purgatory, but with believing it <hi>contrary to all Reason, the Word of God, and all Antiquity</hi>; for the Representer says, <hi>he believes it damnable to admit of any thing for Faith, that is contrary to Reason, the word of God, and all Antiquity. Damnable</hi> is a very dangerous word, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when it is applied to <hi>believing things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reason</hi>; and therefore though it may serve now and then to bluster with, I would advise him to use it sparingly: but though I must confess, we think, that they do believe a Purgatory, and a great many other things, which are contrary to Reason, Scripture, and Antiquity; yet we do not say, that they admit any thing for Faith, which they believe contrary to Reason, Scripture, and Antiquity; and therefore this is no part of their Character, and therefore no Mirepresentation.</p>

But no Protestant ever charged them with preaching, as well as praying in Latin: but the meaning of this is easily understood, to perswade those People, who place all their Religion in hearing Sermons, that it is no matter what Language their Prayers are in (which they care not much for hearing when they are in English) if they have but English Sermons to entertain their Curiosity and itching Ears. And it is, I confess, a cunning Suggestion, and I hope will warn all sober Christians to joyn more devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Prayers of the Church, which they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and that will teach them the difference between an English Liturgy, and Latin Mass-Book.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Character only charges them with praying in Latin, a Language which the People do not understand; and therefore, whatever other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Thoughts they may have, they cannot joyn with the Priest in offering up the same Petitions to God, when they do not understand what it is he says: All this is granted on all hands to be true, and yet this also which the Representer owns, is called misrepresenting.</p>

We are all agreed in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Rule of Faith, as he says they are, only our Rule indeed differs; we take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the safest Rule, and we all agree, that it is so; they the Sense, and Judgment, and Faith of their Church; and I doubt not, but we shall as soon agree in the Sense of every Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as they will, what that Authority in the Church is to which they must yield, what these Traditions are they must receive, and what is the true Sense and Interpretation of the Definitions and Decrees of their Councils. We agree in the Articles of the Apostles Creed, which was the ancient Faith of the Church; and our Differences as to matters of Faith, are as meer School-Disputes, as they say theirs are, and in most cases the same; as about Predestination, Election and Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Efficacy of Grace, and Free-will. We have some indeed which they have not; and they

Now we are so far from misrepresenting in this case, that we do not think this a reasonable Objection against either side; but if they will needs be talking of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, to perswade People for Peace and Unities sake to take Sanctuary in an Infallible Church, they must give us leave to tell our People, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, tho it sounds big, does not do such feats in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as is pretended.

But if to condemn their Doctrines and Practices, if to charge them with contradicting the evidence of Sense, of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and of Scripture, that they are innovations in Faith, and corruptions of the Christian Worship, be to misrepresent them; we confess we are such misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenters, and, for ought I can perceive, are like to continue so; unless they have some better arguments in reserve, than ever we yet saw; for <hi>Character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making</hi> will not do it: so that all this cry about misrepresenting is come to just nothing. We like a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist as little, as he has represented him, as when we see him represented by a Protestant Pen; for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50614:22"/>
there is no difference at all in the Parts, Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Features, though there is some difference in the Colours. A Papist is the same in both Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, only with this difference, that a Protestant thinks him a very bad Christian; and a Papist, we may be sure, thinks him a very good one. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant thinks the Faith and Worship of a Papist to be contrary to Sense, Reason, and Scripture, and the Faith and Practice of the Primitive Church; a Papist thinks it agreeable to all these Rules, or can give a Reason why it should not. And therefore I could not but smile at his concluding Proposal, <hi>to convince us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Faith, as he has represented it, is really the Faith of the Papist,</hi> (which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is true, excepting the deposing Doctrine, and some few other Points, which I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) <hi>that the decision of this whole Affair depend upon an experience. Do but you, or any Friend for you, give your assent to these Articles of Faith in the very form and manner as I have stated them, and if upon your Request, you are not admitted into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Roman Catholicks, and owned to believe aright in all those Points, I'll then confess, that I have abused the World, &amp;c.</hi> and truly I am apt to think so too; but we must like his Faith better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall make the Experiment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But it is time now to proceed to his other Reflections, which concern the Rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be known. For though the Faith of their Church be infallible, it is wonderful hard to know what their Faith is. Now his Reflections may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50614:22"/>
to two general Heads. First, Concerning the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the Rules of expounding it. Secondly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the false Rules the Answerer has used in judging of the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Concerning the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Rules of expounding it. The Author of <hi>A Papist misrepresented and represented,</hi> in drawing the Character of a Papist represented, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to follow the Doctrine <hi>prescribed in the Council of</hi> Trent. This the Answerer says,<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> 
                  <hi>he finds no fault with,</hi> and therefore would not ask, <hi>How the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>comes to be the rule and measure of Doctrine to any here, where it was never received,</hi> p. 9. ed. 1. To this the Reflecter answers, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>is received here, and all the Catholick World over, as to all its definitions of Faith,</hi> p. 5. By which,<note place="margin">Page 5.</note> I suppose, he means, that all <hi>English</hi> Catholicks do own the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and take their Rule of Faith from it; but this is not, what the Answerer means by that Question; Whether <hi>English</hi> Catholicks singly for themselves, and in their private Capacities, own the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; but by what publick Act of Church or State it has been received in <hi>England,</hi> as it has been in other Catholick Countries. The Church of <hi>England</hi> had no Representatives in that Council, nor did by any after Act own it's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therefore it is no authentick and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Rule here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50614:23"/>But allowing the Authority of this rule to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, what is Popery, and what not, which the Answerer allows reasonable enough, considering that its definitions of Faith are received all the Catholick World over, as the Reflecter saith, the greater difficulty is about the Interpretation of this rule. For not only we Hereticks interpret this Council a little differently from our Author, but Catholick Doctors themselves cannot agree about it. Now when other good Catholicks differ from him in explaining the definitions and Decrees of this Council, why must his sense, and not theirs, pass for the character of a Papist?</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. did strictly forbid any private Man to interpret the Council according to his own private sense and opinion; but if any dispute happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the true meaning of their definitions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, he reserved the decision of it to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See; and a very wise Decree it was, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many of their definitions were penned in loose and ambiguous words on purpose to compose the disputes and differences of their Divines (who were many times very troublesome to the Council) that each party might think their own sense fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; but then considering what ill consequence this might be of, to suffer them to dispute the sense of the Council, and wrest it to countenance their private opinions, which would rather inflame, than compose these disputes (a fresh example of which, they had in the dispute between <hi>Catharinus</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> while the Council was sitting) the Pope very prudently forbids this, that if they would still wrangle among themselves, yet the authority of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50614:23"/>
the Council might not be concerned in it. But now if their Doctors do differ still about the sense of the Council, and affix their private opinions on it, and Popes think fit rather to connive at these differences, than to undertake to determine them, why must any one of these different opinions be so made the character of a Papist, as to exclude the other? If some, and those of greatest note and authority in the Church, and not inferiour in number (to say no more) are for the deposing Doctrine, and others against it, why must those only be thought Papists, who deny this deposing power, and not those also, who assert it? Whether it be the Faith of the Church or not, is a dispute between them: and though our Author denies, that it is the Faith of the Church, and therefore that a Papist is not bound to believe it; yet those who are for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Power, assert that it is the Faith of the Church, and that with much greater reason than he denies it; and what authority has he to decide this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and who gave him this authority? Does not <hi>his representation of a Papist,</hi> in this point, <hi>depend upon his own private sense and opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, he says,<note place="margin">Page. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He is so far from being guilty of this fault of interpreting the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>in his own sense? that he has only delivered it, as it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to him, and to all their Church in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism</hi> ad Parochos, <hi>composed and set forth by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Council and</hi> Pius V. <hi>for the instruction of the faithful in their Christian duty touching Faith and good Manners, in conformity to the sense of the Council:</hi> And is he sure, that all his representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are conformable to the sense of this Catechism?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50614:24"/>
May he not play tricks with the Catechism, and expound that by a private spirit, as well as the Council?</p>
               <p>Well, but <hi>he appealed in his conclusion to</hi> Veron'<hi>s rule of Faith.</hi> And what of that? How comes <hi>Veron</hi>'s rule to be so Authentick, as to justifie any interpretation, which agrees with it? Why did not our Author appeal to his own character? which may have as much authority, for ought I know, as <hi>Veron</hi>'s rule. But besides <hi>Veron,</hi> he appeals to the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Condom, <hi>who drew up a like character in</hi> Paris <hi>of the belief of a Papist.</hi> And what is the authority of this Bishops character? For Bishops have no more authority to expound the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (which is intirely reserved to the Apostolick See) than private Doctors. Yes, the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Book has all requisite authority, because the second Edition <hi>was published with several distinct attestations of many Bishops and Cardinals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the present Pope himself, wherein they at large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Doctrine contained in that Treatise for the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Council of</hi> Trent. I shall take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is, as the Reflecter says, but what then? Had not Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s controversies as great an attestation as the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church</hi>? Did he not dedicate them to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. and that with the Popes leave and good liking, <hi>Te annuente,</hi> as he himself says? and how much inferiour is this to a Testimonial under the Popes hand? And why then are not <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Controversies as authentick
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50614:24"/>
a rule for the exposition of the Catholick Faith, as the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> to whom the Reflecter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us, would have taught him, that the Popes private approbation is as little worth, as any other Bishops.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That the name of the Apostolick See does not signifie the Pope in his personal capacity, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting as it becomes the Chair; that is, not giving his own private sense, but proceeding in Council, with the advice of good and learned Men.

               </p>
               <p>But the Answerer did not only charge him in general with interpreting the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> by his own private sense and opinions, but gave some particular instances of it, and I must now consider, how the Reflecter takes off this charge.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to Invocation of Saints,<note place="margin">Page. 7.</note> he limits their power of</hi> helping us to Prayers only, whereas he grants <hi>the Council mentions their Aid and Assistance, as well as Prayers.</hi> And the only vindication he thinks ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make for this is, <hi>that no other means of their aiding and assisting us, is expressed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or in the Catechism</hi> ad Parochos, <hi>besides that of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50614:25"/>
their Prayers; and it is thus limited by the Bishop of</hi> Condom <hi>on this Subject with the Pope and Cardinals approbation.</hi> But though the Council does not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, what other <hi>aid and assistance</hi> we may expect from the Saints besides their Prayers; yet it menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Aid and Assistance,</hi> without limiting it to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of their Prayers; and the Answerer (<hi>P.</hi> 25.) told him what reason he had to believe, that neither the <hi>Trent</hi> Council nor Catechism did intend any such limitation: but this he thought fit to take no notice of, for it had been very troublesome to answer it. As for the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> though his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is nothing, yet I do not find, that he limits <hi>their aid and assistance</hi> only to their Prayers for us; for after repeating the Decree of the Council, <hi>That it is good and useful to invoke the Saints by way of supplication, and to have recourse to their succors and assistances,</hi> &amp;c. he quietly drops the last clause without say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of it, and only tells us, <hi>It is evident that to invoke the Saints according to the intent of this Council, is to resort to their Prayers, for the obtaining the blessings and benefits of God by Jesus Christ.</hi> And no doubt but this is true; but the Council speaks not only of <hi>invoking the Saints,</hi> but <hi>of flying to their aid and assistance</hi>: and pray what does that signifie? That he had no mind to tell us, and when he says nothing of it, how comes our Reflecter to know, that he limits it to their Prayers?</p>
               <p>As for the point of merit, I have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that, though I do not see upon second thoughts, how the Answerer is concerned in it; for he does not alledge the 32 Canon to oppose, what he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, that good works are meritorious by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and promise of God, but for the sake of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> which it denounces against those, who deny,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50614:25"/>
that good works are truly meritorious of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Grace and eternal life: And therefore his next instance is <hi>the Popes personal Infallibility.</hi> This our Reflecter denys, and makes it the Character of a Papist misrepresented to assert it: and yet there are as many Papists, who believe the Popes Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as there are, who deny it; and were they to make Characters, to deny the Popes personal Infallibility, would certainly be one Character of a Papist mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented: But he says,<note place="margin">Page 8.</note> this is only <hi>a School-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> and <hi>not matter of Faith, because not positively determined by any general Council.</hi> And yet whoever reads Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and several others on this subject, would think they made a matter of Faith of it. But I would ask him, Whether the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church be an Article of Faith? If it be, my next question is, In what general Council it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined? It seems indeed to be taken for granted in some later Councils, but I am yet to seek, what Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council has positively defined it. I am sure <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> and other learned Divines of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who use all manner of arguments, they can think of, to prove the Infallibility of the Church, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alledge the authority of any Council for it: So that it seems infallibility it self was never determined by any General Council; and if the Infallibility of the Church be matter of Faith, though it were never defined by any General Council, why may not the Infallibility of the Pope be so too? nay how does our Reflecter come to believe the Infallibility of a General Council? for this is no more defined by any General Council, than the Infallibility of the Pope is.</p>
               <p>If there must be Infallibility in the Church some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, I think, the Pope, whom they acknowledge to be the supream Pastor, has the fairest Pretences
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50614:26"/>
to it. For Infallibility ought in reason to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the greatest and most absolute Power. If we must have an infallible Judge of Controversies, it must be the Pope, not a Council; because if you place Infallibility in a Council, the Church has no infallible Judge any longer than while the Council is sitting. For the Definitions and Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, how infallible soever they are, yet certainly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an infallible Judge, which they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to the Scriptures themselves. And therefore if the Church can never be without an infallible Judge, he who is the supreme Pastor and Judge must be infallible. Now this being the Case, I desire to know, why our Reflecter prefers the Infallibility of a General Council, before the Pope's personal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility? how one comes to be matter of Faith, and not the other? or if neither of them be, why one makes the Character of a Papist misrepresented, the other of a Papist represented. For though he pretends <hi>not to deliver his own private Sentiment or Opinion concerning this Point</hi>; but only to relate <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> yet he has so cunning a way of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Tale, as to let every body know, which side he is of. For we may guess, that he does not over admire the <hi>Papist misrepresented,</hi> and then he cannot be very fond of the Pope's Infallibility, which is part of that Character.</p>
               <p>And now I come to the <hi>Goliath-argument,</hi> as he calls it, concerning the <hi>deposing Power,</hi> which he puts into this form.<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> 
                  <hi>In my Character of a Papist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, I pretend to declare the Faith of a Roman-Catholick, as it is defined and delivered in allowed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils; and yet though the deposing Doctrine has been as evidently declared in such Councils, as ever Purgatory and Transubstantiation were in that of</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50614:26"/>
Trent; <hi>yet still with me, it is no Article of our Faith.</hi> This indeed is an untoward Argument, and I wish him well delivered, and I think he does very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to keep at a distance with a sling and a stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not venture to grapple with it. To this he thus replies:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I answer it in short, that though all Doctrinal Points defined in any approved General Council, and proposed to the Faithful to be received under an <hi>Anathema,</hi> are with us so many Articles of Faith, and are obligatory to all of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; yet not so of every other Matter declared in such a Council: there being many things treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and resolved on in such an Assembly, which concern not the Faith of the Church, but only some matter of Discipline, Government, or other more particular Affair; and these Constitutions and Decrees are not absolutely obligatory, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>—whose Decrees of Doctrine are as much acknowledged here by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> as within the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, or the <hi>Vatican.</hi> And yet its other Constitutions and Decrees are not universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and it may be never will. Now, Sir, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we allow some Councils have made Decrees for deposing in particular Cases; yet the Power it self not being declared as a doctrinal Point, and the Decrees relating only to Discipline and Government, it comes short of being an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Faith, and all that in your Answer depends on it, falls to the ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now in answer to this, I must inquire into these three things. First, Whether nothing be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith but what is decreed with an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Secondly, Whether the deposing Decree be a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50614:27"/>
Doctrinal Point, or only matter of Discipline and Government. Thirdly, What Authority General Councils have in <hi>decretis morum,</hi> or such matters as concern Discipline and Government.</p>
               <p>First, Whether nothing be an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> but what is decreed with an <hi>Anathema.</hi> Now here we must (1) consider, what they mean by an Article of Faith. For an Article of Faith may be taken in a strict, or in a large Sense. In a strict Sense, it signifies only such Articles, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of which is necessary to Salvation; in a large Sense, it includes all Doctrinal Points, whatever is proposed to us to be believed: There are Articles of both these Kinds, both in Scripture, and in some General Councils; and the difference between them is not, that we must believe the one, and may refuse to believe the other, when they are both proposed with equal Evidence and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but that a mistake in one is not of such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequence, as it is to mistake the other. Whoever refuses to believe, whatever is plainly taught in Scripture, and which he believes to be taught there, is an Infidel, and guilty of disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God, though the thing be of no great consequence in it self, but what he might safely have been ignorant of, or mistaken in; and thus it is with General Councils, if we believe them to be infallible; though their definitions are not all of equal necessity, yet they are all equally true: and therefore we must not pick and chuse, what we will believe, and what we will not believe in the Definitions of a General Council; but we must believe them all, if not to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary, yet to be equally true; and therefore to reject the belief of any thing plainly taught

in the Council as points of Doctrine, is to disown the Authority and Infallibility of the Council. Whatever is defined in the Council is the Faith of the Council, and therefore of the Catholick Church, which is both represented, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly taught by a General Council; and if we will give Men leave to distinguish, they may soon distinguish away all the Council; for it is easie for every Man to find a distinction to excuse him from believing, what he does not like. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this is the true reason of this Dispute about the Marks and Characters of Articles of Faith, that Roman Catholicks must maintain the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their General Councils, and yet meet with some things in them which either they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or dare not own: and therefore (though it may be they do not believe the Infallibility of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils themselves, yet) they are put to hard shifts, to find out some Salvo to reconcile the Infallibility of their Councils, with their disowning some of their Decrees. But this will not do; for though Men, who believe these Councils to be infallible, are not bound to believe all their Definitions to be Articles of Faith in such a strict Sense, as to make the belief of them necessary to Salvation, yet they are bound to believe all their Definitions to be true: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no need of any other <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Secondly, and therefore the use of <hi>Anathema</hi> is not to confirm Articles of Faith, but to condemn
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50614:28"/>
Hereticks, and does not concern the Faith, but the Discipline of the Church. <hi>Anathemas</hi> relate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to Persons, not to Doctrines. The Faith of the Church is setled by the Definitions of Councils, and must be so, before there can be any place for <hi>Anathemas.</hi> For till it be determined, what the true Faith is, how can they curse or condemn Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? The infallible Authority of the Council to declare the Faith, gives Life and Soul to the Decree; the <hi>Anathema</hi> signifies only what Censure the Church thinks fit to inflict upon Hereticks, who deny this Faith. And therefore even in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> the Decrees of Faith, and the Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Canons are two distinct things; the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the <hi>Catholick Verity,</hi> and requires all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to believe as they teach, and this establishes the Faith before the <hi>Anathemas</hi> are pronounced by their Canons, and whether any <hi>Anathema</hi> had been denounced or no. And thus it is even in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> which decrees the Doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory without an Anathema, and yet asserts it to be the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and Fathers and Councils, and commands the Bishops to take care this Doctrine be preached to all Christian People, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them,<note place="margin">De auct Conc. 1. 5.</note> which, <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> saies, is a sufficient mark of an Article of Faith without an Anathema; and I suppose <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50614:28"/>I do not deny, but that there is great reason for the Church in some cases to denounce <hi>Anathema's</hi> against great and notorious Hereticks; but I say this belongs to the Discipline, not to the Faith of the Church; and it is very unreasonable to think, that when a Council defines what we are to believe in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point, they should not intend to oblige all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to believe such definitions, unless they curse those who do not:<note place="margin">Concil.

But this Council supposing that now the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> were united to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie and Schism at an end, and the Persons reconciled, there was no need to exercise any Church Censures, and therefore no use for <hi>Anathema's</hi>: For this seems to be the true reason why the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was so liberal of <hi>Anathema's,</hi> because there were so many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and incorrigible Hereticks at that time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next Enquiry is, Whether the deposing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree be a Doctrinal Point, or only matter of Discipline
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50614:29"/>
and Government: For thus the Reflecter says; That <hi>the Deposing Power is not declared as a Doctrinal Point, and the Decrees relate only to Discipline and Government,</hi> and therefore <hi>come short of being an Article of Faith.</hi> This I confess, I look on as a very childish Evasion. For as they have been lately told, <hi>To decree what shall be done,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vindicat. of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Serm. p. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>includes a virtual Definition of that Doctrine on which that Decree is founded.</hi> But I will only ask this Reflecter one short Question, Why he rejects this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Deposing Heretical Princes, or Favourers of Hereticks? Is it because he thinks the Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Heretical Princes, erroneous, or only because he don't like the Practice of it? If the first, then it seems this is a Doctrinal Decree, as well as a Decree of Discipline and Government: If he only condemns the Practice of it, without renouncing the Doctrine; let him say so, and see how Princes will like it. When Papists dispute among themselves about this Deposing Decree; those who are for it, vindicate the Popes Power to depose Princes; those who are against it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the Pope hath any such Power; which shows that they think it a Doctrinal Dispute; for there is no other difference between them, but whether the Pope has, or has not, Power to do it, which is a point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: But when they dispute with us Hereticks, then the Church has not decreed it as a Point of Doctrine, but only of Discipline and Government: But let them tell me then, if this Decree do not involve a Doctrinal Error, what is the fault of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But suppose this Decree must be only ranked among the <hi>decreta morum,</hi> which concern the Discipline and Government of the Church, Is not the Authority of the Church as sacred in such matters, as in points of Doctrine? Is not the Church guided by an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50614:29"/>
Spirit in making such Decrees as concern the whole Christian World, and the propagation and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Christian Faith? At least, Is not the Church secured from making wicked and sinful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees?</p>
               <p>The only Example they have in Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to found the Authority and Infallibility of General Councils, is the Conncil of the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 15. And yet that contains no definition of Faith, but a Decree of Manners, as they call it, that is, a rule whereby they are to guide their Actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defining any point of Doctrine, whereon that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is founded: <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things; that ye abstain from meats offered to Idols, and from Blood, and from things strangled, and from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, from which if you keep your selves, ye shall do well; fare ye well.</hi> They might as well object here, as they do against the deposing Decree, That there is no Point of Doctrine determined in it, but it is only a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to direct them what to do; and yet we find the Holy Ghost assisting in such Decrees; for indeed the rules of Discipline and Government, to direct the lives and manners of men, is the only proper subject of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Authority; and therefore we may most reasonably expect, that God should assist and direct his Church in such matters. The Church has no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make new Articles of Faith; the Gospel was preached by Christ, and what Christ could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly instruct them in, because they were not able to bear it at that time, was supplied by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who led the Apostles into all truth; and now we must expect no farther Revelations. And therefore as to matters of Faith, the Authority
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50614:30"/>
of General Councils was no more than the Authority of Witnesses, to declare what Doctrine they received from Christ and his Apostles; and therefore their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could reach no farther, than we may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably presume them to be credible Witnesses, that is, while the Tradition might be supposed clear and strong, which I doubt, will go no farther than the four first General Councils, which are Received by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but the Authority of the Church in Decrees relating to Discipline and Government is perpetual; and therefore in all Later Councils (if there be any Infallibility in the Church) I should more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely rely on such Decrees than on their Definitions of Faith. And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for the Pope, and <hi>MelchiorCanus</hi> for General Councils (the two Authors to whom our Reflecter refers us) declare,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Rom. Pontif. 1. 4. c. 5. Canus de Auct. Concil. 1. 5.</note> that they cannot err in those Decrees which relate to manners, if they concern the whole Church, and are in things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, that is, that they cannot forbid any Vertue, nor Command any thing which is a Sin. So that they who believe the Infallibility of Popes and Councils, must acknowledg the Lawfulness of deposing Heretical Princes; for if it were Unlawful to do it, Popes and Councils could never Command it.</p>
               <p>Our Reflecter indeed proves,<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> That <hi>such Decrees and Constitutions as concern Discipline and Government, are not absolutely obligatory</hi> from the Example of the Council of Trent, <hi>whose decrees of Doctrine are as much acknowledged here by Catholicks in</hi> England, and Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>as within the Walls of</hi> Rome <hi>it self, or the</hi> Vatican; <hi>and yet its other Constitutions and Decrees are not Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received, and it may be never will.</hi> But pray can he tell me, for what reason this is? Let him say, if he dare, that it is for want of Authority or Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50614:30"/>
in the Council to make Decrees to oblige all the Christian World; and if Christian Princes will not submit to the Decrees of Councils, and the Church dares not compel them to it, does this justify such a refusal? The truth is, such Decrees ought not to take place, nor become Laws in a Christian Nation, without the Consent and Authority of the Soveraign Prince; and therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors gave Authority to the Decrees of Councils, and made them Laws; but since the Church has pretended to act Independently on the Secular Powers, and to give Laws to them without their consent; no wonder that Princes, who understand their own Authority, and have power to defend it, take what they like, and reject the rest.</p>
               <p>And for the same reason (as our Reflecter observes) the Popes suffer <hi>so many Positive assertors of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deposing power to pass without any censure of Heresy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> Which is no Argument, that they do not believe it an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> as he suggests; but only that they want power to do it. Princes will not be deposed now, nor suffer those to be Censured, who deny the Deposing Power; But should the blessed <hi>Hildebrand</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times return again, we should quickly see, whether the Deposing Power be an Article of Faith or not.</p>
               <p>What I have now discoursed will abundantly justify an argument which I find our Reflecter much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at. The Answerer in his Introduction (p. 14.) lays two passages together, which he thinks will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to own the deposing power: For in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist misrepresented</hi> (p.42.) the Author saies, <hi>the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the supream Pastor are to be obeyed, whether he be Infallible or not</hi>; and in another place he confesses, that <hi>Popes have owned the deposing Doctrine, and acted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50614:31"/>
according to it</hi>; and others are bound to obey their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whether Infallible or not, and consequently by the Doctrine of their Church, to act when the Popes shall require it, according to the deposing power. To this the Reflecter answers, That he only made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison between Civil and Ecclesiastical power,<note place="margin">Pag. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Taht as in the Civil Government the sentence of the supream Judge or highest Tribunal is to be obeyed, tho there be no assurance of In<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>allibility or Divine protection from error or mistake, so is he taught should be done to the orders of the supream Pastor, whether he be Infallible or not.</hi> Now he saies, it is as unjust from hence to infer, that all the Orders of the Pope must be obeyed, as it would be to say that Subjects must obey their Princes in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they command, whether it be good or bad: And I ackowledge his answer to be good, if he will grant the deposing Decree to command a sin, which he has never done yet; and when he does it, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to consider how to reconcile himself to his two Friends <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> who assert that Popes and General Councils can make no sinful Decrees which shall relate to the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Let us now consider what faults the Reflecter finds with the Answerers way of proceeding; and they are reduced to Four heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> He saies, that in some points the Answerer <hi>owns the Doctrine</hi> (which he has represented to be <hi>the Faith of a Roman-Catholick) to be the established belief of the Church of England; as in part, that of the power of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly absolution, confession, of due veneration to the Relicks of Saints, of merit, of satisfaction, of the authority of the Church, of General Councils.</hi> Now here our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter returns to his old trade of Misrepresenting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50614:31"/>
again; for every one who will believe his own eyes, may soon satisfie himself, that the Answerer in these Doctrines owns nothing which is peculiar to the Faith of a Papist, as distinguished from the Common Faith of all Christians. He might as well say, that because Protestants own that Christ is to be worshipped, therefore they <hi>in part</hi> own the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Christ is to be worshipped by Images.</p>
               <p>This is the very case here. The Answerer grants, <hi>that Christ gave to the Bishops and Priests of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Church, authority to absolve any truly penitent sinner from his sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> 
                  <hi>and that such absolution is ratified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Therefore <hi>in part</hi> he owns the Popish Doctrine of Absolution, which is a Judicial and Pretorian Authority to forgive sins; tho we think, that to absolve as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and as a Judge, are two very different things; as different as the Kings granting a Pardon, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors sealing it, which is a publick and authentick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the thing. The Answerer owns <hi>the ancient practice of Canonical confession,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>as part of the discipline of the Church for publick offences</hi>; that is, that those who had been guilty of any publick and scandalous sins, were not reconciled tothe Church without making as publick a confession, and giving publick Testimonies of their sorrow and repentance; therefore he in part owns the Auricular confession of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; there being little difference it seems, between confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our sins to the whole Congregation, and in the ear of a Priest. He owns the use <hi>of voluntary confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for the ease and satisfaction of the perplexed minds of</hi> doubting or <hi>dejected Penitents</hi>; and therefore he in part owns the Sacramental Confession, as necessary to the Remission of Sins before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:50614:32"/>The Answerer allows,<note place="margin">P. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>A due Veneration to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Saints and Martyrs,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Religious Decency to be observed towards them, which lies in avoiding any thing like contempt or dishonour to them; and using all such Testimonies of Respect and Decency, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the remains of excellent Persons.</hi> And therefore <hi>in part,</hi> he agrees with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in giving Divine Worship to Relicks, just as much as a decent respect is a part of Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>The Answerer grants,<note place="margin">P. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>The necessity of good Works in order to the reward of another Life.</hi> And if he will call this Merit (in which large Sense the Fathers sometimes use that word) we will not dispute with him about it; but is this to own the Popish Doctrine of Merit? <hi>That the good Works of justified Persons, are truly meritorious of the increase of Grace, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Answerer <hi>distinguishes between satisfaction to the Church before Absolution,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 67.</note> (according to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Primitive Church, which did not use to reconcile publick Penitents, till by a long course of Penance and Mortification, they had given sufficient Testimonies of the Sincerity of their Repentance, and had made some Satisfaction for that Scandal they had given to the Church) <hi>and Satisfaction to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, for some part of the Punishment to Sin, which is unremitted.</hi> The first we own, as a very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part of Church Discipline, and wish the restoring of it; but the second, we utterly disown; for there is no other Satisfaction to the Justice of God for Sin, but the meritorious Death and Sacrifice of Christ; whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes no notice of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the first sence, but has changed the Ancient Discipline of Satisfaction to the Church, into Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Justice of God for Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50614:32"/>The Answerer grants, <hi>That truly penitential Works are pleasing to God, so as to avert his Displeasure, but denies</hi> the Popish Doctrine of Satisfaction, <hi>that there can be any Compensation by way of Equivalency, between what we Suffer, and what we Deserve</hi>: and is this <hi>in part,</hi> to own his Doctrine of Satisfaction?</p>
               <p>The Answerer owns <hi>the right and necessity of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, (upon great Occasions) if they be truly so; which have been,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>and may be of great use to the Christian World, for setling the Faith, healing the Breaches of</hi> Christendom, <hi>and reforming Abuses; and that the Decrees of such Councils ought to be submitted to, where they proceed upon certain Grounds of Faith, and not upon unwritten Traditions.</hi> But this is no part of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning Councils, which owns the Authority of all Councils called by the Pope, and confirmed by him, tho (as we say) neither Free nor General; and ascribes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Infallibility to them, and so puts an end to all inquiries into the Grounds of their Faith. We are sorry we are at such a distance from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there are few things besides the common Principles of Christianity, wherein we can own any part of their Doctrine; and if we own no more than the Answerer has done, I think the Reflecter has no great Reason to Glory in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> The Reflecter charges the Answerer, with <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing from the Definitions of their Councils, and sense of their Church, to some Expressions found in old Mass-Books, Rituals,</hi> &amp;c. what this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> means,<note place="margin">P. 11.</note> I cannot tell; for I find but one instance of this in the whole Answer, relating to the Worship of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> That famous Hymn,

Now I confess, I should not have thought it so great a fault, to have taken the sence of their Church from their Missals, be they never so old: for their Missals are not like private books of devotion, but are the allowed and approved worship of their Church, as our Liturgy is; and therefore is either the sence of their Church at present, or once was so; and if it be damnable to own that the Virgin is more powerful than her Son (or can command him, which seems to be an argument of greater power) it is very hard to charge it upon an Infallible Church, that her publick Offices did once contain damnable Errors; for surely, She was not Infallible then; which may bring her Infallibility into question still. And therefore old Missals have so much Authority still, that nothing contained in them ought to be thought damnable.</p>
               <p>And yet the Answerer does not appeal from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of Councils, to old Mass-books; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has never condemned this Hymn, nor the Doctrine of it. The Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in her Decree for Invocation of Saints, faith nothing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the Worship of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and yet all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks make a vast difference between the Worship of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and other Saints; how then shall we learn the Sense of the Church, but from her Practice, from her publick Offices and Hymns? And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50614:33"/>
tho, since Hereticks have been Inquisitive into these matters, they have reformed some of their Hymns, yet they have never condemned the old ones. And if he remembers, the Answerer in the same place told him a notable Story, whereby he might guess at the Sense, at least, of the governing part of their Church still; <hi>That a Book, which was writ by a Gentleman ten Years since, to bring the People to a bare</hi> Ora pro nobis, <hi>to the blessed Virgin,</hi>

               <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> He complains, that the Answerer <hi>appeals from the Declaration of their Councils, and Sense of their Church, to some External Action, as in case of respect shewn to Images and Saints, upon which,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>from our Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Adoration, by construction of the Fact,</hi> viz. <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bowing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>you are willing to conclude us guilty of Idolatry: As if a true Judgment could be made of these Actions, without respect to the Intention of the Church, who directs them, and of the Person that does them.</hi> The Paragraph in the Answer (<hi>p.</hi> 21.) to which the Reflecter refers us, is but a short one, and if he had thought fit to answer it, it would have cleared this point. He saies, <hi>To Worship Stocks or Stones for Gods,</hi> (as far as we charge them with any such thing) signifies, <hi>to give to Images made of Wood and Stone, the Worship due only to God, and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Fact, to make them Gods, by giving them Divine Worship. And if they will clear themselves of this, they must either prove that External Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no part of Divine Worship (notwithstanding the Scripture makes it so, and all the rest of mankind look upon it as such, even</hi> Jews, Turks <hi>and</hi> Infidels) <hi>or that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50614:34"/>
their External Adoration hath no respect to the Images (which is contrary to the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>) or that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship being due to the Being represented, it may be likewise given to the Image; and how then could the</hi> Gnosticks <hi>be Condemned for giving Divine Worship to the Image of Christ, which</hi> Bellarmin <hi>confesses, and is affirmed by</hi> Irenaeus, Epiphanius, <hi>St.</hi> Austin, <hi>and</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen?</p>
               <p>Wherein now does the Answerer <hi>appeal from the Declarations of their Councils, and sense of their Church, to External Actions</hi>? Does the Council forbid such External Acts of Adoration, as Kneeling, Bowing, Offering Incense, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> to be paid to Images? No it injoyns it. Does the Council then deny, that the Worship which is paid before the Image, has regard to the Image? No, both the <hi>Trent</hi> Council and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism teach the Worship of Images. The whole Mystery of this pretended Appeal from their Church and Councils to External Actions, is no more than this, that they do not believe the giving such Worship to Images, to be giving the Worship due to God to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and the Answerer considering the Nature of those External Acts of Adoration, knows not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them from it, but has put him into a way of doing it, if he can; if he can either prove, that External Adoration is no part of Divine Worship, or that they do not give this External Worship to Images, or that Divine Worship being due to the <hi>Being</hi> Represented, it may likewise be given to the Image; then he will grant that they are not guilty of Worshiping Stocks and Stones for Gods; but till he can do this, he must give us leave to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret such Actions, as all Mankind besides themselves Interpret them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50614:34"/>But our Reflecter did not like this, he is for Judging of Actions <hi>by the intention of the Church that directs them, and of the Person that does them.</hi> Well, and what is their intention in it? Is it not to Worship Images? Yes, this is the Intention, and the express Declaration of their Church. Right! but their Church does not intend to break the Second Commandment, and to commit Idolatry in the Worship of Images, and therefore you ought not to charge this upon them. Very true! nor did ever any man in the World intend to commit Idolatry. We charge them not with any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but if they Worship Images, we desire to know how they excuse themselves from breaking the Second Commandment, and committing Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Whether they are Idolaters or not, let God Judg; but we think we should be guilty of Idolatry if we did it, and that is the reason, why we cannot comply with such practices.</p>
               <p>I would only desire to know, whether there be any such thing as External and Visible Idolatry? If there be, it must consist in External and Visible Actions, for we can never know what mens inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, but by their Actions; and then if men do such Actions as are Idolatrous, how can the intention excuse them from Idolatry? Especially no intention can alter the nature of actions, which are determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Divine or Human Law; for then men might Murder, or commit Adultery, or Steal, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear themselves, and yet avoid the sin and guilt of such actions, by intending to do no evil in them; if then the External Acts of Kneeling or Bowing to or before an Image, directing such Actions to the Image, be called Worshiping of them, and are forbid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50614:35"/>
in the Second Commandment, without any regard to what intentions men have in doing so, we put no other Interpretation upon such Actions, but what the Divine Law puts upon them; and if they will venture to Expound them otherwise, and think to Justify themselves in doing forbidden Actions, by their good Intentions; they think they may; but we dare not.</p>
               <p>As for what he says, that these Actions, such as Bowing, Kneeling,<note place="margin">P. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. are in themselves indifferent, and capable of being paid to God and men</hi>; I readily grant it; but is there then no way to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Civil and Religious Worship, between the Worship of God and men? I will tell him one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Distinction, allowed by all the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>viz.</hi> the Worship of the Invisible Inhabitants of the other World, tho with such External Acts as may be paid to Creatures, has always been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religious Worship. Civil Respects are confined to this World, as all Natural and Civil Relations, which are the Foundation of Civil Respects, are; but we have no Intercourse with the other World, but what is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. And therefore as the different kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Civil Honour are distinguished by the fight of the object, to which they are paid, tho the External Acts and Expressions are the same; as when men bow the Body, and are uncovered, you know what kind of Honour it is by seeing who is present, whether their Father, their Friend, or their Prince, or some other Honourable Persons; so the most certain mark of distinction between Civil and Religious VVorship is this, That the one relates to this VVorld, the other to the Invisible Inhabitants of the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50614:35"/>But God allows us to Worship no Invisible Being but himself, which would unavoidably confound the Worship of God and Creatures. If the Reflecter can give me any one Instance of any Nation in the World, which did not account the Worship of all Invisible Beings to be Religious, I will own my self mistaken. And if all Worship of Invisible Beings is Divine and Religious Worship, this puts an end to this Dispute, and <hi>Abigail</hi> might fall down on her Face before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the Beggars in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> may beg upon their Knees (as the Reflecter argues) without any <hi>constructive Idolatry</hi>; but so cannot a Papist, who prays to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; now they are in an invisible State, with all the External Signs of Worship and Adoration, excepting Sacrifice, which we can give to God himself. And as for his Instance of <hi>Joshua</hi>'s falling down before the Angel, when he can prove that this was only a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Angel, and that <hi>Joshua</hi> took him for no more, we will consider it farther.</p>
               <p>Now, if to Worship any Invisible Being, be to give Divine Honours to it; then to be sure, to Worship the Image of such an Invisible Being, must be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship also. For if the Worship of the Image be referred to that Invisible Being, whom the Image represents, it cannot be Civil, but Religious Honour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The last Complaint is, That the Answerer <hi>appeals from their Councils, and sense of their Church, to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of some private Authors.</hi> And this I confess were a just Exception against the Answer, if it were true; but I challenge him to give any one Instance of it, wherein the Answerer has set up the judgment of private Authors against the declared Sense and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50614:36"/>
of their Councils and Church. He has indeed quoted several of their Authors, and to very good purpose; as to give an account of matter of Fact, and what the practice of their Church is, and what Opinion Wise Men among them had of such practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to which purpose he cites some <hi>French</hi> Authors, <hi>Wicelius,</hi> and <hi>Vives,</hi> (p. 27, 28.) which our Reflecter is so much grieved at; or to give an Historical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the state of the Controversie, what it was before, and what since the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; as about the worship of Images, <hi>p.</hi> 17. about the necessity of Confession, <hi>p.</hi> 61. or about the Sense and Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some controverted Texts of Scripture; or to state the notions of things expressed, but not defined by the Council; as what Merit is; (<hi>p.</hi> 57.) for tho the Church has defined the good works of justified Persons to be truly meritorious, yet it has not told us what true and proper Merit is, and therefore we must learn this from the allowed and received definitions of their Divines. Thus the Council has determined due Honour and Worship to be given to Images, but has not determined what this due Honour and Worship is; and therefore we have no way to know it, but by appealing to the general Practice of the Church, and the Doctrine of their Divines; which is not to oppose the sentiments of private Authors to the judgment of the Church, but where the Church has not explained her self, to learn her sense as well as we can, from their most approved Divines. Thus the Council has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the use of Indulgences, but has not defin'd in what cases and to what purposes they may be used; and therefore when the Representer says confidently, that it is only a relaxation of Canonical Penances, the Authority, and especially the argument of <hi>Greg. de
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50614:36"/>
Valent.</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> are good against him, tho not against their Church, had their Council defined it. (<hi>p.</hi> 66.) When he asserts that Indulgences are not sold, the Tax of the Apostolick Chamber is good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority against him; especially, if those who sell In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences receive the Money only under the notion of Alms, which is allowed by the Council; and when he denies, that Indulgences do concern the remission ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mortal or venial sins, the Answerer might well appeal to the very form of the Popes Bulls, which not only grant the remission of sins, but in some cases the plenary, and most plenary remission of sins.</p>
               <p>Thus in what cases the Pope can dispense, and in what not, is not determined by the Council, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no other way of knowing how large this power is, but by appealing to the practice of Popes in granting Dispensations, and the Opinions of their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> about it: And I cannot imagine what should make the Reflecter so angry with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer for stating this matter, as he seems to be ( <hi>p.</hi> 17.) but that he rebukes his confidence by discovering his unskilfulness in such disputes: Nor do I discern the Answerers fault in saying, <hi>We know this dispensing power is to be kept as a great Mystery, and not to be made use of but upon weighty and urgent causes of great consequence and benefit to the Church, as their Doctrines</hi> (tho the <hi>Errata,</hi> which a Reflecter ought to have consulted, would have told him it should be <hi>Doctors</hi>) <hi>declare</hi>; for if their Doctors, who may be presumed best to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the intrigue, do say this, what fault did the Answerer commit in saying it after them; and thus it is in several other cases; the Answerer has alledged the Opinions of their Divines and Casuists, Not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to the Authority of the Church, but to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50614:37"/>
learn from them what is the most received and currant Doctrine in such matters as are not expresly defined by their Councils; and is this like picking up some particular sayings out of private Authors, to charge them upon any Church? I do not think my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to examine his citations out of some of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, there being so great a disparity between these two cases; but if he have dealt by others as he has done by the Answerer, he is a very Misrepresenter still. He says, <hi>The Answerer seems to maintain, that good works of justified persons are not free.</hi> And the Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer indeed does say, that they are not free, as freedom is opposed to a Divine assistance in doing them, and to an antecedent obligation to do them, which freedom is necessary to merit; but does this destroy the liberty of the Will as assisted by the Divine Grace? Or will the Reflecter own such a freedom as the Answerer denies?</p>
               <p>These are all the material Exceptions the Reflecter has made against the Answer,<note place="margin">Page 17.</note> which come to little more than some popular talk; for I do not think the Vision of St. <hi>Perpetua</hi> worth disputing about; and if he did not think this Vision gave some Credit to the Doctrine of Purgatory, I would know why he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it. The Answerer does not charge them with making such Visions and Apparitions, the only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Purgatory; but certainly those who have taken so much pains to tell, if not to invent, such Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to father them upon ancient Writers, did think that they would do some service to propagate the belief of it in the World: and if this be true, I know no reason they have to be ashamed of them, and notwithstanding all their other arguments, I confess I think they want them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50614:37"/>And now I know nothing in his Reflections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered but some Popular Harangues and Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but plain truth, like a true Beauty, needs no Paint and Varnish; and therefore I shall only for a Conclusion assure our People, That the Answer is every way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its Title, <hi>the Doctrines and Practises of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>truly Represented</hi>; and when this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter, or any one for him, shall think fit to examine any part of it as it becomes men, and Scholars, they shall either have a fair Reply, or a Recantation.</p>
