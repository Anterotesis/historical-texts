            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHAT here is recommended to him, is a Parallel of the two Princes of <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poesie, <hi>Inimitable Pindar,</hi> and <hi>Incomparable Horace.</hi> It was first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, in his own Language, a Person well Vers'd in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Studies, nor less in Historical and Poetical Learning; and by him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in a Speech to the <hi>Premier Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Monsigneur de LAMOIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON</hi> (that Illustrious Patron of good Arts and Sciences) in a full Assembly of the <hi>Beaux Esprits</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> nor without a general Applause. And the Interpreter has


<pb facs="tcp:54113:3"/>
reason to believe, It may be no less accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this <hi>English</hi> Dress to those of the Nation, who have any share of Native In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.</p>
            <p>He thinks it requisite further to add, that the Piece in its <hi>English</hi> Version is rend'red much more useful to the Reader, than it was in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal; For, whereas there are very frequent Citations through the whole Treatise, from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>; these in the <hi>French</hi> are set down without any <hi>Mark of Reference,</hi> to shew from whence they were taken. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is, in this <hi>English</hi> Edition, supply'd by the Apposition of Numerical Figures, directing the Reader where to meet with them in their respective <hi>Originals.</hi> And may with the help of the additional Notes, be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the Reader in General, more particularly to the Curious and Ingenious, who shall take the Pleasure, or the Pains to <hi>confer.</hi>

            <p>I Am very sensible that I have neither Wit suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, nor Ability capable, to speak home and decisively as to the Merits of two of the greatest Lyrick Poets Antiquity ever produc'd, <hi>Pindar</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> Since to do it as I ought, 'twou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoove me to be as knowing in Poesie as themselves, to judge worthily of their Writings. Nevertheless, I owe so blind an obedience to the Commands your Lordship hath been pleas'd to lay upon me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their Comparison, that I believe I ought not to demurr one moment, but tell you what the assiduous Lecture of their Writings, and some others of the Ancients, may have furnish'd me with, to present you upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pindar</hi> liv'd more than 450 Years before <hi>Horace</hi>; and was Son of a Flute-Player. <hi>Aelian</hi> reports, that a Swarm of Bees were his Nurses, as he lay expos'd out of his Father's House, who suckled him with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney instead of Milk.</p>
            <p>It is true that I have not met with that Exposure, save only in <hi>Aelian</hi>; and all else, that speak of that Accident of the Bees, recount it after another manner. <hi>Philostratus</hi> says, that <hi>Pindar</hi> was in his Cradle when that Prodigy happ'ned to him. And <hi>Pausanias,</hi> that being young, and going from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Thespia</hi> in the


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54113:5"/>
great Heats, he was about Mid-day surpriz'd with Sleep; and stepping out of the way to repose himself, the Bees came and wrought their Honey on his Lips; which was the first Signal of the Genius, and natural Inclination, of <hi>

            <p>There is in the Greek Anthology an Epigram of <hi>Antipater,</hi> which says in a manner the same thing.</p>

For the <hi>Brutians,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, were no other than a company of Slaves and desperate Wretches; who having assassinated their Masters, and pillag'd and ravag'd the Neighbouring-Countries, seated themselves at last on these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; of which, by the Situation of the Place, and Force of Arms, they ever since kept the possession.</p>
            <p>To what I have said of the Countries of these two great <hi>Genii,</hi> I shall add, That both of them, in the course of their Lives, were engag'd in troublesome Wars, and, with this Misfortune, to have been on the worse side. <hi>Pindar</hi> was terrify'd (as others) at the Descent <hi>Xerxes</hi> made into <hi>Greece,</hi> and shar'd part of the Infamy with his Country-men, who made an early Accomodation with that King against the common Consent of all the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Insomuch, that after the general Defeat of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> were reckoned as Deserters, and looked upon as People who had abandoned the Common Safety of their Country.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the Family of <hi>Horace</hi> being under the Protection of the <hi>Iunii,</hi> our Poet became engag'd, after the Death of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> on <hi>Brutus</hi> his side; who gave him the Command of a Legion.

            <p>And there is sufficient grounds to make this appear, by the very Titles of those Pieces of his that are lost; as his Hymns, his Dithyrambs, his Paeans, and several other Works; which, for the most part, were no other than the Praises of the God's and Heroes. He dwelt at <hi>Thebes,</hi> near the Temple of the Mother of the Gods, whom he had in particular Veneration; and, as his Scholiast affirms, <hi>He much honoured that Goddess, being of an extraordinary Piety.</hi> He built at <hi>Thebes</hi> a Chappel in Honour of <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi>; for whom he caus'd a Statue to be made by <hi>Calamis,</hi> one of the most famous Statuaries of those Times, as may

be seen in <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Pausanias.</hi> The latter of which reports, that he saw at <hi>Delphos</hi> an Iron-Chair, in which <hi>Pindar</hi> us'd to sit when he came to the Temple, and which was preserv'd 'till his Time as a most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Relick. But that which made the Piety of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> yet more resplendent, and (as <hi>Pausanias</hi> says) rais'd it to the highest pitch of Glory, was, That the Priestess of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> at the instant that <hi>Pindar</hi> entred into the Temple, invited him in the Name of that God, to come and dine with him; and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that of whatsoever was sacrific'd, there should be an equal share assign'd to him, as to <hi>Apollo.</hi> And this occasion'd that Belief, which then run through all <hi>Greece</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports) that the God <hi>Pan</hi> was seen on the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Hills, to divertize himself in Dancing, and singing one of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Songs, which they call'd a <hi>Paean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pausanias</hi> likewise tells a Story, that <hi>Pindar</hi> in the decline of his Age had a Vision of <hi>Proserpine,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd him, that she was the only Deity he had not honoured with a Hymn; but that she expected he should make her one when he came to be with her. Soon after which, dying, he appear'd in a Dream to an old Kinswoman of his, and sung to her in Honour of that Goddess a Hymn; which his said Kinswoman, awaking, wrote down in the same Terms she heard it sung.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Horace,</hi> tho' in his Poem, entituled <hi>Carmen Saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare,</hi> and other his Odes, there are many Passages in Praise of the Gods, and that in the Sixth Satyr of his First Book, he says, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>It may likewise be said in general of these two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, that they were both very honest Men, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Manners and Customs of the Times they liv'd in; tho as to particulars, there were some Vertues, and some Defects more or less remarkable in the one, than in the other. They were both naturally Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, both passionate Affectors of Glory. They


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54113:10"/>
made no difficulty of praising themselves, for those little Vanities give oftentimes a good Grace in Poesie, and ought to be permitted to such great Wits as they were. They were both admir'd in their Ages, by all those who were good Judges of what was commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tho they were ill treated many times by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>We have no sufficient knowledge of the particular Actions of <hi>Pindar</hi> to make a certain Judgment of his good Qualities, nor can we make any reasonable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thereupon, but from the high reputation he acquir'd in his Life time, and the admirable Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath left us so happily exprest in his Odes, where Vertue is always exalted, and Vice painted in all its Deformity.</p>
            <p>His Discourses are so full of moral Sentences, and honest Thoughts, that 'tis impossible such graceful Sentiments should proceed from a Soul ill-form'd, or meanly perswaded of the Principles of Honour. There are Thoughts of so high a Flight, that many have believ'd he drew them from their Divine Source, the Holy Scripture. At least 'tis the Opinion of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus,</hi> who in the third Book of his Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue will have it, that <hi>Pindar</hi> was assisted by reading of the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi>; and maintains, that in that part of his Works where he says,

            <p>The Honesty and Humanity of <hi>Pindar</hi> appears throughout all his Works, and 'tis that which gave occasion to that handsome Discourse of <hi>Agias</hi> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> his Symposiacks, <hi>Where having censur'd the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets or Dinners of</hi> Homer <hi>as hungry and thirsty Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Masters of whose Feasts, (or as he calls them Kings) treat their Guests worse than our common</hi> Italian <hi>Hasts, upbraiding them (even in the time of Fight, when they are encountring their Enemies) with their Debauch'd Behaviour, and reckoning up how many Glasses each of them

drunk off at Dinner. How much better</hi> (says he) <hi>are the Pindarick Feasts, where the Heroes meet together and share their equal Entertainments soberly.

            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Horace</hi> we can say in the first place; he was a very great Lover of his Pleasures; and that very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was of an agreeable Conversation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not displeasing to the Ladies of his Time, which he himself seems to hint at in these Verses.

He cherish'd his Liberty to such a degree, that he could never suffer himself to be constrain'd or made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not even by <hi>Augustus,</hi> who would have had him for his Secretary. As for <hi>Mecaenas</hi> to whom he ow'd so many Obligations, he had for him all the tenderness and grateful respect that was possible. Nevertheless see how he writes to him.

After this, bringing in the Fable of the Fox which could not get out of the Granary where he had fed himself fat, and the Weesels advice to make himself as lean as he was when he crept in at the little hole. He adds,

As to the Beauty of his Morals, it appears in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Passages of his Writings; and we should be forc'd in a manner to copy them all entire; should we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to shew all we find in him to represent the Idea of
an honest Man. He testifies he is himself fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the Honesty of his Manners, when he says,
<q>
                  <l>Non patre praeclaro, sed vita &amp; pectore puro.</l>
                  <bibl>Lib. 1. Satyr. 6.</bibl>

               </q>
               <q>But of firm Faith, and of no niggard Wit.</q>
His frequent Sentences, the Praises of Vertue and the
Vertuous, and the perpetual Blame of things Vicious,
and an infinity of noble and elevated Sentences scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
through his Odes, sufficiently testifie the truth of
what I say; but his Ingenuity, and the free Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
he makes of his Defects in his Satyrs, in a
manner ravish me, as well as the justness of his sence
every where throughout. Never Man exprest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

And speaking of some Peccadillo's, with which he
might be reproach'd, and of the Care he took to root
them out of his Mind. He says,
<q>

               <q>
                  <l>I cannot say, I wholly blameless live,</l>
                  <l>Small faults I have, which you may well forgive:</l>
                  <l>Of which, Time, Books, Friends Counsels, and my own,</l>
                  <l>Have rid the greatest part: For when alone,</l>
                  <l>Or walking, or in Bed I musing lie,</l>

How many excellent things has he of Frugality in the
second Satyr of his second Book? Against Avarice in
the first Satyr of his first Book? Against the Sottish
Vanity of the Nobility in the sixth? Against Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in the second? Against other Crimes in the third
Satyr of his second Book, and every where else?</p>
            <p>In fine, all that he says strikes the Mind, and makes an Impression not possible to be resisted; since his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant manner of treating in jest things the most serious and grave, penetrates much more easily, and more efficaciously than the severity of Precepts, which of it self is but odious, and as he says,

I shall not instance any thing further upon this Subject, since there needs not so many Proofs to support a Truth confirm'd by the judgment of all honest Men; who had always a Love and Admiration for <hi>Horace.</hi> Nor was there any of the great Wits of his Time who were not desirous to have a share in his Friendship. <hi>Virgil</hi> first introduc'd him into the Acquaintance of <hi>Maecenas</hi> who would never after live without him. <hi>Augustus</hi> call'd him <hi>Lepidissimum Homuncionem, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant little Man,</hi> and would have made him his Cabinet Secretary.</p>
            <p>It appears not that <hi>Pindar</hi> ever spoke ill of any Man, and tho he had many Enemies who gave him some trouble while he lived, we find not that he ever sought to be reveng'd of them. He comforts himself against their Malignity by only saying,

            <p>As for <hi>Horace,</hi> no Man ever had a Wit more apt for Raillery: and he seldom lets pass an occasion when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to exercise his Talent that way. I speak not of his Satyrs, which he made expresly to be nipping and biting. Nay even in his Odes he cannot resist the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination he has to Satirize, as may be seen in these,

'Tis not but that he knew how to praise when he pleas'd and he does it with an inimitable Grace in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of his Odes. True it is that Persons of Quality in his Time, were extreamly delicate as to praise, and it behov'd the Incense that was offer'd to be exquisite if receiv'd,

In the fifth Satyre of his second Book, he make <hi>Tyresias</hi> speak thus,

But contrarywise there is nothing seen in all the Works of <hi>Horace</hi> but Generosity. He mocks at the Covetous in a thousand places. He commends every where Frugality and Moderation: He appears always content with his present Fortune, and always ready to resign what he has from her.

'Tis very easie to perceive he was rather Prodigal than Covetous, as may be judg'd by the Checks he gives himself for his lavish Humour.

Where we may observe by the way, that <hi>Horace</hi> was but little of Stature; or as he himself says, <hi>Corporis exigui,</hi> which answers to the Word <hi>Homuncio,</hi> by which <hi>Augustus</hi> us'd to call him.</p>

            <p>He seems to me, among other things to have had a great Advantage over <hi>Pindar,</hi> in that he chose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Subjects he had a mind to treat of, and by that could give a free Field to his Genius to range in, as to the Matters he made choice of. Whereas <hi>Pindar</hi> was under a Constraint, having been always oblig'd to praise Persons who for the most part were but of mean Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Which gave occasion for those <hi>Parechases</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> of which I shall speak hereafter.</p>
            <p>And in Truth, it was requisite the Works of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> should have something extraordinary, or rather Divine, to have pleas'd as they have done, by only singing of Praises; which ordinarily to us, appear as flat, as Satyres are agreeable, by reason of that little principle of Envy which is in us, which makes us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Men take from us what is given to another by praising him, and give to us what is taken from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by dispraising him.

            <p>There was a time nevertheless, when <hi>Pindar</hi> was not of that high Esteem.

            <p>And yet there was little more than a hundred Years between <hi>Pindar</hi> and <hi>Eupolis</hi>; who according to <hi>Suidas</hi> perish'd in a Naval Fight in the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War.

And one of the principal Heads of the Accusation <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophilus</hi> made against <hi>Aristotle</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> was that of Impiety, with which he was charg'd for having made that excellent Ode we find in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> in honour of one <hi>Hermias</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Aternae,</hi> which <hi>Demophilus</hi> maintain'd to have been a <hi>Paean,</hi> tho' <hi>Aristotle</hi> made the contrary appear by several Reasons, of which the principal was, that there wanted in it the Acclamation of <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54113:31"/>That Author says moreover, as does likewise <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, That there were three different Manners of Singing at the Table; the first when all the Company sang together one and the same Song; the second when they sang round one after another; and the third, when they only who were skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Songsters sung each of them a Song, and that Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (says he) <hi>which was made passing from one skilful Songster to another, leaving the rest of the Guests vacant, and going a Traverse, or Skipping, gave the Name</hi> Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <hi>to that manner of Singing.</hi>

            <p>I shall say nothing of that Great <hi>Scolion</hi> of <hi>Pindar,</hi> which he made in Praise of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Courtezans; nor of that <hi>Eustathius</hi> speaks of in his Comment upon the Odysses, <hi>That there were two kinds of</hi> Scolia<hi>'s, whereof one they call'd, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or rallying, made purposely to mock at the Vicious; and the other <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or Serious, in Commendation of Vertue and Vertuous Persons.</hi> Among the last he puts those which they call'd, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Lugubria, which were sung at the Solemnity of the Dead by those of the Family, about the Funeral Pile.</hi> I have read in an Interpreter of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> that these <hi>Scolia</hi>'s were like those Verses which from the <hi>Italians</hi> we at present call <hi>Stanzas, Sonnets,</hi> and <hi>Madrigals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I may seem to have been too long upon this Matter, and that 'tis time to return to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>See therefore the Judgment <hi>Quintilian</hi> has given of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Poesie in the first Chapter of his Tenth Book, where he says, <hi>Novem vero Lyricorum longè Pindarus princeps, Spiritus magnificentia, sententiis, figuris, brevis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima rerum verborumque copiâ, &amp; veluti quodam Eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae flumine, propter quae Horatius eum credidit nemini imitabilem,</hi> i. e. Pindar <hi>is far beyond any, Prince of the Nine</hi> Lyrick Poets, <hi>for the Height and Majesty of his Thoughts, the Gravity of his Sentences, the Beauty of his Figures, the Copious Brevity of his Words and Matter, and


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54113:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as it were a Flood or Torrent of Eloquence</hi>; for which <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> thought him inimitable.</p>
            <p>It seems <hi>Quinctilian</hi> took all this Discourse from <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius Halicarnassaeus</hi> his Book <hi>de construction. verbonim</hi> where he thus speaks, Pindar <hi>is Admirable for the choice of his Words and Thoughts, he has Grandeur, Harmony, Affluence, Order, and vigour of Expressions, and all that, accompany'd with a certain grave yet close Delivery, mix'd with an agreeable sweetness; is marvellous for his Sentences, his Energy, his Figures, his address in describing manners, his Amplifications, and Elocution, and above all for the Honesty of his own Manners, which appears in all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, where his Temperance, his Piety and the Greatness of his Mind shine throughout.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it appears to me, that Author was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the Character of <hi>Pindar,</hi> for he has omitted nothing that could be considered in his Works, where <hi>the Sublime</hi> (of which <hi>Longinus</hi> has written) is in its greatest Lustre, and of which <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> says,

            <p>I shall only tell what <hi>Quinctilian</hi> reports of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> in the 8th Chapter of his 10th Book, where he says, <hi>Exquisitam figuram hujus rei deprendere apud princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem Lyricorum videar, in libro quem inscripsit <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And what <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus</hi> hath upon the Subject of the severity of his Diction in his Book of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his Eloquence, where having explicated at large what he calls austere Harmony, he concludes, that the Diction of <hi>Aeschylus</hi> among the Tragick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and that of <hi>Pindar</hi> wholly and entirely among the <hi>Lyricks,</hi> may afford sufficient Examples.</p>

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:54113:36"/>The same Author in his Book of the <hi>Construction of Words,</hi> says, 'twill suffice to mention only <hi>Pindar</hi> among the Poets, and <hi>Thucydides</hi> among the Historians, for they are two, who have most happily made use of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and austere Construction in Discourse; begin we (says he) with this Dithyramb of <hi>Pindar,</hi> &amp;c.

And some others of the like Nature which are, as I have said, very far from the Notion of Sublime, in our manner of speaking. And we can give no other reason for't, but that of the Mode and Gusto of the Times. But to condemn all upon that Principle, were to be too quick, and to do like those who having never been out of their own Homes, cannot without Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter look upon strange fashion'd Cloaths.</p>
            <p>What besides they find ill in <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Works, are the enormous Digressions or Excursions he makes, which have for the most part so little of Rapport to the principal Subject of the Ode, that they appear like large pieces of Cloth of Gold sow'd to some Stuff, of less value.</p>
            <p>Upon which, 'Tis to be remembred what hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have said, That <hi>Pindar</hi> had occasion to praise Persons who were ordinarily but of mean Merit, and therefore had not much to say of them. So that he was oblig'd to search for Matter abroad, upon which


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54113:38"/>
he might elevate his Thoughts; forasmuch as those wretched Combatants he prais'd, would have long Odes for their Money; and 'twas in this, that the Artifice of <hi>Pindar</hi> principally appear'd,

               </gap>, <hi>The Effect of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Genius:</hi> And upon this Subject I cannot forbear to say what sometime hath come into my Mind, that in all likelihood <hi>Pindar</hi> at his Leisure compos'd upon several sort of Cadences his different Works in Praise of the Gods and Heroes: And that when a Victorious Combatant came to ask him for an Ode, he went to search among his Compositions for a Piece that was most proper, and would be most suitable for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he was to praise, either in respect of his Country, or the place of his Victory, his Beauty, Age, or some other thing that might serve him as a Connexion to put together what he had formerly prepar'd, with that he had thought to say upon the accompt of him he was to speak of.</p>

            <p>If we had those Poems of <hi>Pindar,</hi> which they call <hi>Threni,</hi> we should see whether it be true what <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Halicarnassaeus</hi> says, <hi>That</hi> Simonides <hi>was more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than</hi> Pindar, <hi>in describing sad and Lugubrious Subjects, in as much as he mourned not in such Magnifick and Swelling Expressions as he, but in much more pathetical.</hi> But as those Works are lost, we must acquiesce, and leave it to the judgment and sufficiency of that Author.</p>
            <p>I find there are some Learned Persons who discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the beginning of the first Ode, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The best of Things is Water</hi>; and like not, that being to make a highly-elevated Comparison, he should use that of Water, which is too vile and low to produce any Idea of Grandeur in our Thoughts. That of Gold


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54113:39"/>
which follows after, has (say they) some excuse for the Passion this Poet had for Riches; but they find not any proportion between Water and the Sun to joyn them together, which has a seeming resemblance of Truth according to our Principles and manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning at this Day.</p>
            <p>This Objection nevertheless, will not appear very considerable, if we make but this Reflexion, That <hi>Pindar</hi> sent that Ode into <hi>Sicily</hi> to a Tyrant of <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> where they follow'd the Doctrine of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who about that time had immortaliz'd himself by his Works, by his Life and his voluntary fall into the flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gulf of <hi>Aetna</hi>: For one of the Principles of that Philosopher's Doctrine, was this, <hi>That Water was the Origin and Source of all the Works of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>Pindar</hi> could not make use of a Comparison more happy or more efficacious than that of Water, to comprehend what was great and elevated to the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who regarded that Element as the Principle, which had given them their Being.</p>
            <p>And these, my Lord, are the Defects which some have charg'd <hi>Pindar</hi> with, which are no other than little Moles in a Beautiful Body, as <hi>Horace</hi> says,

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54113:41"/>
to the end of another; yet the common Sence shows clearly, that many times they are both defective. That to the <hi>Piso</hi>'s <hi>de Arte Poetica,</hi> which <hi>Horace</hi> for the most part hath taken from <hi>Parianus Neoptolemus,</hi> is an accomplish'd Piece; it has been anatomiz'd by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius,</hi> who has reduc'd to a certain Order the Precepts here and there scattered in that Treatise.</p>
            <p>You see, my Lord! By this Discourse, we have a larger Subject given us to treat of these Pieces of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> than those of <hi>Pindar,</hi> for the reason we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deliver'd, that the greatest part of the latter's Works are lost. And that by what we have left of him, he seems to have been constrain'd to spend his Wit upon the praises of particular Persons; whereas <hi>Horace</hi> had the Liberty to choose his Subjects the most proper to his own Genius and Humour.</p>
            <p>I know full well there hath been an infinite number of things advantageously said of him and his Works; and that the greatest Persons, both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, have rendred of him Illustrious Testimonies. But I should be too tedious, should I go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them all in this place; I shall therefore content my self to tell you only what <hi>Quinctilian,</hi> who in my Opinion is a sufficient Judge, hath deliver'd of him.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, as to its Satyres, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gives him the advantage over <hi>Lucilius, Multo est tertior Lucilio, ac purius magis Horatius, &amp; ad notandos mores praecipuus.</hi> Horace (says he) <hi>is much more Polite and Neat than</hi> Lucilius; <hi>and for describing of Manners most admirable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his <hi>Epods. Iambus</hi> (says he) <hi>non sane à Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis celebratus est ut proprium opus, à quibusdam interpositus, cujus Acerbitas in Catullo, Bibaculo, Horatio: Quamvis illi Epodos intervenire reperiatur,</hi> i. e. <hi>The</hi> Iambick <hi>never pass'd with the</hi> Romans <hi>for a particular sort of Poetry. Some have inserted it among other Verses. Of which, the force and Acerbity may be seen in</hi> Catullus, Bibaculus


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54113:41"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Horace: <hi>Tho it appears they were sometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd in Epods.</hi> Where we see he calls Epods what others term Clausulars; that is to say, those short Verses interpos'd after the longer, which they call Iambicks.</p>
            <p>But as for his Odes, or Lyricks, he prefers him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that ever wrote in that kind. <hi>At Lyricorum idem Horatius ferè solus legi dignus, nam &amp; insurgit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando &amp; plenus est jucunditatis, &amp; gratiae, &amp; variis figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; verbis faeliciter audax,</hi> i. e. <hi>Of all the</hi> Lyricks, <hi>there is none but</hi> Horace <hi>only who merits to be read, for he sometimes rises full of pleasing Graces, and is most happily bold in the variety of his Expressions and Figures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be very difficult to add any thing to that Judgment; which not only places <hi>Horace</hi> above all the <hi>Lyricks,</hi> but enters into the Particularities of his Perfections. It seems to me as if he would say, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> has spoken upon all the Matters that can enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poesie, and that he has Divinely treated of them: That he raised himself in the greatest Subjects almost as high as <hi>Pindar,</hi> but maintain'd them more uniformly, without falling, as may be seen in these Excellent Odes.

            <p>And 'tis that part of his Works where one may admire the Fecundity and Sublimity of his Invention, the Riches and the Hardiness of his Expressions, the Purity of his Diction, which is infinitely more modest and correct than that of <hi>Pindar.

His Sentences are so frequent, and so strong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and exprest in terms so majestick, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should not touch to the quick; and one may see by all that we have already said, that he had enrich'd his Mind by all the fairest Lights he could get by the Lecture of good Books, or the Conversation of Honourable Company which was the thing <hi>Pindar</hi> wanted.</p>
            <p>His Satyres and his Epistles are not of a Stile so elevated as his Odes, but on the contrary, he seems to have affected the abating and diminishing of its force expresly.

What he says else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, Juvenalis <hi>ardet,</hi> Persius <hi>jugulat,</hi> Horatius <hi>irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det,</hi> i. e. <hi>Iuvenal</hi> is fiery, <hi>Persius</hi> plays the Cut-throat, <hi>Horace</hi> mocks and Laughs, is something of a better Sence; however an old Commentator upon <hi>Horace</hi> hath said, That the Satyre of <hi>Horace</hi> is a Mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal, Nam &amp; asperita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem habet qualem</hi> Lucilius, <hi>&amp; suavitatem qualem</hi> Juvena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, as having the Asperity of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Iuvenal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but be troubled to find that the Authority of <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath drawn after him that of <hi>Lipsius.</hi> Who, after having declar'd that divers Persons were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Scaliger</hi> should prefer <hi>Iuvenal</hi> before <hi>Horace,</hi> says this, <hi>At ille, me judice, inter multa certi &amp; elegantis judicii, nihil verius protulit,</hi> i. e. <hi>Among the many things he hath delivered of a solid and exquisite Iudgment, there is nothing, in my Mind, he ever pronounc'd of greater Truth.</hi> And I am not satisfy'd with the honourable Amends he elsewhere makes <hi>Horace,</hi> by saying, That he is, <hi>Placidus, lenis, quietus, monet saepius quam casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54113:44"/>
sed ita praeclare hoc ipsum, ut in ea parte &amp; arte, nihil possit supra eum,</hi> i. e. <hi>Pleasant, Gentle and agreeable, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishes oftner than Corrects; and this he does with so much Art, and so Nobly, that nothing can be said to go beyond him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in my Opinion 'tis to judge after the <hi>Flemish</hi> or the <hi>Holland</hi> Fashion, of the Delicateness, and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Manners, to say as he in another place does, <hi>Hoc ipsum maxime Satyrae proprium videtur, tangit vitia, objurgat, inclamat, raro jocos, saepius acerbos sales miscet,</hi> i. e. <hi>It seems the most proper Character of a Satyre to strike at Vices, to chide and upbraid, to cry out, seldom to joke, and oftner to intermix sharp and bitter Railleries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis in these Satyres <hi>Horace</hi> displays the best of that Learning he had acquir'd by the Study of Philosophy: He is not pleas'd as <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> to put himself into Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion incessantly, but contrarily <hi>Discovers Truths by Laughing.</hi>

As much as to say, That <hi>Horace</hi> did not well enough understand the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, because he was not Born at <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Son of a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
            <p>But the Learned <hi>Heinsius</hi> is of another Judgment, who speaking of <hi>Horace</hi> says, <hi>Ejus vernae melius de Plauto judicabant, quam qui nunc familiam in literis tuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So knowing a Person could not be ignorant of the Judgment of the Age he had liv'd in,</q> wherein both the <hi>Latin</hi> Poesie and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage were at the height, and (which I take to be an

Argument above all) familiarly conversant with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who were daily discussing that point with him as their Friend.</p>
            <p>There is another who says, <hi>Horace</hi> spake not of <hi>Plautus</hi> but out of Envy; 'tis <hi>Ianus Parrhasius, ingenio Plautus fuit perurbano, &amp; maxime festivo,</hi> quod non absque suspicione livoris elevatus ab Horatio.</p>
            <p>What is it then that could compel <hi>Horace</hi> to speak so disadvantageously of <hi>Plautus? Plautus</hi> (say I) who has been so commended by the Ancients; and in whom we find so many handsome, and agreeable things. <hi>Proficiscine id potuit</hi> (says <hi>Petrus Victorius) à judicio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravato?

            </p>
            <p>I am unwilling to say so; for that were to do an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Reputation of an Age, which was every way the most Gallant, the most Polite, and the most Illuminated of all that preceded, or since succeed it.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I attribute the Cause to the different Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of these two Poets, as <hi>Famianus Strada</hi> hath done, <hi>Cum alter garrulus &amp; facetus, alter iracundus fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret &amp; taciturnus,</hi> as if one were Jovial and Facetious, the other Chagreen and Silent, since we have reason rather to call <hi>Horace</hi> the Father of all pleasant Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:54113:47"/>There is more reason therefore to attribute that Judgment of <hi>Horace</hi> to the Gusto of that Age, which was an Enemy to all unhandsome Buffoonery. For as the same <hi>Strada</hi> says, <hi>Decorum Horatiani saeculi, à liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori ac populari genere joculandi abhorrebat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And really there is no appearance that <hi>Horace</hi> had an intent directly to blame <hi>Plautus</hi> an Author so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, if all the Ingenious Men of those Days were of a different Opinion. He had a Wit too fine and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, to advance a Proposition so hardy, had he not known it would have been receiv'd with Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p>And 'tis no wonder if Wits accustomed to those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate <hi>Lyrick</hi> Cadences, of <hi>Sappho, Alcman, Alcaeus, Stesichorus,</hi> and other <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, whom <hi>Horace</hi> hath so happily imitated in his own Tongue, should not find in the ill-concerted measures of <hi>Plautus</hi> his Verses, that Gusto and that sweetness which their Ancestors were taken with; for that in their Times, they had not met with any more just. It is not strange, I say, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Emperour, (and he a Learned one) Men should take no more Pleasure in hearing the impertinent Turns, the laboured Points, and insipid Railleries, which charm'd the ordinary Vulgar in a Democratical State, which nevertheless in <hi>Plautus</hi> his Days had some shew of Novelty.</p>
            <p>It was not perhaps necessary I should have made so long a Digression in defence of <hi>Horace</hi> his Reputation, that was too well established in his own Times, when even the Ignorant could better judge of his Works, than the most learned Criticks of these Days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:54113:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>In fine <hi>Horace</hi> had this Advantage in his Life time, as to injoy the Fame of the present, and not fear the Judgment of future Times, and was not (as <hi>Famia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Strada</hi> said of <hi>Alexander Farnese)</hi> one of those Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Unfortunate, who needed to die to avow their Merit, which Envy had debas'd during their Lives.</p>
            <p>And this high Reputation which hath lasted till now through so many Ages past, will yet continue, not only as he says,

'Tis that which Enchants the Reader, and there is nothing but Nature can give it.</p>
            <p>But who, my Lord! can better know this than your self? Who have it as a constant Companion, even in your familiar Entertainments, and are notless happy in your Expressions, than just in your Thoughts.</p>
            <p>But this is not a place to undertake your Elogies; and 'tis too long that I have abus'd your Honourable Patience by thus entertaining you. Without further wearying you by a recital of your own Praises, 'tis enough for me to let you see by my Obedience to your Commands, what I have been able to do in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Parallel of <hi>Pindar</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and to shew with how much Zeal, dutiful Respect, and Submission, I am,</p>

               <p>TO make this out, it will be requisite to hear what other Authors say touching this Matter. <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, That he flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 65th.

So that <hi>Gyraldus</hi> and <hi>Vossius,</hi> with fair probability conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture what <hi>Suidas</hi> delivers of his flourishing in the 65th. Olympiad, ought rather to be taken for the Time of his Birth, which reconciles the two different Computations. And this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by <hi>Petavius</hi> in his <hi>Doctrina Temporum,</hi> Part the 2d. Page 562. where, against the 65th.

Olympiad, that is in the Year of <hi>Iphitus</hi> (the Restaurator of the Olympick Games after <hi>Hercules</hi>) 257. and in that of the World 3465. and this is all the certainty we can meet with as to his Birth.
