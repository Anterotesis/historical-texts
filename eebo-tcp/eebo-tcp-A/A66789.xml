            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The tired Petitioner, TO His noble Friends, who are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the honourable Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <l>SIRS, if this <hi>Paper</hi> find you (who, to me</l>
            <l>Are not ſo fully knowne, as you ſhould be)</l>
            <l>It comes to move, that, my <hi>Petitions</hi> may</l>
            <l>Obtaine your Anſwer without more delay;</l>
            <l>Leſt by <hi>Attendance</hi> (as my Neighbours do)</l>
            <l>With my <hi>Eſtate,</hi> I loſe my <hi>Patience</hi> too.</l>
            <l>For, I have waited, and endur'd ſo long,</l>
            <l>That, no <hi>Reſult</hi> can doe me greater wrong</l>
            <l>Then lingring hopes; And, were I quite undone,</l>
            <l>I, poſſibly, another courſe might run</l>
            <l>To be repair'd again, ere I obtaine</l>
            <l>That Benefit, which I, had hope to gaine:</l>
            <l>Or, els, might find ſome other likely way</l>
            <l>To fit me for the part I have to play.</l>
            <l>Some ſay my <hi>Friends</hi> are moe then I do know:</l>
            <l>And, I am hopefull that it may be ſo;</l>
            <l>For, if kind language, and much complement</l>
            <l>Are ſignes thereof; nor <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> nor <hi>Kent</hi>

            <l>Knowes any man who may himſelfe apply</l>
            <l>Unto your <hi>Houſe,</hi> with better hopes then I:</l>
            <l>But, if by <hi>reall-deeds,</hi> it muſt be known</l>
            <l>What <hi>Friends</hi> I have, their <hi>number</hi> ſmall is grown:</l>
            <l>Or, els, their <hi>Pow'r</hi> attaineth not unto</l>
            <l>Thoſe Friendly Offices they wiſh to do;</l>
            <l>And, peradventure, they obſtructed be</l>
            <l>In their endeavours, by defects in me.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43137:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>It may be 'tis obſerv'd, I want <hi>Relations,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Guifts-qualifying,</hi> or thoſe <hi>Commendations</hi>

            <l>Thoſe active, who, mens <hi>Cauſes</hi> undertake;</l>
            <l>And I halfe think it ſo: For, e're this day,</l>
            <l>Some one or other had, els, gotten way</l>
            <l>For my Petitions; or appeared able</l>
            <l>To make my <hi>ſuites</hi> and <hi>me</hi> conſiderable;</l>
            <l>Since, others, who have neither <hi>loſt,</hi> nor <hi>ſpent,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Nor for the <hi>Publike,</hi> hazzarded or lent</l>

            <l>Had profitable places) meet with more</l>
            <l>Succeſſe then I; and, daily can be heard</l>
            <l>With expedition, and with good regard.</l>
            <l>But, (whatſoe're the other cauſes are</l>
            <l>Why thus it comes to paſſe) this, doth appear,</l>
            <l>That, they who now are my <hi>Competitors,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Have ſo o'rematched my <hi>Solicitors,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That, if I ſpeed, your <hi>Houſe,</hi> will prove, to me,</l>
            <l>A better <hi>Friend</hi> then <hi>Individuals</hi> be.</l>
            <l>I find, that, many who, a while agoe,</l>
            <l>Appear'd for me, do now (<hi>Gradatim</hi>) grow</l>
            <l>Elſewhere ingag'd. I find, that, they begin</l>
            <l>To reckon, how the <hi>place</hi> hath valued been;</l>
            <l>And, to expoſtulate, and to admire</l>
            <l>How, I, to an <hi>Employment</hi> dar'd aſpire</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Truſt</hi> or <hi>Worth</hi>; who, am diſpoil'd of that,</l>
            <l>Which (in their judgment) ſhould ſecure the <hi>State</hi>:</l>

            <l>Were no <hi>Security</hi>; or, out of faſhion:</l>
            <l>As if, my <hi>portion,</hi> in the <hi>publike</hi> hand,</l>
            <l>Might not, aſwell, for <hi>good-aſſurance</hi> ſtand,</l>
            <l>As if it were in mine: Or, as if he</l>

            <l>Of all he had, deſerv'd not to be thought</l>

            <l>Thoſe things, which unto me, of right, pertain.</l>
            <l>They might admire, that I, who have not bin</l>

            <l>To <hi>Peer</hi> or <hi>Commoner</hi>; nor have the skill</l>
            <l>To make a <hi>Partie</hi>; nor, thereto, a <hi>Will</hi>:</l>
            <l>That, I who follow <hi>Suites,</hi> as if I thought,</l>

            <l>The <hi>Judge</hi> doth neither GOD, nor <hi>Mortal</hi> fear:</l>

            <l>A <hi>Place of profit</hi>; and, conceive to get</l>
            <l>His hopes, by <hi>merit, honeſty,</hi> or <hi>wit</hi>:</l>
            <l>For, I do find that, in this <hi>undertaking</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Great rubs are made (and many other making)</l>
            <l>So troubleſome to paſſe, that, I am tir'd:</l>
            <l>And, had I but that competence acquir'd,</l>

            <l>For all, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> could give.</l>
            <l>One, of your <hi>Order,</hi> told me, at your dore</l>

            <l>But, as, I to his face, made anſwer, then,</l>
