            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RIght Honorable, Worshipfull, and dearly beloued in our Lord Iesus: It hath beene an ancient and laudable Custome of
<pb facs="tcp:13862:3"/>
the Church of God, as to ordaine generally certaine ordinarie <hi>Loue-Feasts</hi> and Christian Meetings, for the more comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and maintenance of <hi>Brotherly Loue,</hi> which is the <hi>Bond of Perfection:</hi> so more especially, when the Lord hath enlarged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in any extraordinarie Fauour vnto his Church, by deliuering the same out of some desperate and inexplicable danger. We haue not onely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>commaund</hi> of God, to be enlarged in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse accordingly, but to expresse our thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: as principally by exercising our selues in <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:13862:3"/>
spirituall reioycings; so also (to testifie our renued interest in the <hi>Creatures,</hi> which such Extremities might haue vtterly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs of) in this respect also, to solace our selues in a more <hi>liberall vse</hi> thereof by solemne <hi>Feastings,</hi> and all such outward Meanes, as together with inward refreshing of the Minde, might also tend aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to the comfort of the body; as being much weakened and disinabled with the feare and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of former Dangers. And thus wee may finde, that the Church of God hath vpon such Occasion accordingly practised. See <hi>Hest. 9. Nehem.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:4"/>
And thus doe wee at this day solemnize the Memoriall of <hi>our Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glorious Deliuerance</hi> from the Kingdome of Darkenesse, by the True <hi>Light</hi> of the World, <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> Who as at this Time shined as it were in the darkenesse and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that so hee might bring <hi>Light out of Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and by his abasing of himselfe vnto the <hi>shape of a Seruant,</hi> might restore vs to the <hi>glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God.</hi> Wherein howsoeuer happily we are not free from some vniust <hi>imputation of superstition,</hi> by such, who being not able to discerne betweene the

right <hi>vse,</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> of things, doe therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our <hi>Liberty</hi> for the common <hi>abuse</hi> thereof in these licentious Times, by turning the same as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the flesh: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought their aspersions any whit to discourage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religious heart from an holy improuing of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the glory of God, seeing they proceed rather of superstitious singularity then any sound ground of Truth: Neither may we doubt, but that our <hi>reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and spirituall Behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> herein, as it shall iustly cleare vs from any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of superstition, so it may also free vs from the danger of any such abuse,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:5"/>
which the loosenesse of the times is guiltie of. For howsoeuer it may not be denyed, but that such <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations</hi> as were meerely of <hi>Humane Inuention;</hi> or though they were of <hi>Gods</hi> appointment, yet tending to the obscuring and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogating of the <hi>Truth of Christ,</hi> were meerely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, and so to bee renounced of vs, as they were <hi>abolished by Christ:</hi> such as were the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of <hi>Moyses,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer else of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Yet whatsoeuer <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> haue their <hi>Equitie</hi> from the Law of God, and Practise of the Saints, according thereunto, and withall are so farre from

<pb facs="tcp:13862:6"/>
we will not be <hi>contentious,</hi> whereof we haue no such custome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howsoeuer to him that <hi>doubteth,</hi> this libertie may be <hi>sinne;</hi> &amp; that much more, if hee shall proceed to <hi>condemne others,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and that most of all, if hee shall <hi>depriue himselfe</hi> of the <hi>libertie in good things,</hi> vpon pretence of some <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> that doth hang vpon the same (as the manner of some is:) yet should this rather prouoke vs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our libertie to the best in all spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that so eyther the Mouth of Iniquitie may be vtterly stopped, or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:13862:6"/>
graciously to glorifie our God with vs, euen on our behalfe. The <hi>Meanes</hi> and <hi>Triall</hi> hereof, seeing it consists in the <hi>holy orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and gouernment of the Affections,</hi> as euidencing the inward puritie of the hart; which being purified by Faith, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pure thereunto: therefore shall this Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this Time prooue most <hi>seasonable,</hi> wherein by our <hi>libertie in the flesh,</hi> we may be so easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to exceed to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of the flesh. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely shall it serue for the restrayning of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancie at this time: But seeing <hi>the whole course of our Christian Life</hi> is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
<pb facs="tcp:13862:7"/>
ledde, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly followeth the wise <hi>Temper of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and so is also approued and perfected thereby: Therefore also shall this <hi>Light</hi> prooue a profitable <hi>Guide,</hi> to conduct vs throughout all the <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> thereof: As seruing for an Armour both to enable vs in the <hi>Conquest</hi> of such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which will bee sure at all times to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vs in our Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iourney; as also the better to comfort vs, in regard of such <hi>Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and outward faylings, which doe oftentimes mainely challenge the
<pb facs="tcp:13862:7"/>
truth of our proceeding. For as, if there be a <hi>willing minde,</hi> the Lord <hi>accepts</hi> it aboue what we do, or can doe, that so wee may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a <hi>truth</hi> of Grace in the <hi>imperfection</hi> thereof: so seeing the Lord <hi>will perfect the worke he hath begun in vs.</hi> And yet in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that still his <hi>power must be seene in our weakenesse,</hi> that he may haue the only glory; therefore as this is for the present our <hi>euidence</hi> of sinceritie, that we <hi>loue</hi> &amp; <hi>affect</hi> what we cannot do, <hi>greeuing</hi> withall for our fayling heerein; so by these <hi>contrarie affections</hi> about the same <hi>Obiect,</hi> wee doe not onely Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the <hi>Spirituall combate,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:8"/>
but do daily interesse our selues heereby in the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of our <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom we are not only <hi>sustained</hi> in the combate, aboue any abilitie in our selues, but also by his <hi>vertue,</hi> we are daily strengthned against all oppositions, that so in time we may be <hi>more then Conquerors.</hi> But of these things more particularly in the <hi>Treatise</hi> ensuing. Which as I haue now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promise, published for the <hi>Common good;</hi> so because we liue in a <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>surfeting Age,</hi> wherein all is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too little for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the <hi>Flesh:</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery little too-much, that serues by the restraining
<pb facs="tcp:13862:8"/>
thereof to the satisfaction of the <hi>Mind:</hi> therefore are my <hi>Meditations</hi> sorted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; As in some <hi>breuitie</hi> and much <hi>weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> to <hi>stumble</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, who stands vpon <hi>colour</hi> more then <hi>cloth,</hi> doting rather vpon what may affect and puffe vp the <hi>giddy braine,</hi> then what may reforme and humble the <hi>honest heart:</hi> so thereby also to exercise, and stirre vp the <hi>dulnesse</hi> of the best; that what seemes not so apparant at the first view, may by more serious <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> and feruent <hi>prayer</hi> be better conceiued, and more profitably digested. And therefore also haue I beene the briefer in this
<pb facs="tcp:13862:9"/>
               <hi>Generall discouery of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Affections;</hi> because my purpose is (God-willing) to adde shortly hereunto a <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Discouery of each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Affection,</hi> according to their <hi>Order, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Differences;</hi> wherein by the Grace of God there may be some profitable supply in <hi>speciall,</hi> for what soeuer is wanting in the <hi>Generall direction.</hi> Meane while, that I might not be wanting to the season, whereby the time may in some measure be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the hearts of Gods children raysed vp to further hope. I haue thought good first to frame these <hi>Wals</hi> and <hi>Gates</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:9"/>
for the <hi>Citie,</hi> that so the <hi>Inward buildings</hi> may be more safely erected and perfected. Of all which, as I haue bin bold to make choice of your <hi>Honours</hi> &amp; <hi>Wor.</hi> as <hi>Patrons;</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> as to whom being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bound by so many former fauours; I could not choose but renew my <hi>Bonds,</hi> by paying this poor <hi>Interest,</hi> though far I hope from any base <hi>Usurie:</hi> yet binding hereby to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <hi>debt</hi> of <hi>loue,</hi> which is then best paid, when stil it is owed.

Worships, which seeing they ought not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by any <hi>outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> thereof, therefore my hope is, that you will accept of my <hi>endeauours</hi> herein, not according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which I <hi>haue,</hi> but answerable to my <hi>affection</hi> therein. Comforting my selfe heerein: that seeing God hath giuen you wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to discern of things that differ, and our hearts are in the <hi>hands of God,</hi> that if we preuaile with <hi>him,</hi> we shall preuaile with <hi>men:</hi> therefore, as my desire heerein, is to approue my selfe vnto <hi>God</hi> and the consciences of his people; so <hi>other things</hi> shall be so farre supplied, as that still

the power of God may be seene in our weakenesse, and the Lord may haue the glory of all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

whereby I may prouoke <hi>men,</hi> that they may be like vnto <hi>God</hi> in a wiser dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of their <hi>Affections.</hi> This is that I ayme at in this Treatise.

our loue to Good, and not Euill, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Affections</hi> must so <note place="margin">3.

That whereas there is in the <hi>Obiect</hi> the <hi>person,</hi> or <hi>thing,</hi> wherein the qualitie is, and the <hi>Qualitie</hi> it selfe; and the <hi>person,</hi> or <hi>thing,</hi> is to be diuersly affected, in regard of the <hi>different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> thereof.

And this may serue for the iust conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Times.</p>

            <p>Wee haue beene better taught, then to feare God so little.</p>
            <p>Wee haue had greater <hi>Iudgements,</hi> then that we should be so secure.</p>

            <p>First I say, our <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. By the Word.</note> must be informed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:34"/>
We first know what to <hi>loue,</hi> and then affect the same: and if our <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are proportionable to our knowledge, we affect so farre, as wee are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and perswaded of the truth; and according to the particular truth we know, so our particular affection is leuelied at, and confined thereunto.

            <p>And secondly, if our <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> exceed our Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and knowledge of the Truth, wee shall not onely be driuen to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truth of our Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but also by our

Or else, by the strength and violence of our Affections, wee may bee drawne to doe that which is contrary to our Iudgement; and so there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also offer violence to our Consciences.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, if our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> onely ayme at ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, <note place="margin">2.

vnto vs, cannot rest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the quieting of our Consciences, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vs to Obedience. Our <hi>Affections</hi> are not in <hi>Faith,</hi> and so cannot be acceptable vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all our <hi>affections</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God must arise from the knowledge and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of his loue vnto vs in <hi>Iesus Christ: Wee loue him, because hee loued vs first,</hi> 1.

Not as if wee could <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue</hi> his Loue, by louing him first; or could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere his Loue with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall measure: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath freely, and infinitely loued vs, therefore we labour, in our weake measure, to

loue him againe, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue hereby our <hi>thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse</hi> vnto him, and so to giue him the glorie of his free goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I say, that our <note place="margin">3. To our Callings.</note> 
               <hi>affections</hi> must be squared and limitted according to our seuerall <hi>Callings,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the execution of them. I say, in regard of the <hi>execution thereof</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, That though eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Christian is equally bound to loue God aboue all, and so to testifie his loue, not onely by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his glorie, grieuing at his dishonour, but also by all outward occasions, as may expresse the same: yet seeing the Lord hath ordayned <hi>seuerall Callings</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:13862:36"/>
in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> and these both distinct, by their seuerall <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and so also <hi>subordinate</hi> to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the maintenance of the common peace and publike good. Therefore also, according to these distinct and subordinate Callings, there must be a different and subordinate execution of our <hi>affections.</hi> As, that though all must equally affect the glory of God, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward measure of grace the Lord hath vouchsafed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. yet each must seuerally expresse their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection herein, as their <hi>Callings</hi> doe limit or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the same. As that
<pb facs="tcp:13862:37"/>
the <hi>Magistrate</hi> may testifie his zeale to Gods glorie, not onely in being angrie at sinne, but in punishing the same; which a priuate man may not doe: His onely Weapons heerein, must be <hi>Prayers</hi> &amp; <hi>Teares.</hi> And so the <hi>Minister</hi> may testifie his zeale to God by his publike Calling, in reproouing, conuincing, and censuring publikely: all which, a priuate man may not doe, because God is the God of Order, and requires no more at our hands, then he allots vnto vs. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I say our <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</note> must be sutable to the <hi>occasions</hi> and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Times and

Church where wee liue, and so to our owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Occasions. As that wee must <hi>weepe with them that weepe,</hi> and <hi>reioyce with them that reioyce.</hi> Rom. 12. 15. 16.

            <p>And yet seeing there is <note place="margin">9.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:38"/>
an holy Order to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in our <hi>Affections,</hi> according to the more excellent <hi>Obiects:</hi> As that our <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Glorie</hi> must haue the chiefe place; the <hi>publike Good,</hi> the next, before our owne <hi>priuate:</hi> Therefore our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ctions must be suited and mixed accordingly. As if it stand with Gods Glorie, to punish <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> with fire from Heauen, for offering strange fire vnto God; <hi>Aaron,</hi> their Father, must preferre Gods glorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the good of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.</note> and in silence sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the will of God.

            <p>Yea, such must be our holy wisedome and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per herein; as that seeing the <hi>publike</hi> must be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the <hi>priuate:</hi> Therefore, though our priuate case be safe, and yeeld vs sound matter of reioycing; yet wee must withall be sorrowfull for the publike: yea, our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

ioy must giue way thereto: And though in priuate it goe ill with vs; yet wee must reioyce in the publike good, and be comforted in our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar distresse, by the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the publike welfare of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>

            <p>A second <hi>generall Rule</hi> there is concerning our

               <hi>Affections;</hi> That as they must bee informed by Knowledge, so they must be bounded thereby: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching onely so farre vnto their <hi>obiects,</hi> aa the Word alloweth.

               <hi>Affections</hi> are, so wee shall profit in the Word, and holy Duties.

            <p>A <hi>fourth Rule</hi> herein is, That if the <hi>Affection</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last <note place="margin">4. Rule. Out-lasting the Action.</note> the <hi>Action:</hi> eyther if it be accomplished, yet still we desire to better it; or if it fayle, yet still it is more kindled to recouer againe; this is a signe of the inward Life thereof. But if it giue ouer with the <hi>Action,</hi> eyther ending in the thing done, or quayling, because of the thing vndone; this rather is the power of Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doting vpon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Action, then the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13862:44"/>
power of Affection, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing it selfe vnto God, and not measuring it selfe by the successe of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eyther way, but by the loue of God discerning inward and generall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fift Rule</hi> hitherto is, That if our <hi>Affection</hi> hath <note place="margin">5. Rule.

            <p n="6">6. And so if our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">6. Rule. Direct meanes.</note> carries vs by indirect meanes, here we may sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the strength of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>How to order affections for our selues.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>VNto which we may adde these <hi>Rules,</hi> for the more holy ordering, and so benefiting, by them: as also for the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Sinceritie therein.</p>
            <p>Whereof some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <note place="margin">How to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for our selues.</note> 
               <hi>our selues:</hi> as that,</p>
            <p>First, When the case concerneth our selues, we must euer learne to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our owne Opinion, and Affection: as being ouer-weened with eon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our selues, and so subiect to much selfe-loue and deceit in our selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudgement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:46"/>
Secondly, We must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour more for <hi>Affection,</hi> then for Knowledge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Knowledge puffeth vp, and so causes barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but <hi>Affections</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and prouoke to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: by the one, wee may rule others, but by these, rule our selues.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We must make <note place="margin">In compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> our Affections as little knowne in companie as may be; so did <hi>Ioseph:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the discouerie of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection causeth imputation of Hypocrisie from others vnto vs, and causeth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of offence, by peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to the flesh from vs vnto others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We must trie <note place="margin">By vse,</note> our affections hereby, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13862:46"/>
if they make vs lesse fit to pray, more vnable to doe the good we should, lesse careful to auoid sinne, then they are euill: But when on the contrary, they can prouoke vs to well doing, preuent sinne; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are quickned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods grace.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, If whatsoeuer we haue in the <hi>Iudgement,</hi> we <note place="margin">and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</note> haue also in the <hi>Affection,</hi> endeuouring to practise as we know, and so desiring still to know more that we may practise; this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the sinceritie of our Affections. Thus they are to be ordered: Because this implyes the subiection of the will and heart, and so of the whole man, to the obedience of Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:47"/>
Sixtly, Hereby also we <note place="margin">By contrary Bent.</note> shal discerne the sinceritie of our Affections: If as by nature wee enclined to one Vice more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; so now wee are more affected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Vertue. As if by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we were more dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Choler and Fumes; so now we are more affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to peaceablenesse and meekenesse. If naturally wee were more enclined to Slouth; so now wee are more actiue and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in good things.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, Yea this is <note place="margin">By contrary measure.</note> a notable Tryall hereof, That whereas naturally we were furious, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to euill, wee can be now more zealous and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13862:47"/>
feruent in good: whereas before we were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and desperate in euill, we can be now more constant and resolute for good: whereas before we were more desperate, in vnnecessarie and wilfull troubles, we can be now more couragious and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in those that are layd vpon vs, for good things. If the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent our <hi>affections</hi> were to euill by nature, the more feruent they shall be in the worke of Grace; this is a certaine token of the true change of them.</p>
            <p>The reason hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vsually whom the Lord conuerteth from a more desperate estate of
<pb facs="tcp:13862:48"/>
sinne: as hereby they are more bound vnto him; so shal they expresse what he aymeth at herein: namely, to be more iealous of his glory, to labour more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly therefore.</p>
            <p>Thus as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was more violent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the Saints; so was hee more zealous for the glory of his God: so did he labour more abundantly then the rest, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement thereof, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 1. 17. Thus, because much was forgiuen to that great Sinner, therefore much more did shee loue; the more shee had offended her God before, the more did shee labour to please him afterward, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:13862:48"/>
Eightly, Whereas the <note place="margin">By their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie.</note> triall of Sinceritie in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is, That God must be preferred aboue all things, aboue all earthly things whatsoeuer, yea aboue all heauenly things, as they concern vs, or any interest we haue therein: We must respect God simply for himselfe, &amp; for that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that is in him, without any respect of whatsoeuer benefit may redound to vs thereby. Therefore by this Rule also we may trie the sinceritie of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: That as they come more neerly to the nature and absolutenesse of God; so they are more pure and heauenly: that as God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs for his own sake, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13862:49"/>
not for ours; so wee can loue him for his owne sake, and not for any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite redounds vnto vs hereby: nay, rather then we will fayle in our loue vnto him, and his Glorie, wee can be contented to renounce all loue vnto our selues; not onely to suffer whatsoeuer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his sake, but euen to bee accursed, rather then he should be dis-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, <hi>Rom. 9. 12. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>So because our sinne it is, which displeaseth God, and it is the punishment that may displease vs: If therefore wee can grieue simply for our sinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our God is grieued
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13862:49"/>
with them, and not rather for the punishment wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are like to smart: being rather willing, if it could be put to our choise, to vndergoe euen Hellish torments, so we might be free from sinne, whereby we may offend our God; then to enioy Heauen, with condition of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: so, that though there were no Hell to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, nor Heauen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs; yet wee could hate sinne, and loue righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. This is a very gracious Euidence of the sinceritie of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Hereby wee may know a great measure of Gods grace in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of our Affections,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:50"/>
and quickening of them to the life of Glory.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Concerning <note place="margin">Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euill and good.</note> our <hi>Affections</hi> to <hi>euill:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that if the floud-gates be open, grow headstrong and vnresistable; therefore we are to nip them in the blade, nay, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, stifle them in the Wombe, lest they grow so violent, as that they cannot be mastered. But touching <hi>good Affections,</hi> because they are <hi>like the</hi>

               <hi>Morning Light, that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more and more vnto the perfect Day;</hi> therefore they are to bee cherished dayly, and quickened by the Word, and Prayer: that so they may master
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13862:50"/>
not onely our corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, but also bring in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection all our <hi>gifts of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, all other sauing <note place="margin">Note.</note> Graces may be turned as it were into <hi>Affections;</hi> that the zeale of Gods House may euen eate vs vp: Nothing may bee seene, in comparison of our <hi>Affections;</hi> these may preuayle and raigne ouer all.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As wee must take notice of this, That wee are subiect to <hi>one Affection</hi> more then another.</p>
            <p>First, in regard of our <hi>different Condition:</hi> as in <hi>Prosperitie,</hi> to Pride, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Vncharitablenesse, &amp;c. and so in <hi>Aduersitie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:51"/>
to Feare, Impatiencie, Despaire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and so in regard of our <hi>Naturall different disposition,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Complexion and Education, Societie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our <hi>different Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> as to Couetousnesse, Ambition, Deceit, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So in regard hereof <note place="margin">Rule heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note> know we, that it is a good signe of Grace to discerne the <hi>predominancie</hi> of the <hi>speciall affection,</hi> so that we labour principally against the same, auoyding the Occasions lawfully, and strengthening our selues, by the contrarie meanes to subdue and weaken the power thereof.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:13862:51"/>
8. If we can turne all the Graces of God into <hi>affections,</hi> as to heare with Feare and Ioy, to pray with Feruencie and Zeale, to giue Almes cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so that indeede the whole action is swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp of the Affection, and conuerted thereunto.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Whereas e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <note place="margin">In regard of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> regenerate man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of two <hi>contrary parts,</hi> namely, the <hi>New Man,</hi> which is renewed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Image of Christ; and the <hi>Old Man,</hi> that remainder of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which wee haue receiued from <hi>Adam:</hi> the Condition of both which is, that they are alwayes striuing against each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb facs="tcp:13862:52"/>
               <hi>The Spirit lusteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Flesh;</hi> and, <hi>the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit:</hi> so according to this continuall Combate, the <hi>Affections</hi> are to be <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> and <hi>tried.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As first for the <hi>ordering</hi> of them: The <hi>Affections</hi> 
               <note place="margin">For orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> of the vnregenerate part must be alwayes led and ordered by those of the Regenerate; our <hi>loue</hi> of <hi>Earthly</hi> things, directed by, and subordinate to our <hi>loue</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly;</hi> our <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> ordered and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to our <hi>feare of God</hi> and his goodnesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And Triall.</note> of our <hi>Affections,</hi> here also the Rule is, That
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13862:52"/>
seeing wee are but in part regenerate; therefore our <hi>Affections</hi> are then most sutable, when wee can expresse <hi>contrarie Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> about the same <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As first, That we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce <note place="margin">Note.</note> in our God, and his goodnesse, and yet grieue that we are not answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereto; that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereof, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walke worthie the same.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we can so <hi>grieue for sinne,</hi> as that wee can also reioyce in this, that wee doe by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained sorrow testifie our Obedience vnto God, our hatred of sinne, and
<pb facs="tcp:13862:53"/>
our endeuour to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: That wee can so <hi>feare our God,</hi> and his Goodnesse, as withall we can hope and trust in his mercie, and rely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>The reason hereof is, that as by the one <hi>affection</hi> we iustifie our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in part; so by the other contrarie, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and mortifie the vnregenerate. By both, thus contending with each other in the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we approue the truth thereof in the presence of God, and so labour for the acceptance of it aboue the worth thereof, in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, and we also maintaine the Spirituall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13862:53"/>
Combate betweene the Flesh and the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If our <hi>affections</hi> run <note place="margin">In regard of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> more vpon heauenly then earthly things, and wee can begin our desires for earthly things from a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ground,</hi> and so can vse them with a <hi>spirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi> still to thriue in grace, and to a <hi>spirituall end,</hi> namely, to further vs to Heauen; this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the circumcising thereof: thus may wee learne to order them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Our <hi>affections</hi> must <note place="margin">In respect of reflection</note> begin from our selues to others; and from others, returne vnto our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Wee must labour
<pb facs="tcp:13862:54"/>
to quicken and order our Affections, by Prayer, Singing, and Meditation especially.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In most weightiest Occasions, we must espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Note.</note> watch ouer our <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> because now Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will by them peruert vs herein.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Our <hi>affection</hi> must be sutable to the qualitie of the Obiect, and hence to be rightly iudged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning others,</hi> Our <hi>affections</hi> are to bee orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus towards <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, According <hi>to the diuersitie of Gods graces in them,</hi> so must wee affect accordingly, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Nature, or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13862:54"/>
Worldly Happinesse. For this is to haue respect of Persons; and so is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Iam. 2, 3, 4. Act.</hi> 10. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>Secondly, According <hi>to present Necessitie;</hi> so wee must affect those that are in greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Want, howsoeuer farre inferiour in Grace to others, that are not in such extremitie: and out of our tender compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, minister present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe vnto them; that so it may appeare, wee doe it for Gods sake, and not vpon any goodnesse in them: expecting our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence from the Lord; which we are like to loose from men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:55"/>
Thirdly, Whereas there <note place="margin">Affections vnited to the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> are <hi>some Callings</hi> on Earth which doe in some sort represent the <hi>Maiestie</hi> and <hi>Office of God:</hi> as the Calling of the <hi>Magistrate, Minister,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore herein also there must be a wise ordering of our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> As that, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, in generall, we must affect where there be best Graces; yet now, if the case stand betweene a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> though wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and a <hi>priuate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:</hi> wee must more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the Image of Gods <hi>Maiestie, Power,</hi> &amp;c. and in regard of his Place and Office, is to execute the Will of God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13862:55"/>
whether for good or euill, and so is an image of Gods free and absolute Power. I say, in these respects we must more lone, feare, and regard the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> then any <hi>priuate Christian</hi> howsoeuer, superiour in spirituall Graces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reasons</hi> are:</p>
            <p>First, Because the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Reasons hereof.</note> 
               <hi>Calling</hi> of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi> and such Gifts as may concerne the same, is that which the Lord in wisdome hath set ouer not onely the <hi>persons</hi> of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, but euen their <hi>best Gifts</hi> also, either to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> them for the <hi>Good</hi> they doe, or else to <hi>punish</hi> them for the <hi>Euill</hi> they doe: yea, to <hi>correct</hi> them
<pb facs="tcp:13862:56"/>
also for the <hi>good</hi> they may doe, because they haue fayled in the measure thereof: so that, wherein we thinke we haue most cause to spurne at <hi>gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> because happily it layes the burthen vpon the wrong horse, <hi>vexing</hi> the <hi>Doues,</hi> and <hi>acquitting the Crowes,</hi> as hee sayth. Yet herein we haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test cause to loue the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate:</hi> As not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein an Image of the Diuine Prouidence, in bearing with the wicked in great patience, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his children; but also expressing herein the Diuine Goodnesse: first, of his <hi>generall Prouidence</hi> to the <hi>Wicked,</hi> in sparing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13862:56"/>
them; and therein, his <hi>speciall Prouidence</hi> to the <hi>Godly,</hi> in sparing the <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> for the triall of his Children; and so of his Goodnesse herein to his Saints, in correcting them here, that they may not be condemned hereafter; and so of his <hi>speciall Prouidence</hi> to the <hi>Wicked,</hi> in hardning them by his patience to the Day of Slaughter.</p>
            <p>The like may bee said concerning the <hi>Faithfull Minister:</hi> That whereas hee is the <hi>Interpreter, one of a thousand, to declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man his Righteousnesse,</hi> Iob. 33. 22. Yea, is so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with God, as both to be the <hi>Mouth of God</hi> vnto the people, the Lord

            <p>Yea, herein wee haue singular matter to <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our Loue;</hi> both in praying for his Parson,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13862:58"/>
that God may make him more profitable: and so <hi>mourning</hi> for his <hi>Defects,</hi> as that by our Meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Humilitie wee seeke by all holy meanes to winne him to more faithfulnesse, by being faithfull in the obedience of that Truth which hee hath deliuered: as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>our sinne</hi> is the cause that our Pastour is so defectiue.</p>
            <p>And therefore mourne wee especially for our owne Sinnes; so wee may giue him example to doe the like, or else make him herein inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.</p>
            <p>Which as it <hi>reproueth</hi> the <note place="margin">Vse.</note> giddinesse of our people,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:59"/>
which heape vp Teachers <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 2.</note> vnto themselues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne Lusts, forsaking and disgracing those whom God hath set ouer them, vpon pretence of their insufficiencie of Gifts, or other defects; so it ought to aduise vs, to be <hi>humbled for our owne sinnes,</hi> when any such stumbling blockes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>Assuring our selues, <note place="margin">Note.</note> That if wee can truely <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>compare,</hi> not out vaine and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Affections after the most eminent Gifts, but our measure of profiting answerable to the meanest Gifts in truth, wee shall find, if wee deale truely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13862:59"/>
with our owne Hearts (may I not speake of those that presume most in this case) that wee are generally to learne the very first grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11. and so are short of answering the meanest Gifts.</p>
            <p>And so may iustly feare, that whereas we would be <note place="margin">Note.</note> generally thought better then wee are, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed that we haue been so short in answering so long and gracious time of our Visitation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath giuen vs vp to this <hi>Presumption,</hi> to iudge of our Teachers, that wee may iustifie our selues, and so to this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and hunting after
<pb facs="tcp:13862:60"/>
those, as we take it, of the best Gifts; that so, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee may be conceited to be that wee are not, men of greater vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, of more spirituall experience, as being able to reach and attayne to their measure, and so thereby be further harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and corruptions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our <hi>Affections</hi> to others, must be deriued from our Affection to our selues: we must begin at home, and so be enlarged abroad; so loue others, out of loue to our selues; so to be zealous against others sinnes, as to begin at home, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:13862:60"/>
And secondly, <hi>Our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to others</hi> must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe: if by grieuing for others sinnes, we can doe little good vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, let our griefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home for our owne sinnes; yea, let vs be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our <hi>Affections to others</hi> must be alwayes bounded within the Rules of the Word, &amp; the glory of God: We must so affect the saluation of others, as may stand with Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with the good of his Church, according to his Word. We must so grieue for their sinnes, as that we submit to Gods will, and not hinder our Callings, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:61"/>
We must so pitie them, as not to harden them in sinne, not to pamper them in wantonnesse, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the right ordering of our <hi>Affections</hi> toward <note place="margin">Order of Affections towards God.</note> God, this <hi>generall Rule</hi> must be obserued, That there are some <hi>Affections</hi> which properly and only belong vnto him: as <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> these are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar onely to the Lord: so that it is high Treason to that supreme Maiestie, to transferre them to any other.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Trust:</hi> Onely in the Lord; Not in Princes, not any, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:13862:61"/>
So for <hi>Hope:</hi> Onely in God; not in Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>meaning</hi> is, not that wee must not trust them, that is, yeeld some ciuile credit to them, as to their words, to their actions, &amp;c. in regard of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, nor that wee must not hope well of them in charitie, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. in regard of spirituall, because we know not the contrarie: but wee must not repose any religious confidence in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning saluation; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope in them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to effect the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me: in which sense wee here speake of these <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>second Rule</hi> is, That
<pb facs="tcp:13862:62"/>
though some <hi>Affections</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect our selues &amp; others, yet they must be <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to our respect of God. Our <hi>Affections</hi> to God must be without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation: Wee cannot <hi>loue</hi> him enough, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>feare</hi> him too much; so farre as possibly wee may, our affections must be enlarged proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the <hi>Obiect;</hi> they must be <hi>boundlesse,</hi> and <hi>endlesse,</hi> as the <hi>Obiect</hi> is. But those to our neighbor must be confined within their Limits, both subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to <hi>God;</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as our Callings, and the condition of the party doth require, with reference still to Gods glory.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Benefit of the right vse of holy Affections.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FIrst, <hi>Hereby</hi> wee shall be sure to profit and thriue in all well-doing: for as the thing is affected, so it is encreased and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Hereby</hi> wee shal discerne vndoubtedly the <hi>true worke of Grace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in vs; for as is the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> so is the truth of the heart: Looke what we <hi>loue,</hi> what we <hi>feare,</hi> what we <hi>reioyce</hi> in, what we are <hi>sorrie</hi> for; these will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the vprightnesse of the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:63"/>
Thirdly, Hereby also wee shall approoue our selues in the <hi>growth of Grace:</hi> for as our <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are more quickened to holy duties, as we more <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>reioyce</hi> in them, as we more <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> in the continuance of them, as wee are more <hi>grieued</hi> in our selues for our fayling, are more <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> against sinne, more <hi>angrie</hi> against it; so wee doe thriue in well-doing. And</p>
            <p>Fourthly, So also by our <hi>Affections</hi> wee may discerne our <hi>perseuerance,</hi> and constancie, in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; each of them being furtherances thereunto, and assurances thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:13862:63"/>
Fiftly, Our <hi>Affections</hi> rightly ordered, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs to haue more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable fellowship with God in <hi>Prayer, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. as quickening our <hi>zeale</hi> of his Glorie, our <hi>loue</hi> vnto his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; procuring our more free and bold accesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his glorious presence, our more entire and cheerefull societie with him, our better content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his prouidence; enabling vs with more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to wait vpon him, and so to striue more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with him, that we may not be sent emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie away.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, These also well ordered, will proue <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:13862:64"/>
helpes</hi> for our <hi>more comfortable societie with men,</hi> to our mutuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and aduantage: As whereby,</p>
            <p>First, wee are enabled and enlarged to doe them most good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fitted to maintaine the fellowship, as being ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ouercome what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer euills may arise, to the breach thereof, with our <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Meekenesse:</hi> And so fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to further each other to the <hi>Heauenly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, Especially whereas there are three speciall <hi>Times,</hi> wherein our <hi>Affections</hi> are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13862:64"/>
much distempered, but euen quite peruerted, so farre as wee can perceiue, from their right <hi>Obiects,</hi> and vse; namely,</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Time of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion;</hi> when our God with-draweth the Light of his Countenance from vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Time of violent Distresse;</hi> by reason of acute Diseases: as in Feuers, power of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Time of vehement Tentation;</hi> by the Malice of Satan.</p>
            <p>In all these, as wee must bee wise to iudge of our Affections, and our selues by them; so wee may reape sound
<pb facs="tcp:13862:65"/>
comfort thereby, both to preuent distraction and despaire, as also giue hope of recouerie thereout.</p>
            <p>As first, <hi>generally,</hi> That our <hi>Affections</hi> must not be measured by any of these extraordinarie Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wee may not bee iudged by the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Affection in them.</p>
            <p>First, because the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is contrarie to the maine bent of our hearts, in our ordinarie course of Sanctification: and,</p>
            <p>Secondly, When wee come to our selues againe, and can iudge rightly of things, wee are the first that <hi>iudge</hi> our selues, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13862:65"/>
condemne our folly and ignorance in such distem pers: and <hi>Ps.</hi> 73. 22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our God lookes vpon vs, not as wee are transported with these distempers, but as he hath from euerlasting loued vs in Christ, and in his singular wisedome and mercie, hath inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to turne our distem pers, as to the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>priuie corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> as it was in <hi>Iob, Cap.</hi> 3. so to the purging out of more inward and dangerous euils; of Pride, Vaineglorie, &amp;c. And so to the aduancing of his free mercie, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not onely in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayning vs by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:13862:66"/>
power, in these Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but in ouer-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our Distempers, by his wonderfull lenitie and goodnesse: as hee dealt with <hi>Ionas;</hi> and making <note place="margin">Ch. 11.</note> way hereby, for the better quieting and settling of our vnruly and carnall heat and affections, for the time to come, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vs wholly out of our selues vpon his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Christ Iesus, and so renewing vs in him to more constant and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience. And so not so much respecting the present disorder of the Affection, as prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it hereby to that comfortable issue of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to his Will, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13862:66"/>
so hee may crowne and perfect his owne worke in vs; meerely, for his owne sake, by his owne mightie Arme, that hee may haue the onely glory of all his mercies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Particularly,</hi> We may obserue a speciall hand of God in each of these Occasions:</p>
            <p>As first, <hi>In the Case of Desertion.</hi> And here let the examples of <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> be the instance of our Case.</p>
            <p>It pleased God for a time to withdraw the sense of his mercy from them, and so to exercise them with contrarie buffettings and sense of his displeasure, <hi>Iob. 6. 2. Ps. 38. 4, 5. Ps.</hi> 77. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:67"/>
Hereupon followes a strange distemper of their <hi>Affections:</hi> in stead of <hi>Ioy,</hi> bitter <hi>Sorrow;</hi> yea, sorrow prouoking to rage, and <note place="margin">Ps. 77.</note> repining against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they encreased the <note place="margin">Iob. 3. Iob. 62. 12.</note> burthen, and were readie to sinke vnder the same, by despaire.</p>
            <p>Yet we see how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully the Lord sustaines them in the midst of these Terrors.</p>
            <p>First, It befalls not them as they foolishly feare, and wish.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are kept in some measure of <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> to leaue the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret worke to God: yea, in some measure of <hi>Fatth,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:13862:67"/>
as to relye on the power of God: yea, in some measure, nay, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent measure of <hi>Loue;</hi> though hee forsaketh, yet he is still my God, <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. And therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, Will the Lord forsake for euer? Not so <note place="margin">Ps. 77. 7, 9, 10.</note> much doubting, that he will forsake; as wrestling with God by Faith, that hee may not forsake for euer: as gathering from the former times, that he hath beene gracious; and so concluding, from the faithfulnesse of God, that he will not forsake for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Yea, victorious <hi>Iob</hi> professeth confidently his loue vnto God, euen in the greatest extremitie,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:68"/>
Though he kill me, yet I will trust in him, <hi>Iob.</hi> 16. 13. And lastly, when the Lord hath tryed them in the Furnace, and their drosse is purged out, their <hi>Affections</hi> returne to their right kind againe, yea, much more refined; to the denyall of themselues, and so to their more sober and constant furtherance in the worke of Grace, <hi>Iob.</hi> 42. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Concerning the distemper of our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> in acute Diseases: wherein if Satan hath not vsually an hand, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the fire; yet the violence of the Disease is sufficient to disorder and peruert the Iudgement
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13862:68"/>
for a time, and so to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract and distemper the Affections. Yet seeing wee speake and doe that in these extremities, which is contrarie to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer constant course; and when wee are recouered, wee eyther haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what wee did, or spake, or else doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our selues for the same: herein is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that our God will not impute vnto vs what hath fallen out in this case.</p>
            <p>And so wee may also conclude of the <hi>Time of Tentation,</hi> That whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer distempers fall out in this case, as they are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully bounded within
<pb facs="tcp:13862:69"/>
the generall Condition, That nothing hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen vs herein, but what is incident to <hi>Man;</hi> so their disorder shall not be imputed to <hi>vs,</hi> but to the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>malice of Satan.</hi> And the Lord in mercy will giue that issue, as that we shall both beare the burthen without groaning vnder it, and be freed thereof so farre, as shall make for his Glorie, and our good. But of this else-where, God willing, more at large.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Whereas it is a most desperate Policie in Poperie, to detayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and deceiued soules in their damnable Errors, and so to draw such like
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13862:69"/>
Nouices to their Lure: That if it please God to affoord light vnto any, whereby they haue some inckling of their Deceits, and so haue some inward motion, or affection, to renounce the same, and embrace the Truth; they presently suggest vnto them, that this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tentation, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish illusion: that so they might hereby deterre them from embracing the same, and so detayne them in their Egyptian Bondage. This triall of Affections will proue an excellent meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue them herein.</p>
            <p>For as by those Rules formerly layd downe, to
<pb facs="tcp:13862:70"/>
discerne the Affection from the Tentation, they may easily discerne the truth of Affection from the power of Delusion: so especially, in that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge, is layd downe both to bee the ground and bounds of all holy Affections; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they shall be sure to discerne the efficacie of Delusion from an vpright Affection.</p>
            <p>And so also, by a wise obseruation of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, may the weake Christian bee preserued graciously from Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; as hereby knowing what hee holdeth, and so holding that which is good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:13862:70"/>
To conclude, there is not a better euidence of the sinceritie of the heart, then the well-ordering of the Affections: because howsoeuer wee may bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from outward grosse Actions, yet our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will discouer the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our heart, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And on the other side, howsoeuer wee may be hindered from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action of well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by many occasions, as want of opportunitie, violence of tentation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilitie, and the like; yet our Affection thereto, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by grieuing that we cannot doe it, or going so farre as our abilitie will
<pb facs="tcp:13862:71"/>
serue, or endeuouring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue our abilitie, is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious euidence of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of our hearts.</p>
            <p>Nay, we shall find, that there is not a better spurre to prouoke vs to well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not any more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bridle to restrayne from sinne, then are our Affections.</p>
            <p>For as if wee doe any good, we must first be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the loue of it, before we can attempt the same: or else if wee doe vndertake it vpon by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, as to please men, to satisfie carnall ends; we shall easily giue ouer when these proppes fayle, onely it is the loue of Goodnesse, for it selfe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13862:71"/>
will make vs constant therein: So, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, wee shall neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake euill conscionably, vnlesse wee first hate it for it selfe, and loathe as wel the corruption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as feare the danger of the same. If vpon any other respects wee shall leaue sinne, as for feare of punishment, for credite, &amp;c. these respects will proue meanes sometimes euen to returne to such sinnes, or worse; which haue beene the occasions to lay them aside for a season.</p>
            <p>And therefore as it is the mercie of our God to shew vs oft times in our Affections what we may
<pb facs="tcp:13862:72"/>
doe in our Actions: so it is also his singular good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to forewarne vs of many euills which wee may otherwise fall into, euen by the sway of our Affections leading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>What should I say? Can we haue a better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the truth of our Conuersion, then the alteration of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Can wee now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in such thinges, which before wee loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed? And can we grieue especially at that, which heretofore was our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reioycing? Can we delight in the mortifying of the flesh? and reioyce that wee can sorrow for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13862:72"/>
sinne? and can we so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in all spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as that we can also be sorrowfull for our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of them? so that we can be alwayes sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and alwayes reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: reioycing in our God, and his Goodnesse; sorrowing, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reioyce as we should; that we cannot doe the good we would: reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in this, that wee haue got the masterie of some sinnes; and yet sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for our many fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and faintings euen in those conquests, &amp; for that body of sin, that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth so fast vpon vs? Can we discerne our <hi>Affections</hi> thus turned vpside down?
<pb facs="tcp:13862:73"/>
out ioy into sorrow, our sorrow into ioy, that so our carnall ioy in sinne may bee first swallowed vp of carnall sorrow for the punishment thereof: And our carnall sorrow may be preuented of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame despaire, by the glad Tidings of Gods mercie in Iesus Christ, speaking peace vnto our soules, and breeding spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ioy by the euidence of our adoption. And so our ioy in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our God may still worke in vs a spirituall sorrow and repentance of all our secure wayes, that so wee may cleaue vnto our God in new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: And so still as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13862:73"/>
wee can now reioyce in the truth of our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours; so wee can also mourne for the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of them; that so wee may still labour to be found in Christ. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by these changes and contrarieties of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly conclude a truth of our Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

               <hi>A Case of Conscience, here to bee resolued,</hi> Whether it be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vnsanctified Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be more placed on Earthly then Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Resolution</hi> hereof consists in a wise <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> of our <hi>Affections:</hi> which may be considered eyther as they are <hi>mixt,</hi> and so they are at the best; or, as they are <hi>predominant,</hi> and so the <hi>better</hi> part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles against the <hi>worse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take them as they are <hi>mixt:</hi> And so because the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13862:74"/>
               <hi>corrupt part</hi> first breakes out, and so is more <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and so still accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the <hi>better part</hi> in the processe of the Worke, and will haue a fling euen in the <hi>issue,</hi> to share with God, and rob him of his Glory; and so though happily the intention and purpose bee to the best, and in the issue of it, may prooue best to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of the flesh: yet in regard of the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of that of <hi>flesh,</hi> as being more naturall and sensible to a carnall eye; it may bee coniectured, that the <hi>Affection</hi> is more vpon that which is carnall, then that which is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13862:75"/>
Especially if wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That as <hi>Earthly things</hi> haue a present and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vse in all Occasions; so bring they a kinde of Warrant with them: As to vse them, so to <hi>affect</hi> them, that so we may take comfort in them; and by this comfort be prouoked vnto thankfulnesse.</p>
            <p>So that thus to <hi>affect,</hi> is not to <hi>affect</hi> them as <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but as <hi>heauenly</hi> things; as turned to the right end, and being good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Euidences to a better life. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19.</p>
            <p>Onely the <hi>Triall</hi> is in the <hi>setting of the Affection,</hi> and resting of the same in these earthly things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:13862:75"/>
               <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. It is one thing to <hi>affect</hi> euen the meanest things, as Gods blessings, which wee are to receiue cheerefully, and returne thankfully vnto our God. And another thing, to <hi>set the Affections</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, first, to rest in the thing, not in the giuer thereof. Secondly, so to rest in the present, as we place hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse heerein, and not make it a step to a further happinesse. Thirdly, so to giue way vnto these affections, for the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our hearts, as that either we leaue no roome for spirituall Obiects, but are wholly taken vp with desire and pursuit of earthly things, or so to
<pb facs="tcp:13862:76"/>
diuide our hearts to the entertainment of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Obiects, as that either they doe equally share in our desires; we are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to either, wee can serue God and Mammon alike, wee can be as eager, take as great delight in the prosecuting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of these, as the other. Or else, as it vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fails out, that if once wee grow to this equall partition, the Handmaid will shortly perke aboue the Mistresse, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Obiect will preuaile aboue the Spirituall, and so wee shall labour more for the meat that perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then for that which endureth for euer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:13862:76"/>
Thus to set our Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon earthly things, is indeed to giue more roome in our hearts for the World, then God, and so to exclude God, in regard of the World; and this is carnall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish.</p>
            <p>But so to affect earthly things, as to make them steps to higher blessings, as to acknowledge our faithfulnesse in the least, because God loues a cheerefull giuer, and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his meanest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, is indeed in earthly things to affect heauenly: The resolution rests in the meanes, and end of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting these things; that if we prosecute our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb facs="tcp:13862:77"/>
by holy meanes, and subordinate still these thinges to better; wee may affect them lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereby affect the better.</p>
            <p>This is to liue by Faith, and not by Sense, euen in outward things. This is to reioyce in God, and not in the things themselues. This is to lay vp a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation against the Day of Christ, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19. 20. Especially if wee consider these two things.</p>
            <p>First, that the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyes <note place="margin">Note.</note> vnto vs euen the most spirituall Blessings, by outward and carnall meanes; as the Word, by an Earthen Vessell; the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13862:77"/>
Sacraments, by outward Elements. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wee receiue such blessings by the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Flesh; as by hearing the Word, eating the Bread, &amp;c. which, as the Wisedome of God, no doubt, hath intended, for the humbling of the Flesh, that it should not rest in the outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operation of the Spirit; so also hath it his especiall worke for the triall of the Spirit, that it leads vs from that which is obuious to Sense, to that which is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Faith: that so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Flesh, yet wee <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note> may not liue after it, but
<pb facs="tcp:13862:78"/>
rather vse the flesh for the mortifying of the flesh. As that, if wee were not Flesh, we should not be thus led along with rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and elements, to the capacitie thereof; and because wee are thus led with elements, therefore the Lord hauing now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed our Infancie and weakenesse, wee should not bee weakelings still, needing Milke, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> but rather grow on to strength, and power of Grace, that so wee may digest the strongest Meat.</p>
            <p>The summe of all is: The Wicked affect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thinges with an earthly appetite, and so all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13862:78"/>
things are impure vnto <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> them: the Godly affect earthly thinges with an heauenly appetite, and so all thinges are pure vnto them. The Wicked affect heauenly things for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges sake, and so all become earthly vnto them: the Godly affect earthly things for heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things sake, and so all things become heauenly. The Godly find a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse in affecting earthly things, and so are prouoked to hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heauenly; the Wicked find a loathsomenesse in affecting heauenly things, and so rather seeke to quench their thirst in the puddle of earthly pleasure:
<pb facs="tcp:13862:79"/>
the Godly findea want of Heauenly things, and so still affect the best Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Wicked are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer satisfied with Earthly things, and so still tyre themselues in pursuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. So that it is the predominancie of the Affection, that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the right ordering thereof. Whereupon it settles most, wherein it sets vp it rest: How it subordinates the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the superiour, and aymes at the chiefest end, euen the glorie of God, and saluation of the Soule.</p>
            <p>And secondly, it is the <hi>issue</hi> of the Affection, that approoues the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13862:79"/>
thereof. If God giue <hi>Salomon</hi> aboundance of Earthly things, and hee giue his heart to seeke out pleasure, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein: yet, if vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on experience of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and insufficiencie of these things, to content the minde, hee renounce these carnall Delights, yea, euen what is good in them, in regard of the end that doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie the same, and so soare vp higher by this experience, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good; Is not this the right vse of all Earthly desires? Is not this to sanctifie euen these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Earthly thinges, by making them Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:80"/>
to quicken Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Affections, and so to settle them more firmely vpon dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ACcording to my Promise, in my last Treatise of the</hi> Gouernment of the Thoughts; <hi>I haue now supplyed thee (deare Christian) with some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering and subduing of thy vnruly and rebellious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: A Taske as so much the more difficult, then the former, of ruling the Thoughts, by how much
<pb facs="tcp:13862:81"/>
carnall Reason and fleshly wisedome, beares more sway heerein, and so giues more strength and warrant to the excesses thereof: so in this respect also the more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to be vndertaken, as being that wherein euen the best doe much faile in the wise temper thereof, and yet are very hardly brought to discerne their aberrations therein. For what one the one side through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the right Obiects whereon our affections are to be placed, and the right measure of Proportion to their Obiects: And on the other side, by reason of such collusions of carnall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, making good our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers therein: very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<pb facs="tcp:13862:81"/>
it is to obserue how easily many, other wise good men, haue beene miserably transported into these aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations either in the excesse or defect. As also how hardly they haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to the right temper againe: nay, not so much as to discerne wherein they haue fallen. May we not obserue both these true in</hi> Ionas <hi>his case? how easily fel he through ignorance, and selfe loue into a violent fit of rage, and how hardly was he reduced to see his error heerein. That which he should haue reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, in the truth of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Lord had mercie vpon that People, voiced to destruction: wee see proues an occasion,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:82"/>
through spirituall Pride and Selse-loue blinding of him; that I say, proued a meanes to make him euen burst with anger, not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God himselfe in his rage and furie: And with what great Patience doth the glorious Lord seeke to allay his heat? how hardly is he brought, so much as to the sight of his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but that he is still rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Iustifie his fumes, though it were to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of God himselfe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The like we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie in the other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And had wee not then great neede of some light to further vs heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, both that we may see our owne errors heerein, and
<pb facs="tcp:13862:82"/>
also be gratiously enabled to moderate the same. Accept then I pray you my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour heerein: And in the feare of God make vse of such directions as are affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereunto. I doubt not but as thou shalt perceiue a right ayme heerein, so thou wilt not measure the truth of God by my infirmities, but rather take occasion heereby to glorifie God the more, if that his power shall any whit shine throughout such mists of humane corruption. In the conclusion of my last Booke howsoeuer I may be censured to giue way to too much passion, yet for mine owne part, I blesse God with my soule, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mee so much Patience,
<pb facs="tcp:13862:83"/>
as that when I might haue righted my selfe by deeds to the vtter wracke of such who haue sought by slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and desperate practises my vtter vndoing. It hath pleased my gratious God so to guide me therein, as only to giue them a generall</hi> Item <hi>of their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, that so they may be brought to Repentance: which as I doe heartily pray for, so my endeauour by Gods mercie shall be to watch ouer my affections with more heede and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: that so I may keepe my peace more comfortably with my God, howsoeuer I make account still to be more and more encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by vnreasonable men.
<pb facs="tcp:13862:83"/>
And so I desire thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to walke after the same Rule, labouring so farre as possibly thou maiest to be at Peace with all men, by possessing thy soule in patience and ouercomming euill with good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so I commend thee (heartily) to the Grace of God: wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to expect shortly as heere a generall directs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Affections in generall: so a particular discouery of each Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their liuely collours, that so thou maiest bee furnished with what may particularly informe thee heerein, and thereby bee enabled to walke peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with God and Men,
