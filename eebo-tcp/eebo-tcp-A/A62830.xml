            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>In all Humility Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners cannot but acknowledge themſelves a ſeduced and miſled People, who through the Temptations of Satan, and his Grand Inſtruments Sir <hi>Harry Vane</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> have choſe unto themſelves new paths to walk in, and have gone aſtray from the good Old Road of Submiſſion and Obedience, and have rackt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences upon the Tenter-hooks of my Lord <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Valour: That the aforeſaid Hectors ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt their deſign, have left us a wretched and confuſed Multitude, And having not the fear of God before our eyes, we did attempt to diſturb the peace of this Commonwealth, and in order thereunto, we do confeſs we did provide Arms and Ammunition for the private Seizing and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Honourable City of <hi>London,</hi> and likewiſe of your Honours, with a Reſolved intent (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our old received Principles) to overturn the Seat of Magiſtracy, and invade the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Function with the profundity of our own conceited Doctrine, (invented by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>) and to lay waſt their dwelling places and to level their Churches with the Ground.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as we have failed in theſe our Damned Plots and Contrivances, and that we find no bleſſing to attend unrighteous Actions; and whereas ſince our leaving off our <hi>Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> Divinity, and praying Blind-fold for the Proſperity of what we deſired, we find that we have no anſwer either by our Urim and Thummim, or Enthuſiaſm, which is our wonted way of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving anſwers to what we ask; but Confuſion hath overtaken our intents, and we are now left to your Honours Mercy and Indulgence, without which we can neither think our ſelves ſafe, nor reckon our Lives for our own.</p>
            <p>We therefore moſt humbly implore your Honours, (after your conſideration what uſeful Members We have been to this Nation:)</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the perſons taken in this our Defection may be tryed for their Cenſpiracy by a Jury of Twelve men, the <hi>Hangman</hi> being Foreman; the favour of whoſe Function we queſtion nos but we ſhall receive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Capt. <hi>Kiffin</hi> (that ſweet PREACHER upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Canticles) may have liberty to make his Recantation in his own Synagogue near <hi>Tower-ſtreet;</hi> and that <hi>H. Hills</hi> may aſſiſt him in the Work, out of his elaborate piece of Repentance for Adultery, Entituled, <hi>The Prodigal ſon retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Fathers houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the ſteel-Swords and Knives taken from your Petitioners may be converted into Plow-ſhares and Pruning-books, thereby to induce the Countrey to pardon our paſt-offences; and that ſuch Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be made at your Petitioners proper Coſts and Charges.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That We have liberty granted by your Honours to perſevere in our Religious diſpenſations; we being willing to give ample ſecurity for our future good behaviour; as likewiſe to pray for the New Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, as we have done for you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That an Act of Indempnity may paſſe for ſuch of us as your Honours think, good to have hang'd: And that <hi>Patience,</hi> our Orthodox preaching Taylor, may accompany them to the place of Execution.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Trained Bands of <hi>London</hi> may be diſcharged their Duty of Watching and Warding, We being now both ready and willing to render Obedience to your Commands, We having now tryed all things, deſire to hold faſt that which is good.</p>
            <closer>Theſe our humble Requeſts being granted, Your Petitioners ſhall dayly Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
