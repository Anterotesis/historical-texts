            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     </hi> Have now by the assistance of God, and the advantages of your many favours, finished a <hi>Year of Sermons;</hi> which if, like the first year of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours preaching, it may be <hi>annus acceptabilis,</hi> an <hi>acceptable year</hi> to God, and his afflicted hand-maid the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a reliefe to some of her new necessities, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution or assistance to any soule; I shall esteem it among those honors and blessings, with which God uses to reward those good intentions which himselfe first puts into our hearts, and then recompenses upon our heads.

God, that your Family is like <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece, <hi>irriguous</hi> with a dew from heaven, when much of the <hi>voicinage</hi> is dry; for we have cause to remember that <hi>Isaac</hi> complain'd of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> who fill'd up his wells with stones, and rubbish, and left no beauvrage for the Flocks; and therefore they could give no milke to them that waited upon the Flocks, and the flocks could not be gathered, nor fed, nor defended. It was a designe of ruine, and had in it the greatest hostility; and so it hath been lately;</p>

                  <p>But, My Lord, this is not all: I would faine also complaine that men feele not their greatest evill, and are not sensible of their danger, nor covetous of what they want, nor strive for that which is forbidden them; but that this complaint would suppose an unnaturall evill to rule in the hearts of men; For who would have in him so little of a Man, as not to be greedy of the Word of God, and of holy Ordinances, even therefore because they are so hard to have? and this evill, although it can have no excuse, yet it hath a great and a certain cause;
<pb facs="tcp:50231:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the Word of God still creates new appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, as it satisfies the old; and enlarges the capacity, as it fils the first propensities of the Spirit. For all Spirituall blessings are seeds of Immortality, and of infinite felicities, they swell up to the comprehensions of Eternity; and the desires of the soule can never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but when they are decayed; as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will be craving every day, unlesse it be sick and abused. But every mans experience tels him now, that because men have not Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, they lesse desire it; their long fasting makes them not to love their meat; and so wee have cause to feare, the people will fall to an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> then to a loathing of holy food, and then Gods anger will follow the method of our sinne, and send a famine of the Word and Sacraments. This we have the greatest reason to feare, and this feare can be relieved by nothing but by notices and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the greatnesse of the Divine mercies and goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>Against this danger in future, and evill in present, as you and all good men interpose their prayers, so have I added this little instance of my care and services; being willing to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in all offices and varieties of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that so I may <hi>by all meanes save some,</hi> and confirme others; or at least, that my selfe may be accepted of God in my desiring it.
<pb facs="tcp:50231:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And I thinke I have some reasons to expect a speciall mercy in this, because I finde by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Divine providence, and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall affaires, that all the great necessities of the Church have been served by the zeale of preaching in publick, and other holy ministeries in publick or private, as they could be had. By this the Apostles planted the Church, and the primitive Bishops supported the faith of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> and the hardinesse of <hi>Confessors,</hi> and the austerity of the <hi>Retired.</hi> By this they confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Hereticks, and evill livers, and taught them the wayes of the Spirit, and left them without pertinacy, or without excuse. It was Preaching that restored the splendour of the Church, when Barbarisme, and Warres, and Ignorance either sate in, or broke the Doctors Chaire in pieces: For then it was that divers Orders of <hi>religious,</hi> and especially of <hi>Preachers</hi> were erected; God inspiring into whole companies of men a zeal of Preaching: And by the same instrument God restored the beauty of the Church, when it was necessary shee should be reformed; it was the assiduous and learned preaching of those whom God chose for his Ministers in that work, that wrought the Advantages and persuaded those Truths, which are the <hi>enamel</hi> and beautie of our Churches. And because by the same meanes all things are preserved, by which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, it cannot but be certaine, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:50231:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
state of the Church requires a greater care and prudence in this Ministerie then ever; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since by Preaching some endevour to supplant Preaching, and by intercepting the fruits of the flocks to dishearten the Shepheards from their attendances.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, your great noblenesse and religious charitie hath taken from mee some portions of that glory which I designed to my selfe in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> towards the <hi>Corinthian Church;</hi> who esteemed it his honour to preach to them without a revenue; and though also like him I have a trade, by which as I can be more usefull to others, and lesse burthensome to you, yet to you also under God, I owe the quiet and the opportunities and circumstances of that, as if God had so interweaved the support of my affaires with your charitie, that he would have no advantages passe upon mee, but by your interest; and that I should expect no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the issues of my Calling, unlesse your Lordship have a share in the blessing.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I give God thanks that my lot is fallen so fairely, and that I can serve your Lordship in that ministerie, by which I am bound to serve God, and that my <hi>gratitude</hi> and my <hi>duty</hi> are bound up in the same bundle; but now, that which was <hi>yours</hi> by a right of propriety, I have made publick, that it may still be more <hi>yours,</hi> and you derive to your

                  <p>My Lord, in these Sermons I have medled with no mans interest, that onely excepted, which is <hi>Eternall;</hi> but if any mans vice was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, I have done it with as much severitie as I ought; some cases of Conscience I have here determined; but the speciall designe of the whole, is to describe the greater lines of Dutie, by speciall arguments: and if any <hi>witty Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> shall say, that I tell him nothing but what he knew before; I shall be contented with it, and rejoyce that he was so well instructed, and wish also that he needed not a <hi>Remembrancer:</hi> but if either in the first, or in the second; in the institution of some, or the reminding of others, I can doe God any service; no man ought to be offended, that Sermons are not like curious <hi>inquiries</hi> after <hi>New-nothings,</hi> but <hi>pursuances</hi> of <hi>Old truths.</hi> However, I have already

                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ertue and Vice are so essentially distinguished, and the distinction is so necessary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in order to the well being of men, in private, and in societies, that to divide them in themselves, and to separate them by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient notices, and to distinguish them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, hath been designed by all Laws, by the sayings of wise men, by the order of things, by their proportions to good or evill; and the expectations of men have been fram'd accordingly; that Vertue may have a proper seat in the will and in the affections, and may become <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> amiable by its own excellency and its appendant blessing; and that Vice may be as naturall an enemy to a man as a Wolf to the Lamb, and as darknesse to light; destructive of its being, and a contradiction of its nature. But it is not enough that all the world hath armed it self against Vice, and by all that is wise and sober amongst men, hath taken the part of Vertue, adorning it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50231:9"/>
with glorious appellatives, encouraging it by rewards, entertaining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it with sweetnesses, and commanding it by edicts, fortifying it with defensatives, and twining with it in all artificiall compliances; all this is short of mans necessity; for this will in all modest men secure their actions in Theatres, and High-wayes, in Markets, and Churches, before the eye of Judges, and in the society of Witnesses. But the actions of closets and chambers, the designs and thoughts of men, their discourses in dark places, and the actions of retirements and of the night, are left indifferent to Vertue or to Vice; and of these, as man can take no cognisance, so he can make no coercitive; and therefore above one half of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> humane actions is by the Laws of man left unregarded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for: and besides this, there are some men who are big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then Lawes, and some are bigger then Judges, and some Judges have lessened themselves by fear and cowardize, by bribery and flattery, by iniquity and complyance; and where they have not, yet they have notices but of few causes; and there are some sins so popular and universall, that to punish them is either impossible or intolerable; and to question such, would betray the weaknesse of the publick rods and axes, and represent the sinner to be stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the power that is appointed to be his bridle; and after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all this, we finde sinners so prosperous, that they escape, so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that they fear not, and sin is made safe when it growes great,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Facere omnia saevè</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>and innocence is oppressed, and the poor cry, and he hath no helper; and he is oppressed, and he wants a Patron: and for these and many other concurrent causes, if you reckon all the causes that come before all the Judicatories of the world, though the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> litigious are too many, and the matters of <hi>instance</hi> are intricate and numerous, yet the personall and criminall are so few, that of 20000 sins that cry aloud to God for vengeance, scarce two are noted by the publick eye and chastis'd by the hand of Justice; it must follow from hence, that it is but reasonable for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of vertue and the necessities of the world, that the private should be judg'd, and vertue should be tyed upon the spirit, and the poor should be relieved, and the oppressed should appeal, and the noise of Widows should be heard, and the Saints should stand upright, and the Cause that was ill judged should be judged over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> again, and Tyrants should be call'd to account, and our thoughts should be examined, and our secret actions view'd on all sides, and the infinite number of sins which escape here should not escape finally; and therefore God hath so ordained it, that there shall be a day of doom wherein all that are let alone by men shall be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50231:9"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> question'd by God, and every word and every action shall receive its just recompence of reward. <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>

                     </gap>, because these are the acts of the man in the state of conjunction with the body. The words have in them no other difficulty or variety, but contain a great truth of the biggest interest, and one of the most materiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive Articles of the whole Religion, and the greatest endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our duty in the whole world. Things are so ordered by the great Lord of all the creatures, that whatsoever we do or suffer shall be call'd to account, and this account shall be exact, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and the sentence shall be just, and the reward shall be great; all the evils of the world shall be amended, and the injustices shall be repaid, and the divine Providence shall be vindicated, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice shall for ever be remark'd by their separate dwellings and rewards.</p>
                  <p>This is that which the Apostle in the next verse cals <hi>the terror of the Lord; it is his terror,</hi> because himself shall appear in his dresse of Majesty and robes of Justice, and <hi>it is his terror,</hi> because it is of all the things in the World the most formidable in it self, and it is most fearfull to us: where shall be acted the interest and finall sentence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> eternity; and because it is so intended, I shall all the way represent it as <hi>the Lords terror,</hi> that we may be afraid of sin, for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which <hi>this terror</hi> is intended. 1. Therefore we will consider <note place="margin">1.</note> the persons that are to be judged, with the circumstances of our advantages or our sorrowes: <hi>[We must all appear.]</hi> 2. The Judge <note place="margin">2.</note> and his Judgement seat: <hi>[before the Judgment seat of Christ.]</hi> 3.

                  <p n="1">1. The persons who are to be judged: even you, and I, and all the world: Kings and Priests, Nobles and Learned, the Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Easie, the Wise and the Foolish, the Rich and the Poor, the prevailing Tyrant and the oppressed Party shall all appear to receive ther Symbol; and this is so farre from abating any thing

of its terror and our dear concernment, that it much increases it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for although concerning Precepts and Discourses we are apt to neglect in particular what is recommended in generall, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidencies of Mortality and sad events the singularity of the chance heightens the apprehension of the evill; yet it is so by accident and only in regard of our imperfection; it being an effect of self-love or some little creeping envie which adheres too often to the infortunate and miserable; or else because the sorrow is apt to increase by being apprehended to be a rare case and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular unworthinesse in him who is afflicted, otherwise then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the sons of men, companions of his sin, and brethren of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his nature, and partners of his usuall accidents; yet in finall and extreme events the multitude of sufferers does not lessen but increase the sufferings; and when <hi>the first day of Judgement</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that (I mean) of the universall deluge of waters upon the old World, the calamity swell'd like the floud, and every man saw his friend perish, and the neighbours of his dwelling, and the relatives of his house, and the sharers of his joyes, and yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies bride, and the new born heir, the Priest of the Family, and the honour of the Kindred, all dying or dead, drench'd in water and the divine vengeance; and then they had no place to flee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no man cared for their souls; they had none to goe unto for counsell, no sanctuary high enough to keep them from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance that rain'd down from heaven: and so it shall be at the day of Judgement, when that world and this and all that shall be born hereafter, shall passe through the same Red sea, and be all baptized with the same fire, and be involv'd in the same cloud, in which shall be thundrings and terrors infinite; every Mans fear shall be increased by his neighbours shriekes, and the amazement that all the world shall be in, shall unite as the sparks of a raging furnace into a globe of fire, and roul upon its own principle, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> increase by direct appearances, and intolerable reflexions. He that stands in a Church-yard in the time of a great plague, and hears the Passing-bell perpetually telling the sad stories of death, and sees crowds of infected bodies pressing to their Graves, and others sick and tremulous, and Death dress'd up in all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of sorrow round about him, is not supported in his spirit by the variety of his sorrow: and at Dooms-day, when the terrors are universall, besides that it is in it self so much greater because it can affright the whole world, it is also made greater by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and a sorrowfull influence; Grief being then strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> infectious: when there is no variety of state but an intire Kingdome of fear; and amazement is the King of all our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the world its subjects: and that shricke must needs be terrible, when millions of Men and Women at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant shall fearfully cry out, and the noise shall mingle with the

But this generall consideration may be hightned with four or five circumstances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider what an infinite multitude of Angels and Men and Women shall then appear; it is a huge assembly when the Men of one Kingdome, the Men of one Age in a single Province are gathered togother into heaps and confusion of disorder; But then all Kingdomes of all ages, all the Armies that ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> mustered, all that World that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> taxed, all those hundreds of Millions that were slain in all the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars from <hi>Numa</hi>'s time till <hi>Italy</hi> was broken into Principalities and small <hi>Exarchats,</hi> all these, and all that can come into numbers, and that did descend from the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> shall at once be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; to which account if we adde the Armies of Heaven, the nine orders of blessed Spirits, and the infinite numbers in every order, we may suppose the numbers fit to expresse the Majesty of that God, and the terror of that Judge, who is the Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all that unimaginable multitude. <hi>Eritterror ingens tot simul</hi>

There we shall see all those good men whom God sent to preach to us, and recall us from humane follies and inhumane practises: and when we espie the good man that chid us for our last drunkennesse or adulteries, it shall then also be remembred how we mocked at counsell, and were civilly modest at the reproof, but laugh'd when the man was gone, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> accepted it for a religious complement, and took our leaves and went and did the same again. But then things shall put on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face, and what we smil'd at here, and slighted fondly, shall then be the greatest terror in the world; Men shall feel that they once laugh'd at their own destruction, and rejected health when it was offered by a man of God upon no other condition, but that they would be wise, and not be in love with death. Then they shall perceive, that if they had obeyed an easie and a sober counsell, they had been partners of the same felicity which they see so illustrious upon the heads of those Preachers <hi>whose</hi>

regard: but that work which he crowns in them he purposed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> should be effective to us, perswasive to the understanding, and active upon our consciences. Good Preachers by their Doctrine, and all good men by their lives are the accusers of the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and they shall rise up from their seats, and judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the follies of those who thought their piety to be want of courage, and their discourses pedanticall, and their reproofs the Priests trade, but of no signification, because they prefer'd moments before eternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There in that great assembly shall be seen all those Converts who upon easier terms, and fewer miracles, and a lesse experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and a younger grace, and a seldomer Preaching, and more unlikely circumstances have suffered the work of God to prosper upon their spirits, and have been obedient to the heavenly calling.

Concerning this no answer can be made.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But there is a worse sight then this yet, which in that great assembly shall distract our sight and amaze our spirits. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> men shall meet the partners of their sins, and them that drank the round when they crown'd their heads with folly and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and their cups with wine and noises.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> evill interest, by power or craft, by witty discourses or deep dissembling, by scandall or a snare, by evill example or perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious counsell, by malice or unwarinesse; and when all this is summ'd up, and from the variety of its particulars is drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an uneasie load and a formidable summe, possibly we may finde sights enough to scare all our confidences, and arguments enough to presse our evill souls into the sorrowes of a most intolerable death. For however we make now but light accounts and evill proportions concerning it, yet it will be a fearfull circumstance of appearing, to see one, or two, or ten, or twenty accursed souls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> despairing, miserable, infinitely miserable, roaring and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and fearfully cursing thee as the cause of its eternall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. Thy lust betray'd and rifled her weak unguarded inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; thy example made thy servant confident to lye, or to be perjur'd; thy society brought a third into intemperance and the disguises of a beast; and when thou seest that soul with whom thou didst sin drag'd into hell, well maist thou fear to drink the dregs of thy intolerable potion; And most certainly it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of evils to destroy a soul for whom the Lord Jesus dyed, and to undoe that grace which our Lord purchased with so much sweat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and bloud, pains and a mighty charity. And because very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sins, are sins of society and confederation; such are fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drunkennesse, bribery, simony, rebellion, schisme, and many others; it is a hard and a weighty consideration what shall become of any one of us who have tempted our Brother or Sister to sin and death: for though God hath spar'd our life, and they are dead and their debt-books are sealed up till the day of account, yet the mischief of our sin is gone before us, and it is like a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but more execrable, the soul is dead in trespasses and sins, and sealed up to an eternall sorrow, and thou shalt see at Dooms-day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> what damnable uncharitablenesse thou hast done. That soul that cryes to those rocks to cover her, if it had not been for thy perpetuall temptations, might have followed the Lamb in a white robe; and that poor man that is cloathed with shame and flames of fire, would have shin'd in glory, but that thou didst force him to be partner of thy basenesse. And who shall pay for this losse? a soul is lost by thy means; thou hast defeated the holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of the Lord's bitter passion by thy impurities; and what shall happen to thee by whom thy Brother dies eternally? Of all the considerations that concern this part of the horrors of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Dooms-day nothing can be more formidable then this, to such whom it does concern: and truly it concerns so many, and amongst so many, perhaps some persons are so tender, that it might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright their hopes and discompose their industries and spritefull labours of repentance; but that our most mercifull Lord hath in the midst of all the fearfull circumstances of his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50231:12"/>
interwoven this one comfort relating to this, which to my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sense seems the most fearfull and killing circumstance: Two shall be grinding at one mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two shall be in a bed; the one shall be taken, and the other left; that is, those who are confederate in the same fortunes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and actions, may yet have a different sentence: for an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and an active repentance will wash off this account, and put it upon the tables of the Crosse; and though it ought to make us diligent and carefull, charitable and penitent, hugely penitent, even so long as we live, yet when we shall appear together, there is a mercy that shall there separate us, who sometimes had blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> each other in a common crime. Blessed be the mercies of of God, who hath so carefully provided a fruitfull shower of grace to refresh the miseries and dangers of the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was used to beg of God that he might never be tempted from his low fortune to Prelacies and dignities Ecclesiasticall; and that his minde might never be discomposed or polluted with the love of any creature; and that he might by some instrument or other understand the state of his deceased Brother; and the story sayes, that he was heard in all: In him it was a great curiosity, or the passion and impertinencies of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> uselesse charity to search after him, unlesse he had some other personall concernment, then his relation of kindred. But truly, it would concern very many to be solicitous concerning the event of those souls with whom we have mingled death and sin; for many of those sentences which have passed and decreed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our departed relatives, will concern us dearly, and we are bound in the same bundles, and shall be thrown into the same fires, unlesse we repent for our own sins, and double our sorrows for their damnation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We may consider that this infinite multitude of men and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> women, Angels and Devils, is not ineffective as a number in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Tables, but must needs have influence upon every spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that shall there appear. For the transactions of that court are not like Orations spoken by a <hi>Grecian</hi> Orator in the circles of his people, heard by them that croud nearest him, or that sound li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the circles of aire, or the inclosure of a wall; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is represented to every person, and then let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, when thy shame and secret turpitude, thy midnight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and secret hypocrisies, thy lustfull thoughts, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous designes, thy falshood to God and startings from thy holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> promises, thy follies and impieties shall be laid open before all the world, and that then shall be spoken by the trumpet of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell upon the house top, the highest battlements of Heaven, all those filthy words and lewd circumstances which thou didst act secretly, thou wilt find that thou wilt have reason strangely to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50231:12"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be ashamed. All the wise men in the world shall know how vile thou hast been: and then consider; with what confusion of face wouldst thou stand in the presence of a good man and a severe, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he should suddenly draw thy curtain, and finde thee in the sins of shame and lust; it must be infinitely more, when God and all the Angels of heaven and earth, all his holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads, and all his redeemed Saints shall stare and wonder at thy impurities and follies. I have read a story that a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being passionately by his mother disswaded from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the severe courses of a religious and single life, broke from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> her importunity by saying, <hi>Volo servare animam meam, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by all means to save my soul.</hi> But when he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a rule with passion, he performed it carelesly and remifly, and was but lukewarm in his Religion, and quickly proceeded to a melancholy and wearied spirit, and from thence to a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the neighbourhood of death; but falling into an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and a phantastick vision, dream'd that he saw himself sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before Gods angry throne, and from thence hurryed into a place of torments, where espying his Mother, full of scorn she upbraided him with his former answer, and asked him, <hi>Why he</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>did not save his soul, by all means,</hi> according as he undertook. But when the sick man awaked and recovered, he made his words good indeed, and prayed frequently, and fasted severely, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured humbly, and conversed charitably, and mortified himself severely, and refused such secular solaces which other good men received to refresh and sustain their infirmities, and gave no other account to them that asked him but this: If I could not in my extasie or dream endure my Mothers upbraiding my follies and weak Religion, how shall I be able to suffer, that God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargue me at Dooms-day, and the Angels reproach my luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the Devils aggravate my sins, and all the Saints of God deride my follies and hypocrisies? The effect of that mans consideration may serve to actuate a meditation in every one of us: for we shall all be at that passe, that unlesse our shame and sorrowes be cleansed by a timely repentance, and cover'd by the Robe of Christ, we shall suffer the anger of God, the scorn of Saints and Angels, and our own shame in the generall assembly of all mankind. This argument is most considerable to them who are tender of their precious name and sensible of honour; if they rather would chuse death then a disgrace, poverty rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then shame, let them remember that a sinfull life will bring them to an intolerable shame at that day, when all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in heaven and earth shall be summon'd as witnesses and parties in a fearfull scrutiny. The summe is this; All that are born of <hi>Adam</hi> shall appear before God and his Christ, and all the innumerable companies of Angels and Devils shall be there:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50231:13"/>
and the wicked shall be afrighted with every thing they see; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and there they shall see those good men that taught them the waies of life, and all those evill persons whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have tempted into the waies of death, and those who were converted upon easier termes, and some of these shall shame the wicked, and some shall curse them, and some shall upbraid them, and all shall amaze them, and yet this is but the <gap reason="foreign">

Christ who is our Saviour, and is our Advocate, shall then be our Judge, and that will strangely change our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and all the face of things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That's then the place and state of our appearance, <hi>Before the Judgement seat of Christ:]</hi> For Christ shall rise from the right hand of his Father, he shall descend towards us and ride upon a cloud, and shall make himself illustrious by a glorious Majesty, and an innumerable retinue and circumstances of terror and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power: and this is that which <hi>Origen</hi> affirms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be the sign of the Son of Man. <hi>Remalcus de Vaux in Harpocrate divino</hi> affirms that all the Greek and Latine Fathers <hi>consentientibus animis asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, hoc signo Crucem Christi significari,</hi> do unanimously affirm that the representment of the Crosse, is the sign of the Son of Man spoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. And indeed they affirm it very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, but <hi>Origen</hi> after his manner is singular, <hi>hoc signum Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis erit, cum Dominus ad judicandum venerit,</hi> so the Church used to sing, and so it is in the Sibyls verses;</p>
                  <l>O lignum felix in quo Deus ipse pependit,</l>
                  <l>Nec te terra capit, sed coeli tecta videbis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

                  <l>Cum renovata Dei facies ignita micabit.</l>
                  <p>The sign of the Crosse is that sign of the Son of Man, when the Lord shall come to Judgement: and from those words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture [They shall look on him whom they have pierced] it hath been freely entertain'd at the day of Judgement, Christ shall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his person by something that related to his passion, his crosse, or his wounds, or both. I list not to spin this curious cobweb; but <hi>Origen</hi>'s opinion seems to me more reasonable; and it is more agreeable to the Majesty and Power of Christ to signifie himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with proportions of his glory rather then of his humility, with effects of his being exalted into Heaven, rather then of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and sorrowes upon Earth; and this is countenanced better by some Greek copies; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Majesty of the Judge, and the terrors of the Judgement shall bee spoken aloud by the immediate forerunning accidents, which shall bee so great violences to the old constitutions of Nature, that it shall break her very bones, and disorder her till shee be destroyed.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 1. IF we consider the person of the Judge, we first perceive that he is interested in the injury of the crimes he is to sentence. <hi>Videbunt quem crucifixerunt,</hi> and <hi>they shal look on him whom they have pierced.</hi> It was for thy sins that the Judge did suffer such unspeakable pains as were enough to reconcile all the world to God: The summe and spirit of which pains could not be better understood then by the consequence of his own words, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> meaning, that he felt such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pure, unmingled sorrowes, that although his humane nature was personally united to the Godhead, yet at that instant he felt no comfortable emanations by sensible perception from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but he was so drenched in sorrow, that the Godhead see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have forsaken him. Beyond this, nothing can be added: but then, that thou hast for thy own particular made all this in vain and ineffective, that Christ thy Lord and Judge should be tormented for nothing, that thou wouldst not accept felicity and pardon when he purchased them at so dear a price, must needs be an infinite condemnation to such persons. How shalt thou look <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> upon him that fainted and dyed for love of thee, and thou didst scorn his miraculous mercies? How shall we dare to behold that holy face that brought salvation to us, and we turned away and fell in love with death, and kissed deformity and sins? and yet in the beholding that face consists much of the glories of eternity. All the pains and passions, the sorrowes and the groans, the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and poverty, the labours and the watchings, the Prayers and the Sermons, the miracles and the prophecies, the whip and the nails, the death and the buriall, the shame and the smart, the Crosse and the grave of Jesus shall be laid upon thy score, if thou hast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> refused the mercies and design of all their holy ends and purposes. And if we remember what a calamity that was which broke the Jewish Nation in pieces, when Christ came to judge them for their murdering him who was their King and the Prince of life, and consider that this was but a dark image of the terrors of the day of Judgement, we may then apprehend that there is some
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50231:16"/>
strange unspeakable evill that attends them that are guilty of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> death, and of so much evill to their Lord. Now it is certain if thou wilt not be saved by his death, you are guilty of his death; if thou wilt not suffer him to save thee, thou art guilty of destroying him; and then let it be considered what is to be expected from that Judge before whom you stand as his murtherer and betrayer. * But this is but half of this consideration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ may be <hi>crucified again,</hi> and upon a new account <hi>put to an open shame.</hi> For after that Christ had done all this by the direct acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Priestly Office, of sacrificing himself for us, he hath also done very many things for us which are also the fruits of his first love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and prosecutions of our redemption. I will not instance in the strange arts of mercy that our Lord uses to bring us to live holy lives; But I consider, that things are so ordered, and so great a value set upon our souls since they are the images of God, and redeemed by the Bloud of the holy Lamb, that the salvation of our souls is reckoned as a part of Christs reward, a part of the glorification of his humanity. Every sinner that repents causes joy to Christ, and the joy is so great that it runs over and wets the fair brows and beauteous locks of Cherubims and Seraphims, and all the Angels have a part of that banquet; Then it is that our blessed Lord feels the fruits of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> holy death, the acceptation of his holy sacrifice, the graciousnesse of his person, the return of his prayers. For all that Christ did or suffer'd, and all that he now does as a Priest in heaven, is to glorifie his Father by bringing souls to God: For this it was that he was born and dyed, that he descended from heaven to earth, from life to death, from the crosse to the grave; this was the purpose of his resurrection and ascension, of the end and design of all the miracles and graces of God manifested to all the world by him; and now what man is so vile, such a malicious fool, that will refuse to bring joy to his Lord by doing himself the greatest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> good in the world? They who refuse to do this, are said to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the Lord of life again, and put him to an open shame:</hi> that is, they, as much as in them lies, bring Christ from his glorious joyes to the labours of his life, and the shame of his death; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his enemies, and refuse to advance the Kingdome of their Lord; they put themselves in that state in which they were when Christ came to dye for them; and now that he is in a state that he may rejoyce over them, (for he hath done all his share towards it) every wicked man takes his head from the blessing, and rather chuses that the Devill should rejoyce in his destruction, then that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his Lord should triumph in his felicity. And now upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these premises, we may imagine that it will be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite amazement to meet that Lord to be our Judge whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we have murdered, whose honour we have disparaged, whose purposes we have destroyed, whose joyes we have lessened, whose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50231:16"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> passion we have made ineffectuall, and whose love we have tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under our profane and impious feet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But there is yet a third part of this consideration. As it will be inquir'd at the day of Judgement concerning the dishonours to the person of Christ, so also concerning the profession and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, and concerning his poor Members; for by these also we make sad reflexions upon our Lord. Every man that lives wickedly disgraces the religion and institution of Jesus, he discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages strangers from entring into it, he weakens the hands of them that are in already, and makes that the adversaries speak <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> reproachfully of the Name of Christ; but although it is certain our Lord and Judge will deeply resent all these things, yet there is one thing which he takes more tenderly, and that is, the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse of men towards his poor: It shall then be upbraided to them by the Judge, that himself was hungry and they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give meat to him that gave them his body and heart-bloud, to feed them and quench their thirst; that they denyed a robe to cover his nakednesse, and yet he would have cloathed their souls with the robe of his righteousnesse, lest their souls should be found naked in the day of the Lords visitation; and all this unkindnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is nothing but that evill men were uncharitable to their Brethren, they would not feed the hungry, nor give drink to the thirsty, nor cloath the naked, nor relieve their Brothers needs, nor forgive his follies, nor cover their shame, nor turn their eyes from deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their affronts and evill accidents; this is it which our Lord will take so tenderly, that his Brethren for whom he died, who suck'd the paps of his Mother, that fed on his Body and are nourished with his Bloud, whom he hath lodg'd in his heart and entertains in his bosome, the partners of his Spirit and co-heirs of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, that these should be deny'd relief and suffered to go away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ashamed, and unpitied; this our blessed Lord will take so ill, that all those who are guilty of this unkindnesse, have no reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the favour of the Court.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To this if we adde the almightinesse of the Judge, his infinite wisdome and knowledge of all causes, and all persons, and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that he is infinitely just, inflexibly angry, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in his sentence, there can be nothing added either to the greatness or the requisites of a terrible and an Almighty Judge. For who can resist him who is Almighty? Who can evade his scrutiny that knows all things? Who can hope for pity of him that is inflexible? Who can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> think to be exempted when the Judge is righteous and impartial? But in all these annexes of the great Judge, that which I shal now remark, is that indeed which hath terror in it, and that is, the severity of our Lord. For then is the day of vengeance and recompenses, and no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at all shall be shewed, but to them that are the sons of mercy; for the other, their portion is such as can be expected from these premises.</p>

1. If we remember the instances of Gods severity in this life, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in the daies of mercy and repentance, in those dayes when Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment waits upon Mercy, and receives lawes by the rules and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of pardon, and that for all the rare streams of loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse issuing out of Paradise and refreshing all our fields with a moisture more fruitfull then the flouds of <hi>Nilus,</hi> still there are mingled some stormes and violences, some fearfull instances of the Divine Justice, we may more readily expect it will be worse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worse at that day, when Judgement shall ride in triumph, and Mercy shall be the accuser of the wicked. But so we read, and are commanded to remember, because they are written for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that God destroyed at once five cities of the plain, and all the country, and <hi>Sodome</hi> and her sisters are <hi>set forth for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, suffering the vengeance of eternall fire.</hi> Fearfull it was when God destroyed at once 23000 for fornication, and an extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Angell in one night killed 185000 of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and the first born of all the families of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and for the sin of <hi>David</hi> in numbring the people threescore and ten thousand of the people dyed, and God sent ten tribes into captivity and eternall oblivion and indistinction from a common people for their idolatry. Did not God strike <hi>Corah</hi> and his company with fire from Heaven? and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the earth open'd and swallowed up the congregation of <hi>Abiram?</hi> And is not evill come upon all the world for one sin of <hi>Adam?</hi> Did not the anger of God break the nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> all in pieces with judgements so great, that no nation ever suffered the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none ever sin'd so? And at once it was done, that God in anger destroyed all the world, and eight persons only escaped the angry Baptisme of water, and yet this world is the time of mercy; God hath open'd here his Magazines, and sent his holy Son as the great channell and fountain of it too: here he delights in mercy, and in judgement loves to remember it, and it triumphs over all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his works, and God contrives instruments and accidents, chances and designs, occasions and opportunities for mercy: if therefore now the anger of God makes such terrible eruptions upon the wicked people that delight in sin, how great may we suppose that anger to be, how severe that Judgement, how terrible that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, how intolerable those inflictions which God reserves for the full effusion of indignation on the great day of vengeance?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may also guesse at it by this; if God upon all single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and in the midst of our sins, before they are come to the full, and sometimes in the beginning of an evill habit be so fierce in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his anger, what can we imagine it to be, in that day when the wicked are to drink the dregs of that horrid potion, and count over all the particulars of their whole treasure of wrath? <hi>This is the</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. We may guesse at the severity of the Judge by the lesser strokes of that Judgement which he is pleased to send upon sinners in this world, to make them afraid of the horrible pains of Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: I mean the torments of an unquiet conscience, the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confusions of some sins and some persons. For I have sometimes seen persons surpriz'd in a base action, and taken in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> circumstances of crafty theft, and secret unjustices before their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse was ready; They have changed their colour, their speech hath faltered, their tongue stammer'd, their eyes did wander and fix no where, till shame made them sink into their hollow eye-pits to retreat from the images and circumstances of discovery; their wits are lost, their reason uselesse, the whole order of their soul is discomposed, and they neither see, nor feel, nor think as they use to do, but they are broken into disorder by a stroke of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a lesser stripe of hell; but then if you come to observe a guilty and a base murtherer, a condemned traytor, and see him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> harrassed first by an evill conscience, and then pull'd in pieces by the hangmans hooks, or broken upon sorrows and the wheel, we may then guesse (as well as we can in this life) what the pains of that day shall be to accursed souls: But those we shall consider afterwards in their proper scene; now only we are to estimate the severity of our Judge by the intolerablenesse of an evill conscience; if guilt will make a man despair, and despair will make a man mad, confounded and dissolved in all the regions of his senses and more noble faculties, that he shall neither feel, nor hear, nor see any thing but spectres and illusions, devils and frightfull dreams, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and hear noises, and shriek fearfully, and look pale and distracted like a hopelesse man from the horrors and confusions of a lost battell upon which all his hopes did stand, then the wicked must at the day of Judgement expect strange things and fearfull, and such which now no language can expresse, and then no patience can endure. <gap reason="foreign">

For it will, it must needs be a fearfull exprobration of our unworthinesse, when the Judge himself shall bear witnesse against us, that the wisdome of God himself was strangely imployed in bringing us safely to felicity. I shall draw a short Scheme, which although it must needs be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short of what God hath done for us, yet it will be enough to shame us. *God did not only give his Son for an example, and <note place="margin">1.</note> the Son gave himself for a price for us, but both gave the holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Spirit to assist us in mighty graces, for the verifications of Faith, and the entertainments of Hope, and the increase and perseverance of Charity. *God gave to us a new nature, he put another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <note place="margin">2.</note> into us, a third part of a perfective constitution: we have the Spirit put into us, to be a part of us, as properly to produce acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a holy life, as the soul of man in the body does produce the naturall. *God hath exalted humane nature, and made it in <note place="margin">3.</note> the person of Jesus Christ, to sit above the highest seat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and <hi>the Angels</hi> are made <hi>ministring spirits,</hi> ever since their Lord became our Brother. *Christ hath by a miraculous Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Our conscience shall be our accuser,]</hi> but this signifies but these two things; 1. that we shall be condemned for the evils that we have done, and shall then remember; God by his power wiping away the dust from the tables of our memory, and taking off the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and the voluntary neglect and rude shufflings of our cases of conscience.

And <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> it signifies this also, that not only the Justice of God shall be confessed by us in our own shame and condemnation, but the evill of the sentence shall be received into us, to melt our bowels and to break our heart in pieces within us, because we are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our own death, and our own inhumane hands have torn our souls in pieces.

I remember S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tels of a good man who in his agony of death saw a phantasme of a noble and angelicall shape, who frowning and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry said to him, <hi>Pati timetis, exire non vultis, Quid faciam vobis?</hi> Ye cannot endure sicknesse, ye are troubled at the evils of the

Although this is apt to represent every mans condition more or lesse, yet concerning persons of wicked lives, it hath in it too many sad degrees of truth; they are impatient of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and justly fearfull of death, because they know not how to comfort themselves in the evill accidents of their lives; and their conscience is too polluted to take death for sanctuary, and to hope to have amends made to their condition by the sentence of the day of Judgement. Evill and sad is their condition who cannot be contented here, nor blessed hereafter; whose life is their misery, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and their conscience is their enemy, whose grave is their prison, and death their undoing, and the sentence of Dooms-day, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an intolerable condition.</p>

Man destroys his Brother, and destroyes himselfe, and confounds Governments, and raises Armies, and tempts to sin, and delights in it, and drinks drunk, and forgets his sorrow, and heaps up great estates, and raises a family and a name in the Annals, and makes others fear him,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and introduces new Religions, and confounds the old, and changeth Articles as his interest requires, and all this while God is silent, save that he is loud and clamorous with his holy precepts, and over-rules the event; but leaves the desires of men to their owne choice, and their course of life such as they generally choose. But then, God shall have his day too; the day of the Lord shall come, in which <hi>he</hi> shall speak, and no man shall answer, he shall speak in the voyce of thunder and fearfull noyses, and man shall doe no more as he please, but must suffer as he hath deserved. When <hi>Zedekiah</hi> reigned in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> persecuted the Prophets, and destroyed the interests of Religion, and put <hi>Jeremy</hi> into the Dungeon, God held his peace; save onely that he warned him of the danger, and told him of the disorder; but it was <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s day, and he was permitted to his pleasure. But when he was led in chains to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his eyes were put out with burning Basons and horrible circles of reflected fires, then was Gods day, and his voyce was the accent of a fearfull anger, that broke him all in pieces.

Every fox is crafty and mischievous, and if you gather a whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> herd of them there is not a good natur'd beast amongst them all; so it is with man; by nature he is <hi>the child of wrath,</hi> and by his manners he is the child of the Devill; wee call <hi>Christian,</hi> and wee dishonour our Lord, and we are Brethren, but we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and murther one another; it is a great degree of sanctity now a-days not to be so wicked as the worst of men; and wee live at the rate as if the best of men did design to themselves an easier condemnation; and as if the generality of men consider'd not concerning the degrees of death, but did beleeve that in hell no man shall perceive any ease or refreshment in being tormented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with a slower fire. For consider what <hi>we doe in the body;</hi> 12 or 14 years passe before we choose good or bad; and of that which remaines above halfe is spent in sleep and the needs of Nature; for the other halfe it is divided as the Stag was when the beasts went a hunting, the Lyon hath five parts of sixe: The businesse of the world takes so much of our remaining portion, that Religion and the service of God have not much time left that can be spar'd; and of that which can, if we consider how much is allowed to crafty arts of cousenage, to oppression and ambition, to greedy desires, and avaritious prosecutions, to the vanities of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our youth, and the proper sins of every age, to the meer idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of man and doing nothing, to his fantastick imaginations of greatnesse, and pleasures, of great and little devices, of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent law-suites and uncharitable treatings of our Brother; it will be intolerable when we consider that we are to stand or fall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, according to what we have done in the body. Gather it all together, and set it before thy eyes; <hi>Almes</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> are the summe of all thy good. Were thy prayers made in feare and holinesse, with passion and desire? Were they not made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, weakly, and wandringly, and abated with sins in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> greatest part of thy life? Didst thou pray with the same affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and labour as thou didst purchase thy estate? Have thy alms been more then thy oppressions, and according to thy power? and by what means didst thou judge concerning it? How much of our time was spent in that? and how much of our estate was spent in this? But let us goe one step further: How many of us love our enemies? or pray for, and doc good to them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute and affront us? or overcome evill with good, or turn the face again to them that strike us, rather then be reveng'd? or suffer our selves to be spoil'd or robbed without contention and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> uncharitable courses? or lose our interest rather then lose our charity?

These things are to be considered, for by <hi>our own words we stand or fall,</hi> that is, as in humane Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the confession of the party, and the contradiction of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or the failing in the circumstances of his story, are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> confidences or presumptions of law, by which Judges give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; so shall our words be, not onely the means of declaring a secret sentence, but a certain instrument of being absolved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But upon these premises, we see what reason we have to fear the sentence of that day, who have sinned with our tongues so often, so continually, that if there were no other actions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50231:25"/>
to be accounted for, we have enough in this account to make us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> die, and yet have committed so many evill actions that if our words were wholly forgotten, wee have infinite reason to feare concerning the event of that horrible sentence. The effect of which consideration is this, that we set a guard before our lips, and <hi>watch over our actions with a care, equall to that fear which shall be at Doomes-day, when we are to passe our sad accounts.</hi> But I have some considerations to interpose.</p>
                  <p>1. But (that the sadnesse of this may a little be relieved, and our <note place="margin">1.</note> endevours be encouraged to a timely care and repentance) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that this great sentence, although it shall passe concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>little things,</hi> yet it shall not passe by <hi>little portions,</hi> but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall measures; not by the little errors of one day, but by the great proportions of our life; for God takes not notice of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of honest persons that alwayes endevour to avoid every sin, but in little intervening instances are surprized; but he judges us by <hi>single actions,</hi> if they are <hi>great,</hi> and of <hi>evill effect;</hi> and by <hi>little small instances,</hi> if they be <hi>habituall.</hi> No man can take care concerning every minute; and therefore concerning it Christ will not passe sentence but by the discernible portions of our time, by <hi>humane</hi> actions, by things of choice and deliberation, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> generall precepts of care and watchfulnesse, this sentence shall be exacted. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The sentence of that day shall be passed, not by <note place="margin">2.</note> the proportions of an Angell, but by the measures of a Man; the first follies are not unpardonable, but may bee recovered; and the second are dangerous, and the third are more fatall; but nothing is unpardonable but perseverance in evill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The last Judgement shall bee transacted by the same <note place="margin">3.</note> Principles by which we are guided here: not by strange and secret propositions, or by the fancies of men, or by the subtilties of uselesse distinctions, or evill perswasions; not by the scruples of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the credulous, or the interest of sects, nor the proverbs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, nor the uncertain definitions of them that give laws to subjects by expounding the decrees of Princes; but by the plain rules of Justice, by the ten Commandements, by the first apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conscience, by the plain rules of Scripture, and the rules of an honest mind, and a certain Justice. So that by this restraint and limit of the finall sentence, we are secur'd we shall not fall by scruple or by ignorance, by interest or by faction, by false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of others, or invincible prejudice of our own, but we shall stand or fall by plain and easie propositions, by chastity or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> uncleannesse, by justice or unjustice, by robbery or restitution: and of this wee have a great testimony by our Judge and Lord himselfe; <hi>Whatsoever yee shall bind in earth shall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whatsoever yee loose shall be loosed there;</hi> that is, you shall stand or fall according to the Sermons of the Gospel, as the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Ministers of the Word are commanded to preach, so yee must live here, and so yee must be judged hereafter; yee must not look for that sentence by secret decrees or obscure doctrines, but by plain precepts and certain rules. But there are yet some more degrees of mercy. 4. That sentence shall passe upon us not after the measures of Nature, and possibilities, and utmost extents, <note place="margin">4.</note> but by the mercies of the Covenant; we shall be judged as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians rather then as men, that is, as persons to whom much is pardoned, and much is pityed, and many things are (not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, but consequently) indulged, and great helps are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and many remedies supplyed, and some mercies extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly conveyed, and their hopes enlarged upon the stock of an infinite mercy, that hath no bounds but our needs, our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and our proportions to glory. 5. The sentence is to be given by him that once dyed for us, and does now pray for us, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <note place="margin">5.</note> intercedes; and upon soules that he loves, and in the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of which himself hath a great interest, and increase of joy.

And he that chooses <hi>to do</hi> an evill, rather then <hi>suffer one,</hi> shall finde it but an ill exchange, that he deferred his <hi>little</hi> to change for a <hi>great one.</hi> I remember that a servant in the old Comedy did chuse to venture the lash ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to feel a present inconvenience, <hi>Quia illud aderat malum, istud aberat longiùs: illud erat praesens, huic erant dieculae:</hi> but this will be but an ill account, when the rods shall for the delay be turned into Scorpions, and from easie shall become intolerable. Better it is to suffer here, and to stay till the day of restitution for the good and the holy portion; for it will recompense both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for the suffering and the stay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how if the portion be bad?</hi> It shall be bad to the greatest part of mankinde; that's a fearfull consideration; the greatest part of men and women shall dwell in the portion of Devils to eternall ages. So that these portions are like the Prophets figs in the vision; the good are the best that ever were, and the worst are so bad that worse cannot be imagined. For though in hell the accursed souls shall have no worse then they have deserved, and there are not there overrunning measures as there are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore that the joyes of heaven are infinitely greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> joyes then the pains of hell are great pains, yet even these are a full measure to a full iniquity, pain above patience, sorrowes without ease, amazement without consideration, despair without the intervals of a little hope, indignation without the possession of any good, there dwels envie and confusion, disorder and sad remembrances, perpetuall woes and continuall shriekings, uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and all the evils of the soul. But if we will represent it in some orderly circumstances, we may consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That here, all the troubles of our spirits are little participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">1.</note> of a disorderly passion; A man desires earnestly, but he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

If this consideration be not too Metaphysicall, I am sure it is very sad, and it relies upon this; that as in heaven there are some holy Spirits whose crown is <hi>all love;</hi> and some in which the brightest jewell is <hi>understanding;</hi> some are <hi>purity,</hi> and some are <hi>holinesse</hi> to the Lord: so in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of sorrow, <hi>evill</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> have an essence and proper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being, and are set there to be suffer'd intirely by every undone man that dies there for ever.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Know not which is the greater wonder, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> either that prayer, which is a duty so easie and facile, so ready and apted to the powers, and skill, and opportunities of every man, should have so great effects, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of such mighty blessings; or that we should be so unwilling to use so easie an instrument of procuring so much good. The first declares Gods goodnesse, but this publishes mans folly and weaknesse, who finds in himself so much difficulty to perform a condition so easie and full of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But the order of this infelicity is knotted like the foldings of a Serpent, all those parts of easinesse which invite us to doe the duty, are become like the joynes of a bulrush, not bendings, but consolidations and stiffenings; the very facility becomes its objection, and in every of its stages, wee make or finde a huge uneasinesse. At first wee doe not know what we ask, and when we doe, then we finde difficulty to bring our wils to desire it; and when that is instructed and kept in awe, it mingles interest, and confounds the purposes; and when it is forc'd to ask <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>severely,</hi> then it <hi>wills</hi> so coldly, that God hates the prayer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and if it desires <hi>fervently,</hi> it sometimes turns that into passion, and that passion breaks into murmurs or unquietnesse; or if that be avoyded, the indifferency cooles into death, or the fire burns violently, and is quickly spent; our desires are dull as a rock, or fugitive as lightening; either wee aske ill things earnestly, or

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> good things remissely; we either court our owne danger, or are not zealous for our reall safety; or if we be right in our matter, or earnest in our affections, and lasting in our abode, yet we misse in the manner; and either we aske for evill ends, or without religion and awefull apprehensions; or we rest in the words and signification of the prayer; and never take care to passe on to action; or else we sacrifice in the company of <hi>Corah</hi> being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a schisme, or a rebellion in religion; or we bring unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed censers; our hearts send up to God an unholy smoak, a cloud from the fires of lust, and either the flames of <hi>lust</hi> or <hi>rage,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which proposition let us first consider in the sense of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose which the blind man spoke it in, and then in the utmost
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50231:31"/>
extent of it, as its analogie and equall reason goes forth upon us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and our necessities. The man was cured of his blindnesse, and being examined concerning him that did it, named and gloryed in his Physitian: but the spitefull Pharisees bid him give glory to God, and defie the Minister; for God indeed was good, but he wrought that cure by a wicked hand. No (says he) this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. If this man were a sinner and a false Prophet (for in that instance the accusation was intended) God would not hear his prayers, and work miracles by him in verification of a lye. <hi>A false Prophet could not work true miracles;</hi> this hath received its diminution when the case was changed; for at that time when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christ preached, Miracles was the onely, or the great verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any new revelation; and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it proceeding from an Almighty God, must needs be the testimony of a Divine truth; and if it could have been brought for a lye, there could not then have been sufficient instruction given to mankind, to prevent their beleef of false Prophets, and lying doctrines. But when Christ proved his doctrine by miracles, that no enemy of his did ever doe so great before or after him; then he also told, that after him his friends should doe greater; and his enemies should do some, (but they were fewer, and very inconsiderable) and therefore could have in them no unavoydable cause of deception; because they were discovered by a Prophesie; and caution was given against them by him that did greaten miracles; and yet ought to have been beleeved if he had done but one; because against him there had been no caution, but many prophesies creating such expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning him, which he verified by his great works. So that in this sense of working miracles, though it was infinitely true that the blind man said, <hi>then when he said it,</hi> yet after that the case was alter'd: and Sinners, Magicians, Astrologers, Witches, Hereticks, Simoniacks and wicked persons of other instances, have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> done miracles, and God hath heard sinners, and wrought his own works by their hands, or suffered the Devill to doe his works under their pretences; and many at the day of Judgment shall plead that they have done miracles in Christs name, and yet they shall be rejected; Christ knows them not, and their portion shall bee with dogs, and goats, and unbeleevers.</p>
                  <p>There is in this case onely this difference, that they who doe miracles in opposition to Christ, doe them by the power of the Devill, to whom it is permitted to doe such things which wee think miracles; and that is all one as though they were: but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> danger of them is none at all, but to them that will not beleeve him that did greater miracles, and prophesied of these lesse, and gave warning of their attending danger, and was confirmed to be a true teacher by voices from heaven, and by the resurrection of his body after a three days buriall: So that to these the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:50231:31"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> still remains true, <hi>God hears not sinners,</hi> God does not work those miracles; but concerning <hi>sinning Christians,</hi> God in this sense and towards the purposes of miracles does hear them, and hath wrought miracles by them, for they doe them <hi>in the name of Christ,</hi> and therefore Christ said, <hi>cannot easily speak ill of him;</hi> and although they either prevaricate in their lives, or in superinduced doctrines, yet because the miracles are a verification of the Religion, not of the opinion, of the power or truth of Christ, not of the veracity of the man, God hath heard such persons many times whom men have long since, and to this day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> such were the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Arrians;</hi> For to the Heathens they could onely prove their Religion by which they stood distinguished from them; but we find not that they wrought miracles among the Christians, or to verifie their superstructures and private opinions. But besides this yet, we may also by such means arrest the forwardnesse of our judgments and condemnations of persons disagreeing in their opinions from us; for those persons whose faith God confirmed by miracles was an intire faith, and although they might have false opinions, or mistaken explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of true opinions, either inartificiall or misunderstood, yet we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> have reason to beleeve their faith to be intire; for that which God would have the Heathen to beleeve, and to that purpose prov'd it by a miracle, himselfe intended to accept first to a holy life, and then to glory. The false opinion should burn, and themselves escape. One thing more is here very considerable, that in this very instance of working miracles, God was so very carefull not to hear sinners or permit sinners, till he had prevented all dangers to good and innocent persons, that the case of Christ and his Apostles working miracles was so clearly separated and remarked by the finger of God, and distinguished from the impostures and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of all the many Antichrists that appeared in <hi>Palestine, Cyprus, Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said <hi>Galen,</hi> It is not easie to teach anew him that hath been taught by Christ: And St. <hi>Austin</hi> tels a story of an unbeleeving man, that being troubled that his wife was a Christian, went to the Oracle to aske by what means hee should alter her perswasion; but he was answered, it could never be done, he might as well imprint characters upon the face of a torrent or a rapid river, or himself fly in the air, as alter the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of a hearty and an honest Christian; I would to God it were so now in all instances, and that it were so hard to draw men from the severities of a holy life, as of old they could be cousened, disputed, or forced out of their faith. Some men are vexed with hypocrisie, and then their hypocrisie was punished with infidelity and a wretchlesse spirit. <hi>Demas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50231:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> and the lapsed Confessors are instances of humane craft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or humane weaknesse; but they are scarce a number that are remarked in Ancient story to have fallen from Christianity by direct persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the efficacy of abusing arguments and discourses. The reason of it is the truth in the text; God did so avoyd hearing sinners in this affair, that he never permitted them to doe any miracles so as to doe any mischief to the souls of good men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, the enemies of Christ came <hi>in the power of signes and wonders able to deceive (if it were possible) even the very elect;</hi> but <hi>that was not possible;</hi> without their faults it could not be; the elect were sufficiently strengthened, and the evidence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christs being heard of God, and that none of his enemies were heard of God to any dangerous effect, was so great, that if any Christian had apostatized or fallen away by direct perswasion, it was like the sin of a falling Angell, of so direct a malice that he never could repent, and God never would pardon him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> twice remarks in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The result of this discourse is the first sense and explication of the words, <hi>God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not sinners, viz.</hi> in that in which they are sinners: a sinner in his manners may be heard in his prayer in order to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his faith, but if he be a sinner in his faith God hears <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him not at all in that wherein he sins; for God is truth and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confirm a lye, and when ever he permitted the Devill to doe it, he secur'd the interest of his Elect, that is, of all that beleeve in him and love him, <hi>lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which yet concerns us more neerly is, that <hi>God heareth not sinners,</hi> that is, if wee be not good men, our prayers will doe us no good: wee shall be in the condition of them that never pray at all. The prayers of a wicked man are like the breath of corrupted lungs, God turns away from such unwholsome brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But that I may reduce this necessary doctrine to a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; I shall consider that there are some persons whose prayers are sins; and some others whose prayers are ineffectuall: some are such who doe not pray lawfully; they sin when they pray while they remain in that state and evill condition; others are such who doe not obtain what they pray for, and yet their prayer is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect sin: the prayer of the first is a direct abomination, the prayer of the second is hindred; the first is corrupted by a direct state of sin, the latter by some intervening imperfection and unhandsome circumstance of action; and in proportion to these, it is required, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 1. that he be in a state and possibility of acceptation; and 2. that the prayer it selfe be in a proper disposition. 1. Therefore wee shall consider what are those conditions which are required in every person that prays, the want of which makes the prayer to be a sin? 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. What are the conditions of a good mans prayer, the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> absence of which makes that even his prayer returns empty? 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>; What degrees and circumstances of piety are required to make a man fit to be an intercessor for others, both with holinesse in himself and effect to them he prays for?

                  <p n="1">1. Whosoever prays to God while he is in a state, or in the affection to sin, his prayer is an abomination to God. This was a truth so beleeved by all Nations of the world, that in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they ever appointed baptismes and ceremoniall expiations to cleanse the persons before they presented themselves in their holy offices. <hi>Deorum Templa cum adire disponitis ab, omni vos labe puros, lautos, castissimósque praestatis,</hi> said <hi>Arnobius</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles: When you addresse your selves to the Temples of your Gods, you keep your selves chast, and clean, and spotlesse.</hi> They washed their hands, and wore white garments, they refused to touch a dead body, they avoyded a spot upon their clothes as they avoyded a wound upon their head, <gap reason="foreign">

That was the religious ground they went upon; an impure thing ought not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> touch that which is holy, much lesse to approach the Prince of purities; and this was the sense of the old world in their lustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their preparatory baptismes; they wash'd their hands to signifie that they should <hi>cleanse them from all iniquity,</hi> and keep them pure from bloud and rapine; they washed their garments, but that intended they should <hi>not be spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the flesh;</hi> and their follies consisted in this, that they did not looke to the bottome of their lavatories; they did not see through the vail of their ceremonies. <hi>Flagitiis omnibus inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is an act of profanation for any unholy person to handle holy things, and holy offices. For if God was ever carefull to put all holy things into cancels, and immure them with acts and laws and cautions of separation; and the very sanctification of them was nothing else but the solemn separating them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> usages, that himself might bee distinguished from men by actions of propriety; it is naturally certain, he that would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenc'd from common things, would be infinitely divided from things that are wicked: If things that are <hi>lawfull</hi> may yet be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy</hi> in this sense; much more are unlawfull things most unholy in all senses. If God will not admit of that which is <hi>beside Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> he will lesse endure that which is <hi>against Religion.</hi> And therefore if a common man must not serve at the altar, how shall he abide a wicked man to stand there? No: he will not indure him, but he will cast him and his prayer into the separation of an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> infinite and eternall distance. <hi>Sic profanatis sacris peritura Troja perdidit primùm Deos,</hi> So <hi>Troy</hi> entred into ruine when their prayers became unholy, and they profan'd the rites of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

For punishment is but the latter part of sin; it is not a new thing and distinct from it: or if we will kisse the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> or clip the <hi>Lamia</hi> about the neck, we have as certainly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the taile, and its venemous embraces, as the face and lip. Every man that sins against God, and loves it, or, which is all one, continues in it, for by interpretation that is love, hath all the circumstances of unworthinesse towards God; hee is unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and a breaker of his vowes, and a despiser of his mercies, and impudent against his judgments, he is false to his profession, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> false to his faith, hee is an unfriendly person, and useth him bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously who hath treated him with an affection not lesse then infinite; and if any man does half so much evill, and so unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely to a man, we stone him with stones and curses, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and an unrelenting scorn. And how then shall such a person hope that God should pity him? for God better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, and deeper resents, and more essentially hates, and more severely exacts the circumstances and degrees of basenesse then we can doe; and therefore proportionably scorns the person and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides the calamity. Is not unthankfulnesse to God a greater base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and unworthinesse then unthanfulnesse to our Patron? And is not hee as sensible of it and more then wee? These things are more then words; and therefore if <hi>no man</hi> pities a base person, let us remember that <hi>no man</hi> is so base in any thing as in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome demeanour towards God. Doe wee not professe our selves his servants, and yet serve the Devill? Doe we not live upon Gods provision, and yet stand or work at the command of lust, or avarice, humane regards and little interests of the world? We call him <hi>Father</hi> when we desire our portion, and yet spend it in the society of all his enemies. In short: Let our actions to God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and their circumstances be supposed to be done towards men, and we should scorn our selves; and how then can we expect God should not scorne us, and reject our prayer when we have done all the dishonour to him, and with all the unhandsomnesse in the world? Take heed lest we fall into a condition of evill, in which it shall be said, <hi>You may thank your selves;</hi> and be infinitely afraid lest at
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50231:34"/>
the same time we be in a condition of person in which God will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> upbraid our unworthinesse, and scorne our persons, and rejoyce in our calamity. The first is intolerable, the second is irremedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; the first proclaims our folly, and the second declares Gods finall justice; in the first there is no comfort, in the latter there is no remedy; <hi>that</hi> therefore makes us miserable, and <hi>this</hi> renders us desperate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This great truth is further manifested by the necessary and convenient appendages of prayer requir'd, or advis'd, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in holy Scripture. For why is <hi>Fasting</hi> prescribed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with prayer? For neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse; and God does not delight in that service, the first, second, and third part of which is nothing but pain and self-affliction. But therefore fasting is usefull with prayer, because it is a penall duty, and an action of repentance; for then onely God hears sinners, when they enter first into the gates of repentance, and proceed in all the regions of sorrow, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; and therefore we are commanded to fast, that we may pray with more spirituality, and with repentance, that is, without the loads of meat, and without the loads of sin. Of the same consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it is that <hi>almes</hi> are prescribed, together with prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it is a part of that charity without which our soules are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all that which ought to be equally valued with our owne lives. But besides this, we may easily observe what speciall unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies there are, which besides the generall malignity and demerit, are speciall <hi>deleteries</hi> and hinderances to our prayers, by irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the person of him that prays.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is unmercyfulnesse. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said one in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> and they were well joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. He that takes Mercy from a Man is like him that takes an Altar from the Temple; the Temple is of no use without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> an Altar, and the Man cannot pray without mercy; and there are infinite of prayers sent forth by men which God never attends to, but as to so many sins; because the men live in a course of rapine, or tyranny, or oppression, or uncharitablenesse, or something that is most contrary to God, because it is unmercifull. Remember, that God sometimes puts thee into some images of his own relation. We beg of God for mercy, and our Brother begs of us for pity: and therefore let us deal equally with God and all the world. I see my selfe fall by a too frequent infirmity, and still I beg for pardon, and hope for pity; thy brother that offends thee, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he hopes so too, and would fain have the same measure, and would be as glad thou wouldst pardon him, as thou wouldest rejoyce in thy own forgivenesse. I am troubled when God rejects my prayer, or in stead of hearing my petition, sends a judgement: Is not thy Tenant, or thy Servant, or thy Client so to thee? does
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50231:34"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not he tremble at thy frown, and is of an uncertaine soule till thou speakest kindly unto him, and observes thy lookes as hee watches the colour of the bean coming from thy box of Sentence, life or death depending on it? when he begs of thee for mercy, his passion is greater, his necessities more pungent, his apprehension more brisk, and sensitive, his case dressed with the circumstances of pity, and thou thy selfe canst better feel his condition then thou doest usually perceive the earnestnesse of thy own prayers to God; and if thou regardest not thy brother whom thou seest, whose case thou feelest, whose circumstances can afflict thee, whose passion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is dressed to thy fancy, and proportioned to thy capacity, how shall God regard thy distant prayer, or be melted with thy cold desire, or softned with thy dry story, or moved by thy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting soul? If I be sad, I seek for comfort, and goe to God and to the ministry of his creatures for it; and is it not just in God to stop his own fountaines, and seal the cisterns and little emanations of the creatures from thee, who shuttest thy hand, and shuttest thy eye, and twistest thy bowells against thy brother, who would as fain be comforted as thou? It is a strange <hi>Iliacall passion</hi> that so hardens a mans bowells, that nothing proceeds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from him but the name of his own disease, a <hi>Miserere mei Deus,</hi> a prayer to God for pity upon him that will not shew pity to others. We are troubled when God through severity breaks our bones, and hardens his face against us; but we think our poor brother is made of iron, and not of flesh and bloud, as we are. God hath bound mercy upon us by the iron bands of necessity, and though Gods mercy is the measure of his justice, yet justice is the measure of our mercy, and as we doe to others it shall be done to us, even in the matter of pardon and of bounty, of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse and remission, of bearing each others burdens, and faire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> interpretation; <hi>Forgive us our trespasses as wee forgive them that trespasse against us,</hi> so we pray. The finall sentence in this affair is recorded by St. <hi>James, Hee that shews no mercy shall have</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50231:35"/>
his confidence, and all his manly hopes; it makes his spirit light, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> effeminate, and fantastick, and dissolves his attention, and makes his mind so to disaffect all the objects of his desires, that when he prays he is as uneasy as an impaled person, or a condemned criminall upon the hook or wheel; and it hath in it this evill quality, that a lustfull person cannot pray heartily against his sin; he cannot desire his cure, for his will is contradictory to his Collect, and he would not that God should hear the words of his prayer, which he poor man never intended. For no crime so seises upon the will as that; some sins steale an affection, or obey a temptation, or secure an interest, or work by the way of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> understanding, but lust seises directly upon the will, for the Devil knows well that the lusts of the body are soon cured; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easynesse that dwels there is a disease very tolerable, and every degree of patience can passe under it. But therefore the Devill seises upon the will, and that's it that makes adulteries and all the species of uncleannesse; and lust growes so hard a cure, because the formality of it is, that it will not be cured; the will loves it, and so long as it does, God cannot love the Man; for God is the Prince of purities, and the Son of God is the King of Virgins, and the holy Spirit is all love, and that is all purity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and all spirituality: And therefore the prayer of an Adulterer, or an uncleane person, is like the sacrifices to <hi>Moloch,</hi> or the rites of <hi>Flora,</hi> ubi <hi>Cato spectator esse non potuit,</hi> a good man will not endure them, much lesse will God entertaine such reekings of the Dead sea and clouds of <hi>Sodome.</hi> For so an impure vapor begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the slime of the earth, by the feavers and adulterous heats of an intemperate Summer sun, striving by the ladder of a mountaine to climbe up to heaven, and rolling into various figures by an uneasy, unfixed revolution, and stop'd at the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the aire, being thrown from his pride and attempt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> passing towards the seat of the stars, turnes into an unwholsome flame, and like the breath of hell is confin'd into a prison of darknesse, and a cloud, till it breaks into diseases, plagues and mildews, stink and blastings: so is the prayer of an unchast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it strives to climbe the battlements of heaven, but because it is a flame of sulphur, salt and <hi>bitumen,</hi> and was kindled in the dishonorable regions below, deriv'd from hell, and contrary to God, it cannot passe forth to the element of love, but ends in barrennesse and murmur, fantastick expectations, and trifling imaginative confidences, and they at last end in sorrows and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> * Every state of sin is against the possibility of a mans being accepted; but these have a proper venome against the graciousnesse of the person, and the power of the prayer. God can never accept an unholy prayer, and a wicked man can never send forth any other; the waters passe thorough impure aquaeducts

                  <p>Henceforth therefore, never any more wonder that men pray so seldome; there are few that feel the relish, and are enticed with the deliciousnesse, and refreshed with the comforts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed with the sanctity, and acquainted with the secrets of a holy prayer: But cease also to wonder, that of those few that say many prayers, so few find any return of any at all. To make up a good and a lawfull prayer there must be charity, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all its daughters, <hi>almes, forgivenesse,</hi> not judging uncharitably; there must be purity of spirit, that is, purity of intention; and there must be purity of the body and soule, that is, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of chastity; and there must be no vice remaining, no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to sin: for he that brings his body to God, and hath left his will in the power of any sin, offers to God the calves of his lips, but not a whole burnt-offering; a lame oblation, but not a <hi>reasonable sacrifice;</hi> and therefore their portion shall be amongst them whose prayers were never recorded in the book of life, whose tears God never put into his bottle, whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> desires shall remaine ineffectuall to eternall ages.

Hee that is in the <hi>affection,</hi> or in the <hi>habit,</hi> or in the <hi>state</hi> of any one sin whatsoever, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at such distance <hi>from</hi> and contrariety <hi>to</hi> God, that he provokes God to anger in every prayer hee makes: And then adde but this consideration; that prayer is the great summe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is the <hi>effect,</hi> and the <hi>exercise,</hi> and the <hi>beginning,</hi> and the <hi>promoter of all</hi> graces, and the <hi>consummation</hi> and <hi>perfection of many;</hi> and all those persons who pretend towards heaven, and yet are not experienced in the secrets of Religion, they reckon their piety, and account their hopes, onely upon the stock of a few prayers; it may be they pray twice every day, it may be thrice, and blessed be God for it; so farre is very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> well; but if it shall be remembred and considered, that this course of piety is so farre from warranting any one course of sin, that any one habituall and cherished sin destroyes the effect of all that piety, wee shall see there is reason to account this to be one of those great arguments with which God hath so bound the duty of holy living upon us, that without a holy

For every sort of man hath some religion or other, by the measures of which they proportion their lives and their prayers; Now as the holy Spirit of God teaching us to pray, makes us like himself in order to a holy and an effective prayer; and no man prayes well, but he that prays by the Spirit of God, <hi>the Spirit of holinesse,</hi> and he that prayes with the Spirit must be made like to the Spirit, he is first sanctified and made holy, and then made fervent, and then his prayer ascends beyond the cloud; first he is renewed in the spirit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his minde, and then he is inflamed with holy fires, and guided by a bright starre; first purified and then lightned, then burning and shining: so is every man in every of his prayers. He is alwayes like the spirit by which he prayes: If he be a lustfull person, he prayes with a lustfull spirit; if he does not pray for it, he cannot heartily pray against it.

Since therefore no prayer can be good but that which is taught by the Spirit of grace, none holy but the man whom Gods Spirit hath sanctified, and therefore none heard to any purposes of blessing which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost does not make for us (for he makes intercession for the Saints, the Spirit of Christ is the <hi>praecentor</hi> or the <hi>rector chori</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Master of the Quire) it followes that all other prayers being made with an evill Spirit must have an evill portion; and though the Devils by their Oracles have given some answers, and by their significations have foretold some future contingencies, and in their government and subordinate rule have assisted some armies, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered some treasures, and prevented some snares of chance, and accidents of men, yet no man that reckons by the measures of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or religion, reckons witches and conjurors amongst blessed and prosperous persons: these and all other evill persons have an evill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the measures of which their desires begin and proceed on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to issue; but this successe of theirs neither comes from God, nor brings felicity: but if it comes from God, <hi>it is anger,</hi> if it descends upon good men, it <hi>is a curse,</hi> if upon evill men, it is <hi>a sin,</hi> and then it is a present curse, and leads on to an eternall infelicity. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports that the <hi>Tyrians</hi> tyed their gods with chains, because certain persons did dream that <hi>Apollo</hi> said he would leave their City, and go to the party of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who then besieged the town: and <hi>Apollodorus</hi> tels of some that tied the image of <hi>Saturne</hi> with bands of wooll upon his feet.

                  <p>That's the first generall. 2. Many times good men pray, and their prayer is not a sin, but yet it returns empty; because although the man be, yet the prayer is not in proper disposition; and here I am to account to you concerning the collaterall and accidentall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of the prayer of a good man.</p>
                  <p>The first thing that hinders the prayers of a good man from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> its effect is a violent anger, a violent storm in the spirit of him that prayes. For anger sets the house on fire, and all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are busie upon trouble, and intend propulsion, defence, displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or revenge; it is a short madnesse, and an eternall enemy to to discourse, and sober counsels, and fair conversation; it intends its own object with all the earnestnesse of perception, or activity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and a quicker motion of a too warm and distempered bloud; it is a feaver in the heart, and a calenture in the head, and a fire in the face, and a sword in the hand, and a fury all over; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can never suffer a man to be in a disposition to pray. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> prayer is an action and a state of entercourse, and desire, exactly contrary to this character of anger. Prayer is an action of likenesse to the holy Ghost, the Spirit of gentlenesse and dove-like simplicity; an imitation of the holy Jesus, whose Spirit is meek up to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the biggest example, and a conformity to God whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is alwaies just, and marches slowly, and is without transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50231:38"/>
and often hindred, and never hasty, and is full of mercy; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is the peace of our spirit, the stilnesse of our thoughts, the evennesse of recollection, the seat of meditation, the rest of our cares, and the calme of our tempest; prayer is the issue of a quiet minde, of untroubled thoughts, it is the daughter of charity, and the sister of meeknesse; and he that prayes to God with an angry, that is, with a troubled and discomposed spirit, is like him that retires into a battle to meditate, and sets up his closet in the out quarters of an army, and chooses a frontier garrison to be wise in. Anger is a perfect alienation of the minde from prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is contrary to that attention which presents our prayers in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> right line to God. For so have I seen a lark rising from his bed of grasse and soaring upwards singing as he rises, and hopes to get to heaven, and climbe above the clouds; but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud sighings of an eastern winde, and his motion made irregular and unconstant, descending more at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breath of the tempest, then it could recover by the libration and frequent weighing of his wings; till the little creature was forc'd to sit down and pant, and stay till the storm was over, and then it made a prosperous flight, and did rise and sing as if it had learned musick and motion from an Angell as he passed sometimes through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the aire about his ministeries here below: so is the prayers of a good man; when his affairs have required businesse, and his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was matter of discipline, and his discipline was to passe upon a sinning person, or had a design of charity, his duty met with the infirmities of a man, and anger was its instrument, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became stronger then the prime agent, and raised a tempest, and overrul'd the man; and then his prayer was broken, and his thoughts were troubled, and his words went up towards a cloud, and his thoughts pull'd them back again, and made them without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and the good man sighs for his infirmity, but must be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> content to lose that prayer, and he must recover it when his anger is removed and his spirit is becalmed, made even as the brow of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and smooth like the heart of God; and then it ascends to heaven upon the wings of the holy dove, and dwels with God till it returnes like the usefull Bee, loaden with a blessing and the dew of heaven.</p>

                     <q>Thou neither answerest to the question thou art asked, nor givest according as thou art desired; but being inquired of, how many are two and two, thou answerest twenty.</q> So it is with God and us in the intercourse of our prayers: we pray for health, and he gives it us, it may be, a sicknesse that carries us to eternall life; we pray for necessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> support for our persons and families, and he gives us more then we need; we beg for a removall of a present sadnesse, and he gives us that which makes us able to bear twenty sadnesses, a cheerfull spirit, a peacefull conscience, and a joy in God, as an antepast of eternall rejoycings in the Kingdome of God; But then although God doth very frequently give us beyond the matter of our desires, yet he does not so often give us great things beyond the spirit of our desires, beyond the quicknesse, vivacity, and fervor of our minds; for there is but one thing in the world that God hates besides sin, that is, <hi>indifferency</hi> and <hi>lukewarmnesse;</hi> which although it hath not in <note place="margin">See 2.

The reason of it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>lukewarmnesse</hi> or an <hi>indifferent spirit</hi> is an undervaluing of God and of Religion, it is a separation of reason from affections,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50231:39"/>
and a perfect conviction of the understanding to the goodnesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a duty, but a refusing to follow what we understand. For he that is <hi>lukewarm</hi> alwaies understands the better way, and seldome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues it; he hath so much reason as is sufficient, but he will not obey it; his will does not follow the dictate of his understanding, and therefore it is unnaturall. It is like the phantastick fires of the night, where there is <hi>light and no heat,</hi> and therefore may passe on to the reall fires of hell, where there is <hi>heat and no light;</hi> and therefore although <hi>an act of lukewarmnesse</hi> is only an undecency, and no sin; yet <hi>a state of lukewarmnesse</hi> is criminall, and sinfull state of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and undecency; an <hi>act of indifferency</hi> hinders <hi>a single prayer</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his affections upon it. If our prayers be for temporall things, I shall not need to stirre up your affections to be passionate for their purchase; we desire them greedily, we run after them intemperately, we are kept from them with huge impatience, we are delayed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite regret, we preferre them before our duty, we aske them unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, we receive them with our own prejudice, and we care not, we choose them to our hurt and hinderance, and yet delightin the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase; and when we do pray for them, we can hardly bring our selves to it, to submit to Gods will, but will have them (if we can) whether he be pleased or no; like the Parasite in the Comedy, <hi>Qui comedit</hi>

But then for spirituall things, for the interest of our souls, and the affairs of the Kingdome, we pray to God with just such a zeal as a man begs of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to cut him of the stone; or a condemned man desires his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner quickly to put him out of his pain, by taking away his life; when things are come to that passe, it must be done, but God knows with what little complacency and desire, the man makes his request: And yet the things of religion and the spirit, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things that ought to be desired vehemently, and pursued passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> because God hath set such a value upon them that they are the effects of his greatest loving kindnesse; they are the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christs bloud, and the effect of his continuall intercession, the fruits of his bloudy sacrifice, and the gifts of his healing and saving mercy, the graces of Gods Spirit, and the only instruments

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of felicity; and if we can have fondnesses for things indifferent, or dangerous, our prayers upbraid our spirits when we beg coldly and tamely for those things for which we ought to dye, which are more precious then the globes of Kings, and weightier then Imperiall Scepters, richer then the spoils of the Sea, or the treasures of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> hils.</p>
                  <p>He that is cold and tame in his prayers, hath not tasted of the deliciousnesse of Religion, and the goodnesse of God; he is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the secrets of the Kingdome, and therefore he does not know what it is either to have hunger or satiety; and therefore neither are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they hungry for God, nor satisfied with the world, but remain stupid and inapprehensive, without resolution and determination, never choosing clearly, nor pursuing earnestly; and therefore never enter into possession, but alwaies stand at the gate of wearinesse, unnecessary caution, and perpetuall irresolution. But so it is too often in our prayers; we come to God because it is civill so to do, and a generall custome, but neither drawn thither by love, nor pinch'd by spirituall necessities, and pungent apprehensions; we say so many prayers because we are resolved so to do, and we passe through them sometimes with a little attention, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with none at all, and can we think that the grace of Chastity can be obtain'd at such a purchase, that grace that hath cost more labours then all the persecutions of faith, and all the disputes of hope, and all the expence of charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, amounts to?

For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayer we make is considered by God, and recorded in heaven; but cold prayers are not put into the account in order to effect and acceptation; but are laid aside like the buds of roses which a cold wind hath nip'd into death, and the discoloured <hi>tawny face of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian slave:</hi> and when in order to your hopes of obtaining a great blessing, you reckon up your prayers with which you have soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> your suit in the court of heaven, you must reckon, not by the number of the collects, but by your sighs and passions, by the vehemence of your desires, and the fervour of your spirit, the apprehension of your need, and the consequent prosecution of your supply. <hi>Christ</hi> pray'd <gap reason="foreign">

Under this title of lukewarmnesse and tepidity may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised also these Cautions: that a good mans prayers are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hindred by <hi>inadvertency,</hi> sometimes by <hi>want of perseverance.</hi> For inadvertency or want of attendance to the sense and intention of our prayers, it is certainly an effect of lukewarmnesse, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain companion and appendage to humane infirmity; and is only so remedyed as our prayers are made zealous, and our infirmities
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50231:40"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> passe into the strengths of the Spirit. But if we were quick in our perceptions, either concerning our danger, or our need, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the object, or the glories of God, or the niceties and perfections of Religion, we should not dare to throw away our prayers so like fools, or come to God and say a prayer with our minde standing at distance, trifling like untaught boyes at their books, with a truantly spirit. I shall say no more to this, but that in reason we can never hope that God in heaven will hear our prayers, which we our selves speak and yet hear not at the same time when we our selves speak them with instruments joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to our ears; even with those organs which are parts of our hearing faculties. If they be not worth our own attending to, they are not worth Gods hearing; If they are worth Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to, we must make them so by our own zeal, and passion, and industry, and observation, and a present and a holy spirit.</p>
                  <p>But concerning <hi>perseverance,</hi> the consideration is something distinct. For when our prayer is for a great matter, and a great necessity, strictly attended to, yet we pursue it only by chance or humour, by the strengths of fancy, and naturall disposition; or else our choice is cool as soon as hot, like the emissions of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or like a sun-beam often interrupted with a cloud, or cool'd with intervening showers: and our prayer is without fruit because the desire lasts not, and the prayer lives like the repentance of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or the trembling of <hi>Felix,</hi> or the Jewes devotion for seven dayes of unleavened bread, during the Passeover or the feast of Tabernacles; but if we would secure the blessing of our prayers, and the effect of our prayers, we must never leave till we have obtain'd what we need.</p>
                  <p>There are many that pray against a temptation for a moneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and so long as the prayer is fervent, so long the man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath a nolition, and a direct enmity against the lust; he consents not all that while; but when the moneth is gone, and the prayer is removed, or becomes lesse active, then the temptation returnes, and sorrages, and prevails, and seises upon all our unguarded strengths. There are some desires which have a period, and Gods visitations expire in mercy at the revolution of a certain number of dayes; and our prayer must dwell so long as Gods anger abides; and in all the storm we must out cry the noyse of the tempest, and the voices of that thunder. But if we become hardned, and by custome and cohabitation with the danger lose our fears, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> abate of our desires and devotions, many times we shall finde, that God by a sudden breach upon us will chastise us for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our hands go down. <hi>Israel</hi> prevailed no longer then <hi>Moses</hi> held up his hands in prayer; and he was forced to continue his prayer, till the going down of the Sun; that is, till the danger was over, till the battell was done. But when our desires, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50231:41"/>
prayers are in the matter of spirituall danger, they must never be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> remitted, because our danger continues for ever, and therefore so must our watchfulnesse, and our guards. <hi>Vult n. Deus rogari, vult cogi, vult quâdam importunitate vinci</hi> (sayes S. <hi>Gregory)</hi> God loves to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, intreated, importun'd</hi> with an unquiet, restlesse desire and a persevering prayer. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, God hears the persevering man, and the unwearied prayer. For it is very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that we be very curious to observe; that many times a lust is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>sopita, non mortua,</hi> it is asleep; the enemy is at truce, and at quiet for a while, but not conquered, not dead; and if we put off our armour too soon, we lose all the benefit of our former war, and are surprised by indiligence and a carelesse guard. For God sometimes binds the Devill in a short chain, and gives his servants respite, that they may feel the short pleasures of a peace, and the rest of innocence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what are the eternall felicities of heaven, where it shall be so for ever; But then we must return to our warfare again; and every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond affault is more troublesome, because it finds our spirits at ease, and without watchfulnesse, and delighted with a spirituall rest, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> keeping holiday. But let us take heed; for whatsoever temptation we can be troubled withall by our naturall temper, or by the condition of our life, or the evill circumstances of our condition, so long as we have capacity to feel it, so long we are in danger, and must <hi>watch thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with prayer</hi> and continuall diligence. And when your temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons let you alone, let not you God alone; but lay up prayers and the blessings of a constant devotion against the day of tryall. Well may your temptation sleep, but if your prayers do so, you may chance to be awakened with an affault that may ruine you. However, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rule is easie: Whatsoever you need, aske it of God so long as you want it, even till you have it. For God therefore many times defers to grant, that thou mayst persevere to aske; and because every holy prayer is a glorification of God by the confessing many of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, a lasting and a persevering prayer is a little image of the Allel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs and services of eternity; it is a continuation to do that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our measures which we shall be doing to eternall ages: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think not that five or six hearty prayers can secure to thee a great blessing, and a supply of a mighty necessity. He that prays so, and then leaves off, hath said some prayers, and done the ordinary offices of his Religion, but hath not secured the blessing, nor used <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> means reasonably proportionable to a mighty interest.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The prayers of a good man are oftentimes hindered, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of their effect for want of praying in good company; for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an evill or an obnoxious person hath so secured and ascertained a mischief to himself, that he that stayes in his company or his traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50231:41"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must also share in his punishment: and the <hi>Tyrian</hi> sailers with all their vows and prayers could not obtain a prosperous voyage so long as <hi>Jonas</hi> was within the Bark; for in this case the interest is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the publick sin prevails above the private piety. When the Philosopher asked a penny of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he told him it was too little for a <hi>King</hi> to give; when he asked a talent, he told him it was too much for a <hi>Philosopher</hi> to receive; for he did purpose to cousen his own charity, and clude the others necessity, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a double inequality. So it is in the case of a good man mingled in evill company: if a curse be too severe for a good man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a mercy is not to be expected by evill company; and his prayer, when it is made in common, must partake of that event of things which is appropriate to that society. The purpose of this caution is, that every good man be carefull that he do not mingle his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the communions of hereticall persons, and in schismaticall conventicles; for although he be like them that follow <hi>Absalom</hi> in the simplicity of their heart, yet his intermediall fortune, and the event of his present affairs may be the same with <hi>Absaloms;</hi> and it is not a light thing, that we curiously choose the parties of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. I do not say it is necessary to avoid all the society of evill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> persons; for then <hi>we must go out of the world;</hi> and when we have thrown out a drunkard, possibly we have entertain'd an hypocrite; or when a swearer is gone, an oppressor may stay still; or if that be remedied, yet pride is soon discernible, but not easily judicable: but that which is of caution in this question is, that we never min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with those, whose very combination is a sin; such as were <hi>Corah</hi> and his company that rebelled against <hi>Moses their Prince;</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> that made a schisme in Religion against <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron the Priest:</hi> for so said the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Come out from the congregation of these men, lest ye perish in their company;</hi> and all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> those that were abused in their communion, did <hi>perish in the gain-saying of</hi> Corah. It is a sad thing to see a good man cousened by fair pretences, and allured into an evill snare; for besides, that he dwels in danger, and cohabits with a dragon, and his vertue may change by evill perswasion, into an evill disposition, from sweetnesse to bitternesse, from thence to evill speaking, from thence to beleeve a lye, and from beleeving to practise it; besides this, it is a very great sadnesse, that such a man should lose all his prayers to very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purposes: God will not respect the offering of those men who assemble by a peevish spirit; and therefore although God in pity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the desires of a good man if innocently abused, yet as it unites in that assembly, God will not hear it to any purposes of blessing, and holinesse; unlesse we <hi>keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> we cannot have the blessing of the Spirit in the returns of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer; and all those assemblies which meet together against God or Gods Ordinances, may pray and call, and cry loudly, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50231:42"/>
and still they provoke God to anger; and many times he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> will not have so much mercy for them as to deny them; but lets them prosper in their sin, till it swels to intolerable and impardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. * But when good men pray with one heart, and in a <hi>holy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> that is, <hi>holy in their desires, lawfull in their authority,</hi> though the persons be of different complexion, <hi>then</hi> the prayer flies up to God like the hymns of a Quire of Angels; for God that made body and soul to be one man, and God and man to be one Christ, and three persons are one God, and his praises are sung to him by Quires, and the persons are joyned in orders, and the orders into hierarchies, and all, that God may be served by unions and communities, loves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that his Church should imitate the Concords of heaven, and the unions of God, and that every good man should promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of his prayers by joyning in the communion of Saints in the unions of obedience and charity, with the powers that God and the Lawes have ordained.</p>
                  <p>The sum is this, If the man that makes the prayer be an unholy person, his prayer is not the instrument of a blessing, but a curse; but when the sinner begins to repent truly, then his desires begin to be holy. But if they be holy, and just, and good, yet they are without profit and effect, if the prayer be made in schisme, or an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> evill communion, or if it be made without attention, or if the man soon gives over, or if the prayer be not zealous, or if the man be angry. There are very many waies for a good man to become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed and unthriving in his prayers, and he cannot be secure unlesse he be in the state of grace, and his spirit be quiet, and his minde be attentive, and his society be lawfull, and his desires earnest, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate, and his devotions persevering, lasting till his needs be served, or exchanged for another blessing: so that, what <hi>Laelius (apud Cicer. de senectute)</hi> said concerning old age, <hi>neque in summâ inopiâ levis</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>esse senectus potest, ne sapienti quidem, nec insipienti etiam in summâ copiâ non gravis; that a wise man could not bear old age if it were extremely poor; and yet if it were very rich, it were intolerable to a fool;</hi> we may say concerning our prayers; they are sins and unholy, if a wicked man makes them, and yet if they be made by a good man they are ineffective, unlesse they be improved by their proper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. A good man cannot prevail in his prayers, if his desires be cold, and his affections trifling, and his industry soon weary, and his society criminall; and if all these appendages of prayer be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, yet they will do no good to an evill man, for his prayer that begins in sin, shall end in sorrow. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

NExt I am to inquire and consider, what degrees and circumstances of piety are requir'd to make us fit to be intercessors for others, and to pray for them with probable effect? I say <hi>with probable effect;</hi> for when the event principally depends upon that which is not within our own election, such as are the lives and actions of others, all that we can consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this affair is, whether wee be persons fit to pray in the behalf of others that hinder not, but are persons within the limit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and possibilities of the present mercy. When the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> was smitten with the wrath of God, and a sore disease for his cruell persecuting the Christian cause, and putting so many thousand innocent and holy persons to death, and he understood the voice of God and the accents of thunder, and discerned that cruelty was the cause, he revoked their decrees made against the Christians, recall'd them from their caves and deserts, their sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and retirements, and enjoyned them to pray for the life and health of their Prince. They did so, and they who could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand mountaines to remove, and were obeyed, they who could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> doe miracles, they who with the key of prayer could open Gods four closets, of the <hi>wombe</hi> and the <hi>grave,</hi> of <hi>providence</hi> and <hi>rain,</hi> could not obtain for their bloudy Emperour one drop of mercy, but he must die miserable for ever.

For there are some sins of that state and greatnesse that God will not pardon.

For whomsoever Christ prays, for them wee pray, that is, for all them that are within the covenant of repentance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for all whose actions have not destroyed the very being of Religion, who have not renounc'd their faith, nor voluntarily quit their hopes, nor openly opposed the Spirit of grace, nor grown by a long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse to a resolute and finall impiety, nor done injustices greater then <hi>sorrow,</hi> or <hi>restitution,</hi> or <hi>recompense,</hi> or <hi>acknowledgment.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though it may be uncertain and disputed concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>sins unto death,</hi> and therefore to pray, or not to pray, is not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty; yet it is all one, as to the effect, whether we know them or no; for though we intend charity when we pray for the worst of men, yet concerning the event God will take care, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> return thy prayer upon thy own head, though thou didst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it should water and refresh thy neighbors drynesse; and St. <hi>John</hi> so expresses it as if he had left the matter of duty undetermin'd; because the instances are uncertain; yet the event is certainly none at all, therefore because we are not encouraged to pray, and because it is a <hi>sin unto death,</hi> that is, such a sin that hath no portion in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of life, and the state of repentance.

This appeares in the case of <hi>Job:</hi> When the <note place="margin">Chap. 42. 7, 8.</note> wrath of God was kindled against <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and his two friends, God commanded them to offer a sacrifice, but <hi>my servant</hi> Job <hi>shall prey for you, for him will I accept:</hi> and it was so in the case of the prevaricating <hi>Israelites;</hi> God was full of indignation against them, and smote them, <hi>Then stood up</hi> Phinehas <hi>and prayed, and the plague ceased.</hi> For this man was a good man, and the spirit of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> zeal filled him, and he did glory to God in the execution upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and his fair <hi>Madianite.</hi> And it was a huge blessing that was intail'd upon the posterity of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had a great Religion, a great power with God, and their <hi>extraordinary</hi> did consist especially in the matter of prayers and devotion; for that was eminent in them besides their obedience: for so <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells concerning them, that <hi>Abraham</hi> first instituted <hi>Morning prayer.</hi> The affairs of Religion had not the same constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then as now. They worshipped God never but at their <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,</hi> and in <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>seldome times</hi> of separation. The bowed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their head when they came to a hallowed stone, and upon <hi>the top of their staffe,</hi> and worshipped when they came to a <hi>consecrated pillar,</hi> but this was seldome; and they knew not the secrets and the priviledges of a frequent prayer, of intercourses with God by ejaculations, and the advantages of importunity: and the Doctors of the <hi>Jews</hi> that record the prayer of <hi>Noah,</hi> who in all reason knew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50231:44"/>
the secret best, because he was to teach it to all the world, yet have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> transmitted to us but a short prayer of some seaven lines long; and this he onely said within the Ark, in that great danger, once on a day, provoked by his fear, and stirred up by a Religion then made actuall, in those days of sorrow and penance. But in the descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages, when God began to reckon a Church in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, there began to be a new institution of offices, and <hi>Abraham</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that God should be prayed to <hi>every morning. Isaac</hi> being taught by <hi>Abraham,</hi> made a law, or at least commended the practise, and adopted it into the Religion, that God should be worshipped by <hi>decimation</hi> or <hi>tithing</hi> of our goods; and he added <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an order of prayer to be said in the <hi>afternoon;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to make up the office compleat added <hi>evening prayer;</hi> and God was their God, and they became fit persons to <hi>blesse,</hi> that is, of procuring blessings to their relatives; as appears in the instances of their own families; of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Cities of the Plain. For a man of an ordinary piety is like <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece, wet in its own locks; but it could not water a poor mans Garden. But so does a thirsty land drink all the dew of heaven that wets its face, and a great shower makes no torrent, nor digs so much as a little furrow that the drils of the water might passe into rivers, or refresh their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wearinesse; but when the earth is full, and hath no strange consumptive needs, then at the next time when God blesses it with a gracious shower, it divides into portions, and sends it abroad in free and equall communications, that all that stand round about may feel the shower. So is a good mans prayer; his own cup is full, it is crowned with health, and overflowes with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and all that drink of his cup, and eat at his table are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed with his joys, and divide with him in his holy portions. And indeed he hath need of a great stock of piety, who is first to provide for his own necessities, and then to give portions to a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> relation. It is a great matter that every man needs for himself; the daily expences of his own infirmities, the unthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving state of his omission of duties, and recessions from perfection, and sometimes the great losses and shipwracks, the plundrings and burning of his house by a fall into a deadly sin; and most good men are in this condition, that they have enough to doe to live, and keep themselves above water; but how few men are able to pay their own debts, and lend great portions to others? The number of those who can effectually intercede for others to great purposes of grace and pardon, are as soon told as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of wise men, as the gates of a City, or the entries of the river <hi>Nilus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then doe but consider what a great ingagement this is to a very strict and holy life. If we chance to live in times of an extraordinary trouble, or if our relatives can be capable of great

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dangers, or great sorrows, or if we our selves would doe the noblest friendship in the world, and oblige others by acts of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test benefit; if we would assist their souls, and work towards their salvation; if we would be publick ministers of the greatest usefulness to our countrey; if we would support Kings, and relieve the great necessities of Kingdoms; if we would be effective in the stopping of a plague, or in the successe of armies; a great and an exemplar piety, and a zealous and holy prayer can do all this. <hi>Semper tu hoc facito ut cogites, Id optimum esse, tute ut sis optimus; si id nequeas, saltem ut optimis sis proximus.</hi> He that is the best man towards God, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> certainely the best Minister to his Prince or Countrey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe thou endevour to be so; and if thou canst not be so, be at least next to the best. For in that degree in which our Religion is great, and our piety exemplar, in the same we can contribute towards the fortune of a Kingdome: and when <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken into heaven, <hi>Elisha</hi> mourn'd for him because it was a losse to <hi>Israel: My Father, my father, the chariots of</hi> Israel <hi>and horsemen thereof:</hi> But consider how uselesse thou art, when thou canst not by thy prayers obtain so much mercy as to prevaile for the life of a single Trooper, or in a plague beg of God for the life of a poor Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but the ordinary emanations of providence shall proceed to issue without any arrest, and the sword of the Angel shall not be turn'd aside in one single infliction. Remember, although he is a great and excellent person that can prevaile of God for the interest of others, yet thou that hast no stock of grace and favour, no interest in the Court of heaven, art but a mean person; extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in nothing; thou art unregarded by God, cheap in the fight of Angels, uselesse to thy Prince or Countrey; thou maist hold thy peace in a time of publick danger. For, Kings never pardon Murtherers at the intercession of Theeves; and if a mean <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Mechanick should beg a Reprieve for a condemned Traitor, he is ridiculous and impudent; so is a vicious Advocate or an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary person with God. It is well if God will hear him beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for his owne pardon; hee is not yet disposed to plead for others.</p>
                  <p>And yet every man that is in the state of grace, every man that can pray without a sinfull prayer, may also intercede for others; and it is a duty for all men to doe it; all men I say who can pray at all acceptably; <hi>I will therefore that prayers, and supplications, and intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men;</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this is a duty that is prescrib'd to all them that are concern'd in the duty and in the blessings of Prayer; but this is it which I say; if their piety be but ordinary, their prayer can be effectuall but in easy purposes, and to smaller degrees; but he that would work effectively towards a great deliverance, or in great degrees towards the benefit or ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50231:45"/>
in the same degree in which his person is gracious. <hi>There are strange</hi>

                     <hi>things in heaven;</hi> judgments there are made of things and persons by the measures of Religion; and a plain promise produces effects of wonder and miracle; and the changes that are there made are not effected by passions, and interests, and corporall changes, and the love that is there is not the same thing that it is here, it is more beneficiall, more reasonable, more holy, of other designes, and strange productions; and upon that stock it is that a holy poor man that possesses no more (it may be) then an Ewe-lambe, that eats of his bread, and drinks of his cup, and is a daughter to him, and is all his temporall portion, this poor man is ministred to by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Angels, and attended to by God, and the Holy Spirit makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for him, and Christ joyns the mans prayer to his own advocation, and the man by prayer shall save the City, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the fortune of a Tyrant army, even then when God sees it good it should be so; for he will no longer deny him any thing, but when it is no blessing; and when it is otherwise, his prayer is most heard when it is most denyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That we should prevaile in intercessions for others, we are to regard and to take care, that as our piety, so also must our offices be extraordinary. He that prays to recover a family from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an hereditary curse, or to reverse a Sentence of God, to cancell a Decree of heaven gone out against his friend, hee that would heale the sick with his prayer, or with his devotion prevaile against an army, must not expect such great effects upon a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Evening Collect, or an honest wish put into the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of a prayer, or a period put in on purpose. <hi>Mamercus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> seeing his City and all the Diocese in great danger of perishing by an earthquake, instituted <hi>great Letanies,</hi> and solemn supplications, besides the ordinary devotions of his usuall hours of prayer; and the Church from his example took up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the practise, and translated it into an anniversary solemnity, and upon St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s day did solemnly intercede with God to divert or prevent his judgments falling upon the people, <hi>majoribus Litani is,</hi> so they are called; with the more solemn supplications they did pray unto God in behalf of their people. And this hath in it the same consideration that is in every great necessity; for it is a great thing for a man to be so gracious with God, as to be able to prevaile for himself and his friend, for himself and his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and therefore in these cases, as in all great needs, it is the way of prudence and security, that we use all those greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> offices which God hath appointed as instruments of importunity, and arguments of hope, and acts of prevailing, and means of great effect and advocation: such as are, separating days for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer, all the degrees of violence, and earnest addresse, fasting and prayer, almes and prayer, acts of repentance and prayer,

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our needs continue, therefore we are commanded to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the memory, and to represent to God that which was done to satisfie all our needs: Then we receive Christ; we are after a secret and mysterious, but most reall and admirable manner made all one with Christ; and if God giving us his Son could not but with him give us all things else, how shall he refuse our persons when we are united to his person, when our souls are joined to his soul, our body nourished by his body, and our souls sanctified by his bloud, and cloth'd with his robes, and marked with his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and sealed with his Spirit, and renewed with holy vows, and consign'd to all his glories, and adopted to his inheritance? when we represent his death, and pray in vertue of his passion, and imitate his intercession, and doe that which God commands, and offer him in our manner that which he essentially loves? can it be that either any thing should be more prevalent, or that God can possibly deny such addresses, and such importunities? Try it often, and let all things else be answerable, and you cannot have greater reason for your confidence. Doe not all the Christians in the world that understand Religion, desire to have the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when they die; when they are to make their great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before God, and to receive their great consignation to their eternall sentence, good or bad? And if <hi>then</hi> be their greatest needs, <hi>that</hi> is their greatest advantage, and instrument of acceptation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you have a great need to be serv'd, or a great charity to serve, and a great pity to minister, and a dear friend in a sorrow, take Christ along in thy prayers, in all thy ways thou canst take him; take him in affection, and take him in a solemnity, take him by obedience and receive him in the Sacrament; and if thou then offerest up thy prayers and makest thy needs known; if thou nor thy friend be not relieved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> if thy party be not prevalent, and the war be not appeased, or the plague be not cured, or the enemy taken off, there is something else in it; but thy prayer is good and pleasing to God, and dressed with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of advantage, and thy person is apt to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, and thou hast done all that thou canst; the event must be left to God; and the secret reasons of the deniall either thou shalt find

                  <p>That in our importunity and extraordinary offices for others, we must not make our accounts by multitude of words, and long prayers, but by the measures of the Spirit, by the holynesse of the soul, and the justnesse of the desire, and the usefulnesse of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and its order to Gods glory, and its place in the order of providence, and the sincerity of our heart, and the charity of our wishes, and the perseverance of our advocation.

So must wee; though wee must not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ashamed to aske for whatsoever we need, <hi>Rebus semper pudor absit in arctis,</hi> and in this sense it is true that <hi>Stasimus</hi> in the Comedy said concerning Meat, <hi>Verecundari neminem apud mensam decet, Nam ibi de divinis &amp; humanis cernitur:</hi> Men must not be bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full so as to lose their meat; for that is a necessity that cannot bee dispensed withall: so it is in our prayers, whatsoever our necessity calls to us for, we must call to God for; and he is not pleased with that rusticity or fond modesty of being ashamed to ask of God any thing that is honest and necessary; yet our importunity hath also bounds of modesty, but such as are to be expressed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> other significations, and he is rightly modest towards God, who without confidence in himself, but not without confidence in Gods mercy, nor without great humility of person, and reverence of addresse, presents his prayers to God as earnestly as he can; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided alwayes, that in the greatest of our desires, and holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, we submit to Gods will, and desire him to choose for us.

                  <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The last great advantage towards a prevailing intercession for others, is, that the person that prayes for his relatives, be a <hi>person of an extraordinary dignity, imployment or designation.</hi> For God hath appointed some persons and callings of men to pray for others, such are Fathers for their Children, Bishops for their Dioceses, Kings for their Subjects, and the whole Order Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast call for all the men and women in the Christian Church. And it is well it is so; for as things are now, and have been too long, how few are there that understand it to be their duty, or part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their necessary imployment, that some of their time, and much of their prayers, and an equall portion of their desires be spent upon the necessities of others? All men doe not think it necessary, and fewer practise it frequently; and they but coldly, without interest, and deep resentment: it is like the compassion we have in other mens miseries, we are not concerned in it, and it is not our case, and our hearts ake not when another mans children are made fatherlesse, or his wife a sad widow: and just so are our prayers for their relief: If we thought their evils to be ours, if wee and they as members of the same body had sensible and reall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of good and evill; if we understood what is really meant by being <hi>members one of another,</hi> or if we did not think it a spirituall word of art, instrumentall onely to a science, but no part of duty, or reall relation, sure we should pray more earnestly one for another then we usually doe. How few of us are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he sees his brother wicked, or dishonorably vicious? Who is sad and melancholy when his neighbour is almost in hell? when he sees him grow old in iniquity? How many days have we set apart for the publick relief and interests of the Kingdome? How earnestly have we fasted, if our Prince be sick or afflicted? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> What almes have we given for our brothers conversion? or if this be great, how importunate and passionate have we been with God by prayer in his behalf, by prayer and secret petition? But however, though it were well, very well, that all of us would think of this duty a little more; because besides the excellency of the duty it self, it would have this blessed consequent, that for whose necessities we pray, if we doe desire earnestly they should be relieved, we would, <hi>when ever we can,</hi> and <hi>in all we can,</hi> set our hands to it; and if we pity the Orphan children, and pray for them heartily, we would also, when we could, relieve them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> charitably: but though it were therefore very well that things were thus with all men, yet God who takes care for us all, makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for us in speciall manner; and the whole Order of the Clergy are appointed by God to pray for others, to be Ministers of Christs Priesthood, to be followers of his Advocation, to stand between God and the people, and present to God all their needs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50231:47"/>
and all their desires. That this God hath ordained and appointed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and that this rather he will blesse and accept, appears by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God himself, for he onely can be witnesse in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; for it depends wholly upon his gracious favour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Word of God preached, will have a great effect, even though it be preached by an evill Minister, a vicious person, yet it is not so well there, as from a pious man; because by prayer also his preaching is made effectuall, and by his good example his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Sermons are made active; and therefore it is very necessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in respect of this half of the Ministers office, <hi>[The preaching of Word]</hi> he be a good man; unlesse he be, much perishes to the people, most of the advantages are lost. But then for the other half; all those ministeries which are <hi>by way of prayer</hi> are rendred extremely invalid, and ineffectuall, if they be ministred by an evill person. For upon this very stock it was that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that none were to be chosen to the Ministery but <hi>immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati &amp; integri antistites, holy and upright men, who offering their sacrifices worthily to God, and holily, may be heard in their prayers which they make for the safety of the Lords people.</hi> But he presses <note place="margin">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this caution to a further issue: that it is not only <hi>necessary</hi> to choose holy persons to these holy Ministeries for fear of losing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a sanctified Ministery; but also that the people may not be guilty of an evill communion, and a criminall state of society. <hi>Nec enim sibi plebs blandiatur quasi immunis à contagione delicti esse possit cum sacerdote peccatore communicans, the people cannot be innocent if they communicate with a vitious priest: for so said the Lord by the Prophet Hosea, Sacrificia eorum panis luctus; their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are like bread of sorrow, whosoever eat thereof shall be defiled.</hi> The same also he sayes often and more vehemently, <hi>ibid. &amp; lib.</hi> 4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

The prayer and offices of holy Ministers are of great advantages for the interest of the people; but if they be ministred to by evill men, by vicious, and scandalous Ministers, this extraordinary advantage is lost, they are left to stand alone, or to fall by their own crimes; so much as is the action of God, and so much as is the piety of the man that attends and prayes in the holy place with the Priest, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> far he shall prevail, but no further; and therefore the Church hath taught her Ministers to pray thus in her preparatory prayer to consecration, <hi>Quoniam me peccatorem inter te &amp; eundem populum Medium esse voluisti, licet in me boni operis testimonium non agnoscas, officium dispensationiis creditae non recuses, nec per me indignum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulum tuum eorum salutis pereat pretium, pro quibus victima factus salutaris, dignatus es fieri redemptio.</hi> For we must know that God hath not put the salvation of any man into the power of another. And although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by calling the Priests actuall intention simply necessary, and the Sacraments also indispensably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> necessary, hath left it in the power of every Curate to damn very many of his Parish; yet it is otherwise with the accounts of truth, and the Divine mercy; and therefore he will never exact the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of us by the measures and proportions of an evill Priest, but by the piety of the communicant, by the prayers of Christ,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50231:48"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and the mercies of God. But although the greatest interest of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation depends not upon this Ministery, yet as by this we receive many advantages, if the Minister be holy: so if he be vicious, we lose all that which could be conveyed to us by his part of the holy Ministration; every man and woman in the assembly prays and joynes in the effect, and for the obtaining the blessing; but the more vain persons are assembled, the lesse benefits are received even by good men there present: and therefore much is the losse, if a wicked Priest ministers, though the summe of affairs is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely turned upon his office or default; yet many advantages are. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For we must not think that the effect of the Sacraments is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly done, at once, or by one ministery; but they operate by parts, and by morall operation, by the length of time, and a whole order of piety, and holy ministeries; every man is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker with God</hi> in the work of his salvation; and as in our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no one prayer of our own alone prevails upon God for grace and salvation, but all the devotions of our life are upon Gods account for them; so is the blessing of God brought upon the people by all the parts of their religion, and by all assistances of holy people, and by the ministeries not of one, but of all Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Ministers, and relies finally upon our own faith, and obedience, and the mercies of God in Jesus Christ; but yet for want of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons to minister, much diminution of blessing, and a losse of advantages is unavoidable; therefore if they have great necessities, they can best hope that God will be moved to mercy on their behalf, if their necessities be recommended to God by <hi>persons of a great piety, of a holy calling,</hi> and by <hi>the most solemn offices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, I promised to consider concerning the signs of having our prayers heard; concerning which, there is not much of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular observation; but if our prayers be according to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Gods Word, if we aske according to Gods will, things honest and profitable, we are to relye upon the promises, and we are sure that they are heard; and besides this, we can have no sign but <hi>the thing signified;</hi> when we feel the effect, then we are sure God hath heard us; but till then we are to leave it with God, and not to aske a sign of that, for which he hath made us a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. And yet <hi>Cassian</hi> hath named one sign, which if you give me leave I will name unto you. <hi>It is a sign we shall prevail in our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Collat.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.</note> 
                     <hi>prayers, when the Spirit of God moves us to pray, cum fiduciâ &amp; quasi securitate impetrandi,</hi> with a confidence and a holy security of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> what we aske. But this is no otherwise a sign, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a part of the duty; and trusting in God is an endearing him, and doubting is a dishonour to him; and he that doubts hath no faith; for all good prayers relye upon Gods Word; and we must judge of the effect by prudence: for he that askes what is <hi>not lawfull,</hi> hath made an unholy prayer; if it be lawfull and <hi>not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50231:49"/>
we are then heard when God denies us; and if both these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be in the prayer, <hi>he that doubts is a sinner,</hi> and then God will not hear him; but beyond this I know no confidence is warrantable; and if this be a signe of prevailing, then all the prudent prayers of all holy men shall certainely be heard, and because that is certain, we need no further inquiry into signes.</p>
                  <p>I summe up all in the words of God by the Prophet: <hi>Run</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ierem. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>to and fro thorow the streets of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and see, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can finde a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh truth,</hi> virum quaerentem fidem, <hi>a man that seeketh for faith,</hi> &amp; propitius ero ei, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>and I will pardon it.</hi> God would pardon all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for one good mans sake; there are such dayes and opportunities of mercy when God at the prayer of one holy person will save a people; and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> spake a great thing, but it was hugely true: <hi>Quis dubitet mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum stare precibus sanctorum?</hi> the world it self is established and kept from dissolution by the prayers of Saints; and the prayers of Saints shall hasten the day of Judgement; and we cannot easily find two effects greater. But there are many other very great ones; for the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of holy men appease Gods wrath, drive away temptations, resist and overcome the Devill: Holy prayer procures the ministery and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> service of Angels, it rescinds the Decrees of God, it cures sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and obtains pardon, it arrests the Sun in its course, and staies the wheels of the Charet of the Moon; it rules over all Gods creatures, and opens and shuts the storehouses of rain; it unlocks the cabinet of the womb, and quenches the violence of fire, it stops the mouthes of Lions, and reconciles our sufferance and weak faculties, with the violence of torment, and sharpnesse of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; it pleases God and supplies all our needs. But <hi>Prayer</hi> that can do thus much for us, can do nothing at all without <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> for <hi>God heareth not sinners, but if any man be a worshipper of</hi>

                     </gap>, it is in the Prophesie; <hi>I will shake not the earth only, but also heaven</hi> with a greater terror then was upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the voice of an Archangell, with the trump of God, with a concussion so great, that heaven and earth shall be shaken in pieces, and new ones come in their room. This is an unspeakable and an unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable terror: <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> was shaken, but it stands to this day, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when that shaking shall be, <hi>the things that are shaken shall be no more; that those things that cannot be shaken may remain,</hi> that is, not only that the clestiall Jerusalem may remain for ever, but that you who do not turn away from the faith and obedience of the Lord Jesus, you who cannot be shaken nor removed from your duty, you may remain for ever; that when the rocks rend, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains flie in pieces like the drops of a broken cloud, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens shall melt, and the Sun shall be a globe of consuming fire, and the Moon shall be dark like an extinguish'd candle, then you poor men who could be made to tremble with an ague, or shake by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the violence of a Northern winde, or be remov'd from your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by the unjust decree of a persecutor, or be thrown from your estates by the violence of an unjust man, yet could not be removed from your duty, and though you went trembling, yet would go to death for the testimony of a holy cause, and you that would dye for your faith would also live according to it; you shall be established by the power of God, and supported by the arme of your Lord, and shall in all this great shaking be unmovable as the corner stone of the gates of the new Jerusalem, you shall remain and abide for ever.

                     <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 24.</note> as it was then, so it is true now, <hi>Our God is a consuming fire:</hi> He was so to them that brake the Law, but he will be much more to them that disobey his Son, he made great changes then, but those which remain are farre greater, and his terrors are infinitely more intolerable; and therefore although he came not in the spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> but with meeknesse and gentle insinuations, soft as the breath of heaven, not willing to disturb the softest stalk of a violet, yet his second coming shall be with terrors, such as shall amaze all the world, and dissolve it into ruine, and a <hi>Chaos.</hi> This truth is of so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> great efficacy to make us do our duty, that now we are sufficiently enabled with this consideration. This is the grace which we have to enable us, this terror will produce fear, and fear will produce obedience, and <hi>we therefore have grace,</hi> that is, we have such a motive to make us reverence God and fear to offend him, that he

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Godly fear is ever without despair;</hi> because Christian fear is an instrument of duty, and that duty without hope can never go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For what should that man do who like <hi>Nausiclides</hi>

A man will very hardly be brought to deny his own pleasing appetite, when for so doing he cannot hope to have a recompense; when the mind of a man is between hope and fear, it is intent upon its work; <hi>at post quam adempta spes est, lassus, curâ confectus stupet,</hi> if you take away the hope the minde is weary, spent with care, hindred by amazements; <hi>aut aliquem sumpserimus teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rariâ in Deos desperatione,</hi> saith <hi>Arnobius;</hi> a despair of mercy makes men to despise God; and the damned in hell when they shall for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ever be without hope, are also without fear; their hope is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to despair, and their fear into blasphemy, and they curse the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of blessing, and revile God to eternall ages. When <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant imposed intolerable tributes upon his <hi>Sicilian</hi> subjects, it amazed them, and they petitioned and cryed for help, and flatter'd him, and fear'd and obey'd him carefully, but he impos'd still new ones, and greater, and at last left them poor as the valleys of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius,</hi> or the top of <hi>Aetna;</hi> but then all being gone, the people grew idle, and carelesse, and walked in the markets, and publick places, cursing the Tyrant, and bitterly scoffing his person and vices; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which when <hi>Dionysius</hi> heard, he caused his Publicans and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees to withdraw their impost; for now, sayes he, they are dangerous, because they are desperate, <gap reason="foreign">

Let your confidence be allayed with fear, and your fear be sharpned with the intertextures of a holy hope, and the active powers of our souls are furnished with feet and wings, with eyes and hands, with consideration and diligence, with reason and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Godly fear must alwaies be with honourable opinion of God,</hi> without disparagements of his mercies, without quarrellings at the intrigues of his providence, or the rough wayes of his Justice, and therefore it must be ever relative to our selves and our own fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and imperfections. <gap reason="foreign">

But this caution I have now inserted for their sakes whose Schooles and Pulpits raise doctrinall fears concerning God, which if they were true, the greatest part of mankinde would be tempted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to think they have reason not to love God, and all the other part that have not apprehended a reason to hate him, would have very much reason to suspect his severitie, and their own condition.

And they also fear God unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, and speak no good things concerning his Name, who say that God commands us to observe Lawes which are impossible; that think he will condemn innocent persons for errors of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which they cannot avoid, that condemn whole Nations for different opinions, which they are pleased to call <hi>Heresie;</hi> that think God will exact the duties of a man by the measures of an Angell, or will not make abatement for all our pitiable infirmities. The precepts of this caution are, that we remember Gods mercy to be over all his works, that is, that he shewes mercy to all his creatures
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50231:53"/>
that need it; that God delights to have his mercy magnified in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> things, and by all persons, and at all times, and will not suffer his greatest honour to be most of all undervalued; and therefore as he that would accuse God of injustice were a blasphemer, so he that suspects his mercy, dishonours God as much, and produces in himself that fear which is the parent of trouble, but no instrument of duty.</p>

It is a great mercy that signifies a finall and universall acquittance. God sends it out in little scroles, and excuses you from falling by the sword of the enemy, or the secret stroke of an Angell in the days of the plague; but these are but little entertainments and inticings of our hopes to work on towards the great pardon which is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the leaves of the Book of Life. And it is a mighty folly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to think, that every little line of mercy signifies <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> from the eternall wrath of God; and therefore it is not to be wondred at, that wicked men are unwilling to dye; it is a greater wonder that many of them dye with so little resentment of their danger and their evill. There is reason for them to tremble when the Judge summons them to appear. When his messenger is clothed with horror, and speaks in thunder; when their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is their accuser, and their accusation is great, and their bills uncancell'd, and they have no title to the crosse of Christ, no advocate, no excuse; when God is their enemy, and Christ is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> injur'd person, and the Spirit is grieved, and sicknesse and death come to plead Gods cause against the man; then there is reason that the naturall fears of death should be high and pungent, and those naturall fears encreased by the reasonable and certain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that anger which God hath laid up in heaven for ever, to consume and destroy his enemies.</p>
                  <p>And indeed if we consider upon how trifling and inconsiderable grounds most men hope for pardon (if at least that may be call'd hope, which is nothing but a carelesse boldnesse, and an unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wilfull confidence) we shall see much cause to pity very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> many who are going merrily to a sad and intolerable death.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this we are to reckon the proportions of Gods mercy in forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or his anger in retaining.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin hath obliged us to suffer many evills, even whatsoever <note place="margin">2.</note> the anger of God is pleased to inflict; sicknesse and dishonour, poverty and shame, a caytive spirit, and a guilty conscience, famine and war, plague and pestilence, sudden death and a short life, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death or death eternall, according as God in the severall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Law and Gospel hath expressed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For in the law of <hi>Moses</hi> sin bound them to nothing but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall evills, <note place="margin">3.</note> but they were sore, and heavy, and many; but these only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there were threatned; in the Gospel Christ added the menaces of evills, spirituall and eternall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The great evill of the <hi>Jews</hi> was their abscission and cutting off <note place="margin">4.</note> from being Gods people, to which eternall damnation answers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; and as sicknesse, and war, and other intermediall evills were lesser strokes in order to the finall anger of God against their Nation, so are these and spirituall evills intermediall, in order to the Eternall destruction of sinning and unrepenting Christians.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When God had visited any of the sinners of <hi>Israel</hi> with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sicknesse, then they lay under the evill of their sin, and were not pardoned till God took away the sicknesse; but the taking the evill away, the evill of the punishment, was the pardon of the sin; <hi>to pardon the sin is to spare the sinner:</hi> and this appears; For when Christ had said to the man sick of the palsey, <hi>Son thy sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>thee,</hi> the Pharisees accused him of blasphemy, because none had power to forgive sins but God onely; Christ to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe gives them an ocular demonstration, and proves his words: <hi>that yee may know the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he saith to the man sick of the palsey, Arise and walk;</hi> then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he pardoned the sin, when he took away the sicknesse, and proved the power by reducing it to act: for if pardon of sins be any thing else, it must be <hi>easier</hi> or <hi>harder:</hi> if it be <hi>easier,</hi> then sin hath not so much evill in it as a sicknesse, which no Religion as yet ever taught. If it be <hi>harder,</hi> then Christs power to doe that which was harder, could not be proved by doing that which was easier. It remaines therefore, that it is the same thing to take the punishment away, as to procure or give the pardon; because as the retaining the sin was an obligation to the evill of punishment, so the remitting the sin is the disobliging to its penalty. So farre then the case is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> manifest.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The next step is this, that although in the Gospel God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes sinners with temporall judgements, and sicknesses, and deaths, <note place="margin">6.</note> with sad accidents, and evill Angels, and messengers of wrath; yet besides these lesser strokes, he hath scorpions to chastise, and loads of worse evils to oppresse the disobedient: he punishes one sin with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50231:58"/>
another, vile acts with evill habits, these with a hard heart, and this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with obstinacy, and obstinacy with impenitence, and impenitence with damnation. Now because the worst of evills which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to us are such which consign to hell by persevering in sin, as God takes off our love and our affections, our relations and bondage under sin, just in the same degree he pardons us; because the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sin being taken off and pardoned, there can remaine no guilt. Guiltinesse is an unsignificant word, if there be no obligation to punishment. Since therefore spirituall evils, and progressions in sin, and the spirit of reprobation, and impenitence, and accursed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and perseverance in iniquity are the worst of evils, when these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are taken off, the sin hath lost its venome, and appendant curse; for sin passes on to eternall death onely by the line of impenitence, and it can never carry us to hell, if we repent timely and effectually; in the same degree therefore that any man leaves his sin, just in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree he is pardoned, and he is sure of it. For although curing the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall evill was the pardon of sins among the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet wee must reckon our pardon by curing the spirituall. If I have sinned against God in the shamefull crime of Lust, then God hath pardoned my sins, when upon my repentance and prayers he hath given me the grace of Chastity. My Drunkennesse is forgiven, when I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> acquir'd the grace of Temperance, and a sober spirit. My Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse shall no more be a damning sin, when I have a loving and charitable spirit; loving to do good, and despising the world: for every further degree of sin being a neerer step to hell, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the worst punishment of sin, it follows inevitably, that according as we are put into a contrary state, so are our degrees of pardon, and the worst punishment is already taken off. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall find that the great blessing, and pardon, and redemption which Christ wrought for us, is called <hi>sanctification, holinesse,</hi> and <hi>turning us away from our sins:</hi> So St. <hi>Peter, Yee know that you</hi>

If therefore you are in contestation against sin; while you dwell in difficulty, and sometimes yeeld to sin, and sometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, your pardon is uncertain, and is not discernible in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse; but when sin is mortified and your lusts are dead, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> under the power of grace, and you are <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> all your fears concerning your state of pardon are causelesse, and afflictive without reason; but so long as you live at the old rate of lust or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, of covetousnesse or vanity, of tyranny or oppression, of carelesnesse or irreligion, flatter not your selves, you have no more reason to hope for pardon then a begger for a Crown, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned criminall to be made Heir apparent to that Prince whom he would traiterously have slain.</p>

                  <p>Now because the three great actions of Religion are, <hi>to worship God, to fear God,</hi> and <hi>to trust in him,</hi> by the inordination of these three actions, we may reckon three sorts of this crime; <hi>the excesse of fear,</hi> and <hi>the obliquity in trust,</hi> and <hi>the errors in worship,</hi> are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> three sorts of <hi>superstition:</hi> the first of which is only pertinent to our present consideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Fear is the duty we owe to God as being the God of power and Justice, the great Judge of heaven and earth, the avenger of the cause of Widows, the Patron of the poor, and the Advocate of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, a mighty God and terrible, and so essentiall an enemy to sin, that he spared not his own Son, but gave him over to death, and to become a sacrifice, when he took upon him our Nature, and became a person obliged for our guilt. <hi>Fear</hi> is the great bridle of intemperance, the modesty of the spirit, and the restraint of gaieties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and dissolutions; it is the <hi>girdle</hi> to the soul, and the handmaid to repentance, the arrest of sin, and the cure or antidote to the spirit of reprobation; it preserves our apprehensions of the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and hinders our single actions from combining to sinfull habits; it is the mother of consideration, and the nurse of sober counsels, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50231:62"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it puts the soul to fermentation and activity, making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it to passe from trembling to caution, from caution to carefulnesse, from carefulnesse to watchfulnesse, from thence to prudence, and by the gates and progresses of repentance, it leads the soul on to love, and to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to joyes in God that shall never cease again. Fear is the guard of a man in the dayes of prosperity, and it stands upon the watch-towers and spies the approaching danger, and gives war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them that laugh loud, and feast in the chambers of rejoycing, where a man cannot consider by reason of the noises of wine, and jest, and musick: and if prudence takes it by the hand, and leads <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it on to duty, it is a state of grace, and an universall instrument to infant Religion, and the only security of the lesse perfect persons; and in all senses is that homage we owe to God who sends often to demand it, even then when he speaks in thunder, or smites by a plague, or awakens us by threatning, or discomposes our easinesse by sad thoughts, and tender eyes, and fearfull hearts, and trembling considerations.</p>
                  <p>But this so excellent grace is soon abused in the best and most tender spirits; in those who are softned by Nature and by Religion, by infelicities or cares, by sudden accidents or a sad soul; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and the Devill observing, that fear like spare diet starves the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of lust, and quenches the flames of hell, endevours to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this abstinence so much as to starve the man, and break the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into timorousnesse and scruple, sadnesse and unreasonable trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, credulity and trifling observation, suspicion and false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of God; and then vice being turned out at the gate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in at the postern, and does the work of hell and death by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too inconsiderately in the paths which seem to lead to heaven. But so have I seen a harmlesse dove made dark with an artificiall night, and her eyes ceel'd and lock'd up with a little quill, soaring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> upward and flying with amazement, fear and an undiscerning wing, she made toward heaven, but knew not that she was made a train and an instrument, to teach her enemy to prevail upon her and all her defencelesse kindred: so is a superstitious man, zealous and blinde, forward and mistaken, he runs towards heaven as he thinks, but he chooses foolish paths; and out of fear takes any thing that he is told or fancios; and guesses concerning God by measures ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his own diseases and imperfections. But fear when it is inordinate, is never a good counsellor, nor makes a good friend; and he that fears God as his enemy is the most compleatly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> person in the world. For if he with reason beleeves God to be his enemy, then the man needs no other argument to prove that he is undone then this, that the fountain of blessing (in this state in which the man is) will never issue any thing upon him but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. But if he fears this without reason, he makes his fears true by the very suspicion of God, doing him dishonour, and then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50231:63"/>
those fond and trifling acts of jealousie which will make God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to be what the man feared he already was; We do not know God, if we can think any hard thing concerning him. If God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, let us only fear to offend him; but then let us never be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that he will destroy us when we are carefull not to displease him. There are some persons so miserable and scrupulous, such perpetuall tormentors of themselves with unnecessary fears, that their meat and drink is a snare to their consciences; if they eat, they fear they are gluttons, if they fast, they fear they are hypocrites, and if they would watch, they complain of sleep as of a deadly sin; and every temptation though resisted, makes them cry for pardon; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> every return of such an accident, makes them think God is angry; and every anger of God will break them in pieces.</p>
                  <p>These persons do not beleeve noble things concerning God, they do not think that he is as ready to pardon them, as they are to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a sinning servant; they do not beleeve how much God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in mercy, nor how wise he is to consider and to make abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our unavoidable infirmities; they make judgement of themselves by the measures of an Angell, and take the accounts of God by the proportions of a Tyrant. The best that can be said concerning such persons is, that they are hugely tempted, or huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ignorant. For although <hi>ignorance</hi> is by some persons named <hi>the mother of devotion;</hi> yet if it fals in a hard ground, it is <hi>the mother of Atheisme,</hi> if in a soft ground, it is <hi>the parent of superstition:</hi> but if it proceeds from evill or mean opinions of God, (as such scruples and unreasonable fears do many times) it is an evill of a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and in some sense, and if it were in equall degrees, is as bad as Atheisme; for he that sayes there was no such man as <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> does him lesse displeasure, then he that sayes there was, but that he was a Tyrant, and a bloudy parricide. And the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> were not esteemed impious for saying that there was no sun in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> heavens; But <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was esteemed irreligious for saying the sun was a very stone: And though to deny there is a God is a high impiety and intolerable, yet he sayes worse, who beleeving there is a God sayes, he delights in humane sacrifices, in miseries and death, in tormenting his servants, and punishing their very infelicities and unavoidable mischances. To be God, and to be essentially and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good, is the same thing, and therefore to deny either is to be reckoned among the greatest crimes in the world.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this, that he that is afraid of God, cannot in that disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion love him at all; for what delight is there in that religion which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> drawes me to the Altar as if I were going to be sacrificed, or to the Temples as to the Dens of Bears? <hi>Oderant quos metuunt, sea colunt tamen:</hi> whom men fear they hate certainly, and flatter readily, and worship timorously; and he that saw <hi>Hermolaus</hi> converse with <hi>Alexander;</hi> and <hi>Pausanias</hi> follow <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Macedonian;</hi> or <hi>Chaeteas</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> kissing the feet of <hi>Cajus Caligula</hi> would have observed how fordid men are made with fear, and how unhappy and how hated Tyrants are in the midst of those acclamations, which are loud, and forc'd, and unnaturall, and without love or fair opinion. And therefore although the <hi>Atheist</hi> sayes there is no God, the <hi>scrupulous, fearfull,</hi> and <hi>superstitious man</hi> does heartily with what the other does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p>But that the evill may be proportionable to the folly, and the punishment to the crime, there is no man more miserable in the world, then the man who fears God as his enemy, and Religion as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a snare, and duty as intolerable, and the Commandements as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and his Judge as implacable, and his anger as certain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, and unavoidable: whither shall this man goe? where shall he lay his burden? where shall he take sanctuary? for he fears the Altars as the places where his soul bleeds and dies; and God who is his Saviour he looks upon as his enemy; and because he is Lord of all, the miserable man cannot change his service un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be apparently for a worse. And therefore of all the evils of the minde, <hi>fear</hi> is certainly the worst and the most intolerable; <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>rashnesse</hi> have in it some spritefulnesse, and greatnesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> action; <hi>anger</hi> is valiant; <hi>desire</hi> is busie and apt to hope; <hi>creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is oftentimes entertain'd and pleased with images and appearances: But <hi>fear</hi> is dull, and sluggish, and treacherous, and flattering, and dissembling, and miserable, and foolish. Every false opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God is pernicious and dangerous; but if it be joyned with trouble of spirit, as fear, scruple or superstition are, it is like a wound with an inflamation, or a strain of a sinew with a contusion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the part, painfull and unsafe; it puts on to actions when it self is driven; it urges reason, and circumscribes it, and makes it pityable, and ridiculous in its consequent follies; which if we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> consider it, will sufficiently reprove the folly, and declare the danger.</p>
                  <p>Almost all ages of the world have observed many instances of fond perswasions and foolish practises proceeding from violent fears and scruples in matter of Religion. <hi>Diomedon</hi> and many other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were condemned to dye, because after a great <hi>Naval victory</hi> they pursued the flying enemies, and did not first bury their dead. But <hi>Chabrias</hi> in the same case first buryed the dead, and by that time the enemy rallyed, and returned and beat his Navy, and made his masters pay the price of their importune superstition; they fear'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> where they should not, and where they did not, they should. From hence proceeds observation of signs, and unlucky dayes; and the people did so when the <hi>Gregorian</hi> account began, continuing to call those unlucky dayes which were so signed in their tradition or <hi>Erra pater,</hi> although the day upon this account fell 10 dayes soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and men were transported with many other trifling contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50231:64"/>
and little accidents; which when they are one entertain'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by weaknesse, prevail upon their own strength, and in sad natures and weak spirits have produced effects of great danger and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. <hi>Aristodemas</hi> King of the <hi>Messenians</hi> in his warre against the <hi>Spartans,</hi> prevented the sword of the enemies by a violence done upon himself, only because his dogs howl'd like wolves, and the Soothsayers were afraid because the <hi>Briony</hi> grew up by the wals of his Fathers house: and <hi>Nicias</hi> Generall of the <hi>Athenian</hi> forces sate with his armes in his bosome, and suffered himself and 40000 men tamely to fall by the insolent enemy, only because he was afraid of the labouring and eclipsed Moon. When the Marble statues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in <hi>Rome</hi> did sweat (as naturally they did against all rainy weather) the <hi>Augures</hi> gave an alarum to the City; but if lightning struck the spire of the Capitoll, they thought <hi>the summe of affairs,</hi> and the Commonwealth it self was indanger'd. And this <hi>Heathen folly</hi> hath stuck so close to the <hi>Christian,</hi> that all the Sermons of the Church for 1600 years have not cured them all: But the practises of weaker people and the artifice of ruling Priests have superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many new ones. When Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> sang Masse at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and some few drops from the Chalice were spilt upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was thought to foretell mischief, warres, and bloud, to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Christendome, though it was nothing but carelesnesse and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of the Priest: and because <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sang the Masse of <hi>Requiem</hi> upon the day he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to his Prince, it was thought to foretell his own death by that religious office: and if men can listen to such whispers, and have not reason and observation enough to confute such trifles, they shall still be afrighted with the noise of birds, and every night-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall foretell evill as <hi>Micaiah</hi> to the King of Israel, and every old woman shall be a Prophetesse, and the events of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which should be managed by the conduct of counsell, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and religion, shall succeed by chance, by the flight of birds, and the meeting with an evill eye, by the falling of the salt, or the decay of reason, of wisdome, and the just religion of a man.</p>
                  <p>To this may be reduc'd the observation of dreams, and fears commenced from the fancies of the night. For the superstitious man does not rest, even when he sleeps, neither is he safe because dreams usually are false, but he is afflicted for fear they should tell true. Living and waking men have one world in common, they use the same air and fire, and discourse by the same principles of Logick and reason; but men that are asleep have every one a world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to himself, and strange perceptions; and the superstitious hath none at all; his reason sleeps, and his fears are waking, and all his rest, and his very securities to the fearfull man turn into afrights and insecure expectation of evils, that never shall happen; they make their rest uneasie and chargeable, and they still vex their weary

Dreams follow the temper of the body, and commonly proceed from trouble or disease, businesse or care, an active head and a restlesse minde, from fear or hope, from wine or passion, from fulnesse or emptinesse, from phantastick remembrances or from som <hi>Daemon</hi> good or bad: they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rule and without reason, they are as contingent as if a man should study to make a Prophesie, and by saying 10000 things may hit upon one true, which was therefore not foreknown though it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> forespoken: and they have no certainty because they have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall causality nor proportion to those effects which many times they are said to foresignifie. The dream of the yolk of an egge importeth gold (saith <hi>Artemidorus)</hi> and they that use to remember such phantastick idols are afraid to lose a friend when they dream their teeth shake, when naturally it will rather signifie <hi>a scurvy;</hi> for a naturall indisposition and an imperfect sense of the beginning of a disease, may vex the fancy into a symbolicall representation; for so the man that dreamt he swam against a stream of bloud, had a Plurisie beginning in his side: and he that dreamt he dipt his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> foot in water, and that it was turn'd to a Marble, was intic'd into the fancie by a beginning dropsie: and if the events do answer in one instance, we become credulous in twenty; for want of reason we discourse our selves into folly and weak observation, and give the Devill power over us in those circumstances in which we can least resist him. <gap reason="foreign">

For though it be lawfull to be afraid in a storm, yet it is not lawfull to leap into the sea; though we may be more carefull for our fears, yet we must be faithfull too; and we may flie from the persecution till it overtakes us, but when it does, we must not change our Religion for our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or leave the robe of Baptisme in the hand of the tempter, and run away <hi>by all means.</hi> St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> for 46 years did run and fight, he disputed with the <hi>Arrians</hi> and fled from their Officers; and that flies, may be a man worth preserving, if he bears his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> faith along with him, and leaves nothing of his duty behinde; but when duty and life cannot stand together, he that then flies a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by delivering up his soul, is one that hath no charity, no love to God, no trust in promises, no just estimation of the rewards of a noble contention, <hi>Perfect love casts out fear</hi> (faith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) that is, he that loves God will not fear to dye for him, or for his sake to be poor.

He that denies to give almes for fear of being poor, or to entertain a Disciple for fear of being suspected of the party, or to own a duty for fear of being put to venture for a crown, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he that takes part of the intemperance because he dares not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the company, or in any sense fears the fears of the world, and not the fear of God, this man enters into his portion of fear betimes, but it will not be finished to eternall ages. To fear the censures of men when God is your Judge, to fear their evill when God is your defence, to fear death when he is the entrance to life and felicity, is unreasonable and pernicious; but if you will turn your passion into duty, and joy, and security, fear to offend God, to enter voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into temptation, fear the alluring face of lust, and the smooth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of intemperance, fear the anger of God when you have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> deserved it, and when you have recover'd from the snare, then infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely fear to return into that condition, in which whosoever dwels is the heir of fear and eternall sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I have discoursed concerning good fear and bad, that is, <hi>filiall</hi> and <hi>servile:</hi> they are both good, if by <hi>servile</hi> we intend <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> or the new beginning fear of penitents; a fear to offend God upon lesse perfect considerations: But <hi>servile</hi> fear is vitious when it still retains the affection of slaves, and when its effects are hatred, wearinesse, displeasure, and want of charity: and of the same cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are those fears which are superstitious, and worldly.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But to the former sort of vertuous fear, some also adde another which they call <hi>Angelicall,</hi> that is, such a fear as the blessed Angels have, who before God hide their faces, and tremble at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and <hi>fall down before his footstool,</hi> and are ministers of his anger and messengers of his mercy, and night and day worship him with the profoundest adoration. This is the same that is spoken of in the Text: <hi>Let us serve God with reverence and godly fear;</hi> all holy fear partakes of the nature of this which Divines call <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and it is expressed in acts of adoration, of vowes, and holy prayers, in hymnes, and psalmes, in the eucharist and reverentiall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and while it proceeds in the usuall measures of common duty, it is but <hi>humane;</hi> but as it arises to great degrees, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it is <hi>Angelicall</hi> and <hi>Divine;</hi> and then it appertains to <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Theologie,</hi> and therefore is to be considered in another place; but for the present, that which will regularly concern all our duty, is this, that when the fear of God is the instrument of our duty,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50231:66"/>
or Gods worship, the greater it is, it is so much the better. It was an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> old proverbiall saying among the <hi>Romans, Religentem esse oportet, religiosum, nefas; Every excesse in the actions of religion is crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi> they supposing that in the services of their gods, there might be too much. True it is, there may be too much of their unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expressions, and in things indifferent, the very multitude is too much, and becomes an undecency: and if it be in its own nature undecent or disproportionable to the end, or the rules, or the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Religion, it will not stay for numbers to make it intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but in the direct actions of glorifying God, in doing any thing of his Commandements, or any thing which he commands, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or counsels, or promises to reward, there can never be excesse or superfluity: and therefore in these cases, <hi>do as much as you can;</hi> take care that your expressions be prudent, and safe, consisting with thy other duties; and for the passions or vertues themselves, let them passe from beginning to great progresses, from man to Angel, from the imperfection of man to the perfections of the sons of God; and when ever we go beyond the bounds of Nature, and grow up with all the extention, and in the very commensuration of a full grace, we shall never go beyond the excellencies of God: For ornament may be too much, and turn to curiosity; cleanlinesse may be changed into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nicenesse; and civill compliance may become flattery; and mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tongue may rise into garrulity; and fame and honour may be great unto envie; and health it self, if it be athletick, may by its very excesse become dangerous: but wisdome, and duty, and comelinesse, and discipline, a good minde, and eloquence, and the fear of God, and doing honour to his holy Name, can never exceed: but if they swell to great proportions, they passe through the measures of grace, and are united to felicity in the comprehensions of God, in the joyes of an eternall glory.</p>

The Divine love must come upon us and snatch us from our imperfection, enlighten our understanding, move and stirre our affections, open the gates of heaven, turn our nature into grace, entirely forgive our former prevarications; take us by the hand, and lead us all along, and we onely contribute our assent unto it; just as a childe when he is tempted to learne to goe, and called upon, and guided, and upheld, and constrain'd to put his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feet to the ground, lest he feel the danger by the smart of a fall; just so is our nature and our state of flesh.

Is it not necessary that we take in auxiliaries from Reason and Religion, from heaven and earth, from observation and experience, from hope and fear, and cease to be what we are, left we become what we ought not? It is certain that in the cases of temptations to voluptuousnesse, a man is naturally, as the Prophet said of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> like a Pigeon that hath no heart, no courage, no conduct, no resolution, no discourse, but falls as the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> when it comes to its cataracts, it falls infinitely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> restraint; And if we consider how many drunken meetings the Sunne sees every day, how many Markets and Faires and Clubs, that is, so many solemnities of drunkennesse, are at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant under the eye of heaven; that many <hi>Nations</hi> are marked for intemperance, and that it is lesse noted because it is so popular, and universall, and that even in the midst of the glories of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity there are so many persons drunk, or too full with meat, or greedy of lust, even now that the Spirit of God is given to us to make us sober, and temperate, and chaste, we may well imagine, since all men have flesh, and all men have nor the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> spirit, the flesh is the parent of sin, and death, and it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
                  <p>And it is no otherwise when we are tempted with pain. We are so impatient of pain, that nothing can reconcile us to it; not the laws of God, not the necessities of nature, not the society of all our kindred, and of all the world, not the interest of vertue, not the hopes of heaven; we will submit to pain upon no terms, but the basest and most dishonorable; for if sin bring us to pain, or affront, or sicknesse, we choose that, so it be in the retinue of a lust, and a base desire; but we accuse Nature, and blaspheme God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we murmur and are impatient when pain is sent to us from him that ought to send it, and intends it as a mercy when it comes. But in the matter of afflictions and bodily sicknesse we are so weak and broken, so uneasie and unapt to sufferance, that this alone is beyond the cure of the old Philosophy. Many can endure poverty, and many can retire from shame and laugh at home, and very many can endure to be slaves; but when pain and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are to be endured for the interests of vertue, we finde but few Martyrs; and they that are, suffer more within themselves by their fears and their temptations, by their uncertain purposes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> violences to Nature, then by the Hang-mans sword; the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is within; and then he hath won his Crown, not when he hath suffered the blow, but when he hath overcome his fears, and made his spirit conqueror.

                  <p>We carry about us the body of death, and we bring evils upon our selves by our follies, and then know not how to bear them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the flesh forsakes the spirit. And indeed in sicknesse the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity is so very great, that God in a manner at that time hath reduced all Religion into one vertue, <hi>Patience</hi> with its appendages is the summe totall of almost all our duty that is proper to the days of sorrow: and we shall find it enough to entertain all our powers, and to imploy all our aids; the counsels of wise men, and the comforts of our friends, the advices of Scripture, and the results of experience, the graces of God, and the strength of our own resolutions are all then full of imployments, and find it work enough to secure that one grace. For then it is that a could is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wrapped about our heads, and our reason stoops under sorrow, the soul is sad, and its instrument is out of tune, the auxiliaries are disorder'd, and every thought sits heavily; then a comfort cannot make the body feel it, and the soule is not so abstracted to rejoyce much without its partner; so that the proper joyes of the soul, such as are hope, and wise discourses, and satisfactions of reason, and the offices of Religion, are felt, just as we now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the joyes of heaven, with so little relish, that it comes as news of a victory to a man upon the Rack, or the birth of an heir to one condemned to dye; he hears a story which was made to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> delight him, but it came when he was dead to joy and all its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; and therefore sicknesse, though it be a good <hi>Monitor,</hi> yet it is an ill stage to act some vertues in; and a good man cannot <hi>then</hi> doe much, and therefore he that is in the state of flesh and blood, can doe nothing at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But in these considerations we find our nature in disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and a strong man may be overcome when a stronger comes to disarme him; and pleasure and pain are the violences of choice and chance; but it is no better in any thing else: for nature is weak in all its strengths, and in its fights, at home, and abroad, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in its actions and passions; we love some things violently, and hate others unreasonably; any thing can fright us when we should be confident, and nothing can scare us when we ought to feare; the breaking of a glasse puts us into a supreme anger, and we are dull and indifferent as a <hi>Stoick</hi> when we see God dishonour'd; we passionately desire our preservation, and yet we violently destroy

our selves, and will not be hindred; we cannot deny a friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when he tempts us to sin and death, and yet we daily deny God when he passionately invites us to life and health; we are greedy after money, and yet spend it vainly upon our lusts; we hate to see any man flatter'd but our selves; and we can endure folly if it be on our side, and a sin for our interest; we desire health, and yet we exchange it for wine and madnesse; we sink when a persecution comes, and yet cease not daily to persecute our selves, doing mischiefs worse then the sword of Tyrants, and great as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a Devill.</p>

But to summe up all the evills that can be spoken of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> infirmities of the flesh; the proper nature and habitudes of men are so foolish and impotent, so averse and peevish to all good, that a mans will is of it self onely free to choose evils. Neither is it a contradiction to say <hi>liberty,</hi> and yet <hi>suppose it determin'd to one object onely;</hi> because that one object is the thing we choose. For although God hath set life and death before us, fire and water, good and evill, and hath primarily put man into the hands of his owne counsell, that he might have chosen good as well as evill, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did not, but fell into an evill condition and corrupted manners, and grew in love with it, and infected all his children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with vicious examples; and all nations of the world have contracted some universall stains, and <hi>the thoughts of mans hearts are onely evill, and that continually,</hi> and <hi>there is not one that doth good, no not one that sinneth not:</hi> since (I say) all the world have sinned, we cannot suppose <hi>a liberty of indifferency</hi> to good and bad; it is impossible in such a liberty that there should be no variety, that all should choose the same thing; but <hi>a liberty of complacency</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> we may suppose; that is so, that though naturally he might choose good, yet morally he is so determin'd with his love to evill, that good seldome comes into dispute; and a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> runs to evill as he runs to meat or sleep; for why else should it be, that every one can teach a childe to be proud, or to swear, to lie, or to doe little spites to his play-fellow, and can traine him up to infant follies? But the severity of Tutors and the care of Parents, discipline and watchfulnesse, arts and diligence, all is too little to make him love but to say his prayers, or to doe that which becomes persons design'd for honest purposes, and his malice shall out-run his years; he shall be a man in villany before he is by law capable of choice or inheritance; and this indisposition lasts upon us for ever, even as long as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we live, just in the same degrees as flesh and blood does rule us: <gap reason="foreign">

A resolution (such as we usually make) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little trench which every childe can step over; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there is no civill man that commits a <hi>willing sin,</hi> but he does it  <hi>against his resolution;</hi> and what Christian lives, that will not say, and think, that he hath repented in some degree; and yet still they commit sin, that is, they break all their holy purposes as readily as they lose a dream; and so great is our weaknesse, that to most men the strength of a resolution is just such a restraint as he suffers who is imprisoned in a curtain, and secured with dores and bars of the finest linnen: for though <hi>the spirit be strong</hi> to resolve, <hi>the flesh is weak</hi> to keep it.</p>

matter, or without just consideration, and weighing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> circumstances, or the case is alter'd, and there is a new emergent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, or a vow is no more then a resolution made in matter of duty; both are made for God, and in his eye and witnesse; or if nothing will doe it, men grow sad and weary, and despaire, and are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and bite the knot in pieces, with their teeth, which they cannot by disputing, and the arts of the tongue. A vow will not secure our duty, because it is not stronger then our appetite; and the spirit of man is weaker then the habits and superinduced na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the flesh; but by little and little it falls off, like the finest thread twisted upon the traces of a chariot; it cannot hold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> long.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Beyond all this, some choose excellent guides, and stand within the restraints of modesty, and a severe Monitor; and the Spirit of God hath put a veile upon our spirits, and by <hi>modesty</hi> in women and young persons, by <hi>reputation</hi> in the more aged, and by <hi>honour</hi> in the more noble, and by <hi>conscience</hi> in all, have fortified the spirit of Man, that men dare not prevaricate their duty though they be tempted strongly, and invited perpetually; and this is a partition wall that separates the spirit from the flesh, and keeps it in its proper strengths and retirements. But here the spirit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man, for all that it is assisted, strongly breaks from the inclosure, and runnes into societies of flesh, and sometimes despises <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and sometimes supplies it with little arts of flattery, and self-love, and is modest as long as it can be secret, and when it is discovered, it growes impudent; and a man shelters himselfe in crouds and heaps of sinners, and beleeves that it is no worse with him then with other mighty criminals, and publick persons, who bring sin into credit amongst fooles and vicious persons; or else men take false measures of fame or publick honesty, and the world being broken into so many parts of disunion, and agreeing in nothing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in confederate vices, and grown so remisse in governments, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere accounts, every thing is left so loose, that <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick fame, modesty,</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> are now so slender guards to the spirit, that the flesh breaks in and makes most men more bold against God then against men, and against the laws of Religion, then of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When the spirit is made willing by the grace of God, the flesh interposes in deceptions and false principles. If you tempt some man to a notorious sin, as to rebellion, to deceive his trust, or to be drunk, he will answer, he had rather die then doe it: But put the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sin civilly to him, and let it be disguised with little excuses, such things which indeed are trifles, but yet they are colours fair enough to make a weak pretence, and the spirit yeelds instantly. Most men choose the sin, if it be once disputable whether it be a sin or no? If they can but make an excuse, or a colour, so that it shall not rudely
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50231:72"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dash against the conscience with an open professed name of Sin, they suffer the temptation to doe its worst. If you tempt a man, you must tell him 'tis no sin, or it is excusable: this is not rebellion, but necessity, and selfe-defence; it is not against my allegiance, but is a performing of my trust; I doe it for my friend, not against my Superiour; I doe it for a good end, and for his advantage; this is not drunkennesse, but free mirth, and fair society; it is refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and entertainment of some supernumerary hours; but it is not a throwing away my time, or neglecting a day of salvation; and if there be any thing more to say for it, though it be no more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then <hi>Adams</hi> fig-leaves, or the excuses of children and truants, it shall be enough to make the flesh prevail, and the spirit not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; for so great is our folly, that the flesh always carries the cause, if the spirit can be cousen'd.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The flesh is so mingled with the spirit, that we are forced to make distinctions in our appetite, to reconcile our affections to God and Religion, lest it be impossible to doe our duty; we weep for our sins, but we weep more for the death of our dearest friends, or other temporall sadnesses; we say we had rather die then lose our saith, and yet we doe not live according to it; we lose our estates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and are impatient, we lose our vertue and bear it well enough; and what vertue is so great, as more to be troubled for having sin'd, then for being asham'd, and begger'd, and condemn'd to die? Here we are forced to a distinction: there is a <hi>valuation of price,</hi> and a <hi>valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of sense:</hi> or the spirit hath <hi>one rate</hi> of things, and the flesh hath <hi>another;</hi> and what we beleeve the greatest evill, does not alwayes cause to us the greatest trouble; which shews plainly, that we are imperfect carnall persons, and the flesh will in some measure prevaile over the spirit; because we will suffer it in too many instances, and cannot help it in all.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 9. The spirit is abated and interrupted by the flesh, because the flesh pretends it is not able to doe those ministeries which are appointed in order to Religion; we are not able to fast, or if we watch, it breeds gouts and catarrhes; or charity is a grace too expensive, our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are too big to do it; or we cannot suffer pain; and <hi>sorrow breeds death,</hi> and therefore our repentances must be more gentle, and we must support our selves in all our calamities: for we cannot beare our crosses without a freer refreshment, and this freedome passes on to licence, and many melancholy persons drowne their sorrows in sin and forgetfulnesse, as if sin were more tolerable then sorrow, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the anger of God an easier load then a temporall care: here the flesh betrayes its weaknesse and its follies: For the flesh complains too soon, and the spirit of some men like <hi>Adam</hi> being too fond of his <hi>Eve,</hi> attends to all its murmurs and temptations; and yet the flesh is able to bear farre more then is required of it in usuall duties. Custome of suffering will make us endure much, and <hi>feare</hi> will make

And what shall we doe to secure our duty, and to be delivered of our selves, that the body of death which we bear about us may not destroy the life of the spirit?</p>
                  <p>I have all this while complain'd, and you see not without cause; I shall afterwards tell you the remedies for all this evill. In the mean time, let us have but mean opinions of our selves; let us watch every thing of our selves as of suspected persons, and magnifie the grace of God, and be humbled for our stock and spring of follies, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> let us look up to him who is the fountaine of grace and spirituall strengths.</p>

But <hi>Prayer is but one part of devotion;</hi> and though of admirable efficacy towards the obtaining this excellent promise, yet it is to be assisted by the other parts of <hi>devotion,</hi> to make it a perfect remedy to our great evill.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 4. I am now to consider, how farre the infirmities of the flesh can be innocent, and consist with the spirit of grace. For all these counsels are to be entertain'd into a willing spirit, and not only so, but into an active: and so long as the spirit is only willing, the weaknesse of the flesh will in many instances become stronger then the strengths of the spirit. For he that hath a good will, and does not do good actions which are required of him, <hi>is hindred,</hi> but not by God that requires them, and therefore by himself, or his worst enemy. But the measures of this question are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the flesh hinders us of our duty, it is our enemy; and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our misery is not, that the flesh is weak, but that it is too strong; But 2. when it abates the degrees of duty and stops its growth, or its passing on to action and effect, then <hi>it is weak, but not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor alwaies criminall.</hi> But to speak particularly.</p>
                  <p>If our flesh hinders us of any thing that is a direct duty, and prevails upon the spirit to make it do an evill action, or contract an evill habit, the man is in a state of bondage and sin: his flesh is the mother of corruption, and an enemy to God. It is not enough to say, I desire to serve God, and cannot as I would: I would fain love God above all the things in the world, but the flesh hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> appetites of its own that must be served: <hi>I pray</hi> to be forgiven as I forgive others; but flesh and bloud cannot put up such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: for know that no infirmity, no unavoidable accident, no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, no poverty, no businesse can hinder us from the love of God, or forgiving injuries, or being of a religious and a devout spirit; Poverty and the intrigues of the world are things that can no more hinder the spirit in these duties, then a strong enemy can hinder the sun to shine, or the clouds to drop rain. These things which God requires of us, and exacts from us with mighty penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, these he hath made us able to perform; for he knows that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we have no strength but what he gives us; and therefore as he binds burdens upon our shoulders, so he gives us strength to bear them; and therefore he that sayes he cannot forgive, sayes only that his lust is stronger then his religion; his flesh prevails upon his spirit. For what necessity can a man have to curse him whom he cals ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? or to sue him, or kill him, or do him any spite? A man may serve all his needs of nature, though he does nothing of all this; and if he be willing, what hinders him to love, to pardon to wish well, to desire? The willing is the doing in this case; and he that sayes he is willing to do his duty, but he cannot, does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> what he sayes. For all the duty of the inner man consists in the actions of the will, and there they are seated, and to it all the inferiour faculties obey in those things which are direct emanations, and effects of will. He that desires to love God, does love him; indeed men are often cousened with pretences, and in some good mood are warm'd with a holy passion, but it signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50231:79"/>
because they will not quit the love of Gods enemies; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> therefore they do not desire, what they say they doe: but if the will and heart be right, and not false and dissembling, this duty is, or will be done infallibly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the spirit and the heart be willing, it will passe on to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions in all things where it ought, or can. He that hath a charitable soul will have a charitable hand; and will give his money to the poor, as he hath given his heart to God: For these things which are in our hand are under the power of our will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be commanded by it. He that sayes to the naked, <hi>be warm and cloathed,</hi> and gives him not the garment that lies by him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or money to buy one, mocks <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>himself. Nequam illud verbum est, bene vult, nisi qui bene facit,</hi> said the Comedy; <hi>It</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Trinummus.</note> 
                     <hi>is an evill saying, he wishes well, unlesse he do well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those things which are not in our power, that is, such things in which the flesh is inculpably weak, or naturally, or politically dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, the will does the work of the outward and of the inward man; we cannot cloath Christs body, he needs it not; and we cannot approach so sacred and separate a presence; but if we desire to do it, it is accounted as if we had. The ignorant man cannot discourse wisely and promote the interest of souls, but he can love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> souls, and desire their felicity; though I cannot build Hospitals and Colledges, or pour great summes of money into the lap of the poor, yet if I incourage others and exhort them, if I commend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the work, I have done the work of a holy Religion. For in these and the like cases, the outward work is not alwaies set in our power; and therefore without our fault is omitted, and can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by that which is in our power.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For that is the last caution, concerning this question. <hi>No man is to be esteemed of a willing spirit, but he that endevours to doe the outward work, or to make all the supplies that he can;</hi> not only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by the forwardnesse of his spirit, but by the compensation of some other charities, or devotion, or religion. <hi>Silver and gold have I none,</hi> and therefore I can give you none: But I wish you well; How will that appear? why thus, <hi>Such as I have I will give you: Rise up and walk.</hi> I cannot give you gold, but I can give you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; I cannot relieve your need, but I can relieve your sadnesse; I cannot cure you, but I can comfort you; I cannot take away your poverty, but I can ease your spirit; and <hi>God accepts us</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.</hi> Only as our desires are great, and our spirits are willing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so we shall finde wayes to make supply of our want of ability and expressed liberality.</p>

In this world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we see it is quite contrary: we long for perishing meat, and fill our stomachs with corruption; we look after white and red, and the weaker beauties of the night; we are passionate after rings and seals, and inraged at the breaking of a Crystall; we delight in the society of fools and weak persons; we laugh at sin, and contrive mischiefs; and the body rebels against the soul, and carries the cause against all its just pretences; and our soul it self is above half of it earth, and stone in its affections, and distempers; our hearts are hard, and inflexible to the softer whispers of mercy and compassion, having no loves for any thing but strange flesh, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and heaps of money, and popular noises, for misery and folly; and therefore we are a huge way off from the Kingdome of God, whose excellencies, whose designs, whose ends, whose constitution is spirituall and holy, and separate, and sublime, and perfect. Now between these two states of <hi>naturall flesh,</hi> and <hi>heavenly spirit,</hi> that is, the powers of darknesse, and the regions of light, the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of man, and the perfections of God; the imperfection of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where we stand by our creation, and supervening follies, and that state of felicities whither we are designed by the mercies of God, there is a middle state; <hi>the Kingdome of grace</hi> wrought for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us by our Mediator, <hi>the man Christ Jesus,</hi> who came to perfect the vertue of Religion, and the designs of God, and to reforme our Nature, and to make it possible for us to come to that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall state where all felicity does dwell.

while the spirit prevails, we do not to evill purposes of abatement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> converse with flesh and bloud, this service is also <hi>fervent, intense, active, wise, and busie,</hi> according to the nature of things spirituall.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fail in either, we do <hi>the Lords work deceitfully,</hi> and then we are accursed. For so saith the Spirit of God; <hi>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here then is the duty of us all: 1. God requires of us to serve him with an integrall, intire, or a whole worship and religion. 2. God requires of us to serve him with earnest and intense affections; The intire purpose of both which, I shall represent in its severall parts by so many propositions. 3.

                  <p n="1">1. For, to worship God with our souls consesses one of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ateributes; it declares him to be the searcher of hearts, and that he reads the secret purposes, and beholds the smallest arrests <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of fancy, and bends in all the flexures and intriques of crafty peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and searches out every plot and trifling conspiracy against him, and against our selves, and against our brethren.</p>

This service distinguishes our duty towards God from all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conversation with man, and separates the divine commandements from the imperfect decrees of Princes and Republiques; for these are satisfied by the outward work, and cannot take any other cognisance of the heart, and the will of man, but as himself is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to signifie. He that wishes the <hi>fiscus</hi> empty, and that all the revenues of the Crown were in his counting-house, cannot be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the Lawes, unlesse himself become his own traytor and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser; and therefore what man cannot discern, he must not judge, and must not require? but God sees it and judges it, and requires it, and therefore reserves this as his own portion and the chiefest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> feudall right of his Crown.</p>

But he that seals up a fountain, may drink up all the waters alone, and may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> best appoint the channels where it shall run, and what grounds it shall refresh.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That I may summe up many reasons in one; God by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the heart secures the <hi>perpetuity</hi> and <hi>perseverance</hi> of our duty, and its <hi>sincerity,</hi> and its <hi>integrity,</hi> and its <hi>perfection:</hi> for so also God takes account of little things; it being all one in the heart of man, whether maliciously it omits a duty in a small instance or in a great; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the expression hath variety and degrees in it in relation to those purposes of usefulnesse and charity whither God designs it, yet the obedience and disobedience is all one, and shall be equally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> accounted for; and therefore the Jew <hi>Tryphon</hi> disputed against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> that the precepts of the Gospell were impossible to be kept, because it also requiring the heart of man did stop every egression of disorders: for making the root holy and healthfull, as the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same of <hi>Judaea,</hi> or the drops of Manna in the evening of the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; it also causes that nothing spring thence but gummes sit for incense, and oblations for the Altar of proposition, and a cloud of perfume fit to make atonement for our sins, and being united to the great sacrifice of the world to reconcile God and man together. Upon these reasons you see it is highly fit that God should require <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it, and that we should pay the <hi>sacrifice of our hearts;</hi> and not at all think that God is satisfied with the work of the hands, when the affections of the heart are absent. He that prayes because he would be quiet, and would fain be quit of it, and communicates for fear of the lawes, and comes to Church to avoid shame, and gives almes to be eased of an importunate begger, or relieves his old parents because they will not dye in their time, and provides for his children lest he be compeld by Lawes and shame, but yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the charge of Gods blessings, this man is a servant of the eyes of men, and offers parchment or a white skin in sacrifice, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the flesh and the inwards he leaves to be consumed by a stranger fire. And therefore this is a deceit that robs God of the best, and leaves that for religion which men pare off: It is sacriledge, and brings a double curse.</p>

perswasion. The faith and the cause of God must be owned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> publiquely; for if it be the cause of God, it will never bring us to shame. I do not say, what ever we think, we must tell it to all the world, much lesse at all times, and in all circumstances; but we must never deny that which we beleeve to be the cause of God in such circumstances in which we can and ought to glorifie him. But this extends also to other instances. He that swears a false oath with his lips, and unswears it with his heart, hath deceived one more then he thinks for; himself is the most abused person: and when my action is contrary to men they will reprove me, but when it is against my own perswasion, I cannot but reprove my self; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> am witnesse, and accuser, and party, and guilty, and then God is the Judge, and his anger will be a fierce executioner, because <hi>we do the Lords work deceitfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They are deceitfull in the Lords work that reserve one facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for sin, or one sin for themselves, or one action to please their appetite, and many for Religion. Rabbt Kimchi</hi> taught his Scholars, <hi>Cogitationem pravam Deus non habet vice facti, nisi concepta fuerit in Dei sidem &amp; Religionem;</hi> that God is never angry with an evill thought, unlesse it be a thought of Apostasie from the Jewes religion; and therefore, provided that men be severe and close in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their sect and party, they might roll in lustfull thoughts; and the torches they light up in the Temple might smoke with <hi>anger</hi> at one end, and <hi>lust</hi> at the other, so they did not flame out in egres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of violence and injustice, in adulteries and fouler complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: nay they would give leave to some degrees of evill actions; for <hi>R. Moses</hi> and <hi>Selomoh</hi> taught, that if the most part of a mans actions were holy and just, though in one he sinned often, yet the greater ingredient should prevail, and the number of good works should out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the lesser account of evill things; and this <hi>Pharisaicall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> is too frequent even amongst Christians. For who almost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is there that does not count fairly concerning himself, if he reckons many vertues upon the stock of his Religion, and but one vice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stock of his infirmity; half a dozen to God, and one for his company, or his friend; his education, or his appetite? and if he hath parted from his folly, yet he will remember the fleshpots, and please himself with a phantastick sin, and call it home through the gates of his memory, and place it at the door of fancy, that there he may behold it and consider concerning what he hath parted withall, out of the fears and terrors of religion, and a necessary unavoidable conscience. Do not many men go from sin to sin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> even in their repentance? they go backward from sin to sin, and change their crime as a man changes his uneasie load, and shakes it off from one shoulder to support it with the other. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny severe persons, virgins and widows are so pleased with their chastity, and their abstinence even from lawfull mixtures, that by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50231:83"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this means they fall into a worse pride? insomuch that I remember St. <hi>Austin</hi> said, <hi>Audco dicere superbis continentibus expedit cadere,</hi> they that are chaste and proud, it is sometimes a remedy for them to fall into sin, and by the shame of lust to cure the devill of pride, and by the sin of the body to cure the worser evils of the spirit; and therefore he addes, that he did beleeve, God in a severe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did permit the barbarous nations, breaking in upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to violate many virgins professed in Cloisters and religious Families to be as a mortification of their pride, lest the accidentall advantages of a continent life should bring them into the certain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> miseries of a spirituall death, by taking away their humility, which was more necessary then their virgin state; It is not a cure that men may use, but God permits it sometimes with greater safety through his wise conduct and over-ruling providence; St. <hi>Peter</hi> was safer by his fall (as it fell out in the event of things) then by his former confidence. Man must never cure a sin by a sin; but he that brings good out of our evill, he can when he please. But I speak it, to represent how deceitfully many times we do the work of the Lord. We reprove a sinning Brother, but do it with a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous spirit; we separate from scandall, and do it with glory, and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> gaudy heart; we are charitable to the poor, but will not forgive our unkinde enemies; or we powre relief into their bags, but we please our selves and drink drunk, and hope to commute with God, giving the fruit of our labours or effluxes of money for the sin of our souls: And upon this account it is that two of the noblest graces of a Christian are to very many persons made <hi>a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death,</hi> though they were intended for the beginning and the promotion of an eternal life; and those are <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> some men think if they have <hi>faith,</hi> it is enough to answer all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of sin which our consciences or the Devils make against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us: If I be a wanton person, yet my faith shall hide it, and faith shall cover the follies of drunkennesse, and I may all my life relye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>faith,</hi> at last to quit my scores. For he that is most carefull is not innocent, but must be saved by <hi>faith,</hi> and he that is least carefull may have <hi>faith,</hi> and that will save him. But because these men mistake concerning faith, and consider not that charity or a good life is a part of that faith that saves us, they hope to be saved by the <hi>Word,</hi> they fill their bellies with the story of <hi>Frimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions</hi> banquet, and drink drunk with the newes of wine, they eat shadows, and when they are drowning, catch at the image of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> trees which hang over the water, and are reflected from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
                  <p>But thus many men do with charity, <hi>[Give almes and all things shall be clean unto you,</hi> said our <hi>Blessed Saviour:]</hi> and therefore, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny keep a sin alive, and make account to pay for it, and God shall be put to relieve his own poor at the price of the sin of another of

his servants; charity shall take lust or intemperance into protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and men will not be kinde to their brethren, unlesse they will be also at the same time unkinde to God. I have understood concerning divers vicious persons, that none have been so free in their donatives and offerings to Religion and the Priest as they: and the Hospitals that have been built, and the High-wayes mended at the price of souls, are too many for Christendome to boast of in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of charity. But as others mistake concerning faith, so these do concerning its twin sister. The first had <hi>faith without charity,</hi> and these have <hi>charity without hope;</hi> for <hi>every one that hath this hope,</hi> that is, the hope of receiving the glorious things of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> promised in the Gospell, <hi>purifies himself even as God is pure;</hi> faith and charity too, must both suppose repentance; and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the abolition of the whole body of sin, the purification of the whole man. But the summe of the Doctrine and case of conscience in this particular is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Charity is a certain cure of sins that are past, not that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> He that repents and leaves his sin, and then relieves the poor and payes for his folly by a diminution of his own estate, and the supplies of the poor, and his ministring to Christs poor members, turns all his former crimes into holinesse; he purges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the stains and makes amends for his folly, and commutes for the baser pleasure with a more noble usage: so said <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar [Break off thy sins by righteousnesse, and thine iniquities</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Den. 4. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>by shewing mercy to the poor:]</hi> first be just, and then be charitable; for it is pity almes, which is one of the noblest services of God, and the greatest mercy to thy Brother, should be spent upon sin, and thrown away upon folly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith is</hi> the remedy of all our evils, but then it is never <hi>of force, but when we either have endevoured or undertaken to do all good; this</hi> in baptisme, <hi>that</hi> after: <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> at first; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> at last; and because we fail often by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and sometimes by inadvertency, sometimes by a surprize, and often by omission; and all this even in the midst of a sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to live justly, and perfectly; therefore the passion of our Lord payes for <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> layes hold upon <hi>that.</hi> But without a hearty and sincere intent, and vigorous prosecution of all the parts of our duty, <hi>faith is but a word,</hi> not so much as a cover to a naked bosome, nor a pretence big enough to deceive persons that are not willing to be cousened.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The bigger ingredient of vertue and evill actions will prevail,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but it is only <hi>when vertue is habituall, and sins are single, interrupted, casuall and seldome, without choice</hi> and <hi>without affection;</hi> that is, when our repentance is so timely that it can work for God, more then we served under the tyranny of sin; so that if you will account the whole life of man, the rule is good, and the greater ingredient
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50231:84"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> shal prevail, and he shall certainly be pardoned and accepted whose life is so reformed, whose repentance is so active, whose return is so early, that he hath given bigger portions to God then to Gods enemy.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> part cannot prevail; a small or a seldome sin spoils not the sea of piety; but when the affection is divided, a little ill destroyes the whole body of good; the cup in a mans right hand must be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it must be pure although it be mingled; that is, the whole affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be for God, <hi>that</hi> must be pure and unmingled; if sin min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles in seldome and unapproved instances, the drops of water are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> swallowed up with a whole vintage of piety, and the bigger ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient is the prevailing; in all other cases it is not so: for one sin that we choose and love and delight in, will not be excused by 20 vertues: and as one broken link dissolves the union of the whole chain, and one jarring and untuned string spoils the whole musick; so is every sin that seises upon a portion of our affections; if we love one, that one destroyes the acceptation of all the rest; And as it is in faith, so it is in charity. He that is a Heretick in one article, hath no saving faith in the whole; and so does every vicious habit, or unreformed sin destroy the excellency of the grace of charity; a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wilfull error in one article is Heresie, and every vice in one instance is Malice, and they are perfectly contrary, and a direct darknesse to the two eyes of the soul, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is one deceit more yet, in the matter of the extension of our duty, destroying the integrity of its constitution: for they do the work of God deceitfully, who think God sufficiently served with <hi>abstinence from evill,</hi> and converse not in the acquisition and pursuit of holy charity and religion.

Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vivacity, quicknesse and delight, perfect choyce of the service, and a delight in the prosecution, is all that the spirit of a man can yeeld towards his Religion: the outward work is the effect of the body; but if a man does it heartily and with all his mind, then religion hath wings and moves upon wheels of fire; and therefore when our blessed Saviour made those <hi>capitulars</hi> and <hi>canons</hi> of Religion, to <hi>love God, and to love our neighbors;</hi> besides, that the materiall part of the duty <hi>[love]</hi> is founded in the spirit, as its naturall seat, he also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> gives <hi>three words</hi> to involve the <hi>spirit</hi> in the action, and <hi>but one</hi> for the <hi>body: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy mind; and</hi> lastly, <hi>with all thy strength;</hi> this brings in the body too; because it hath some strengths, and some significations of its own; but <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> mean all the same thing in a stronger and more earnest expression; that is, that we doe it hugely, as much as we can, with a cleer choice, with a resolute understanding, with strong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with great diligence: <hi>Enerves animos odisse virtus solet,</hi> Vertue hates weak and ineffective minds, and tame easie prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                     <hi>period</hi> of Religion.

1. It is a state of the greatest imprudence in the world; for it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> makes a man to spend his labour for that which profits not, and to deny his appetite for an unsatisfying interest; he puts his moneys in a napkin; and he that does so, puts them into a broken bag; he loses the principall for not encreasing the interest. He that dwells in a state of life that is unacceptable, loses the money of his almes, and the rewards of his charity, his hours of prayer, and his parts of justice; he confesses his sins and is not pardoned, he is patient, but hath no hope, and he that is gone so far towards his countrey, and stands in the middle way, hath gone so far out of his way; he had better have stay'd under a dry roof, in the house of banishment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then to have left his <hi>Gyarus,</hi> the Island of his sorrow, and to dwell upon the <hi>Adriatick:</hi> So is he that begins a state of Religion, and does not finish it; he abides in the high-way, and though he be neerer the place, yet is as far from the rest of his countrey as ever; and therefore all that beginning of labour was in the prejudice of his rest, but nothing to the advantages of his hopes. He that hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begun, hath lost no labour; <hi>Jactura praeteritorum,</hi> the losse of all that he hath done, is the first evill of the negligent and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Christian; according to the saying of <hi>Solomon: He that is remisse or idle in his labour, is the brother of him that scattereth</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                     <hi>his goods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second appendant evill is, that <hi>lukewarmnesse is the occasion of greater evill;</hi> because the remisse easie Christian shuts the gate against the heavenly breathings of Gods holy Spirit; he thinks every breath that is fan'd by the wings of the holy Dove, is not intended to encourage his fires, which burn, and smoke, and peep through the cloud already; it tempts him to security; and if an evill life be a certain inlet to a second death, <hi>despaire</hi> on one side, and <hi>security</hi> on the other are the bars and locks to that dore, he can never passe forth again while that state remains; who ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> slips in his spirituall walking does not presently fall; but if that slip does not awaken his diligence, and his caution, then his ruine begins, <hi>vel pravae institutionis deceptus exordio, aut per longam mentis incuriam, &amp; virtute animi decidente,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes; either upon the pursuit of his first error, or by a carelesse spirit, or a decaying slackned resolution; all which are the direct effects of lukewarmnesse. But so have I seen a fair structure begun with art and care, and raised to halfe its stature, and then it stood still by the misfortune or negligence of the owner, and the rain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, and dwelt in its joynts, and supplanted the contexture of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> its pillars, and having stood a while like the antiquated Temple of a deceased Oracle, it fell into a hasty age, and sunk upon its owne knees, and so descended into ruine: So is the imperfect, unfinished spirit of a man; it layes the foundation of a holy resolution, and strengthens it with vows and arts of prosecution, it raises up the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50231:87"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Sacraments, and Prayers, Reading, and holy Ordinances; and holy actions begin with a slow motion, and the building stays, and the spirit is weary, and the soul is naked, and exposed to temptation, and in the days of storm take in every thing that can doe it mischief; and it is faint and sick, listlesse and tired, and it stands till its owne weight wearies the foundation, and then declines to death and sad disorder, being so much the worse, because it hath not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to its first follies, but hath superadded <hi>unthankfulnesse</hi> and <hi>carelesnesse,</hi> a positive neglect, and a despite of holy things, a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a low price to the things of God, lazinesse and wretchlesnesse; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all which are evills superadded to the first state of coldnesse, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is with all these loads and circumstances of death easily revolv'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A state of lukewarmnesse is more incorrigible then a state of coldnesse; while men flatter themselves that their state is good, that they are rich and need nothing, that their lamps are dressed, and full of ornament. There are many that think they are in their countrey as soon as ever they are weary, and measure not the end of their hopes by the possession of them, but by their precedent labour, which they overvalue, because they have easie and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> souls. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> complains of some that say, <hi>Sufficit nobis, nolumus esse meliores quàm Patres nostri:</hi> It is enough for us to be as our forefathers, who were honest and usefull in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but <hi>be not over-righteous:</hi> These men are such as think they have knowledge enough to need no teacher, devotion enough to need no new fires, perfection enough to need no new progresse, justice enough to need no repentance; and then because the spirit of a man and all the things of this world are in perpetuall variety and change, these men decline when they have gone their period; they stand still, and then revert; like a stone returning from the bosome of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cloud, where it rested as long as the thought of a childe, and fell to its naturall bed of earth, and dwelt below for ever. He that says he will take care he be no worse, and that he desires to be no better, stops his journey into heaven, but cannot be secure against his descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell: and <hi>Cassian</hi> spake a hard saying, <hi>Frequentèr vidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus de frigidis &amp; carnalibus ad spiritualem venisse fervorem, de tepidis &amp; animalibus omninò non vidimus:</hi> Many persons from vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50231:88"/>
intolerable character; and the sense of honour, and the care of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> persons, and their love of civill societie, and every thing in the world can invite them towards vertues. But the man that is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honest, and does justice, and some things of Religion, unlesse he finds himselfe but upon his way, and feels his wants, and groans under the sense of his infirmities, and sighs under his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and accounts himself <hi>not to have comprehended,</hi> but <hi>still presses towards the mark of his calling,</hi> unlesse (I say) he still increases in his appetites of Religion as he does in his progression, he will think he needs no counsellor, and the spirit of God whispers to an ear that is already fill'd with noyses, and cannot attend to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> heavenly calling. The stomach that is already full, is next to loathing, and that's the prologue to sicknesse, and a rejecting the first wholesome nutriment which was entertained to relieve the first naturall necessities: <hi>Qui non proficit vult deficere,</hi> said S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard:</hi> He that goes not forward in the love of God, and of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does not stand still, but goes for all that, but whither such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will lead him, himself without a timely care shall feel by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable experiment.</p>
                  <p>In this sense and for these reasons it is that although a lukewarm Christian hath gone forward some steps towards a state of holynesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and is advanced beyond him that is cold, and dead, and unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore speaking <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>naturally,</hi> is neerer the Kingdome of God then he, that is not yet set out; yet <hi>accidentally,</hi> and by reason of these ill appendages, he is worse, in greater danger, in a state equally unacceptable, and therefore must either goe forward, and still doe the work of God carefully, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a Fervent spirit, and an Active hand, with a willing heart, and a chearefull eye, or it had been better he had never begun.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It concerns us next to enquire concerning the duty in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> instances, that we may perceive to what parts and degrees of duty it amounts; we shall find it especially in the duties of <hi>faith,</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> and of <hi>charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our faith must be strong, vigorous, active, confident, and patient, reasonable, and unalterable, without doubting, and feare, and partiality. For the faith of very many men, seems a duty so weak and indifferent, is so often untwisted by violence, or ravel'd and intangled in weak discourses, or so false and fallacious by its mixture of interest, that though men usually put most confidences in the pretences of faith, yet no pretences are more unreasonable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our faith and perswasions in Religion is most commonly imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us by our country, and we are Christians at the same rate as we are <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or of such a family; our reason is first stained and spotted with the dye of our kindred, and country, and our educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on puts it in grain, and whatsoever is against this we are taught to call a

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> temptaiton: in the mean time we call these accidentall and artificiall perswasions by the name of <hi>faith,</hi> which is onely the aire of the countrey, or an heireloome of the family, or the daughter of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent interest. Whatever it was that brought us in, we are to take care that when we are in, our faith be noble, and stand upon its most proper and most reasonable foundation; it concerns us better to understand that Religion which we call Faith, and that faith whereby we hope to be saved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The faith and the whole Religion of many men is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of fear. Men are threatned into their perswasions, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> iron rod of a Tyrant converts whole nations to his principles, when the wise discourses of the Religion seems dull as sleep, and unprevailing as the talk of childhood. That's but a deceitfull faith which our timorousnesse begot, and our weaknesse nurses, and brings up. The Religion of a Christian is immortall, and certaine, and perswasive, and infallible, and unalterable, and therefore needs not be received by humane and weake convoyes, like worldly and mortall Religions: that faith is lukewarm, and easie, and trifling, which is onely a beleef of that which a man wants courage to disbeleeve.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 3. The faith of many men is such, that they dare not trust it: they will talk of it, and serve vanity, or their lust, or their company, or their interest by it, but when the matter comes to a pinch, they dare not trust it. When <hi>Antisthenes</hi> was initiated into the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the Priest told him, that all that were of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <note place="margin">His qui sacris visis abeunt ad inferos Homines beati sunt, solis quia vivere Contingit illic istis, turba cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera Omnium malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum generi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit.</note> immediately after death should be perfectly happy; the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher asked him, why he did not dye if he beleeved what he said? such a faith as that, was fine to talk of at table, or eating the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Religion, when the mystick man was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> full of wine and flesh, of confidence and religion; but to dye, is a more material <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> consideration, and to be chosen upon no grounds, but such a faith which really comes from God, and can secure our reason, and our choyce, and perfect our interest and designes. And it hath been long observed concerning those bold people that use their reason against God that gave it, they have one perswasion in their health, and another in their sicknesse, and fears; when they are well, they blaspheme, when they die, they are superstitious; It was <hi>Bias</hi> his case when he was poyson'd by the Atheismes of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> no man died more like a coward and a fool; <hi>as if the gods were to come and goe as</hi> Bias <hi>pleased to think and talk:</hi> so one said of his folly. If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God be to be feared when we die, he is also to be feared in all our life, for he can for ever make us die; he that will doe it once, and that when he please, can alwayes. And therefore all those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions against God, and against Religion, are onely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of vicious passions, of drink or fancy, of confidence and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, of boldnesse or vile appetites, of vanity or fiercenesse, of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50231:89"/>
pride or flatteries; and Atheisine is a proportion so unnaturall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> monstrous, that it can never dwell in a mans heart <hi>as faith does,</hi> in health and sicknesse, in peace and warre, in company and alone, at the beginning and at the end of a designe; but comes from weake principles, and leaves shallow and superficiall impressions; but when men endevour to strengthen and confirme it, they onely strive to make themselves worse then they can. Naturally a man cannot be an Atheist: for he that is so, must have something within him that is worse either then man or devill.</p>

He that asks with a doubting mind, and a lazy desire, begs for nothing but to be denyed; we must in our prayers be earnest, and fervent, or else we shall have but a cold answer; for God gives his grace according as we can receive it; and whatsoever evill returnes we meet in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when we ask for good things, is wholly by reason of our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring spirits, and cold desires; we have reason to complain that our minds wander in our prayers, and our diversions are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then all our arts of application, and detention; and we wander sometimes even when we pray against wandring: and it is in some degrees naturall, and unevitable: but although the evill is not wholly to be cured, yet the symptomes are to be eased; and if our desires were strong, and fervent, our minds would in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be present; we see it by a certain and regular experience; what we love passionately, we perpetually think on, and it returnes upon us whether we will or no; and in a great fear the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion cannot be shaken off; and therefore if our desires of holy things were strong and earnest, we should most certainly attend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our prayers: it is a more violent affection to other things that carries us off from this; and therefore if we lov'd passionately what we aske for daily, we should aske with hearty desires, and an earnest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and a present spirit; and however it be very easie to have our thoughts wander, yet it is our indifferency and luke warmnesse that makes it so naturall: and you may observe it, that so long as the light shines bright, and the fires of devotion, and desires flame out, so long the mind of a man stands close to the altar, and waits upon the sacrifice; but as the fires die and desires decay, so the mind steals away and walks abroad to see the little images of beauty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and pleasure, which it beholds in the falling stars and little glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes of the world.

                  <p>These are the great Scenes of duty in which we are to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and zealous; but because earnestnesse and zeal are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a great latitude; and the zeale of the present age is starke cold, if compar'd to the fervors of the Apostles, and other holy primitives; and in every age a good mans care may turne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> into scruple, if he sees that he is not the best man, because he may reckon his owne estate to stand in the confines of darknesse, because his spark is not so great as his neighbors fires, therefore it is sit that we consider concerning the degrees of the intention and forward heats; for when we have found out the lowest degrees of zeale, and a holy fervour, we know that <hi>duty</hi> dwels there, and whatsoever is above it is a degree of excellence; but all that is lesse then it, is <hi>lukewarmnesse,</hi> and the state of an ungracious and an unaccepted person.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

Which rule is not to be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> and <hi>in particular instances,</hi> but alwayes <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;</hi> and when it descends to particulars, it must be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to circumstances, and by their proper measures: for,</p>

our life, our health, and a friend are to be neglected rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then a Duty when it stands in its proper place, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

And although <hi>Mary</hi> was commended for choosing the better part, yet <hi>Mary</hi> had done worse if she had been at the foot of her Master when she should have relieved a perishing brother. <hi>Martha</hi> was troubled with much serving; that was <hi>more then need,</hi> and therefore she was to blame; and sometimes <hi>hearing</hi> in some circumstances may be <hi>more then needs;</hi> and some women are <hi>troubled with over-much hearing,</hi> and then they had better have been serving the necessities of their house.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for although the things of the Spirit are better then the things of the World, yet a spirituall man is not in humane regards to be preferred before Princes and noble personages. Because a man is called spirituall in severall regards, and for various measures and manners of partaking of the Spirit of grace, or co-operating toward the works of the Spirit. * A King and a Bishop both, have callings in order to godlinesse, and honesty, and spirituall effects, towards the advancement of Christs Kingdome, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives severally they are. * But whether of these two works more <hi>immediately,</hi> or more <hi>effectively,</hi> cannot at all times be known; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and therefore from hence no argument can be drawn concerning doing them civill regards; * and possibly, <hi>the partaking the Spirit</hi> is a neerer relation to him, then doing his ministeries, and serving his ends upon others; * and if relations to God and Gods Spirit could bring an obligation of giving proportionable civill honour, every holy man might put in some pretence for dignities above some Kings and some Bishops. * But as the things of the Spirit are in order to the affairs of another world, so they naturally can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre onely such a relative dignity, as can be expressed in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manners. But because such relations are subjected in men of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this life, and we now converse especially in materiall and secular significations, therefore we are to expresse our regards to men of such relations by proportionable expressions: but because <hi>civill excellencies</hi> are the proper ground of receiving and exacting <hi>civill honors,</hi> and spirituall excellencies doe onely claim them acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50231:91"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and indirectly, therefore in titles of honour and humane regards the <hi>civill praeeminence</hi> is the appendix of the greatest <hi>civill power</hi> and <hi>imployment,</hi> and is to descend in proper measures; and for a spirituall relation to challenge a temporall dignity, is as if the best Musick should challenge the best cloathes, or a Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string should contend with a Rose for the honour of the greatest sweetnesse. * Adde to this, that although temporall things are in order to spirituall, and therefore are lesse perfect, yet this is not so naturally; for temporall things are properly in order to the felicity of man in his proper and present constitution; and it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by a supernaturall grace that now they are thrust forward to a higher end of grace and glory; and therefore temporall <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>callings</hi> have properly the chiefest temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; and Christ took nothing of this away from them, but put them higher, by sanctifying and ennobling them. * But then the higher calling can no more suppose the higher man, then the richest trade can suppose the richest man. From callings to men, the argument is fallacious; and a Smith is a more usefull man then he that teaches Logick; but not always to be more estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and called to stand at the chairs of Princes and Nobles. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> * Holy persons and holy things and all great relations are to be valued by generall proportions to their correlatives, but if wee descend to make minute and exact proportions, and proportion an inch of temporall to a minute of spirituall, we must needs be hugely deceived, unlesse we could measure the motion of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell by a string, or the progressions of the Spirit by weight and measure of the staple. * And yet if these measures were taken, it would be unreasonable that the lower of the higher kind should be preferr'd before the most perfect and excellent in a lower order of things. A man generally is to be esteemed above a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but not the meanest of her subjects before the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Queen; not alwayes this man before this woman. Now Kings and Princes are the best in all temporall dignities, and therefore if they had in them no spirituall relations and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent excellencies (as they have very many) yet are not to be undervalu'd to spirituall relations, which in this world are very imperfect, weak, partiall; and must stay till the next world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in a state of excellency, propriety and perfection; and then also all shall have them, according to the worth of their persons, not of their calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> * But lastly, what men may not challenge is not their just and proper due; but spirituall persons and the neerest relatives to God stand by him but so long at they dwell low and safe in humility, and rise high in nothing but in labours, and zeal of soules, and devotion. * In proportion to this rule, a Church may be pull'd down to save a Town, and the Vessels of the Church may be

                  <p>But in the whole, the duty of zeale requires that we neglect an ordinary visit rather then an ordinary prayer, and a great profit rather then omit a required duty. No excuse can legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a sin; and he that goes about to distinguish between his duty and his profit, and if he cannot reconcile them, will yet tie them together like a Hyaena and a Dog, this man pretends to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but secures the world, and is indifferent and lukewarme towards that, so he may be warme and safe in the possession of this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                  <p n="2">2. To that fervour and zeal that is necessary and a duty, <hi>it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we be constant and persevering. Esto fidelis ad mortem,</hi> said the Spirit of God to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Be faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life:</hi> For he that is warm to day, and cold to morrow, zealous in his resolution and weary in his practises, fierce in the beginning, and slack and easie in his progresse, hath not yet well chosen what side he will be of; he sees not reason enough for Religion, and he hath not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough for its contrary; and therefore he is <hi>duplicis animi,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> calls him, <hi>of a doubtfull mind.</hi> For Religion is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> worth as much to day as it was yesterday, and that cannot change though we doe; and if we doe, we have left God, and whither he can goe that goes from God, his owne sorrowes will soon enough instruct him. This fire must never goe out, but it must be like the fire of heaven, it must shine like the starres, though sometimes cover'd with a cloud, or obscur'd by a greater light; yet they dwell for ever in their orbs, and walk in their circles, and observe their circumstances, but goe not out by day nor night, and set not when Kings die, nor are extinguish'd when Nations change their Government: So must the zeal of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Christian be, a constant incentive of his duty, and though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his hand is drawne back by violence or need, and his prayers shortned by the importunity of businesse, and some parts omitted by necessities, and just complyances, yet still the fire is kept alive, it burns within when the light breaks not forth, and is eternall as the orb of fire, or the embers of the Altar of Incense.</p>

But if we delight in it, we enter into a portion of the reward as soon as we begin the worke, and the very grace shall be stronger then the temptation in its very pretence of pleasure; and therefore it must needs be pleasing to God, because it confesses God to be the best Master, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the best work, and it serves God with choice, and will, and reconciles our nature to it, and entertaines our appetite, and then there is no <hi>ansa</hi> or handle left whereby we can easily be drawne from duty, when all parties are pleased with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> But this delight is not to be understood as if it were alwayes required that we should feele an actuall cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sensible joy; such as was that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> when he had newly tasted honey, and the light came into his eyes, and he was refreshed and pleasant.

SO long as our zeal and forwardnesse in Religion hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these constituent parts, it hath no more then can keep the duty alive: but beyond this, there are many degrees of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse and vehemence which are progressions towards the state of perfection, which every man ought to design and desire to be added to his portion: of this sort I reckon <hi>frequency in prayer,</hi> and <hi>almes above our estate.</hi> Concerning which two instances I have these two cautions to insert. 1. Concerning <hi>frequency in prayer,</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is an act of zeal so ready and prepared for the spirit of a man, so easie and usefull, so without objection, and so fitted for every mans affairs, his necessities and possibilities, that he that prayes but seldome, cannot in any sense pretend to be <hi>a religious person.</hi> For in Scripture there is no other rule for the frequency of prayer given us, but by such words which signifie we should do it <hi>alwaies, Pray continually:</hi> and, <hi>Men ought alwayes to pray and not to faint.</hi> And then, men have so many necessities, that if we should esteem our needs to be the circumstances and positive determination of our times of prayer, we should be very far from admitting limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the former words, but they must mean that we ought to pray frequently every day. For in danger and trouble, naturall Religion teaches us to pray: In a festivall fortune our prudence, and our needs inforce us equally. For though we feel not a present smart, yet we are certain then is our biggest danger: and if we observe how the world treats her darlings, men of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of prosperity and great successe, we cannot but confesse them to be the most miserable of all men, as being in the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of losing their biggest interest. For they are bigger then the iron hand of Law, and <hi>they cannot be restrain'd with fear:</hi> the hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grasps a power of doing all that which their evill heart can desire, and <hi>they cannot be restrained with disability to sin;</hi> they are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by all mean, and base, and indiligent persons, which are the greatest part of mankinde; but few men dare reprove a potent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>he shall every day be flattered and seldome counselled:</hi> and his great reflexions and opinions of his condition makes him impatient

For when all the troubles and dangers of his condition may turn into his good, if he will but desire they should; when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such easie terms he may be happy, for there is no more trouble in it then this, <hi>Aske and ye shall receive;</hi> that's all that is required; no more turnings and variety in their road; when (I say) at so cheap a rate, a poor man may be provided for, and a rich man may escape damnation, they that refuse to apply themselves to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, <hi>quickly, earnestly, zealously, and constantly,</hi> deserves the smart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his poverty and the care of it, and the scorne <hi>if he be poor,</hi> and <hi>if he be rich</hi> it is fit he should (because he desires it) dye by the evils of his proper danger. * It was observed by <hi>Cassian; orationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus maximè infidiantur Daemones,</hi> the Devill is more busie to disturb our prayers, then to hinder any thing else. For else it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined why we should be brought to pray so seldome, and to be so listlesse to them, and so trifling to them. No, <hi>The Devill knowes upon what hard terms he stands with the praying man;</hi> he also knows that it is a mighty cmanation of Gods infinite goodnesse and a strange desire of saving mankinde, that he hath to so easie a duty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> promised such mighty blessings. For God knowing that upon hard terms we would not accept of heaven it self, and yet hell was so intolerable a state, that God who loved us would affixe heaven to a state of prayer and devotion; this, because the Devill knowes to be one of the greatest arts of the Divine mercy, he labours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to supplant; and if he can but make men unwilling to pray, or <hi>to pray coldly,</hi> or <hi>to pray seldome,</hi> he secures his interest, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the mans; and it is infinitely strange, that he can and doth prevail so much in this so unreasonable temptation. <hi>Opposuisti nubem ne transirot oratio,</hi> the mourning Prophet complained there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50231:94"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prevails often; <hi>opponit nubem:</hi> he claps a cloud between; some little objection; <hi>a stranger is come; or my head akes; or the Church is too cold; or I have letters to write; or I am not disposed; or it is not yet time, or the time is past:</hi> these, and such as these are the <hi>clouds,</hi> the Devill claps between heaven and us; but these are such impotent objections, that they were as soon confuted as pretended, by all men that are not fools, or professed enemies of Religion, but that they are clouds: which sometimes look like Lions and Bears, Castles, and wals of fire, armies and horses; and indeed are any thing that a man will fancy; and the smallest article of objection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> managed and conducted by the Devils arts, and meeting with a wretchlesse, carelesse, indevout spirit, is a Lion in the way, and a deep river; it is impassable, and it is impregnable. <gap reason="foreign">

For in frequent prayer there is so much rest and pleasure, that as soon as ever it is perceived, the contrary temptation appears unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; none are so unwilling to pray as they that pray seldome; for they that do pray often, and with zeal, and passion and desire, feel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> no trouble so great as when they are forced to omit their holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and hours of prayer. It concerns the Devils interest to keep us from all the experience of the rewards of a frequent and holy prayer; and so long as you will not try and <hi>taste how good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is</hi> to the praying man, so long you cannot see the evill of your coldnesse and lukewarm state; but if you would but try, though it be but for curiosity sake, and informe your selves in the vanity of things, and the truth of pretences, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Theologicall propositions, you should finde your selves taken in a golden snare, which will tye you to nothing but <hi>felicity,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and <hi>safety,</hi> and <hi>holinesse,</hi> and <hi>pleasures.</hi> But then the caution which I intended to insert is this; that <hi>frequency in prayers,</hi> and that part of zeal which relates to it, is to be upon no account but of an <hi>holy spirit, a wise heart,</hi> and <hi>reasonable perswasion;</hi> for if it begins upon passion or fear, in imitation of others, or desires of reputation, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or phantastick principles, it will be unblessed and weary,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50231:95"/>
unprosperous and without return or satisfaction: therefore if it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> happen to begin upon a weak principle, be very curious to change the motive, and with all speed let it be turned into religion and the love of holy things, then let it be as frequent as it can prudently, it cannot be amisse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you are entred into a state of zealous prayer, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular devotion, what ever interruption you can meet with, observe their causes and be sure to make them irregular, seldome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, that your omissions may be seldome and casuall, as a bare accident; for which no provisions can be made; for if ever it come, that you take any thing <hi>habitually</hi> and <hi>constantly</hi> from your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> prayers, or that you distract from them <hi>very frequently,</hi> it cannot be but you will become troublesome to your self; your prayers will be uneasie, they will seem hinderances to your more necessary affairs of passion and interest, and the things of the world: and it will not stand still, till it comes to <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and a direct despite and contempt of holy things. For it was an old rule, and of a sad experience, <hi>Tepiditas si callum obduxerit fiet apostasia,</hi> if your luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse be habituall and <hi>a state</hi> of life, if it once be hardned by the usages of many daies, it changes the whole state of the man, it makes him an apostate to devotion. Therefore be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> carefull in this particular; alwayes remembring the saying of St. <hi>Chrysostome, Docendi, praedicandi officia &amp; alia cessant suo tempore, precandi autem nunquam;</hi> there are seasons for teaching, and preaching, and other outward offices; but prayer is the duty of all times, and of all persons, and in all contingences: From other things in many cases we can be excused, but from prayer never. In this therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is good to be zealous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning the second instance I named, <hi>viz.</hi> To give almes above our estate, it is an excellent act of zeal, and needs no other caution to make it secure from illusion and danger, but that <hi>our</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>egressions of charity do not prejudice justice.</hi> See that your almes do not other men wrong, and let them do what they can to thy self, they will never prejudice thee by their abundance; but then be also carefull that the pretences of justice do not cousen thy self of thy charity, and the poor of thine almes, and thy soul of the reward. He that is in debt is not excused from giving almes till his debts are paid; but only from giving away such portions which should and would pay them, and such which he intended should do it: There are <hi>lacernae divitiarum,</hi> and crums from the table, and the gleanings of the harvest, and the scatterings of the vintage, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in all estates are the portions of the poor, which being collected by the hand of providence, and united wisely may become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable to the poor, and are the necessary duties of charity; but beyond this also, every considerable relief to the poor is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable diminution to the estate, and yet if it be, it is not alwaies
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50231:95"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> considerable in the accounts of Justice; for nothing ought to be pretended against the zeal of almes, but the certain omissions or the very probable retarding the doing that, to which we are otherwise obliged. He that is going to pay a debt and in the way meets an indigent person that needs it all, may not give it to him unlesse he knowes by other means to pay the debt; but if he can do both, he hath his liberty to lay out his money for a Crown. But then in the case of provision for children our restraint is not so easie, or discernible; 1. Because we are not bound to provide for them in a certain portion, but may do it by the analogies and measures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of prudence, in which there is a great latitude. 2. Because our zeal of charity is a good portion for them, and layes up a blessing for inheritance. 3. Because the fairest portions of charity are usually short of such sums which can be considerable in the duty of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for our children. 4. If we for them could be content to take any measure lesse then all, any thing under every thing that we can, we should finde the portions of the poor made ready to our hands sufficiently to minister to zeal, and yet not to intrench upon this case of conscience; But the truth is; we are so carelesse, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skil'd, so unstudied in religion, that we are only glad to make an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an excuse, and to defeat our souls of the reward of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest grace: we are contented if we can but make a pretence; for we are highly pleased if our conscience be quiet, and care not so much that our duty be performed; much lesse that our eternall interest be advanced in bigger portions. We care not, we strive not, we think not of getting the greater rewards of Heaven; and he whose desires are so indifferent for the greater, will not take pains to secure the smallest portion; and it is observable, that <gap reason="foreign">

He that does his almes, and resolves that in no case he will suffer inconvenience for his brother whose case it may be is into erable, should do well to remember that God in some cases requires a greater charity; and it may be we shall be called to dye for the good of our brother: and that although it alwaies supposes a zeal, and a holy fervour, yet sometimes it is also a duty, and we lose our lives if we go to save them; and so we do with our estates; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> when we are such good husbands in our Religion, that we will serve all our own conveniences before the great needs of a hungry and afflicted brother, God oftentimes takes from us that which with so much curiosity we would preserve, and then we lose our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and our reward too.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The next measure of zeal is <hi>prudence.</hi> For, as <hi>charity</hi> is <hi>the matter of Zeal,</hi> so is <hi>discretion the manner.</hi> It must alwaies be for good to our neighbour, and there needs no rules for the conducting
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50231:97"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of that, provided the end be consonant to the design, that is, that charity be intended, and charity done. But there is <hi>a Zeal</hi> also <hi>of Religion</hi> or worshipping, and this hath more need of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and proper cautions. For Religion can turn into a snare, it may be abused into <hi>superstition,</hi> it may become wearinesse in the spirit, and tempt to tediousnesse, to hatred, and despair: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons through their indiscreet conduct and furious marches, and great loads taken upon tender shoulders and unexperienced, have come to be perfect haters of their joy, and despisers of all their <hi>hopes,</hi> being like dark Lanthorns, in which a candle burnes bright, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the body is incompassed with a crust and a dark cloud of iron; and these men keep the fires and light of holy propositions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, but the darknesse of hell, the hardnesse of a vexed he art hath shaded all the light, and makes it neither apt to warm nor to enlighten others, but it turnes to fire within, a feaver and a distemper dwels there, and Religion is become their torment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Therefore <hi>our Zeal must never carry us beyond that which is profitable.</hi> There are many institutions, customes, and usages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Religion upon very fair motives, and apted to great necessities; but to imitate those things when they are disrobed of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their proper ends is an importune zeal, and signifies nothing but a forward minde, and an easie heart, and an imprudent head; unlesse these actions can be invested with other ends and usefull purposes. The primitive Church were strangely inspired with a zeal of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, in order to the necessities of preaching and travelling, and easing the troubles and temptations of persecution; but when the necessity went on, and drove the holy men into deserts, that made Colleges of Religious, and their manner of life was such, so united, so poor, so dressed, that they must live <hi>more non saculari,</hi> after the manner of men divorc'd from the usuall entercourses of the world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> still their desire of single life increased; because the old necessity lasted, and a new one did supervene. Afterwards the case was altered, and then the single life was not to be chosen for it self, nor yet in imitation of the first precedents; for it could not be taken out from their circumstances and <hi>be used alone.</hi> He therefore that thinks he is a more holy person for being a virgin or a widower, or that he is bound to be so because they were so, or that he cannot be a religious person because he is not so, hath zeal indeed, but not according to knowledge. But now if the single state can be taken out and put to new appendages, and fitted to the end of another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grace or essentiall duty of Religion, it will well become a Christian zeal to choose it so long as it can serve the end with advantage and security. Thus also a zealous person is to chuse his fastings; while they are necessary to him, and are acts of proper mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while he is tempted, or while he is under discipline, while he repents, or while he obeys; but some persons fast in zeal, but for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50231:98"/>
nothing else; fast when they have no need, when there is need they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> should not; but call it religion to be miserable or sick; here their zeal is folly, for it is neither an act of Religion nor of prudence, to fast when fasting probably serves no end of the spirit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fasting dayes of the Church, although it is warrant enough to us to fast if we had no end to serve in it but the meer obedience, yet it is necessary that the <hi>superiors</hi> should not think the Law obeyed, unlesse the end of the first institution be observed; a fasting day is a day of humiliation, and prayer; and fasting being nothing it self, but wholly the handmaid of a further grace, ought not to be devested of its holinesse and sanctification, and left like the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wals of a ruinous Church, where there is no duty performed to God, but there remains something of that which us'd to minister to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The want of this consideration hath caus'd so much scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and dispute, so many snares and schismes concerning Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall fasts. For when it was undressed and stripp'd of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and usefull appendages, when from a solemn day it grew to be common; from thence to be lesse devout by being lesse sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and lesse usefull; and then it passed from a day of Religion to be a day of order, and from fasting till night, to fasting till evening-song, and evening-song to be sung about twelve a clock; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and from fasting it was changed to a choice of food, from eating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eating fish, and that the letter began to be stood upon, and no usefulnesse remain'd but what every of his own piety should put into it, but nothing was enjoyn'd by the Law, nothing of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the superiours, then the Law fell into disgrace, and the design became suspected, and men were first insnared, and then scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, and then began to complain without remedy, and at last took remedy themselves without authority; the whole affair fell into a disorder and a mischief; and zeal was busie on both sides, and on both sides was mistaken, because they fell not upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> proper remedy, which was to reduce the Law to the usefulnesse and advantages of its first intention. But this I intended not to have spoken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Our Zeal must never carry us beyond that which is safe.</hi> Some there are who in their first attempts and entries upon Religion while the passion that brought them in remains, undertake things as great as their highest thoughts; no repentance is sharp enough, no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities expensive enough, no fastings afflictive enough, then <hi>totis Quinquatribus orant;</hi> and finding some deliciousnesse at the first contest, and in that activity of their passion, they make vowes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> binde themselves for ever to this state of delicacies. The onset is fair: but the event is this. The age of a passion, is not long, and the flatulent spirit being breathed out, the man begins to abate of his first heats, and is ashamed: but then he considers that all that was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and therefore he will abate something more and <hi>from</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:50231:98"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>something to something, at last it will come to just nothing,</hi> and the proper effect of this is, <hi>indignation</hi> and <hi>hatred of holy things, an impudent spirit, carelessenesse</hi> or <hi>despair.</hi> Zeal sometimes carries a man into temptation: and he that never thinks he loves God duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or acceptably, because he is not imprison'd for him, or undone, or design'd to Martyrdome, may desire a triall that will undoe him. It is like fighting of a Duell to shew our valour. Stay till the King commands you to fight and die, and then let zeal do its noblest offices. This irregularity and mistake was too frequent in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, when men and women would strive for death, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be ambitious to feel the hangmans sword; some miscarryed in the attempt, and became sad examples of the unequall yoking a frail spirit with a zealous driver.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let <hi>Zeal never transport us to attempt anything but what is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. M. Teresa</hi> made a vow that she would do alwaies that which was absolutely the best. But neither could <hi>her understanding</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tell her which was so, nor <hi>her will</hi> alwayes have the same fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: and it must often breed scruples, and sometimes tediousnesse, and wishes that the vow were unmade. He that vowes never to have an ill thought, never to commit an error, hath taken a course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that his little infirmities shall become crimes, and certainly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by changing his unavoidable infirmity into vow-breach. Zeal is a violence to a mans spirit, and unlesse the spirit be secur'd by the proper nature of the duty, and the circumstances of the action, and the possibilities of the man; it is like a great fortune in the meanest person, it bears him beyond his limit, and breaks him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangers and passions, transportations and all the furies of disorder that can happen to an abused person.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Zeal is not safe unlesse it be <hi>in re probabili</hi> too, it must be in a likely matter. For we that finde so many excuses to untie all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> just obligations, and distinguish our duty into so much finenesse, that it becomes like leaf-gold apt to be gone at every breath; it can not be prudent that we zealously undertake what is not probable to be effected. If we do, the event can be nothing but portions of the former evill, <hi>scruple</hi> and <hi>snares, shamefull retreats</hi> and <hi>new fantastick principles;</hi> In all our undertakings we must consider what is our state of life, what our naturall inclinations, what is our society, and what are our dependencies; by what necessities we are born down, by what hopes we are biassed; and by these let us measure our heats and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per businesse. A zealous man runs up a sandy hill; the violence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> motion is his greatest hinderance, and a passion in Religion destroys as much of our evennesse of spirit, as it sets forward any outward work: and therefore although it be a good circumstance and degree of a spirituall duty, so long as it is within, and relative to God and our selves; so long it is a holy flame; but if it be in an outward duty, or relative to our neighbours, or in an instance not necessary,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50231:99"/>
it sometimes spoils the action, and alwaies endangers it. But I must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> remember we live in an age in which men have more need of new fires to be kindled within them and round about them, then of any thing to allay their forwardnesse: there is little or no zeal now but the zeal of envie, and killing as many as they can, and damning more then they can; <gap reason="foreign">

But of this I have already given account: and to it, I shall only adde what an old spirituall person told a novice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, asking him the cause why he so frequently suffered tediousnesse in his religious offices; <hi>Nondum vidisti requiem quam speramus, nec tormenta quae timemus;</hi> young man, thou hast not seen the glories which are laid up for the zealous and devout, nor yet beheld the flames which are prepared for the lukewarm, and the haters of strict devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> But the Jewes tell that <hi>Adam</hi> having seen the beauties, and tasted the delicacies of Paradise, repented and mourned upon the <hi>Indian Mountains</hi> for three hundred years together: and we who have a great share in the cause of his sorrowes, can by nothing be invited to a persevering, a great, a passionate religion, more then by remembring what he lost, and what is laid up for them whose hearts are burning lamps, and are all on fire with Divine love, whose flames are fann'd with the wings of the holy Dove, and whose spirits shine and burn with that fire which the holy Jesus came to enkindle upon the earth.</p>

He that drinks a draught or two of water, and cooles his thirst, drinks no more till his thirst returnes; but he that drinks wine, drinks it again, longer then it is needfull, even so long as it is pleasant. Nature best provides for her self when she spreads her own Table; but when men have gotten su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> habits, and new necessities, art that brought them in must maintain them, but <hi>wantonnesse and folly wait at the table, and sickness and death take away.</hi>

Though reason be so strictly to be preserved at our tables as well as at our prayers, and we can never have leave to doe any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to it; yet the measures of Nature may be enlarged beyond the bounds of prime and common necessity.

                  <p>But in these cases <hi>necessity,</hi> and <hi>prndence,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> are to make the measures and the rule; and so long as the just end is fairly designed, and aptly ministred to, there ought to be no scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the quantity or quality of the provision: and he that would stint a Swain by the commons of a Student, and give <hi>Philot as</hi> the Candian, the leavings of <hi>Pluto,</hi> does but ill serve the ends of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but worse of prudence and necessity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sorrow and a wounded spirit may as well be provided for in the quantity and quality of meat and drink, as any other disease; and this disease by this remedy as well as by any other. For great sorrow and importune melancholy may be as great a sin as a great anger; and if it be a sin in its nature, it is more malignant and dangerous in its quality; as naturally tending to murmur and despair, wear inesse of Religion, and hatred of God, timorousnesse and jealousies, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick images of things and superstition; and therefore as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to restrain the feavers of anger, so also to warm the freezings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and dulnesse of melancholy by prudent and temperate, but proper and apportion'd diets; and if some meats and drinks make men lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or sleepy, or dull, or lazy, or spritely, or merry, so far as meats and drinks can minister to the passion, and the passion minister to vertue, so far by this means they may be provided for. <hi>Give</hi>

But this is not intended to be an habituall cure, but single and occasionall; for he that hath a pertinacious sorrow is beyond the cure of meat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and drink, and if this become every days physick, it will quickly become every days sin. 2. It must alwayes keep within the bounds of reason, and never seise upon any portions of affection: The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> use to mingle musick with their bowls, and drink by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the six Notes of Musick:

                     </q>
but they sing so long that they forget not their sorrow onely, but their vertue also, and their Religion; and there are some men that fall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into drunkennesse because they would forget a lighter calamity, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the fire to cure a calenture, and beating their brains out to be quit of the aking of their heads. A mans heavynesse is refreshed long before he comes to drunkennesse; for when he arrives thither, he hath but chang'd his heavynesse, and taken a crime to boot.</p>
                  <p n="5">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 5. Even when a man hath no necessity upon him, no pungent sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or naturall or artificiall necessity, it is lawfull in some cases of eating and drinking to receive pleasure and intend it. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>naturall and necessary,</hi> is therefore <hi>not criminall,</hi> because it is of Gods procuring; and since we eate for need, and the satisfaction of our need is a removing of a pain, and that in nature is the greatest pleasure, it is impossible that in its own nature it should be a sin. But in this case of Conscience, these cautions are to be observed: 1. So long as nature ministers the pleasure and not art, it is materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally innocent. <hi>Si tuo veniat jure, luxuria est:</hi> But it is safe while <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it enters upon natures stock; for it is impossible that the proper effect of health, and temperance, and prudent abstinence should be vicious; and yet these are the parents of the greatest pleasure, in eating and drinking. <hi>Malum panem expecta, bonus siet; etiam illum tenerum tibi &amp; siligineum fames reddet:</hi> If you abstaine and be hungry, you shall turne the meanest provision into delicate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let all the pleasure of meat and drink be such as can minister to health, and be within the former bounds. For since pleasure in eating and drinking is its naturall appendage, and like a shadow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> follows the substance, as the meat is to be accounted, so is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and if these be observed, there is no difference whether nature or art be the Cook. For some constitutions, and some mens customes, and some mens educations, and necessities, and weaknesses are such, that their appetite is to be invited, and their digestion helped, but all this while we are within the bounds of nature and need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is lawfull when a man needs meat to choose the pleasan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even meerly for their pleasures; that is, because they are pleasant, besides that they are usefull; this is as lawfull as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> smell of a rose, or to lye in feathers, or change the posture of our body in bed for ease, or to hear musick, or to walk in gardens rather then the high-wayes; and God hath given us leave to be delighted in those things which he made to that purpose, that we may also be delighted in him that gives them. For so as the more pleasant may <hi>better</hi> serve for <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> to <hi>refreshment,</hi> so <hi>collaterally</hi> to <hi>Religion:</hi> Alwayes provided, that it be in its degree mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and we temperate in our desires, without transportation and violence, without unhandsome usages of our selves, or taking from God and from Religion any minutes and portions of our affections. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> When <hi>Eicadastes</hi> the <hi>Epicure</hi> saw a goodly dish of hot meat serv'd up, he sung the verse of <hi>Homer,</hi>

and swallowed some of it greedily, till by its hands of fire it curled
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50231:111"/>

                  <q>
                     <l>Non poterat letho nobiliore mori:</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>It was fit <hi>he</hi> should dye such a death; but <hi>that death</hi> bids us beware of <hi>that folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let the pleasure as it came with the meat, so also passe away with it. <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was a beast, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>is exclusa esset corporis angustiis;</hi> he mourned because the pleasure of eating was not spread over all his body, that he might have been an Epicure in his hands: and indeed, if we consider it rightly, great eating and drinking is not the greatest pleasure of the <hi>taste,</hi> but of the <hi>touch;</hi> and <hi>Philoxenus</hi> might feel the unctious juyce slide softly down his throat, but he could not taste it in the middle of the long neck; and we see that they who mean to feast exactly, or delight the palate, do <hi>libare</hi> or <hi>pitissare,</hi> take up little proportions and spread them upon the tongue or palate; but <hi>full morsells</hi> and <hi>great draughts</hi> are easie and soft to the <hi>touch;</hi> but so is the feeling of silke, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> handling of a melon, or a moles skin, and as delicious too as eating when it goes beyond the appetites of nature, and the proper pleasures of taste, which cannot be perceived but by a temperate man. And therefore let not the pleasure be intended beyond the taste; that is, beyond those little naturall measures in which God intended that pleasure should accompany your tables. Doe not run to it beforehand, nor chew the chud when the meal is done; delight not in the fancies, and expectations, and remembrances of a pleasant meal; but let it descend <hi>in latrinam,</hi> together with the meals whose attendant pleasure is. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let pleasure be the lesse principall, and used as a servant; it may be modest and prudent to strew the dish with Sugar, or to dip thy bread in vinegar, but to make thy meal of sauces, and to make the accessory become the principall, and pleasure to rule the table, and all the regions of thy soule, is to make a man lesse and lower then an Oglio, of a cheaper value then a Turbat; a servant and a worshipper of <hi>sauces,</hi> and <hi>cookes,</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let pleasure as it is used in the regions and limits of nature and prudence, so also be changed into religion and thankfulnesse. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  </q>
                  <p>For then the body may rejoyce in fellowship with the soule, and then a pleasant meal is religious, if it be not inordinate. But if our festivall dayes like the <hi>Gentile</hi> sacrifices end in drunkennesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To summe up this particular, there are, as you perceive, many cautions to make our pleasure safe, but any thing can make it inordinate, and then scarce any thing can keep it from becoming dangerous.</p>

We expect our servants should not dare to touch what we have forbidden to them; we are watchfull that our children should not swallow poysons, and filthinesse, and unwholesome nourishment; we take care that they should be well manner'd and civil and of fair demeanour; and we our selves desire to be, or

at least to be accounted wise; and would infinitely scorne to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> call'd fooles; and we are so great lovers of health, that we will buy it at any rate of money or observance; and then for honour, it is that which the children of men pursue with passion, it is one of the noblest rewards of vertue, and the proper ornament of the wise and valiant, and yet all these things are not valued or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, when a merry meeting, or a looser feast calls upon the man to act a scene of <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>madnesse,</hi> and <hi>healthlesnesse</hi> and <hi>dishonour.</hi> We doe to God what we severely punish in our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; we correct our children for their medling with dangers, which themselves preferre before immortality; and though no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man think himselfe fit to be despised, yet he is willing to make himselfe a beast, a sot, and a ridiculous monkey, with the follies and vapors of wine; and when he is high in drinke or fancy, proud as a <hi>Grecian</hi> Orator in the midst of his popular noyses, at the same time he shall talk such dirty language, such mean low things, as may well become a changeling and a foole, for whom the stocks are prepared by the laws, and the just scorne of men.

Doe not the laws of all wise Nations marke the drunkard for a foole, with the meanest and most scornfull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment? and is there any thing in the world so foolish as a man that is drunk? But good God! what an intolerable sorrow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath seifed upon great portions of Mankind, that this folly and madnesse should possesse the greatest spirits, and the wittyest men, the best company, the most sensible of the word <hi>honour,</hi> and the most jealous of loosing the <hi>shadow,</hi> and the most carelesse of the <hi>thing?</hi> Is it not a horrid thing, that a wise, or a crafty, a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or a noble person should dishonour himselfe as a foole, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his body as a murtherer, lessen his estate as a prodigall, disgrace every good cause that he can pretend to by his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and become an appellative of scorne, a scene of laughter or derision, <hi>and all,</hi> for the reward of forgetfulnesse and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for there are in immoderate drinking no other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
                  <p>Why doe valiant men and brave personages fight and die ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then break the laws of men, or start from their duty to their Prince, and will suffer themselves to be cut in pieces rather
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50231:112"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then deserve the name of a Traitor or perjur'd? and yet these very men to avoyd the hated name of <hi>Glutton</hi> or <hi>Drunkard,</hi> and to preserve their Temperance, shall not deny themselves one luscious morsell, or poure a cup of wine on the ground, when they are invited to drink by the laws of the circle or wilder company.</p>
                  <p>Me thinks it were but reason, that if to give life to uphold a cause be not too much, they should not think too much to be hungry and suffer thirst for the reputation of that cause; and therefore much rather that they would thinke it but duty to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> temperate for its honour, and eat and drink in civill and faire measures, that themselves might not lose the reward of so much suffering, and of so good a relation, nor that which they value most be destroyed by drink.</p>
                  <p>There are in the world a generation of men that are ingag'd in a cause, which they glory in, and pride themselves in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and appellative: but yet for that cause they will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but talk and drink; they are valiant in wine, and witty in healths, and full of stratagem to promote debauchery; but such persons are not considerable in wise accounts; that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I deplore is, that some men preferre a cause before their life, and yet preferre wine before that cause, and by one drunken meeting set it more backward in its hopes and blessings, then it can be set forward by the counsels and armes of a whole yeer. God hath ways enough to reward a truth without crowning it with successe in the hands of such men. In the mean time they dishonour Religion, and make truth be evill spoken of, and innocent persons to suffer by their very relation, and the cause of God to be reproached in the sentences of erring and abused people; and themselves lose their health and their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their honour and their peace, the rewards of sober counsels, and the wholesome effects of wisdome.</p>

Our blessed Lord, though he was born of a maiden, yet she was vail'd under the cover of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and she was marryed to a widower; for <hi>Joseph</hi> the supposed Father of our Lord had children by a former wife. The first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that ever <hi>Jesus</hi> did, was to doe honour to a wedding; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was in the world before sin, and is in all ages of the world the greatest and most effective antidote against sin, in which all the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had perished if God had not made a remedy; and although sin hath sour'd marriage, and stuck the mans head with cares, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans bed with sorrowes in the production of children, yet these are but throws of life and glory; and <hi>she shall be saved in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, if she be found in faith and righteousnesse.</hi> Marriage is a

For when <hi>the will</hi> began to love it, then <hi>the understanding</hi> was set on work to commend, to advance, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conduct and to approve, to beleeve it, and to be factious in behalf of the new purchase. I do not beleeve the understanding part of man received any naturall decrement or diminution. For if to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils their naturals remain intire, it is not likely that the lesser sin of man should suffer a more violent and effective mischief.

I shall not need to discourse of the Philosophy of this mischief, and by the connexion of what causes ignorance doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low sin: but it is certain, whether a man would fam be pleased with sin, or be quiet, or fearlesse when he hath sinned, or continue in it, or perswade others to it, he must do it by false propositions, by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and such weak discourses as none can beleeve but such as are born fools, or such as have made themselves so, or are made so by others. Who in the world is a verier fool, a more ignorant wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched person then he that is an Atheist? A man may better beleeve there is no such man as himself, and that he is not in being, then that there is no God: for himself can cease to be, and once was not, and shall be changed from what he is, and in very many periods of his life knowes not that he is; and so it is every night with him when he sleeps: but none of these can happen to God; and if he knowes it not, he is a fool. Can any thing in this world be more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> foolish then to think that all this rare fabrick of heaven and earth can come by chance, when all the skill of art is not able to make an Oyster? To see rare effects and no cause; an excellent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and no Prince; a motion without an immovable; a circle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a centre; a time without eternity; a second without a first; a thing that begins not from it self, and therefore not to perceive there is something from whence it does begin, which must be without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; these things are so against Philosophy, and naturall reason, that he must needs be a beast in his understanding that does not assent to them. This is the Atheist: <hi>the fool hath said in his heart, there</hi>

                  <p>But the Devill hath infinitely prevail'd in a thing that is almost as senselesse and ignorant as Atheisme, and that is <hi>idolatry;</hi> not only making <hi>God after mans image,</hi> but in the likenesse of a calf, of a cat, of a serpent; making men such fools as to worship a quartan ague,

And this is the state of a sinner, of every one that delights in iniquity; he cannot be pleased with it if he thinks it evill; he cannot endure it, without beleeving this proposition, that <hi>there is in drunkennesse, or lust, pleasure enough, good enough to make him amends for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pains of damnation.</hi> But then if we consider upon what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

And <hi>no wiser are his hopes;</hi> all his hopes that he hath is, that <hi>he shall have time to repent</hi> of that which he chooses greedily; that he whom he every day provokes will save him, whether he will or no; that he can in an instant, or in a day make amends for all the evils of 40 years; or else that he shall be saved whether he does or no; that heaven is to be had for a sigh, or a short prayer, and yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hell shall not be consequent to the affections, and labours, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish services of a whole life; he goes on and cares not, he hopes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a promise, and refuses to beleeve all the threatnings of God; but beleeves he shall have a mercy for which he never had a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>But then consider, that there are some sins whose very formality is a lye.

But he is so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as to think, that if he sees nothing, nothing sees him; for if men did perceive God to be present, and yet do wickedly, it is worse with them then I have yet spoke of; and they beleeve another lie; that to be seen by man will bring more shame, then to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

                  <p>We see the event of this by too sad an experience. What ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, what hardnesse, what preaching, what necessity can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to confesse their sins? they are so ashamed of them, that to be conceal'd they preferre before their remedy; and yet in penitentiall confession the shame is going off, it is like <hi>Cato</hi>'s coming out of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> or the <hi>Philosopher</hi> from the <hi>Taverne;</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it might have been shame to have entred, but glory to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for ever; and yet ever to have relation to sin is so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing, that a mans spirit is amazed, and his face is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when he is <hi>dressed</hi> of so shamefull a disease. And there are but few men that will endure it, but rather choose to involve it in excuses and deniall, in the clouds of lying, and the white linnen of hypocrisie: and yet when they make a vail for their shame, such is the fate of sin, the shame growes the bigger and the thicker; we lye to men, and we excuse it to God; either some parts of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or many parts of impudence, darknesse, or forgetfulnesse, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> away, or running further in, these are the covers of our shame, like menstruous rags upon a skin of leprosie: But so sometimes we see a decayed beauty besmear'd with a lying <hi>fucus,</hi> and the chinks fill'd with <hi>ceruse;</hi> besides that it makes no reall beauty, it spoils the face, and betrayes evill manners; it does not hide old age, or the change of years, but it discovers pride or lust; it was not shame to be old, or wearied and worn out with age, but it is a shame to dissemble nature by a wanton vizor. So sin retires from blushing into shame; if it be discover'd, it is not to be endured, and if we go to hide it, we make it worse. But then if we remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> how ambitious we are for <hi>fame</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> for honour and a fair opinion, for a good name all our dayes, and when our dayes are done, and that no ingenuous man can enjoy any thing he hath, if he lives in disgrace, and that nothing so breaks a mans spirit as dishonour, and the meanest person alive does not think himself fit

                     </gap>, such remains of punishment, and those not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the lesse perfect, but to the best persons, that it makes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that every sinner is in a worse condition then he dreams of. For consider; can it be imagined that any one of us should escape better then <hi>David</hi> did? we have reason to tremble when we remember what he suffered, even when God had seal'd his pardon. Did not God punish <hi>Zedekiah</hi> with suffering his eyes to be put out in the house of bondage? was not God so angry with <hi>Valentinian,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he gave him into his enemies hand to be flay'd alive? Have not many persons been struck suddenly in the very act of sin, and some been seised upon by the Devill and carryed away alive? These are fearfull contingencies: but God hath been more angry yet; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> was punished in <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, by the gaping of the earth, and the men were buryed alive; and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were consumed with fire for usurping the Priests office: But God hath struck severely since that time; and for the prostitution of a Lady by the Spanish King, the Moors were brought in upon his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and rul'd there for 700. years. And have none of us known <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> an excellent and good man to have descended, or rather to have been thrust into a sin, for which he hath repented, which he hath confessed, which he hath rescinded, and which he hath made amends for as he could, and yet God was so severely angry that this man was suffered to fall in so big a calamity, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50231:144"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he dyed by the hands of violence, in a manner so seemingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to his condition, that it looked like the biggest sorrow that hath happened to the sons of men? But then let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how many and how great crimes we have done; and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think that God hath exacted so fearfull pains, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty punishments for one such sin which we, it may be, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted frequently. Our sin deserves as bad as theirs; and God is <hi>impartial,</hi> and we have no priviledge, no promise of exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no reason to hope it; what then do we think shall become of this affair? where must we suffer this vengeance? For that it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> due, that it is just we suffer it, these sad examples are a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. We have done that for which God thought <hi>flay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive</hi> not to be too big a punishment: that for which God hath smitten Kings with formidable plagues; that for which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments have been changed, and nations enslaved, and Churches destroyed, and the Candlestick removed, and famines and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences have been sent upon a whole Kingdome; and what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us? why do we vainly hope it shall not be so with us? If it was just for these men to suffer what they did, then we are at least to expect so much; and then let us consider into what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a fearfull condition sin hath put us, upon whom a sentence is read, that we shall be plagued like <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> or <hi>Corah,</hi> or <hi>Dathan,</hi> or the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other King who, were, for ought we know, infinitely more innocent and more excellent persons then any of us. What will become of us? For God is as just to us as to them: and Christ dyed for them as well as for us; and they have repented more then we have done; and what mercy can we expect that they might not hope for, upon at least as good ground as we? Gods wayes are secret, and his mercies and justice dwell in a great abysse; but we are to measure our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by revelation and experience. But then what would become of us, if God should be as angry at our sin as at <hi>Zedekiahs,</hi> or King <hi>Davids?</hi> where have we in our body room enough for so many stripes, as our sin ought justly to be punished withall? or what security or probability have we that he will not so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us?</p>
                  <p>For I did not represent this sad story, as a matter of possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only, that we may fear such fearfull strokes as we see God lay upon sinners; but we ought to look upon it as a thing that will come some way or other, and for ought we know we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> escape it. So much, and more is due for the sin, and though Christ hath redeemed our souls, and if we repent we shall not die eternally, yet he hath no where promised we shall not be smitten. It was an odde saying of the Devill to a sinner whom he would fain have had to despair; <hi>Me è Coelo ad Barathrum demisit peccatum, &amp; vos ullum in terra locum tutum existimabitis?</hi> Sin

                  <p n="1">1. But this hath two appendages which are very considerable; and the first is, that there are some mischiefs which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and appointed scourges of certain sins, and a man need not aske; <hi>Cujus vulturïs hoc erit cadaver?</hi> what vultur, what death, what affliction shall destroy this sinner? The sin hath a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of its own which usually attends it, as giddinesse does a drunkard. He that commits sacriledge, is marked for a vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse and changeable fortune; <hi>Make them, O my God, like unto</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 83.</note> 
                     <hi>a wheel,</hi> of an unconstant state: and <hi>we and our fathers have seen it,</hi> in the change of so many families, which have been undone by being made rich: they took the lands from the Church, and the curse went along with it, and the misery and the affliction lasted longer then the sin. Telling lies frequently hath for its punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>given over to believe a lye,</hi> and at last, that no body shall beleeve it but himself; and then the mischief is full, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> becomes a dishonoured and a baffled person. The consequent of <hi>lust</hi> is properly <hi>shame;</hi> and witchcraft is still punished with basenesse, and beggery; and oppression of widowes hath a sting, for the tears of the oppressed are to the <hi>oppressour,</hi> like the waters of jealousie, making the belly to swell, and the thigh to rot; the <hi>oppressor</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dies in a tolerable condition: but is remark'd towards his end with some horrible affliction. The sting of oppression is darted as a man goes to his grave. In these and the like, God keeps a rule of striking, <hi>In quo quis peccat, in eo punitur.</hi> The Divine Judgement did point at the sin, lest that be concealed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, and protected by affection, and increased by passion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the man by its abode. For some sins are so agreeable to the spirit of a fool and an abused person, because he hath fram'd his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to them, and they comply with his unworthy interest, that when God out of an angry kindnesse, smites the man, and punishes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the sin, the man does fearfully defend his beloved sin, as the serpent does his head which he would most tenderly preserve. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God that knowes all our tricks and devices, our stratagems to be undone, hath therefore apportioned out his punishments, by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, by proportions, and entaile: so that when every sin enters into its proper portion, we may discern why God is angry, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to appease him speedily.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second appendage to this consideration is this, that there are some states of sin which expose a man to all mischief, as it can happen by taking off from him all his guards, and defences; by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> driving the good Spirit from him, by stripping him of the guards of Angels. But this is the effect of an habituall sin, a course of an evill life, and it is called in Scripture, <hi>a grieving the good Spirit of God.</hi> But the guard of Angels is in Scripture only promised to them that live godly; <hi>The Angels of the Lord pitch their</hi>

time; for however we are pleased to throw away our time, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are weary of many parts of it, yet are impatiently troubled when all is gone, yet we are as sure to account for every considerable portion of our time, as for every summe of money we receive; and in this it was, that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> gave caution, <hi>Nemo parvi aestimet tempus quod in verbis consumitur otiosis,</hi> Let no man think <note place="margin">Serm. de triplici custodiâ.</note> it a light matter that he spend his pretious time in idle words; let no man be so weary of what flies away too fast, and cannot be recalled, as to use arts and devices to passe the time away in vanity, which might be rarely spent in the interests of eternity.

                  <p>These and many more evils, and the perpetuall unavoydable necessity of sinning by much talking, hath given great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to silence, and made it to be esteemed an act of Discipline and great Religion.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from being imitable and laudable, that if there were no direct prevarication of any commands expressed or intimated in Scripture, yet it must certainly either draw with it, or be it self an infinite omission of duty, especially in the externall glorifications of God, in the institution or advantages of others, in thanksgiving and publick offices, and in all the effects and emanations of spirituall mercy. This was to make amends for committing many sins by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many duties, and in stead of digging out the offending eye, to pluck out both, that they might neither see the scandall nor the duty; for fear of seeing what they should not, to shut their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eyes against all light. It was more prudent which was reported of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who made Silence an act of Discipline, and kept it a whole Lent in his religious retirements, <hi>cujus facti mei si causam quaeris</hi> (said he in his account he gives of it) <hi>idcircò à sermone prorsus abstinui, ut sermonibus meis moderari discam;</hi> I then abstained wholly, that all the yeer after I might be more temperate in my talke. This was in him an act of caution, but how apt it was to minister to his purpose of a moderated speech for the future, is not certaine; nor the philosophy of it, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall efficacy easie to be apprehended. It was also practised by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> way of penance, with indignation against the follies of the Tongue, and the itch of prating, so to chastise that petulant member, as if there were a great pleasure in prating, which when it grew inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, it was to be restrained and punished like other lusts. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was reported of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit, Scholar of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> that having once asked whether Christ or the old Prophets were first, he grew so ashamed of his foolish Question, that he spake not a word for 3 years following: And <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> reports of him, being deceived by the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> spoke some fond things, and repenting of it, held his tongue till his dying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> day, <hi>ut peccatum quod loquendo contraxerat tacendo penitùs emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daret.</hi> Though the pious minde is in such actions highly to be regarded, yet I am no way perswaded of the prudence of such a deadnesse and <hi>Libitinarian</hi> Religion;</p>

But when we draw neer to give counsell, we shall finde that upon a talking person scarce any medicine will stick.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Plutarch</hi> advises that <hi>such men should give themselves to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> that making an issue in the arme, it should drain the flouds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the head; supposing that if the humour were any way vented, the tongue might be brought to reason. But the experience of the world hath confuted this; and when <hi>Ligurinus</hi> had writ a Poem, he talked of it to all companies he came in; But however, it can be no hurt to try, for some have been cured of bleeding at the nose, by opening a vein in the arm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some advise, that such persons should keep company with their betters, with grave, and wise, and great persons, before whom men doe not usually bring forth all, but the better parts of their discourse, and this is apt to give assistance by the help of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

But he that works and works alone, he hath imployment, and no opportunity. But this is but a cure of the symptome and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary effect; but the disease may remain yet. Therefore,</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 5. Some advise that the businesse and imployment of the Tongue be changed into Religion, and if there be a <hi>pruritus</hi> or itch of talking, let it be in matters of Religion, in prayers and pious discourses, in glorifications of God, and the wise sayings of Scripture and Holy men; this indeed will secure the material part, and make that the discourses in their nature shall be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But I fear this cure will either be improper, or unsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For in prayers, multitude of words is sometime foolish, very often dangerous, and of all things in the world we must be carefull we bring not to God <hi>the sacrifice of fooles;</hi> and the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much of the things of Scripture hath ministred often to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and divisions. But therefore whoever will use this remedy must never dwell long upon any one instance, but by variety of holy duties entertaine himselfe; for he may easily exceed his rule in any thing, but in speaking honorably of God, and in that let him enlarge himselfe as he can; he shall never come to equall, much lesse to exceed that which is infinite.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But some men will never be cured without a <hi>Canker</hi> or a <hi>Squinsie;</hi> and such persons are taught by all men what to doe, for if they would avoyd all company, as willingly as company <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> avoyds them, they might quickly have a silence great as midnight, and prudent as the <hi>Spartan</hi> brevity. But Gods grace is sufficient to all that will make use of it; and there is no way for the cure of this evill, but the direct obeying of a counsel, and submitting to the precept, and fearing the divine threatning; alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that <hi>of every word a man speaks, he shall give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the day of Judgement:</hi> I pray God shew us all a mercy in that day, and forgive us the sins of the Tongue. <hi>Amen.</hi>

1. Concerning <hi>Stultiloquy,</hi> it is to be observed that the Masters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of spirituall life meane not, the <hi>talke</hi> and <hi>uselesse babble</hi> of weak and ignorant persons; because in their proportion they may serve their little mistaken ends of <hi>civility</hi> and <hi>humanity,</hi> as seemingly to them, as the strictest and most observed words of the wiser; if it be their best, their folly may be pityed, but not <hi>reproved,</hi> and to them there is no caution to be added, but that it were well if they would put the bridle into the hands of another, who may give them check when themselves cannot; and no wisdome can be required or usefull to them, but to suspect themselves and choose to be conducted by another. For so the little birds and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> laborious bees, who having no art and power of contrivance, no distinction of time, or foresight of new necessities, yet being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the hand, and counsel'd by the wisdome of the <hi>supreme power, their Lord,</hi> and <hi>ours,</hi> doe things with greater nicenesse and exactnesse of art, and regularity of time, and certainty of effect, then the wise Counsellour, who standing at the back of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces chaire, guesses imperfectly, and counsels timorously, and thinks by interest, and determines <hi>extrinsecall</hi> events by inward and unconcerning principles; because these have understanding, but it is lesse then the infinity of accidents and contingences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> without; but the other having none, are wholly guided by him that knows and determines all things: So it is in the imperfect designes and actions and discourses of weaker people; if they can be rul'd by an understanding without, when they have none within, they shall receive this advantage, that their owne passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall not transport their mindes, and the divisions and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their owne sense and notices shall not make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and indeterminate; and the measures they shall walke by, shall be disinterest and even, and dispassionate, and full of observation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which is here meant by <hi>Stultiloquy,</hi> or foolish spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is the <hi>Lubricum verbi,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> calls it, <hi>the slipping with the tongue,</hi> which prating people often suffer, whose discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses betray the vanity of their spirit, and discover <hi>the hidden man of the heart.</hi> For no prudence is a sufficient guard, or can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes stand <hi>in excubiis</hi> still watching, when a man is in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall flouds of talke; for prudence attends after the manner of an Angels ministery; it is dispatched on messages from God, and drives away enemies, and places guards, and calls upon the man to awake, and bids him send out spies and observers, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then goes about his own ministeries above: but an Angell does not sit by a man, as a nurse by the babies cradle, watching every motion and the lighting of a flie upon the childes lip: and so is prudence; it gives us rules and proportions cut our measures, and prescribes us cautions, and by generall influences orders our
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50231:154"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> particulars; but hee that is given to talke cannot be secured by all this; the emissions of his tongue are beyond the generall figures and lines of rule; and he can no more be wise in every period of a long and running talke, then a Lutenist can delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and make every motion of his hand by the division of his notes, to be chosen and distinctly voluntary. And hence it comes that at every corner of the mouth a folly peeps out, or a mischiefe creeps in. A little pride and a great deale of vanity will soon escape, while the man mindes the sequel of his talke, and not that uglinesse of humour which the severe man that stood by, did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> observe, and was ashamed of. Doe not many men talke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into anger, skrewing up themselves with dialogues and fancy, till they forget the company and themselves? and some men hate to be contradicted, or interrupted, or to be discovered in their folly; and some men being a little conscious, and not striving to amend it by silence, they make it worse by discourse; a long story of themselves, a tedious praise of another collaterally to do themselves advantage, a declamation against a sin to undoe the person, or oppresse the reputation of their neighbour, unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repetition of that which neither profits nor delights, trifling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> contentions about a goats beard, or the blood of an oyster, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and animosity, spite and rage, scorn and reproach begun upon Questions, which concern neither of the litigants, fierce disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, strivings for what is past, and for what shall never be, these are the events of the loose and unwary tongue; which are like flies and gnats upon the margent of a poole, they doe not sting like an Aspic, or bite deep as a Bear, yet they can vex a man into a feaver and impatience, and make him uncapable of rest and counsel.</p>

But <hi>cheerfulnesse</hi> and a <hi>festivall spirit</hi> fills the soule full of harmony, it composes musick for Churches and hearts, it makes and publishes glorifications of God, it produces thankfulnesse and serves the ends of charity, and when the oyle of gladnesse runs over, it makes bright and tall emissions of light and holy fires, reaching up to a cloud, and making joy round about: And therefore since it is so innocent, and may be so pious and full of holy advantage, whatsoever can innocently minister to this holy joy does set forward the work of Religion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And indeed <hi>charity</hi> it selfe, which is the verticall top of all Religion, <hi>is nothing else but an union of joyes, concentred in the heart, and reflected from all the angles of our life and entercourse.</hi> It is a rejoycing in God, a gladnesse in our neighbors good, a pleasure in doing good, a rejoycing with him; and without love we cannot have any joy at all.

But when the jest hath teeth and nails, biting or scratching our Brother*, when it is loose and wanton*, when it is unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable*, and much, or many*, when it serves ill purposes*, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> spends better time*, then it is <hi>the drunkennesse of the soul,</hi> and makes the spirit fly away, seeking for a Temple where the mirth and the musick is solemne and religious.</p>
                  <p>But above all the abuses which ever dishonoured the tongues of men, nothing more deserves the whip of an exterminating Angel, or the stings of scorpions, then <hi>profane jesting:</hi> which is a bringing of the Spirit of God to partake of the follies of a man; as if it were not enough for a man to be a foole, but the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God must be brought into those horrible scenes: He that makes a jest of the words of Scripture, or of holy things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> playes with thunder, and kisses the mouth of a Canon, just as it belches fire and death; he stakes heaven at spurnpoint, and trips crosse and pile whether ever he shall see the face of God or no; he laughs at damnation, while he had rather lose God then lose his jest; may (which is the horror of all) he makes a jest of God himselfe, and the Spirit of the Father and the Son to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ridiculous.

But this mischief growes according to the subject matter and its effect; and the tongue of a babbler may crush a mans bones, or break his fortune upon her owne wheel; and whatever the effect be, yet of it self it is the betraying of a trust, and by <hi>reproach,</hi> oftentimes passes on to intolerable calamities, like a criminal to his scaffold through the execrable gates of Cities; And though it is infinitely worse when the secret is laid open out of spite or treachery, yet it is more foolish when it is discovered for no other end but to serve the itch of talking, or to seem to know, or to be accounted worthy of a trust; for so some men open their cabinets to shew onely that a treasure is laid up, and that themselves were valued by their friend, when they were thought capable of a secret; <hi>but they shall be so no more;</hi> for he that by that means goes in pursuit of reputation, loses the substance by snatching at the shadow, and by desiring to be thought worthy of a secret, proves himselfe unworthy of friendship or society. <hi>D' Avila</hi> tels of a <hi>French</hi> Marquesse, young and fond, to whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had conveyed notice of the intended massacre, which when he had whispered into the Kings ear, where there was no danger of publication, but onely would seem a person worthy of such a trust, he was instantly murder'd, lest a vanity like that might unlock so horrid a mysterie.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing more to adde concerning this, but that if this vanity happens in the matters of Religion, it puts on some new circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of deformity: And if he that ministers to the souls of men, and is appointed to <hi>restore him that is overtaken in a fault,</hi> shall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the secrets of a conscience, he prevaricates the bands of Nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and Religion, in stead of a Father he turns an Accuser, a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, he weakens the hearts of the penitent, and drives the repenting man from his remedy by making it to be intolerable; and so Religion becomes a scandall, and his duty is made his disgrace, and Christs yoke does bow his head unto the ground, and the secrets of the Spirit passe into the shames of the world, and all the sweetnesses by which the severity of the duty are alleviated and made easie, are imbittered and become venemous by the tongue of a talking fool. <hi>Valerius So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi> was put to death by the old and braver <hi>Romanes, ob meritum profanae vocis, quòd contra interdictum Romae nomen eloqui fuit</hi>

                  <p>These I reckon as the proper evils of the vain and trifling tongue; for though the effect passes into further mischief, yet the originall is weaknesse and folly, and all that unworthynesse which is not yet arrived at malice. But hither also upon the same account some other irregularities of speech are reducible, which although they are of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> mixt nature, yet are properly acted by a vain and a loose tongue; and therefore here may be considered not improperly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is common Swearing, against which St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> spends twenty homilies: and by the number and weight of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath left this testimony, that it is a foolish vice, but hard to be cured; infinitely unreasonable, but strangely prevailing; almost as much without remedy as it is without pleasure; for it enters first by folly, and grows by custome, and dwels with carelesnesse, and is nurs'd by irreligion, and want of the fear of God; it profanes the <hi>most holy things,</hi> and mingles dirt with the beames of the Sun, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> follies and trifling talke interweav'd and knit together with the sacred name of God; it placeth the most excellent of things in the meanest and basest circumstances, it brings the secrets of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the streets, dead mens bones into a Temple; Nothing is a greater sacriledge then to prostitute the great name of God to the petulancy of an idle tongue, and blend it as an expletive to fill up the emptinesse of a weak discourse. The name of <hi>God</hi> is so sacred, so mighty, that it rends mountains, it opens the bowels of the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest rocks, it casts out Devils and makes Hell to tremble, and fills all the regions of Heaven with joy; the name of God is our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> strength and confidence, the object of our worshippings, and the security of all our hopes; and when God had given himselfe a Name, and immur'd it with dread and reverence, like the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> with the swords of Cherubims, and none durst speak it but he whose lips were hallowed, and that at holy and solemn times, in a most holy and solemne place; I mean the High Priest of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the solemnities when he entred into the sanctuary, then he taught all the world the majesty and veneration of his Name; and therefore it was, that God made restraints upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and expressions of him: and as he was infinitely curious, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that from all the appearances he made to them, they should not depict or ingrave an image of him; so he tooke care that even the tongue should be restrained, and not be too free in forming images and representments of his Name; and therefore as God drew their eyes from vanity, by <hi>putting his name amongst them,</hi> and <hi>representing no shape;</hi> so even when he had <hi>put his name amongst</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:50231:158"/>
                     <hi>them,</hi> he took it off from the tongue and placed it before the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> eye; for <hi>Jehovah</hi> was so written on the Priests Mitre, that all might see and read, but none speak it but the Priest. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, there is one great thing concerning the Name of God, beyond all that can be spoken or imagined else; and that is, that when God the Father was pleased to pour forth all his glories, and imprint them upon his holy Son in his exaltation, it was by giving him his <hi>holy Name,</hi> the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> or <hi>Jehovah</hi> made articulate; to signifie <hi>God manifested in the flesh;</hi> and so he wore the character of God, and became the bright image of his person. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all these great things concerning the Name of God are infinite reproofes of common and vain swearing by it, Gods name is left us here to pray by, to hope in, to be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conveyance of our worshippings, to be the witnesse of truth and the Judge of secrets, the end of strife and the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of perjury, the discerner of right and the severe exacter of all wrongs; and shall all this be unhallowed by impudent tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God without sense, or feare, or notices, or reverence, or observation?</p>
                  <p>One thing more I have to adde against this vice of a foolish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> tongue, and that is, that as much prating fils the discourse with lying, so this trifling swearing changes every trifling lye into a horrid perjury; and this was noted by St. <hi>James, But above all things swear not at all,</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in all the dimensions of the sin, till it grows intolerable, and perhaps unpardonable.

Every state is set in the midst of danger, as all trees are set in the wind, but the tallest endure the greatest violence of tempest: No man flatters a begger, if he does a slovenly and rude crime it is entertained with ruder language, and the mean man may possibly be affrighted from his fault, while it is made so uneasie to him by the scorn and harsh reproaches of the mighty. But Princes and Nobles often die with this disease: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when the <hi>Courtiers</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> counterfeited his wry neck, and the Servants of the <hi>Sicilian Tyrant</hi> pretended themselves dim sighted, and on purpose rushed one against another, and overthrew the meat as it was served to his table, onely because the Prince was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, they gave them sufficient instances in what state of affaires they stood with them that waited; it was certain they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend every foolish answer, and pretend subtilty in every absurd question, and make a petition that their base actions might passe into a law, and be made to be the honor and sanctity of all the people: and what proportions or wayes can such great personages have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> felicity, when their vice shall be allowed and praised, every action that is but tolerable shall be accounted heroicall, and if it be intolerable among the wise, it shall be called vertuous among the flatterers? <hi>Carneades</hi> said bitterly, but it had in it too many degrees of truth; that Princes and great personages never learn to doe any thing perfectly well, but to ride the great horse, <hi>quia scil. ferociens bestia adulari non didicit,</hi> because the proud beast knows not how to flatter, but will as soon throw him off from his back as he will shake off the son of a Potter. But a Flatterer is like a neighing Horse, that neigheth under every rider, and is pleased with every thing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all that he sees, and tempts to mischief, and cares not, so his friend may but <hi>perish pleasantly.</hi> And indeed that is a calamity that undoes many a soul; we so love our peace, and sit so easily upon our own good opinions, and are so apt to flatter our selves, and leane upon our own false supports, that we cannot endure to be disturb'd or awakened from our pleasing lethargy. For we care not to be

                     <hi>safe,</hi> but to be <hi>secure,</hi> not to escape hell, but to live pleasantly; we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are not solicitous of the event, but of the way thither, and it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if we be perswaded all his well; in the mean time we are carelesse whether indeed it be so or no, and therefore we give pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to fools and vile persons to abuse us, and cousen us of felicity. But this evill puts on severall shapes, which we must discover, that they may not cousen us without our observation. For all men are not capable of an open flattery. And therefore some will dresse their hypocrisie and illusion so, that you may feel the pleasure, and but secretly perceive the complyance and tendernesse to serve the ends of your folly? <hi>perit procari, si latet,</hi> said <hi>Plancus,</hi> If you be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> perceived, you lose your reward; if you be too open, you lose it worse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

This put buskins upon <hi>Nero,</hi> and made him fidle in all the great Towns of <hi>Greece.</hi> When their Lords were Drunkards, they called them <hi>Bacchus;</hi> when they were Wrestlers, they saluted them by the name of <hi>Hercules;</hi> and some were so vain as to think themselves commended, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when their Flatterers told aloud, that <hi>they had drunk more then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the Conquerour.</hi> And indeed nothing more abuses easie fooles that onely seek for an excuse for their wickednesse, a Patron for their vice, a warrant for their sleepy peace, then to tell stories of great examples remarked for the instances of their temptation. When old <hi>Cato</hi> commended meretricious mixtures, and to prevent <hi>adulteries</hi> permitted <hi>fornication,</hi> the youth of the succeeding ages had warrant enough to goe <hi>ad olentes fornices,</hi> into their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of filthy pleasure;</p>

                  <p>And it would passe the goblets in a freer circle, if a flattering man shall but say, <hi>Narratur &amp; prisci Catonis saepè mero caluisse virtus,</hi> that old <hi>Cato</hi> would drink hard at sun-set. When <hi>Varro</hi> had noted, that wise and severe <hi>Salust,</hi> who by excellent sententious words had reproved the follies of lust, was himselfe taken in adultery, The <hi>Romane</hi> youth did hug their vice, and thought it grew upon their nature like a mans beard, and that the wisest men would lay their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> heads upon that threshold; and <hi>Seneca</hi> tels that the women of that age despised the adultery of one man onely; and hated it like marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and despis'd that as want of breeding, and grandeur of spirit, because the braver <hi>Spartans</hi> did use to breed their children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously, as the Heards-men doe cattle from the fairest Buls.

                     <hi>Arrianus</hi> tels that the women would defend their basenesse by the doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> who maintain'd the community of women. This sort of flattery is therefore more dangerous, because it makes the temptation ready for mischief, apted and dressed with proper, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, and imitable circumstances. The way of discourse is far about, but evill examples kill quickly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others flatter by imitation: for when a crime is rare and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, singular and out of fashion, it must be a great strength of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and impudence that must entertain it; but the flattering man do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vice of his Lord takes off the wonder, and the fear of being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> stared at; and so incourages it by making it <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>common. Plutarch</hi> tels of one that divorced himself from his wife because his friend did so; that the other might be hardened in the mischief; and when <hi>Plato</hi> saw his scholars stoop in the shoulders, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his to stammer, they began to be lesse troubled with those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which they thought common to themselves and others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some pretend a <hi>rusticity</hi> and downright plainnesse, and upon the confidence of that humour their friends vice, and flatter his ruine. <hi>Seneca</hi> observed it of some of his time; <hi>alius quidam adulatione clam utebatur parcè, alius ex aperto palm, rusticitate simulatâ, quasi simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>illa ars non sit.</hi> They pretend they love not to dissemble, and therefore they cannot hide their thoughts; let their friend take it how he will, they must commend that which is commendable; and so man that is willing to dye quietly, is content with the honest hearty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and downright simplicity of him that with an artificial rudenesse dress'd the flattery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some will dispraise themselves that their friend may think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of himselfe, or lesse severely of his fault.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Others will reprove their friend for a trifle, but with a purpose to let him understand, that this is all; for the honest man would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have told his friend if it had been worse.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Some will laugh and make a sport of a vice, and can hear their friend tell the cursed narrative of his adultery, of his drunkennesse, of his craft and unjust purchases; and all this shall prove but a merry scene; as if damnation were a thing to be laughed at, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting ruine of his friend were a very good jest. But thus the poor sinner shall not be affrighted from his danger, nor chastised by severe language, but the villain that eats his meat shall take him by the hand, and dance about the pit till he fals in, and dies with shame and folly. Thus the evill Spirit puts on shapes enough; none to affright the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> man, but all to destroy him; and yet it is filthy enough when it is invested with its own character:</p>

                  <p>I have this one thing onely to insert, and then the caution will be sufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> that we doe not think all praise given to our friend to be flattery, though it be in his presence. For sometimes praise is the best conveyance for a precept, and it may nourish up an infant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and make it grow up towards perfection, and its proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and rewards. <hi>Friendship</hi> does better please our friend then <hi>flattery,</hi> and though it was made also for vertue, yet it mingles plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the chalice, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>it is delicious to behold the face of a friendly and a sweet person;</hi> and it is not the office of a friend alwayes to be sowre, or at any time morose; but free, open, and ingenuous, candid and humane, not denying to please, but ever refusing to abuse or corrupt. For as adulterine metals retain the lustre and colour of gold, but not the value; so <hi>flattery</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>friendship</hi> takes the face and outside of it, the delicious part; but the flatterer uses it to the interests of vice, and a friend by it serves vertue; and therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> well compared <hi>friendship</hi> to medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall oyntments, which however delicious they be, yet they are also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> usefull, and minister to healing. But flattery is sweet and adulterate, pleasant but without health. He therefore that justly commends his friend to promote and incourage his vertue, reconciles vertue with his friends affection, and makes it <hi>pleasant to be good;</hi> and he that does so, shall also better be suffered when he reproves, because the needing person shall finde that then is the opportunity and season of it, since he denyed not to please so long as he could also profit. I onely adde this advice, that since <hi>selfe-love is the serpents milk</hi> that feeds this viper <hi>flattery,</hi> we should doe well to choke it with its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers milk; I mean, learn to love our selves more, for then we should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> never endure to be flattered. For he that because he loves himselfe, loves to be flattered, does, because he loves himself, love to entertain a man to abuse him, to mock him, and to destroy him finally. But he that loves himselfe truly, will suffer fire, will endure to be burnt, so he may be purified; put to pain, so he may be restored to health; for <hi>of all sauces</hi> (said <hi>Euenus)</hi> sharpnesse, severity, and <hi>fire is the best.</hi>

But it is here as in all other propositions of Religion. God to us, who are in the body, and conducted by materiall phantasmes, and understanding nothing but what we feel, or is conveyed to us by the proportions of what we doe or have, hath given us a Religion that is fitted to our condition and constitution.

                     </gap>, apt to teach. For since all our hopes on our part depend upon our obedience to God, and conformity to our Lord Jesus, by whom our endevours are sanctified and accepted, and our weaknesses are pardoned, and all our obedience relies upon, and is incouraged and grounded in faith, and faith is founded naturally and primarily in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we may observe that it is not onely reasonably to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> expected, but experimentally felt, that in weak and and ignorant understandings there are no sufficient supports for the vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a holy life; there being nothing, or not enough to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and strengthen great resolutions, to reconcile our affections to difficulties, to make us patient of affronts, to receive deeper mortifications, and ruder usages, unlesse where an extraordinary grace supplies the want of ordinary notices, as the Apostles were enabled to their preachings: But he therefore that carries and imports into the understanding of his Brother, notices of faith, and incomes of spirituall propositions, and arguments of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Spirit, enables his brother towards the work and practises of a holy life: and though every argument which the Spirit of God hath made and recorded in holy Scripture, is of it selfe induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment great enough to endear obedience; yet it is not so in the event of things to every mans infirmity, and need; but in the treasures of the Spirit, in the heaps and variety of institution, and wise discourses, there will not onely be enough to make a man without excuse, but sufficient to doe his work and to cure his evill, and to fortifie his weaker parts, and to comply with his necessities; for although Gods sufficient grace is present to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all that can use it, yet if there be no more then that, it is a sad consideration to remember, that there are but few that will be saved, if they be helped but with just so much as can possibly doe the work: and this we may well be assured of, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God is never wanting to any man in what is simply necessary; but then if we adde this also, that of the vast numbers of men who might possibly be saved, so few really are so, we shall perceive that that grace which onely is sufficient, is not sufficient; <hi>sufficient to the thing, is not sufficient for the person;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God does usually give us more, and we need more yet; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and unlesse God <hi>works in us to will and to doe,</hi> we shall neither <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>doe;</hi> though to will be in the power of our hand, yet we will not will; it follows from hence that all they who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Gods method of graciousnesse, and the necessities of their Brethren, must endevour by all meanes, and in all their owne measures, and capacities to lay up treasures of notices and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions

in their brothers soul, that by some argument or other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they may be met withall and taken in every corner of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. Adde to this, that the duty of a man hath great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and the souls of men are infinitely abused, and the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men are strangely divided, and the interests of men are a violent and preternaturall declination from the strictnesses of vertue, and the resolutions of men are quickly altered, and very hardly to be secured, and the cases of conscience are numerous and intricate, and every state of life that hath its proper prejudice, and our notices are abused by our affections, and we shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that men generally need knowledge enough to over-power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all their passions, to root out their vitious inclinations, to master their prejudice, to answer objections, to resist temptations, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh their wearynesse, to fixe their resolutions, and to determine their doubts; and therefore to see your brother in a state of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, is to see him unfurnished and unprepared to all good works, a person safe no longer then till a temptation comes, and one that cannot be saved but by an absolute unlimited <hi>predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> a favour of which he hath no promise, no security, no revelation; and although to doe this God, hath appointed a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Order of men, the whole <hi>Ecclesiasticall Order,</hi> whom he feeds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at his owne charges, and whom men rob at their owne perill, yet this doth not disoblige others: for every Master of a family is to instruct, or cause his family to be instructed, and catechised; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Governour is to instruct his charge, every Man his Brother, not alwayes in person, but ever by all possible and just provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For if the people dye for want of knowledge, <hi>they who are set over them</hi> shall also die for want of charity. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must remember, that it is the duty of us all, in our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall measures and proportions, to instruct those that need it, and whose necessity is made ready for our ministration; and let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us tremble to think what will be the sad account which we shall make when even our families are not taught in the fundamentals of Religion; for how can it be possible for those who could not account concerning the stories of Christs life and death, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries of their redemption, the foundation of all their hopes, the great argument of all their obediences; how can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they should ride in triumph over all the evills which the Devill, and the World, and their owne follies daily present to them in the course of every dayes conversation? And it will be an ill return to say, that God will require no more of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then he hath given them; for suppose that be true in your own sense, yet he will require it of thee, because thou gavest them no more; and however, it is a formidable danger, and a trifling hope for any man to put all the hopes of his being saved upon the onely stock of ignorance; for if his ignorance should never be

For since halfe the duty of a Christian in this life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the exercise of passive graces, and the infinite variety of providence, and the perpetuall adversity of chances, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction and emptynesse that is in things themselves, and the wearynesse and anguish of our spirit does call us to the trial and exercise of patience even in the dayes of sunshine, and much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> more in the violent storms that shake our dwellings, and make our hearts tremble; God hath sent some Angels into the world, whose office it is to refresh the sorrowes of the poore, and to lighten the eyes of the disconsolate; he hath made some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whose powers are chiefly ordain'd to comfort; <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>oyle,</hi> and <hi>society, cordials</hi> and <hi>variety;</hi> and <hi>time</hi> it selfe is chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker'd with black and white; stay but till to morrow, and your present sorrow will be weary, and will lie downe to rest. But this is not all. The third person of the holy Trinity is known to us by the name and dignity of the <hi>Holy Ghost the Comforter,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and God glories in the appellative, that he is <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> and <hi>the God of all comfort,</hi> and therefore to minister in the office is to become like God, and to imitate the charities of heaven; and God hath fitted mankinde for it; he most needs it, and he feels his brothers wants by his owne experience, and God hath given us speech, and the endearments of society, and pleasantness of conversation, and powers of seasonable discourse, arguments to allay the sorrow, by abating our apprehensions and taking out the sting, or telling the periods of comfort, or exciting hope, or urging a precept, and reconciling our affections, and reciting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> promises, or telling stories of the Divine mercy, or changing it into duty, or making the burden lesse by comparing it with greater, or by proving it to be lesse then we deserve, and that it is so intended, and may become the instrument of vertue. And certain it is, that as nothing can better doe it, so there is nothing greater, for which God made our tongues, next to reciting his prayses, then to minister comfort to a weary soul. And what greater measure can we have, then that we should bring joy to our brother, who with his dreary eyes looks to heaven and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and cannot finde so much rest as to lay his eye-lids close <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> together, then that thy tongue should be tun'd with heavenly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and make the weary soul <hi>to listen</hi> for light and ease, and when he perceives that there is such a thing in the world, and in the order of things, as comfort and joy, <hi>to begin</hi> to break out from the prison of his sorrows at the dore of sighs and tears, and by little and little melt into showres and refreshment? This is glory

But so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> have I seen the sun kisse the frozen earth which was bound up with the images of death, and the colder breath of the North, and then the waters break from their inclosures, and melt with joy, and run in usefull channels, and the flies doe rise againe from their little graves in walls, and dance a while in the aire, to tell that there is joy within, and that the great mother of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will open the stock of her new refreshment, become usefull to mankinde, and sing prayses to her Redeemer: So is the heart of a sorrowfull man under the discourses of a wise Comforter, he breaks from the despairs of the grave, and the fetters and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> chains of sorrow, he blesses God, and he blesses thee, and he feels his life returning; for to be miserable is death, but nothing is life but to be comforted; and God is pleased with no musick from below so much as in the thanksgiving songs of relieved Widows, of supported Orphans, of rejoycing, and comforted, and thankfull persons. This part of communication does the work of God and of our Neighbors, and bears us to heaven in streams of joy made by the overflowings of our brothers comfort. It is a fearfull thing to see a man despairing.

And though God hath for this especially intrusted his Ministers and Servants of the Church, and hath put into their hearts and notices great magazines of promises, and arguments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of hope and arts of the Spirit, yet God does not alwayes send Angels on these embassies, but sends a man <hi>ut sit homo homini Deus,</hi> that every good man in his season may be to his brother in the place of God, to comfort and restore him; and that it may appear how much it is the duty of us all to minister com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to our brother, we may remember that the same words and the same arguments doe oftentimes more prevaile upon our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits when they are applyed by the hand of another, then when they dwell in us, and come from our owne discoursings.

                  <p>Some will not endure that a pore man, or an obliged person should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reprove them, and themselves are often so unprofitable servants that they will rather venture their friends damnation then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their owne interest, therefore in the performance of this duty of the usefull communication, the following measures are fit to be observed.</p>

1. <hi>Let not your reproofe be publick and personall:</hi> if it be <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it must be in <hi>generall;</hi> if it be <hi>personall,</hi> it must be in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;</hi> and this is expressely commanded by our blessed Saviour: <hi>If thy Brother offends, tell it him between him and thee;</hi> for when it comes afterwards in case of contumacy to be declared in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it passes from <hi>fraternall correption</hi> to <hi>Ecclesiasticall discipline.</hi> When <hi>Socrates</hi> reproved <hi>Plato</hi> at a feast, <hi>Plato</hi> told him, it had been better he had told him his fault in private; for to speak it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly is indecency: <hi>Socrates</hi> replyed; and so it is for you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to condemne that indecency. For it is the nature of man to be spitefull when he is shamed, and to esteem that the worst of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> evils, and therefore to take <hi>impudence</hi> and <hi>perseverance</hi> for its cover, when his shame is naked: And for this indiscretion <hi>Aristomenes</hi> the Tutor of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> who before the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Embassadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the King for sleeping at the solemne audience, profited nothing, but enraged the Prince, and was himself forc'd to drink poyson. But this warinesse is not alwayes necessary. For 1. a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and an authoriz'd person, may doe it publickly, and may name the person as himself shall judge expedient.</p>

                     <hi>Lucilius</hi> was a censor of manners, and by his office he had warrant and authority. 2. There are also some cases in which a publick reproofe is prudent, and that is when the crime is great, but not understood to be any at all; for then it is <hi>Instruction</hi> and <hi>Catechism,</hi> and layes aside the affront and trouble of reproofe. Thus <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr did reprove <hi>Trajan</hi> sacrificing at the Altar in the sight of all the Officers of the Army; and the <hi>Iews</hi> were commanded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 11.</note> to reprove the <hi>Babylonians</hi> for Idolatry in the land of their Captivity: and if we see a Prince in the confidence of his pride, and carelesnesse of spirit, and heat of war spoyle a Church or rob God, it is then fit to tell him the danger of Sacriledge, if otherwise he cannot well be taught his danger, and his duty. 3. There are some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of person in which by interpretation, duty or custome a leave is indulged or presum'd, that liberty may be prudently used, publickly to reprove the publick vices: so it was in the old days of the <hi>Romans;</hi> vice had then so little footing and authority, so few friends and advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, that the Prophets and Poets used a bolder liberty to disgrace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whatsoever was amisse;</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and much of the same liberty is still reserved to Pulpits, and to the Bishops office, save onely, that although they may reprove pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, yet they may not often doe it personally.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Use not to reprove thy brother for every thing, but for great things onely:</hi> for this is the office of a Tutor, not of a Friend; and few men will suffer themselves to abide alwayes under Pupillage. When the friend of <hi>Philotimus</hi> the Physician came to him to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a sore finger, he told him, <hi>Heus tu, non tibi cum reduvia est nego<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But when a vice stains his soule, when he is a foole in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when he is proud, and impatient of contradiction, when he disgraces himselfe by talking weakly, and yet beleeves himselfe wise, and above the confidence of a sober person, then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns a friend to rescue him from folly. So <hi>Solon</hi> reproved <hi>Croesus,</hi> and <hi>Socrates Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> chid <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> told <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to <hi>Dion</hi> that of all things in the world he should beware of that folly, <hi>by which men please themselves, and despise a better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: quia ei vitio adsidet solitudo,</hi> Because that folly hath in it singularity, and is directly contrary to all capacities of a friendship, or the entertainments of necessary reproofe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Vse not liberty of reproofe in the dayes of sorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;</hi> for the calamity it self is enough to chastise the gayeties of sinning persons, and to bring him to repentance; it may be sometimes fit to insinuate the mention of the cause of that sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in order to repentance, and a cure: But severe and biting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> language is then out of season, and it is like putting vineger to an enflamed and smarting eye, it increases the anguish, and tempts unto impatience. In the accidents of a sad person, we must doe as nurses to their falling children, snatch them up and still their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and entertain their passion with some delightfull avocation; but chide not then when the sorrowfull man needs to be refreshed. When <hi>Crater</hi> the <hi>Cynic</hi> met <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> in his banishment and trouble, he went to him and spoke to him friendly, and used his Philosophy in the ministeries of comfort, and taught him to bear his trouble nobly, and so wrought upon the <hi>criminal,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>wilde Demetrius;</hi> and he moved him to repentance, who if he had been chidden (as he expected) would have scorn'd the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Cynic,</hi> and hated his presence and institution; and <hi>Perseus</hi> kil'd <hi>Euchus</hi> and <hi>Eulaeus,</hi> for reproving his rashnesse, when he was newly defeated by the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

4. <hi>Avoid all the evill appendages of this liberty:</hi> for since to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reprove a sinning brother is at the best but an unwelcome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious employment, though it may also be understood to be full of charity; yet therefore we must not make it to be hatefull by adding reproach, scorn, violent expressions, scurrility, derision, or bitter invectives. <hi>Hieron</hi> invited <hi>Epicharmus</hi> to supper, and he knowing that <hi>Hieron</hi> had unfortunately kil'd his friend, replyed to his invitation, <hi>At<expan>

                        </expan> nuper cum amicos immolares non vorasti,</hi> I think I may come, for when thou didst sacrifice thy friends thou didst not devour them. This was a bitter <hi>sarcasme,</hi> and might with more prudence and charity have been avoyded. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that intend charitably and conduct wisely, take occasions and proper seasons of reproof, they doe it by way of question and similitude, by narrative and apologues, by commending something in him that is good, and discommending the same fault in other persons by way that may disgrace that vice, and preserve the reputation of the man. <hi>Ammonius</hi> observing that his Scholars were nice and curious in their diet, and too effeminate for a Philosophicall life, caused his freed man to chastise his boy for not dining without vinegar, and all the while look'd upon the young Gentlemen, and read to them a lecture of Severity. Thus our dearest Lord reproved St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he look'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> upon him when the signe was given with the crowing of the Cock, and so chid him into a showre of penitentiall tears. Some use to mingle prayses with their reprehensions, and to invite their friends patience to endure remedy, by ministring some pleasure with their medicine; for as no wise man can well indure to be praised by him that knows not how to disprayse, and to reprove; so neither will they endure to be reproved by him that knows not how to praise; for reproof from such a man betrayes too great a love of himselfe, and an illiberall spirit: He that will reprove wisely, must efform himselfe into all images of things which innocently and wisely he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> can put on; not by changing his manners, his principles, and the consequences of his discourse, (as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was supposed to doe) for it is best to keep the severity of our owne principles, and the manner of our owne living: for so <hi>Plato</hi> lived at <hi>Syracuse,</hi> just as he lived in the <hi>Academy;</hi> he was the same to <hi>Dionysius</hi> that he was to <hi>Dion:</hi> But this I mean, that he who meanes to win soules, and prevail to his brothers institution, must as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, effigiate and conform himself to those circumstances of living, and discourse, by which he may prevaile upon the persuasions, by complying with the affections and usages of men. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are the measures by which we are to communicate our counsels and advices to our erring Brethren: to which I adde this last advice, That no man should at that time in which he is reproved give counsell and reproofe to his Reprover, for that betrayes an angry spirit, and makes discord out of piety, and changes charity into
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50231:170"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wrangling, and it looking like a revenge, makes it appear that himself took the first reproofe for an injury.</p>
                  <p>That which remaines now is, that I persuade men to doe it, and that I persuade men to suffer it; 'tis sometimes hard <hi>to doe it,</hi> but the cause is onely, because it is hard <hi>to bear it;</hi> for if men were but apprehensive of their danger, and were not desirous to die, there were no more to be said in this affair; they would be as glad to entertain a severe Reprover as a carefull Physitian; of whom because most men are so willing to make use, so thankfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for their care, so great valuers of their skill, such lovers of their persons; no man is put to it to persuade men to be Physitians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no need to persuade men to live, or to be in health: if therefore men would as willingly be vertuous as be healthfull, as willingly doe no evill as suffer none, be as desirous of heaven as of a long life on earth, all the difficulties and temptations against this duty of reproving our sinning brother would soon be conceal'd; but let it be as it will, we must doe it in duty and piety to him that needs, and if he be impatient of it, he needs it more: <hi>Et per bujusmodi offensas emetiendum est confragosum hoc iter:</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is a troublesome imployment, but it is duty and charity; and therefore when it can with hope of successe, with prudence and piety be done, no other consideration ought to interpose. And for the other part, those I mean who ought to be reproved, they are to remember, that themselves give pensions to the Preacher on purpose to be reproved if they shall need it*, that God hath instituted a holy Order of men to that very purpose*, that they should be severally told of all that is amisse*, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves chide their children and their servants for their good, and that they may amend*, and that they endure thirst to cure their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dropsies*, that they suffer burnings to prevent the gangrenes*, and endure the cutting off a limbe to preserve their lives*, and therefore that it is a strange witchcraft and a prodigious folly, that at so easie a mortification as the suffering of a plain friendly reproofe, they will not set forward their interest of heaven, and suffer themselves to be set forward in their hopes of heaven:</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And when all remember that flattery and importune silence suffer the mighty to perish like fooles and inconsiderate persons, it ought to awake our spirits, and make us to attend to the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of a friend, with a silence great as midnight, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as a widows eyes. It was a strange thing that <hi>Valentinian</hi> should in the midst of so many Christian Prelates make a law to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50231:171"/>
establish <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and that no Bishop should dare to reprehend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him. The effect of it was this, that he had a son by a second wife, the first being alive and not divorc'd, and he left him heir of a great part of the Empire; and what the effect of that was to this soul, God who is his Judge best knows.</p>
                  <p>If now at last it be inquir'd whether every man is bound to reprove every man, if he sins, and if he converse with him? I answer, that if it should be so, it were to no purpose, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for it there is no commandement; every man that can may instruct him that wants it; but every man may not reprove him that is already instructed; that is an act of charity, for which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there are no measures, but the others necessity, and his own op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; but this is also an act of discipline, and must in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cases suppose an authority; and in all cases such a liberty as is not fit to be permitted to mean, and ignorant, and inferiour persons; I end this with the saying of a wise person, advising to every one concerning the use of the tongue, <hi>aut lucrentur vitam loquendo, aut tacendo abscondant scientiam;</hi> if they speak, let them minister to the good of souls; if they speak not, let them mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to sobriety; in the first they serve the end of charity, in the other of humility.</p>

                     <hi>a recorder, how prudent an observer, how sedulous a practiser of holy discourses she was, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, that what did slide thorow her ear, she was desirous to place before her eye, that by those windows they might enter in and dwell in her heart: But because by this truth I shall do advantage to the following discourses, give me leave (my Lord) to fancy, that this Book is derived upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship almost in the nature of a legacy from her, whose every thing was dearer to your Lordship, then your own eyes, and that what she was pleased to beleeve apt to minister to her devotions, and the religions of her pious and discerning soul, may also be allowed a place in your closet, and a portion of your retirement, and a lodging in your thoughts, that they may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and instruct your practise and promote that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, which is and ought to be dearer to you then all those blessings and separations with which God hath remarked your family and person.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord, I confesse the publication of these Sermons can so little serve the ends of my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I am therefore pleased the rather to do it, because I cannot at all be tempted, in so doing, to minister to any thing of vanity. Sermons may please when they first strike the ear, and yet appear flat and ignorant when they are offered to the eye, and to an understanding that can consider at leisure. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that a young Gentleman of Athens being to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for his life, hired an Orator to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and it pleased him well, at his first reading;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50231:174"/>
                     <hi>but when the young man by often reading it that he might recite it publikely by heart, began to grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and dspleased with it, the Orator bade him consider that the Judges and the people were to hear it but once, and then it was likely, they at that first instant might be as well pleased as he. This hath often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to my mind the condition and fortune of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and that I now part with the advantage they bad in their delivery, but I have sufficiently answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my self in that, and am at rest perfectly in my thoughts as to that particular, if I can in any degree serve the interest of souls, and (which is next to that) obey the piety, and record the memory of that dear Saint, whose name and whose soul is blessed: for in both these ministeries, I doubt not but your Lordship will be pleased, and account as if I had done also some service to your self: your religion makes me sure of the first, and your piety puts the latter past my fears. However, I suppose in the whole account of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, this publication may be esteemed but like preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a numerous Auditory, which if I had done, it would have been called either duty, or charity, and therefore will not now so readily be censured for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if I make use of all the wayes I can to minister to the good of souls: But because my intentions are fair in themselves, and I hope are acceptable to God, and will be fairly expounded by your Lordship, (whom for so great reason I so much value) I shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you or the world with an Apologie for this so free publishing my weaknesses; I can better secure my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50231:175"/>
                     <hi>by telling men how they ought to entertain Sermons, for if they that read or hear, do their duty aright, the Preacher shall soon be secured of his fame, and untouched by censure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For it were well, if men would not inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the learning of the sermon, or its deliciousnesse to the ear or fancy, but observe its usefulnesse, not what concerns the preacher, but what concerns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not what may make a vain reflexion upon him, but what may substantially serve their own needs, that the attending to his discourses may not be spent in vain talk concerning him, or his disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but may be used as a duty and a part of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to minister to edification and instruction. When S. John reckoned the principles of evil actions, he told but of three,</hi> The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. <hi>But there was then also in the world (and now it is grown into age, and strength, and faction) another lust,</hi> the lust of the ear, <hi>and a fift also,</hi> the lust of the tongue. <hi>Some people have an insatiable appetite in hearing, and hear onely that they may hear, and talk and make a party: They enter into their neighbours house to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their candle, and espying there, a glaring fire, sit down upon the hearth and warm themselves all day, and forget their errand, and in the mean time, their own fires are not lighted, nor their families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, or provided for, nor any need served, but a lazie pleasure, which is uselesse and imprudent. Hearing or reading sermons is, or ought to be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

                     <hi>to practise, for so God intended it, that</hi> faith should come by hearing, <hi>and that</hi> charity <hi>should come by</hi> faith, <hi>and by both together we may be saved. For a mans ears (as Plutarch cals them) are</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum ansae, <hi>by them we are to hold and apprehend vertue, and unlesse we use them as men do vessels of dishonour, filling them with things fit to be thrown away, with any thing that is not necessary, we are by them more neerly brought to God, then by all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses beside. For although things placed before the eye affect the minde more readily then the things we usually hear, yet the reason of that is, because we hear</hi> carelesly, <hi>and we hear</hi> variety; <hi>the same species dwels upon the eye, and represents the same object in union and single representment, but the objects of the ear are broken into fragments of periods, and words, and syllables, and must be attended with a carefull understanding; and because every thing diverts the sound, and every thing cals off the understanding, and the spirit of a man is truantly, and trifling; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that what men hear, does so little affect them, and so weakly work toward the purposes of vertue, &amp; yet nothing does so affect the minde of man as those voices to which we cannot chuse but attend, and</hi> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>and</hi> all loud voices <hi>from Heaven rend the most ston<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now since hearing is so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective an instrument of conveying impresses and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50231:176"/>
                     <hi>of things, and exciting purposes, and fixing reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, (unlesse we hear weakly and imperfectly) it will be of the greater concernment that we be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to hear in order to such purposes, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of the soul, and of the spirit, and not to dwell in fancy and speculation, in pleasures and trifling ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, which continue the soul in its infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, never letting it go forth into the wisdom and vertues of a man. I have read concerning Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius of Sicily, that being delighted extremely with a Minstrel that sung well, and struck his Harp dexterously, he promised to give him a great reward, and that raised the fancy of the Man, and made him play better. But when the musick was done and the man waited for his great hope, the King dismissed him empty, telling him, that he should carry away as much of the promised reward, as himself did of the Musick, and that he had payed him sufficiently with the pleasure of the promise for the pleasure of his song: both their ears had been equally delighted and the profit just none at all: So it is in many mens hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, they admire the Preacher, and he pleases their ears, and neither of them both bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them any good, and the hearer hath as little good by the sermon, as the Preacher by the ayr of the peoples breath, when they make a noise, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and understand not. And that also is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caution I desire all men would take.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That they may never trouble the affairs of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and hearing respectively, with admiring the</hi>

                     <hi>person of any man. To admire a preacher is such a reward of his pains or worth, as if you should crown a Conqueror with a garland of roses, or a Bride with Laurell; it is an undecency, it is no part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which could be intended for him. For though it be a good natur'd solly, yet it hath in it much danger, for by that means, the Preacher may lead his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers captive, and make them servants of a faction, or of a lust; it makes them so much the lesse to be servants of Christ, by how much they</hi> call any man Master upon earth; <hi>it weakens the heart and hands of others, it places themselves in a rank much below their proper station, changing from hearing</hi> the word of God, <hi>to admiration of</hi> the person and faces of men, <hi>and it being a</hi> fault <hi>that falls upon the more easie natures and softer understandings, does more easily abuse a man; and though such a person may have the good fortune to admire a good man and a wise, yet it is an ill disposition, and makes him liable to every mans abuse:</hi> Stupidum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem quâvis oratione percelli, <hi>said</hi> Heraclitus. <hi>An undiscerning person is apt to be cozened by every oration: And besides this, That Preacher whom some do admire, others will most certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and that also is to be provided against with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and you must not admire too forwardly,</hi> for your own sake, <hi>lest you fall into the hands of a worse preacher,</hi> and for his sake, <hi>whom when you admire you also love, for others will be apt to envy him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>But that must by all men be avoided; for envy</hi>

                     <hi>is the worst counsellour in the world, and the worst hearer of a wise discourse. I pity those men who live upon flattery and wonder, and while they sit at the foot of the Doctors chair, stare in his face, and cry</hi>

But those men that envy the preacher; besides that they are great enemies of the Holy Ghost, and are spitefully evil</hi> because God is good to him, <hi>they are also enemies to themselves. He that envies the honours, or the riches of another, envies for his own sake, and he would fain be rich with that wealth which sweats in his neighbours cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, but he that envies him that makes good sermons, envies himself, and is angry because himself may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit, and be</hi> improved, <hi>or</hi> delighted <hi>or</hi> instructed <hi>by another. He that is apt fondly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire any mans person must cure himself by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the Preacher is Gods minister and servant, that he speaks Gods word and does it by the Divine assistance, that he hath nothing of his own but sin and imperfection, that he does but his duty and that also hardly enough, that he is highly answerable for his talent, and stands deeply charged with the cure of souls, and therefore that he is to</hi> be highly esteemed for the work sake, <hi>not for the person; his industry and his charity is to be beloved, his ability is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50231:177"/>
                     <hi>upon another stock, and</hi> for it, <hi>the preacher and the hearer are both to give God thanks, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is due to the man</hi> for that, <hi>save onely, that it is the rather to be imployed, because by it we may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be instructed, but if any other reflexion be made upon his person, it is next to the sin and danger of Herod and the people, when the fine Oration was made</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with huge fancy <hi>the people were pleased, and Herod was admired, and God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and an Angel was sent to strike him with death and with dishonour. But the envy against a preacher is to be cured by a contrary discourse, and we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is in the place of God, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the gift of God, and the aids of the holy Ghost, that by his abilities God is glorified, and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and the interests of vertue, and holy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are promoted, that by this means God who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that all souls should serve him for ever, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have a fairer harvest of glory and service, and therefore that envie is against him: that if we envie because we are not the instrument of this good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we must consider that we desire the praise to our selves not to God.</hi> Admiration <hi>of a man sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses him to be inferiour to the person so admired, but then he is pleased so to be, but</hi> envie <hi>supposes him as low, and he is displeased at it, and the envious man is not onely lesse then the other mans vertue, but also contrary: the former is a</hi> vanity, <hi>but this is a</hi> vice, that wants wisdom, <hi>but</hi> this wants wisdom <hi>and</hi> charity <hi>too, that supposes an absence of some good,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50231:178"/>
                     <hi>but this is a direct affliction and calamity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>And after all this, if the preacher be not despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he may proceed cheerfully in doing his duty, and the hearer may have some advantages by every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I remember that Homer sayes the woers of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope laught at Ulisses, because at his return be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a loaf, and did not, to shew his gallantry, call for swords and spears; Vlysses was so wise as to call for that he needed, and had it, and it did him more good then a whole armory would in his case: so is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest part of an easie, and honest sermon, it is</hi> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the word, <hi>and nourishes a mans soul, though represented in its own naturall simplicity, and there is hardly any Orator, but you may finde occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to praise something of him. When Plato misliked the order and disposition of the Oration of Lysias, yet he praised the good words, and the elocution of the man. Euripides was commended for his fulness, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides for his composition. Phocilides for his easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Archilochus for his argument, Sophocles for the unequalnesse of his stile: So may men praise their Preacher, he speaks pertinently, or he contrives wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, or he speaks comely, or the man is pious, or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or he hath a good text, or he speaks plainly, or he is not tedious or if he be he is at least industrious, or he is the messenger of God and that will not fail us, and let us love him for that; and we know those that love can easily commend any thing, because they like every thing: and they say, fair men are like angels, and the black are manly, and the pale look like honey and the</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50231:178"/>
                     <hi>stars, and the crook-nosed are like the sons of Kings, and if they be flat they are gentle and easie, and if they be deformed they are humble, and not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed because they have upon them the impresses of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and they are the sons of God. He that despises his Preacher, is a hearer of arts and learning, not of the word of God, and though when the word of God is set off with advantages and entertainments of the better faculties of our humanity, it is more usefull and of more effect, yet when the word of God is spoken tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though but read in plain language, it will become the disciple of Jesus to love that man whom God sends, and the publik order, and the laws have imployed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to despise the weaknesse of him who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a</hi> mighty word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus it is fit that men should be affected and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they hear and read sermons, comming hither</hi> not as into a theatre, <hi>where men observe the gestures and noises of the people, the brow and eyes of the most busie censurers, and make parties, and go aside with them that dislike every thing, or else admire not the things, but the persons:</hi> But as to a sacrifice, <hi>and as</hi> unto a school, <hi>where vertue is taught and exercised, and none come but such as put themselves under disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and intend to grow wiser, and more vertuous, to appease their passion, from violent to become smooth and even, to have their faith established, and their hope confirmed, &amp; their charity enlarged. They that are otherwise affected do not do their duty, but if they be so minded as they ought, I and all men of my</hi>

                     <hi>My Lord, It was your charity and noblenesse that gave me opportunity to do this service (little or great) unto reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and whoever shall find any advantage to their soul, by reading the following discourse, if they know how to blesse God, and to blesse all them that are Gods instruments in doing them benefit, will (I hope) help to procure blessings to your Person and Family, and say a holy prayer, and name your Lordship in their Letanies, and remember, that at your own charges you have digged a well, and placed cisterns in the high wayes, that they may drink and be refreshed, and their souls may blesse you. My Lord, I hope this, even because I very much desire it, and because you exceedingly deserve it, and above all, because</hi> God is good and gracious, <hi>and loves to reward such a charity, and such a religion as is yours, by which you have imployed me in the service of God, and in ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to your Family.

But the Gospel is called the Spirit, 1. Because it contains in it such glorious mysteries which were revealed by the immediate inspirations of the Spirit, not onely in the matter it self, but also in the manner and powers to apprehend them. For what power of humane understanding could have found out, the incarnation of a God; that two natures [a finite, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite] could have been concentred into one hypostasis (or person): that a virgin should be a Mother, that dead men should live again, that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>He that shall discourse Euclids elements to a swine, or preach (as Venerable Bede's story reports of him) to a rock, or talk Metaphysicks to a Bore, will as much prevail upon his assembly as S.

An Ox will relish the tender flesh of Kids with as much gust and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> appetite, as an unspirituall, and unsanctified man, will do the discourses of Angels, or of an Apostle, if he should come to preach the secrets of the Gospel. And we finde it true by a sad experience. How many times doth God speak to us by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets, by his Son, by his Apostles, by sermons by spirituall books, by thousands of homilies, and arts of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and insinuation; and we sit as unconcerned as the pillars of a Church, and hear the sermons as the Athenians did a story, or as we read a gazet: and if ever it come to passe that we tremble as Felix did, when we hear a sad story of death, of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi>

                     <hi>and judgement to come,</hi> then we put it off to another time, or we forget it, and think we had nothing to do but to give the good man a hearing, and (as Anacharsis said of the Greeks, they used money for nothing but to cast account withall; so) our hearers make use of sermons and discourses Evangelical, but to fill up void spaces of our time; to help to tell an hour with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tediousnesse: The reason of this is a sad condemnation to such persons; they have not yet entertained the Spirit of God, they are in darknesse: they were washed in water, but never baptized with the Spirit; <hi>for these things are spiritually discerned.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> They would think the Preacher rude, if he should say they are not Christians, they are not within the Covenant of the Gospel: but it is certain that <hi>the spirit of Manifestation</hi> is not yet upon them; and that is the first effect of the Spirit, whereby we can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sons of God, or relatives of Christ. If we do not apprehend, and greedily suck in the precepts of this holy Discipline as aptly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50231:182"/>
as Merchants do discourse of gain, or Farmers of fair har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we have nothing but the Name of Christians; but we are no more such really, then Mandrakes are men, or spunges are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Gospel is called <hi>Spirit,</hi> because it consists of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Promises, and Spiritual precepts, and makes all men that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, truly to be Spiritual men: and therefore S. Paul addes an Epithete beyond this, calling it <hi>a quiohening Spirit</hi> that is, it puts <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> life into our Spirits, which the law could not. The law bound us to punishment, but did not help us to obedience, because it gave not the promise of Eternal life to its Disciples. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>the</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>Gospel</hi> onely does this: and this alone is it which comforts affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted mindes, which puts activenesse into wearyed Spirits, which inflames our cold desires, and does <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> blows up sparks into live coles, and coles up to flames, and flames to perpetual burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and it is impossible that any man who believes, and considers the great, the infinite, the unspeakable, the unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, the never ceasing joyes, that are prepared for all the sons and daughters of the Gospel should not desire them; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he be a fool, he cannot but use means to obtain them, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, hearty pursuances. For it is not directly in the nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of a man to neglect so great a good; there must be something in his manners, some obliquity in his will, or madnesse in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals, or incapacity in his naturals that must make him sleep such a reward away, or change it for the pleasure of a drunken feaver, or the vanity of a Mistresse, or the rage of a passion, or the unreasonablenesse of any sin. However; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is the life of all our actions, and the Spirit that first taught it is the life of our soules.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But beyond this, is the reason which is the consummation of all the faithful. The <hi>Gospel</hi> is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> because by, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and in the Gospel, God hath given to us not onely <hi>the Spirit of manifestation,</hi> that is, of instruction and of Catechisme, of faith and confident assent; but <hi>the Spirit of Confirmation</hi> or <hi>obsignation</hi> to all them that believe and obey the Gospel of Christ; that is, the power of God is come upon our hearts, by which in an admirable manner we are made sure of a glorious inheritance; made sure (I say) in the nature of the thing; and our own persuasions also are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an excellent, a comfortable, a discerning and a reasonable hope: in the strength of which, and by whose ayde, as we do not doubt of the performance of the promise: so we vigorously pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all the parts of the condition, and are mabled to work all the work of God, so as not to be affrighted with fear, or seduced by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or oppressed by lust, or drawn off by evil example, or abused by riches, or imprison'd by ambition and secular designes: This the Spirit of God does work in all his Servants; and is called
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50231:182"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>the spirit of obsignation,</hi> or <hi>the confirming spirit,</hi> because it confirms our hope, and assures our title to life eternall; and by means of it, and other it's collateral assistances, it also confirms us in our duty, that we may not onely professe in word, but live lives according to the Gospel. And this is the sense of [the Spirit] mentiond in the Text: <hi>ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you:</hi> That is, if ye be made partakers of the Gospel, or of the <hi>spirit of manifestation,</hi> if ye be truly intitled to God, and have received the promise of the Father, then are ye not carnall men; ye are <hi>spirituall,</hi> ye are <hi>in the Spirit:</hi> if ye have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Spirit in one sense to any purpose, ye have it also in another: if the Spirit be in you, you are in it: if it hath given you hope, it hath also inabled and ascertain'd your duty. For <hi>the Spirit of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation</hi> will but upbraid you in the shame and horrours of a sad eternity, if you have not <hi>the Spirit of obsignation:</hi> if the Holy Ghost be not come upon you to great purposes of holinesse, all other pretences are vain, <hi>ye are still in the flesh,</hi> which shall never <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of God.</hi>

And as no man will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that his temples are restrain'd, and his head is prisoner when it is encircled with a crown: So when the Son of God had made us free, and hath onely subjected us to the service and dominion of the Spirit, we are free as Princes within the circles of their Diadem, and our chains are bracelets, and the law is a law of liberty, and <hi>his service is perfect freedom;</hi> and the more we are subjects, the more <hi>we shall reign as Kings;</hi> and the faster we run, the easier is our burden, and Christs yoke is like feathers to a bird, not loads, but helps to motion, without them the body fals: and we do not pity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> birds when in summer we wish them unfeathered and callow, or bald as egges, that they might be cooler and lighter: such is the load and captivity of the soul when we do the work of God and are his servants, and under the Government of the spirit: They that strive to be quit of this subjection, love the liberty of out-laws, and the licentiousness of anarchy, and the freedom of sad widows and distressed Orphans: For so Rebels and fools and children long to be rid of their Princes, and their Guardians, and their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that they may be accursed without law, and be undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out control, and be ignorant and miserable without a teacher and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> without discipline.

                  <p>Upon this foundation, the Apostle hath built these two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. 1.

                  <p n="1">1. All that belong to Christ have the Spirit of Christ.

In the Law God gave his Spirit, 1. to some; to them 2. extraregularly, 3. without solennity, 4. in small proportions, like the dew upon Gideons

But in the Gospel, the spirit is given without measure; first powred forth upon our head Christ Jesus; then descending upon the beard of Aaron, the Fathers of the Church, and thence falling like the tears of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> balsam of Judea upon the foot of the plant, upon the lowest of the people. And this is given regularly to all that ask it, to all that can receive it, and by a solemn ceremony, and conveyed by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: and is now, not the Daughter of a voice, but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many voices, of divided tongues, and united hearts, of the tongues of Prophets, and the duty of Saints, of the Sermons of Apostles, and the wisdom of Governours; It is the Parent of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fortitude to Martyrs, the fountain of learning to Doctors, an Ocean of all things excellent to all who are within the ship, and bounds of the Catholike Church: so that Old men and young <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men, maidens and boyes, the scribe and the unlearned, the Judge and the Advocate, the Priest and the people are full of the Spirit, if they belong to God; Moses's wish is fulfilled, and all the Lords people are Prophets in some sense or other.</p>

For when Gods Spirit hath entred into us and possessed us as his Temple, or as his dwelling, instantly we begin to taste Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and to loath the diet of Egypt; we begin to consider concerning heaven, and to prefer eternity before moments, and to love the pleasures of the soul, above the sottish and beastly pleasures of the body. Then we can consider that the pleasures of a drunken meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot make recompence for the pains of a surfet, and that nights intemperance; much lesse for the torments of eternity: Then we are quick to discern that the itch and scab of lustful appetites is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not worth the charges of a Surgeon, much lesse can it pay for the disgrace, the danger, the sicknesse, the death, and the hell of lustfull persons; Then we wonder that any man should venture his head to get a crown unjustly; or that for the hazard of a victory, he should throw away all his hopes of heaven certainly.</p>
                  <p>A man that hath tasted of Gods Spirit can instantly discern the madnesse that is in rage, the folly and the disease that is in envy, the anguish and tediousnesse that is in lust, the dishonor that is in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our faith, and telling a lie; and understands things truly as they are; that is, that charity is the greatest noblenesse in the world; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that religion hath in it the greatest pleasures; that temperance is the best security of health; that humility is the surest way to honour; and all these relishes are nothing but antepasts of heaven, where the quintessence of all these pleasures shall be swallowed for ever; where the chast shall follow the Lamb, and the virgins sing there where the Mother of God shall reign; and the zealous converters of souls, and labourers in Gods vineyard shall worship eternally where S.

I have read of a spiritual person who saw heaven but in a dream, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but such as made great impression upon him, and was represented with vigorous and pertinacious phantasines, not easily disbanding, and when he awaked he knew not his cell, he remembred not him that slept in the same dorter, nor could tell how night and day were distinguished, nor could discern oyl from wine, but cal d out for his vision again, <hi>Redde mihi campos meos floridos, columnam auream, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitem Hieronymum, assistentes Angelos;</hi> Give me my fields again, my most delicious fields, my pillar of a glorious light, my companion S.

                  <p>And if it were given to any of us to see Paradise, or the third heaven (as it was to S.

THe Spirit of God is given us, as an antidote against evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> concupiscences, and sinfull desires, and is then called the spirit of prayer and supplication. For ever since the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the outward man prevaild upon the ruins of the soul, all our desires were sensuall, and therefore hurtfull: for ever after, our body grew to be our enemy. In the loosnesses of nature, and amongst the ignorance, or imperfection of Gentile Philosophy, men used to pray with their hands full of rapine, and their mouths of blood, and their hearts of malice; and they prayed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for an opportunity to steal, for a fair body, for a prosperous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> revenge, for a prevailing malice, for the satisfaction of whatsoever they could be tempted to by any object, by any lust, by any Devil whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>The Jews were better taught for God was their teacher, and he gave the spirit to them in single rayes. But as the <hi>spirit of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50231:186"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was given to them under a <hi>seal,</hi> and within a <hi>veile;</hi> so the <hi>spirit of Manifestation</hi> or <hi>patefaction</hi> was like the gem of a vine, or the bud of a rose, plain <hi>indices</hi> and significations of life, and principles of juice and sweetnesse: but yet scarce out of the doors of their causes; they had the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of knowledge; and revelations to them were given as Catechisme is taught to our children; which they read with the eye of a bird, and speak with the tongue of a bee, and understand with the heart of a childe, that is, weakly and imperfectly: and they understood so little; that 1. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thought God heard them not unlesse they spake their prayers, at least efforming their words within their lips: and 2. Their forms of prayer were so few and seldome, that to teach a forme of prayer, or to compose a collect was thought a worke fit for a Prophet, or the founder of an institution. 3. Adde to this that as their promises were temporal, so were their hopes: as were their hopes so were their desires; and according to their desires so were their prayers. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> was their Creat office, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> treasury of devotion to their Nation (and very worthily) yet it was full of wishes for temporals, invocations of GOD the <hi>Avenger,</hi> on GOD <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> on God the Enemy of their Enemies; and they desired their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be prospered, and themselves blessed, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all the world, by the effects of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. This was the state of prayer in their Synagogue; save onely that it had also this allay. 4. That their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to GOD were crasse, material, typical and full of shadows, and imagery, paterns of things to come, and so in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> its very being and constitution was relative and imperfect. But that we may see how <hi>great things the Lord hath done for us,</hi> God hath <hi>powred his spirit into our hearts,</hi> the <hi>spirit of prayer and supplication,</hi> and now. 1. Christians <hi>pray in their spirit,</hi> with sighs and groans, and know that GOD who dwells within them, can as clearly distinguish those secret accents, and read their meaning in the Spirit as plainly as he knows the voice of his own thunder, or could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the letter of the law written in the tables of stone by the finger of God. 2. <hi>likewise the spirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>for we know not what we should pray for as we ought.</hi> That is, when God sends an affliction or persecution upon us, we are indeed extreme apt to lay our hand upon the wound and never take it off but when we lift it up in prayer to be delivered from that sadnesse; and then we pray fervently to be cured of a sicknesse, to be delivered from a Tyrant, to be snatched from the grave, not to perish in the danger. But the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50231:187"/>
spirit of God hath from all sad accidents drawn the veil of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and the cloud of intolerablenesse, and hath taught us that our happinesse cannot consist in freedom, or deliverances from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, but in patience, resignation, and noble sufferance; and that we are not then so blessed when God hath turn'd our scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into ease and delicacy, as when we convert our very scorpions into the exercise of vertues: so that now <hi>the spirit having helped our infirmities,</hi> that is, comforted our weaknesses and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our sorrows and impatience by this proposition, that <hi>[All things work together for the good of them that fear God]</hi> he hath taught us to pray for grace, for patience under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the crosse, for Charity to our persecutors, for rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in tribulations, for perseverance and boldnesse in the faith; and for whatsoever will bring us safely to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas onely a <hi>Moses,</hi> or a <hi>Samuel,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> or a <hi>Daniel,</hi> a <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, or the Messias himself could describe and indite formes of prayer and thanksgiving to the time and accent of Heaven, now every wise and good Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed perfectly in the Scriptures (which are the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the spirit) what things he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may, and what things he must ask for.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God hath made our services to be spiritual, intellectual, holy, and effects of choice and religion, the consequents of a spiritual sacrifice, and of a holy union with God: The prayer of a Christian is with the effects of the <hi>spirit of Sanctification;</hi> and then we <hi>pray with the Spirit</hi> when we pray with Holinesse, which is the great fruit, the principal gift of the spirit, And this is by Saint <hi>James</hi> called [the prayer of faith] and is said to be certain that it shall prevail. Such a praying with the spirit, when our prayers are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the voices of our spirits, and our spirits are first taught, then sanctified by Gods spirit, shall never fail of its effect; because then it is, that <hi>the spirit himself maketh intercession for us:</hi> that is, hath enabled us to do it upon his strengths, we speak his sense, we live his life, we breath his accents, we desire in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his purposes, and our persons are Gracious by his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and are accepted by his interpellation and intercession in the act and offices of Christ. This is <hi>praying with the spirit.</hi> To which by way of explication I adde these two annexes of holy prayer, in respect of which also, every good man prayes with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the spirit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The spirit gives us great relish and appetite to our prayers, and this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls [serving of God in his spirit <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is, with a willing minde; not as <hi>Jonas</hi> did <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> his errand, but as Christ did die for us, he was straimed till
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50231:187"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he had accomplished it. And they that say their prayers out of custome onely, or to comply with external circumstances, or collateral advantages, or pray with trouble and unwillingnesse, give a very great testimony that they have not the spirit of Christ within them, that <hi>spirit</hi> which <hi>maketh intercession for the Saints:</hi> but he that delighteth in his prayers, not by a sensible or phantastic pleasure, but whose choice dwells in his prayers, and whose conversation is with God in holy living, and praying accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that man hath the spirit of Christ, and therfore belongs to Christ; for by this spirit it is that Christ prayes in Heaven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for us: and if we do not pray on earth in the same manner according to our measures; we had as good hold our peace, our prayers are an abominable sacrifice, and send up to God no better a perfume, then if wee burned <hi>assa faetida,</hi> or the raw flesh of a murdered man upon the altar of incense.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The spirit of Christ and of prayer helps our infirmities, by giving us confidence and importunity. I put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as our faith is, and our trust in God, so is our hope, and so is our prayer, weary or lasting, long or short, not in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> words, but in works, and in desires For the words of prayer are no part of the spirit of prayer: words may be the body of it, but the spirit of prayer alwayes consists in holinesse, that is in holy desires, and holy actions: words are not properly capable of being holy; all words are in themselves servants of things, and the holinesse of a prayer is not at all concerned in the manner of its expression, but in the spirit of it, that is, in the violence of its desires, and the innocence of its ends, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its imployment: this is the verification of that great Prophecie which Christ made; that <hi>[in all the world the true</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>worshippers should worship in spirit and in truth]</hi> that is, with a pure minde, with holy desires, for spiritual things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the minde of the spirit in imitation of Christs intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with perseverance, with charity, or love. That is the spirit of God, and these are the spiritualities of the Gospel, and the formalities of prayer as they are Christian and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Some men have thought of a seventh way, and explicate our praying in the spirit, by a mere volubilty of language: which indeed is a direct undervaluing the spirit of God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Christ, <hi>the spirit of manifestation</hi> and <hi>intercession;</hi> it is to return to the materiality and imperfection of the law, it is to worship God in outward forms, and to think that Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice consists in shels and rinds, in lips and voices, in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and images of things: it is to retire from Christ to <hi>Moses,</hi> and at the best, it is a going from real graces to imaginary gifts: and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50231:188"/>
when praying with the spirit hath in it so many excellencies, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> consists of so many parts of holinesse, and sanctification, and is an act of the inner man, we shall be infinitely mistaken, if we let go this substance, and catch at a shadow, and sit down and rest in the imagination of an improbable, unnecessary, uselesse <hi>gift of speaking</hi> to which the nature of many men, and the art of all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and the very use and confidence of ignorant men is too abundantly sufficient. Let us not so despise the spirit of Christ as to make it no other then the breath of our lungs. * For though it might be possible that at the first, and when formes of prayer were few and seldome, the spirit of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> might dictatethe very words to the Apostles, and first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yet it follows not that therfore he does so still to all that pretend praying with the spirit. For if he did not then, at the first, dictate words (as we know not whether he did or no) why shall he be suppos'd to do so now? If he did then; it follows that he does not now,; because his doing it then, was sufficient for all men since: for so the formes taught by the spirit were paternes for others to imitate in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seending ages of the Church. There was once an occasion so great that the spirit of God did think it a work fit for him to teach a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man to weave silke, or embroider gold, or woke in brasse, (as it happened to <hi>Besaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab:)</hi> But then every weaver or worker in brasse may by the same reason pretend that he works by the spirit, as that he prayes by the spirit, if by <hi>prayer</hi> he means forming the words. For although in the case of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was certain that the spirit did teach: in the case of indit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or forming the words it is not certain whether he did or no; yet because in both it was extraordinary (if it was at all) and ever since, in both it is infinitely needlesse; to pretend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in forms of every mans making (even though they be of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> contrary religions, and pray one against the other) it may serve an end of a phantastic and hypochondriacal religion, or a secret ambition, but not the ends of God, or the honour of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Jews in their declensions to folly and idolatry did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the stone of imagination, that is, certain smooth ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in which by art magic pictures and little faces were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, declaring hidden things and stoln goods; and God <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 1.</note> severely forbad this basenesse: but we also have taken up this folly, and worship the stone of imagination: we beget imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> phantasmes and speculative images in our phansy, and we fall down and worship them; never considering that the spirit of God never appears through such spectres. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is one of the noblest exercises of Christian religion; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it that duty in which all graces are concentred. Prayer is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50231:188"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> charity, it is faith, it is a conformity to Gods will, a desiring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the desires of Heaven, an imitation of Christs interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and prayer must suppose all holinesse, or else it is nothing: and therefore all that in which men need Gods Spirit, all that is in order to prayer. Baptisme is but a prayer, and the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supperl is but a prayer; a prayer of sacrifice repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative, and a prayer of oblation, and a prayer of intercession, and a prayer of thanksgiving: and obedience is a prayer, and begs and procures blessings: and if the Holy Ghost hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the whole man, then he hath sanctified the prayer of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man, and not till then; and if ever there was, or could be any other praying with the spirit, it was such a one as a wicked man might have, and therefore it cannot be a note of distinction between the good and bad, between the saints and men of the world. But this onely (which I have described from the fountains of Scripture) is that which a good man can have, and therefore this is it in which we ought to rejoyce; <hi>that he that glories, may glory in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have (as I could) described the effluxes of the Holy Spirit upon us in his great chanels. But the great effect of them is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this; That as by the arts of the spirits of darknesse, and our own malice our souls are turned into flesh, (not in the naturall sense, but in the morall, and Theologicall) and <hi>animalis homo</hi> is the same with <hi>carnalis,</hi> that is, his soul is a servant of the passions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the flesh, and is <hi>flesh</hi> in it s operations and ends, in it s principles and actions: So on the other side, by the Grace of God, and the promise of the Father, and the influences of the Holy Ghost, our souls are not onely recovered from the state of flesh, and reduced back to the intirenesse of animall operations, but they are heightned into <hi>spirit,</hi> and transform d into <hi>a new nature:</hi> And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this is a new Article, and now to be considered.</p>
                  <p>S. Hierom tels of the Custome of the Empire; When a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was overcome, they us d to break the head of his Statues, and upon the same Trunk, to set the head of the Conquerour, and so it passed wholly for the new Prince: So it is in the kingdom of Grace: As soon as the Tyrant sin is overcome, and a new heart is put into us, or that we serve under a new head, instantly we have a new Name given us, and we are esteemed a new Creation; and not onely changed in manners, but we have a new nature within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us, even a third part of an essentiall constitution. This may seem strange; and indeed it is so: and it is one of the great mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesses of the Gospel. Every man naturally consists of soul and body: but every Christian man that belongs to Christ, hath more. For he hath <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>spirit.</hi> My Text is plain for it. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his:</hi> and by <hi>[Spirit]</hi> is not meant onely the graces of God, and his gifts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50231:189"/>
us to do holy things: there is more belongs to a good man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then so. But as when God made man, he made him after his own image, and breath'd into him <hi>the spirit of life,</hi> and he was made <hi>in animam viventem, into a living soul;</hi> then he was made a man: So in the new creation, Christ <hi>by whom God made both the worlds,</hi> intends to conform us to his image, and he hath given us <hi>the spirit of adoption,</hi> by which we are made sons of God; and by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a new life we are made <hi>new creatures,</hi> capable of a new state, intitled to another manner of duration, enabled to do new and greater actions in order to higher ends; we have new affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, new understandings, new wils: <hi>Veter a transierunt, &amp; ecce om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>

This great Mystery I should not utter but upon the greatest authority in the world, and from an infallible Doctor, I mean S.

                  <p>The spirit (as I now discourse of it) is a principle infused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by God, when we become his children, whereby we live the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life of Grace, and understand the secrets of the Kingdom, and have passions and desires of things beyond, and contrary to our naturall appetites, enabling us not onely to sobriety (which is the duty of the body) not onely to justice, which is the rectitude of the soul; but to such a sanctity as makes us like to God. * For so saith the Spirit of God; <hi>Be ye holy as I am; be pure, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is pure, as he is perfect:</hi> which because it cannot be a perfection of degrees, it must be <hi>in similitudine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> in the likenesse of that nature which God hath given us in the new birth, that by it, we might resemble his excellency, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> holinesse.

The spirit of fornication is an unclean devil, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely contrary to the Spirit of God; and so is the spirit of malice or uncharitablenesse; for the Spirit of God is the Spirit of love: for as by purities Gods Spirit sanctifies the body, so by love he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the soul, and makes the soul grow into a spirit, into a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature. But God knows, that even in Christian societies, we see the devils walk up and down every day, and every hour; the devil of uncleannesse, and the devil of drunkennesse, the devil of malice, and the devil of rage, the spirit of filthy speaking, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the spirit of detraction, a proud spirit, and the spirit of rebellion; and yet all call <hi>[Christian.</hi> It is generally supposed, that unclean spirits walk in the night; and so it used to be; <hi>for they that are drunk, are drunk in the night,</hi> said the Apostle: but Suidas tels of certain <hi>Empusae,</hi> that used to appear at Noon, at such time as the Greeks did celebrate the Funerals of the Dead; and at this day some of the Russians fear the <hi>Noon-day Devil,</hi> which appeareth like a mourning widow to reapers of hay and corn, and uses to break their arms and legs, unlesse they worship her.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of God, and all lawes, and all modesty. There is in such men the spirit of impudence, as well as of impiety. And yet I might have expressed it higher; for every habituall sin doth not onely put us into the power of the devil, but turns us into his very nature: just as the Holy Ghost transforms us into the image of God.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore I have a greater Argument to perswade you to holy living, then Moses had to the sons of Israel. <hi>Behold, I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:</hi> so said Moses; but I adde, that I have upon the stock of this Scripture, set before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you, the good Spirit and the bad, God, and the devil: choose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose nature you will be likened, and into whose inheritance you will be adopted, and into whose possession you will enter. If you commit sin, ye are of your father the Devil, ye are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of his principles, and follow his pattern, and shall passe into his portion, when ye are led captive by him at his will; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what a sad thing it is to go into the portion of evil and accursed spirits, the sad and eternall portion of Devils. But he that hath the Spirit of God, doth acknowledge God for his Father, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and his Lord, he despises the world, and hath no violent appetites for secular pleasures, and is dead to the desires of this life, and his hopes are spirituall, and God is his joy, and Christ is his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and his support, and Religion is his imployment, and <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is his gain,</hi> and this man understands the things of God, and is ready to die for Christ, and fears nothing but to sin against God, and his will is filled with love, and it springs out in obedience to God, and in charity to his brother: and of such a man we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make judgement by his fortune, or by his acquaintance, by his circumstances, or by his adherencies, for they are the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of a naturall man: but <hi>the spirituall is judged of no man:</hi> that is, the rare excellencies that make him happy, do not yet make him illustrious, unlesse we will reckon Vertue to be a great fortune, and holinesse to be great Wisedom, and God to be the best Friend, and Christ the best Relative, and the Spirit the hugest advantage, and Heaven the greatest Reward. He that knows how to value these things, may sit down and reckon the felicities of him that hath the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this Discourse is this; That since the Spirit of God is a new nature, and a new life put into us, we are thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> taught, and enabled to serve God by a constant course of holy living, without the frequent returns and intervening of such actions, which men are pleased to call <hi>sins of infirmity.</hi> Whosoever hath the Spirit of God, lives the life of grace; The Spirit of God rules in him, and is strong according to its age and abode, and allows not of those often sins which we think unavoidable, because we call them, <hi>naturall infirmities.</hi>

Paul largely describes him in the seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Romanes) but he that hath the Spirit is made alive, and free, and strong, and a conquerour over all the powers, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of sin; such a man resists temptations, falls not under the assault of sin, returns not to the sin which he last repented of, acts no more that errour which brought him to shame and sorrow: but he that falls under a crime, to which he still hath a strong, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous inclination, he that acts his sin, and then curses it, and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is tempted, and then sins again, and then weeps again, and calls himself miserable, but still the inchantment hath confined him to that circle, this man hath not the Spirit; <hi>for where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty,</hi> there is no such bondage and a returning folly to the commands of sin. But because men deceive themselves with calling this bondage, <hi>a pitiable and excusable infirmity,</hi> it will not be uselesse to consider the state of this question more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lest men from the state of a <hi>pretended infirmity,</hi> fall into a <hi>reall death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. No great sin is <hi>a sin of infirmity,</hi> or excusable upon that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stock. But that I may be understood, we must know that every sin is in some sense or other, <hi>a sin of infirmity.</hi> When a man is in the state of spirituall sicknesse or death, he is in a state of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, for he is a wounded man, a prisoner, a slave, a sick man, weak in his judgement, and weak in his reasoning, impotent in his passions, of childish resolutions, great inconstancy, and his purposes untwist, as easily as the rude conjuncture of uncombining cables, in the violence of a Northern tempest: and he that is thus in infirmity, cannot be excused; for it is the aggravation of the state of his sin; he is so infirm that he is in a state unable to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his duty. Such a man is <hi>a servant of sin,</hi> a slave of the Devil, an heir of corruption, absolutely under command; and every man is so, who resolves for ever to avoid such a sin, and yet for ever falls under it: for what can he be but a servant of sin, who fain would avoid it but cannot; that is, he hath not the Spirit of God within him; Christ dwels not in his soul, <hi>for where the Son is, there is liberty:</hi> and all that are in the Spirit are sons of God, and servants of righteousnesse, and therefore freed from sin. But then there are also <hi>sins of infirmity,</hi> which are single actions, intervening seldom, in litle instances, unavoidable, or through a faultlesse ignorance. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Such as these are alwayes the allays of the life of the best men; and for these Christ hath payd, and they are never to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to good men, save onely to make them more wary, and more humble. Now concerning these, it is, that I say; No great sin is a sin of excusable, or unavoidable infirmity. Because whosoever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50231:191"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath received the Spirit of God, hath sufficient knowledge of his duty, and sufficient strengths of grace, and sufficient advertency of minde, to avoid such things as do great and apparent violence to piety, and religion. No man can justly say, that it is a sin of infirmity that he was drunk; For there are but three causes of every sin (a fourth is not imaginable.) 1. If ignorance cause it, <note place="margin">1.</note> the sin is as full of excuse, as the ignorance was innocent. But no Christian can pretend this to drunkennesse, to murder, to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, to uncleannesse. For what Christian is so uninstructed but that he knows Adultery is a sin? 2. Want of observation, is the <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cause of many indiscreet and foolish actions. Now at this gap ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny irregularities do enter and escape, because in the whole, it is impossible for a man to be of so present a spirit, as to consider, and reflect upon every word, and every thought: but it is in this case in Gods laws otherwise then in mans: the great flies cannot passe thorow without observation, little ones do; and a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drunk, and never take notice of it; or tempt his neighbours wife before he be aware; therefore the lesse the instance be, the more likely it is to be a sin of infirmity: and yet if it be never so little, if it be observed, then it ceases to be a sin of infirmity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 3. But because great crimes cannot pretend to passe undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, <note place="margin">3.</note> it follows that they must come in at the door of <hi>malice,</hi> that is, of want of Grace, in the absence of the Spirit; they destroy where ever they come, and the man dies if they passe upon him.</p>
                  <p>It is true, there is <hi>flesh and blood</hi> in every regenerate man, but they do not both rule: the flesh is left to tempt, but not to prevail. And it were a strange condition, if both the godly and the ungodly were captives to sin, and infallibly should fall into temptation, and death, without all difference, saue onely; that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> godly sins <hi>unwillingly,</hi> and the ungodly sins <hi>willingly.</hi> But if the same things be done by both, and God in both be dishonoured, and their duty prevaricated, the pretended unwillingnesse is the signe of a greater, and a baser slavery, and of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lesse to be endured. For the servitude which is against me is intollerable, but if I choose the state of a servant, I am free in my minde,</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> certain it is, that such a person who fain would, but cannot choose but commit adultery, or drunkennesse, is the veriest slave to sin that can be imagined, and not at all freed by the Spirit, and by the liberty of the sons of God; <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>—Tot rebus iniquis Parüimus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti: veniaest haec sola pudoris, Degenerisque metus, nil jam potuisse negari.</hi> Lucan.</note> and there is no other difference, but that the mistaken good man feels his slavery, and sees his chains, and his fetters; but therefore it is certain that he is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sees himself to be a slave. No man can be a servant of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50231:192"/>
sin, and a servant of righteousnesse at the same time, but every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man that hath the Spirit of God, is a servant of righteousnesse; and therefore whosoever finde great sins to be unavoidable, are in a state of death and reprobation, (as to the present) because they willingly, or unwillingly (it matters not much, whether of the two) are servants of sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sins of infirmity as they are small in their instance, so <note place="margin">2.</note> they put on their degree of excusablenesse, onely according to the weaknesse, or infirmity of a mans understanding: So far as men (without their own fault) understand not their duty, or are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with weaknesse of principles, or are destitute and void of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> discourse, or discerning powers, and acts, so far if a sin creeps upon them, it is as naturall, and as free from a law, as is the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a childe; But if any thing else be mingled with it, if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any other principle, it is criminall and not excused by our infirmity; because it is chosen: and a mans will hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, but when it wants the grace of God, or is mastered with passions, and sinfull appetites: and that infirmity is the state of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The violence or strength of a temptation is not sufficient to <note place="margin">3.</note> excuse an action, or to make it accountable upon the stock of a pitiable and innocent infirmity; if it leaves the understanding still <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> able to judge; because a temptation cannot have any proper strengths but from our selves, and because we have in us a principle of basenesse which this temptation meets, and onely perswades me to act, because I love it. Joseph met with a temptation as violent and as strong as any man: and it is certain there are not many Christians but would fall under it, and call it, <hi>a sin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> since they have been taught so to abuse themselves, by sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fig-leaves before their nakednesse: but because Joseph had a strength of God within him, the strength of chastity, therefore it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> could not at all prevail upon him. Some men cannot by any art of hell be tempted to be drunk; others can no more resist an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to such a meeting, then they can refuse to die if a dagger were drunk with their heart blood; because their evil habits made them weak on that part: And some man that is fortified against revenge, it may be will certainly fall under a temptation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse: for every temptation is great or small, according as the man is; and a good word will certainly lead some men to an action of folly, while another will not think ten thousand pound a considerable argument to make him tell one single lie, against his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> duty, or his conscience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No habituall sin, (that is) no sin that returns constantly, <note place="margin">4.</note> or frequently, that is repented of, and committed again, and still repented of, and then again committed, no such sin is excusable with a pretence of infirmity: Because that sin is certainly noted,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50231:192"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and certainly condemned, and therefore returns, not because of the weaknesse of nature, but the weaknesse of grace: the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this, is an evil spirit, an habituall aversation from God, a dominion and empire of sin: and as no man for his inclination, and aptnesse to the sins of the flesh, is to be called carnall, if he corrects his inclinations, and turns them into vertues: so no man can be called spirituall for his good wishes, and apt inclinations to goodnesse, if these inclinations passe not into acts, and these acts into habits, and holy customs, and walkings, and conversation with God. But as natural concupiscence corrected becomes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of vertue: so these good inclinations, and condemnings of our sin, if they be ineffective and end in sinfull actions, are the perfect signes of a reprobate, and unregenerate estate.</p>
                  <p>The sum is this. An animal man, a man under the law, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man (for as to this, they are all one) is sold under sin, he is a servant of corruption, he falls frequently into the same sin to which he is tempted, he commends the Law, he consents to it that it is good, he does not commend sin, he does some little things against it, but they are weak and imperfect, his lust is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stronger, his passions violent, and unmortified, his habits vitious, his customs sinfull, and he lives in the regions of sin, and dies and enters into its portion; But a spirituall man, a man that is in the state of grace, who is born anew of the Spirit, that is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by the Spirit of Christ, <hi>he is led by the Spirit,</hi> he <hi>lives</hi> in the Spirit, he does the works of God cheerfully, habitually, vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and although he sometimes slips, yet it is but seldom, it is in small instances: his life is such as he cannot pretend to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works, and merit, but by mercy, and the faith of Jesus Christ; yet he never sins great sins: If he does, he is for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>falne from Gods favour;</hi> and though possibly he may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (and the smaller, or seldomer the sin is, the sooner may be his restitution) yet for the present (I say) he is out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But he that remains in the grace of God, sins not by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, consultive, knowing act; he is incident to such a surprize as may consist with the weaknesse, and judgement of a good man: but whatsoever is, or must be considered, if it cannot passe without consideration, it cannot passe without sin; and therefore cannot enter upon him, while he remains in that state. For <hi>he that is in Christ, in him the body is dead by reason of sin;</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Gospel did not differ from the Law, but that the Gospel gives grace and strength to do whatsoever it commands, which the Law did not; and the greatnesse of <hi>the promise of eternall life</hi> is such an argument to them that consider it, that it must needs be of force sufficient, to perswade a man to use all his faculties, and all his strength, that he may obtain it: God exacted all upon this stock; God knew this could do every thing: <hi>Nihil non in hoc prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit</hi>

For since God hath given us reason to choose, and a promise to exchange, for our temperance, and faith, and charity, and justice, for these (I say) happinesse, exceeding great happinesse; that we shall be Kings, that we shall reigne with God, with Christ, with all the holy Angels for ever, in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities so great, that we have not now capacities to understand it, our heart is not big enough to think it; there cannot in the world be a greater inducement to engage us, a greater argument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to oblige us to do our duty. God hath not in heaven a bigger ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; it is not possible any thing in the world should be bigger: which because the Spirit of God hath revealed to us, if by this strength of his we walk in his wayes, and be ingrafted into his stock, and bring forth his fruits, <hi>the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> then <hi>we are in Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ in us,</hi> then <hi>we walk in the spirit,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit dwels in us,</hi> and our portion shall be there, where <hi>Christ by the Spirit maketh intercession for us,</hi> that is, at the right hand of his Father for ever, and ever.</p>

Sometimes the Angels who are the observers of all our works carry up sad tidings to the Court of Heaven against us. Thus, two Angels were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers against Sodom; but yet these were the last; for before that time the cry of their iniquity had sounded loud and sadly in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and all this is the direct and proper effect of his jealousie; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which sets spies upon all the actions, and watches the circumstances, and tells the steps, and attends the businesses, the recreations, the publications, and retirements of every man, and will not suffer a thought to wander but he uses means to correct it's errour, and to reduce it to himself. For he that created us and daily feeds us, he that intreats us to be happy, with an opportunity so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate as if (not we, but) himself were to receive the favour; he that would part with his onely Son from his bosome, and the embraces of eternity, and give him over to a shameful and cursed death for us, cannot but be supposed to love us with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a great love, and to own us with an intire title, and therefore that he would fain secure us to himself with an undivided possession: and it cannot but be infinitely reasonable: for to whom else should any of us belong, but to God? Did the world create us? Or did lust ever do us any good: Did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ever suffer one stripe for our advantage? Does not he study all the wayes to ruine us? Doe the Sun or the stars pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us alive? Or do we get understanding from the Angels? Did ever any joynt of our body knit, or our heart ever keep one true minute of a pulse without God? Had not we been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nothing, or worse, that is, infinitely eternally miserable, but that God made us capable, and then pursued us with arts and devices of great mercy to force us to be happy? Great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore there is, that God should be jealous, lest we take any of our duty from him, who hath so strangely deserved it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50231:195"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all, and give it to a creature, or to our enemy, who cannot be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any. But however it will concern us with much caution to observe our own wayes, since <hi>we are made aspectacle to God, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and to Men:</hi> God hath set so many spies upon us, the blessed Angels and the accursed Devils, good men and bad men, the eye of Heaven, and eye of that eye, God himself, all watching lest we rob God of his Honour, and our selves of our hopes; For by his prime intention he hath chosen so to get his own glory, as may best consist with our felicity: His great designe is to be glorified in our being saved. 3. Gods jealousie hath a sadder effect then all this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For all this is for mercy; but if we provoke this jealousie if he findes us in our spiritual whoredoms, he is <hi>implacable,</hi> that is, he is angry with us to eternity unlesse we returne in time: and if we do it may be he will not be appeased in all instances: and when he forgives us he will make some reserves of his wrath; he will punish our persons, or our estate; he will chastise us at home, or abroad in our bodies, or in our children; for he will visit our sins upon our children from generation to generation: and if they be made miserable for our sins, they are unhappy in such parents; but we bear the curse and the anger of God, even while they bear his rod: <hi>God visits the</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>sins of the Fathers upon the children]</hi> That's the second Great stroke he strikes against sin, and is now to be considered.</p>
                  <p>That God doth so is certain; because he saith he doth; and that this is just in him so to do, is also as certain therefore because <note place="margin">2.</note> he doth it. For as his lawes are our measures, so his actions, and his own will are his own measures. He that hath right over all things, and all persons, cannot do wrong to any thing. He that is essentially just, (and there could be no such thing as justice, or justice it self could not be good, if it did not derive from him) it is impossible for him to be unjust. But since God is pleased to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> speak after the manner of men, it may well consist with our duty to enquire into those manners of consideration, whereby we may understand the equity of God in this proceeding, and to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted also in our own danger, if we persevere in sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No man is made <hi>a sinner</hi> by the fault of another man without his own consent. For to every one God gives his choice, and sets life and death before every of the sons of Adam: and therefore this death is not a consequent to any sin, but our own. In this sense it is true, that <hi>if the fathers eat sowre grapes, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>teeth shall not be set on edge:</hi> and therefore the sin of Adam which was derived to all the world; did not bring the world to any other death but temporall, by the intermediall stages of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and temporal infelicities: And it is not said that <hi>sin passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men,</hi> but <hi>death,</hi> &amp; that also no otherwise but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in as much as al men have sinned;</hi> as they have followed the steps of their father, so they are partakers of this death. And therefore it is very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50231:196"/>
remarkable; that death brought in by sin, was nothing <hi>superindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to man; man onely was <hi>reduced</hi> to his own naturall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from which before Adams fall he stood exempted by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall favour; and therefore although the taking away that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary grace, or priviledge was a punishment; yet the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the naturall death, was directly none; but a condition of his creation, naturall, and therefore not primarily evil; but if not good, yet at least indifferent. And the truth and purpose of this observation will extend it self, if we observe that before any man died, Christ was promised, by whom death was to lose its sting, by whom death did cease to be an evil, and was, or might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be, if we do belong to Christ, a state of advantage. So that we by occasion of Adams sin, being returned to our naturall certainty of dying, do still even in this very particular stand between the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and the cursing. If we follow Christ, death is our friend; If we imitate the praevarication of Adam, then death becomes an evil; the condition of our nature, becomes the punishment of <hi>our own sin;</hi> not of Adams: for although his sin brought death in, yet it is onely our sin that makes death to be evil: And I desire this to be observed, because it is of great use in vindicating the Divine justice in the matter of this question. The materiall part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the evil came from our father upon us, but the formality of it, the sting and the curse is onely by our selves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the fault of others many may become <hi>miserable,</hi> even all or any of those, whose relation is such to the sinner, that he in any sense may by such inflictions be punished, execrable, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Indeed it were strange, if when a plague were in Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, the Athenians should be infected: or if the house of Pericles were visited, and Thucydides should die for it. For although there are some evils which (as Plutarch saith) are <hi>ansis &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagationibus praedita incredibili celeritate in longinquum penetran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> such which can dart evil influences, as Porcupines do their quils; yet as at so great distances the knowledge of any confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate events must needs be uncertain: so it is also uselesse, because we neither can joyne their causes, nor their circumstances, nor their accidents into any neighbourhood of conjunction: Relations are seldome noted at such distances; and if they were, it is certain, so many accidents will intervene, that will out-weigh the efficacy of such relations; that by any so far distant events, we cannot be instructed in any duty, nor understand our selves reproved for any fault. But when the relation is neerer, and is joyned under such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> head, and common cause, that the influence is perceived, and the parts of it do usually communicate in benefit, notices, or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity (especially if they relate to each other, as superiour and inferiour) then it is certain, the sin is infectious (I mean) not onely in example, but also in punishment.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is so in kingdoms, in Churches, in families, in politicall, artificiall, and even in accidentall societies.</p>
                  <p>When David numbred the people, God was angry with him; but he punished the people for the crime; seventy thousand men died of the plague: and when God gave to David the choice of three plagues, he chose that of the pestilence, in which the meanest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the people and such which have the least society with the acts and crimes of Kings are most commonly devoured, whilest the powerfull and sinning persons by arts of physick, and flight, by provisions of nature, and accidents are more commonly secured. *But the story of the Kings of Israel hath furnished us with an example sitted with all the stranger circumstances in this question. Joshuah had sworn to the Gibeonites (who had craftily secured their lives, by exchanging it for their liberties:) Almost 500. yeers after, Saul in zeal to the men of Israel and Judah slew many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of them. After this Saul dies, and no question was made of it. But in the dayes of David there was a famine in the land three yeers together; and God being inquired of, said it was because of <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 14.</note> Saul his killing the Gibeonites. What had the people to do with their Kings fault? or at least, the people of David with the fault of Saul? That we shall see anon: But see the way that was appointed to expiate the crime, and the calamity. David took seven of Sauls sons and hanged them up against the Sun, and after that God was intreated for the land. The story observes one circumstance more: that for the kindnesse of Jonathan, David spared Mephibosheth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Now this story doth not onely instance in Kingdoms, but in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies too. The fathers fault is punished upon the sons of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and the Kings fault upon the people of his land, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the King, after the death of the father. Thus God visited the sin of Ahab, partly upon himself, partly upon his sons. <hi>I will not bring the evil in his dayes, but in his sons dayes will I bring the evil upon his house.</hi> Thus did God slay the childe <note place="margin">1 King. 21. 29.</note> of Bathsheba for the sin of his father David: and the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Because Ataalek fought with the sons of Israel at Rephidim God took up a quarrell against the nation for ever. And above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples is that of the Jews, who put to death the Lord of life, and made their nation to be an anathema for ever, untill the day
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50231:197"/>

                  <p>This last instance went further then the other of families and kingdoms. For not onely the single families of the Jews were made miserable for their Fathers murdering the Lord of life, nor also was the Nation extinguished alone for the sins of their Rulers, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the religion was removed; it ceased to be God peoples; the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue was rejected, and her vail rent, and her privacies dismant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Gentiles were made to be Gods people, when the Jews inclosure was disparkd. I need not further to instance this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the case of National Churches, though it is a sad calamity that is fallen upon the al seven Churches of Asia (to whom the spirit of God wrote seven Epistles by Saint <hi>John)</hi> and almost all the Churches of Africa, where Christ was worshipped, and now <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is thrust in substitution, and the people are servants, and the religion is extinguished, or where it remains, it shines like the Moon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in an Eclipse, or like the least spark of the pleiades, seen but seldom, And that rather shining like a gloworm, then a taper enkindled with a beam of the Sun of righteousnesse I shall adde no more instances to verifie the truth of this, save onely I shall observe to you, that even there is danger in being in evil company, in suspected places, in the civil societies and fellowships of wicked men.</p>

Many times the sin of one man is punished by the falling of a house or a wall upon him, and then al the family are like to be crushed with the same ruine; so dangerous, so pestilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, so infectious a thing is sin, that it scatters the poison of its breath to all the neighbourhood, and makes that the man ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> like a person infected with the plague.</p>
                  <p>Next I am to consider why this is so, and why it is justly so? To this I answer. 1. Between Kings and their people, Parents and their <note place="margin">2.</note> children there is so great a necessitude, propriety and entercourse of nature, dominion, right and possession, that they are by God
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50231:197"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and the laws of Nations reckoned as their Goods, and their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. <hi>The honour of a King is in the multitude of his people;</hi> and <hi>children are a gift that cometh of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>happy is that man that hath his quiver full of them:</hi> and <hi>Lo thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord; his wife shall be like the fruitful vine by the wals of his house, his children like olive branches round about his Table.</hi> Now if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be a blessing, then to take them away in anger is a curse: and if the losse of flocks and herds, the burning of houses, the blasting of fields be a curse; how much greater is it to lose our children, and to see God slay them before our eyes, in hatred to our persons, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> detestation and loathing of our basenesse. When <hi>Jobs</hi> Messengers told him the sad stories of fire from Heaven, the burning his sheep, and that the Sabeans had driven his Oxen away, and the Chaldeans had stolne his Camels; these were sad arrests to his troubled spirit: but it was reserved as the last blow of that sad execution that the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of a house had crush'd his Sons and Daughters to their graves. Sons &amp; daughters are greater blessings then sheep &amp; Oxen: they are not servants of profit as sheep are, but they secure greater ends of bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ssing; they preserve your Names; they are so many titles of provision &amp; providence; every new childe is a new title to Gods care of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> family: They serve the ends of honour, of commonwealths, and Kingdoms; they are images of our souls, and images of God, and therefore are great blessings; and by consequence, they are great riches, though they are not to be sold for mony: and surely he that hath a cabinet of invaluable jewels will think himself rich though he never sells them, <hi>Does <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. But as this is a <hi>punishment to us,</hi> so it is <hi>not unjust as to them,</hi> though they be innocent. For all the calamities of this life are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the most Godly persons of the world; and since the King of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Heaven and earth was made a man of sorrows, it cannot be called unjust or intolerable that innocent persons should be pressed with temporal infelicities: onely in such cases we must distinguish the misery from the punishment; for that all the world dyes is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of <hi>Adams</hi> sin: but it is no evil to those single persons that <hi>die in the Lord;</hi> for they are blessed in their death. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was killed the same day with his Father the King; and this was a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50231:198"/>
to <hi>Saul</hi> indeed; but to <hi>Jonathan</hi> it was a blessing: for since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God had appointed the kingdom to his neighbour, it was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for him to die fighting the Lords battel, then to live and see himself the lasting testimony of Gods curse upon his Father; who lost the Kingdom from his family by his disobedience. That death is a blessing which ends an Honorable, and prevents an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious life. And our children (it may be) shall be sanctified by a sorrow, and purified by the fire of affliction, and they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the blessing of it; but it is to their Fathers a curse, who shall wound their own hearts with sorrow, and cover their heads with a robe of shame, for bringing so great evil upon their house. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                  <p n="3">3. God hath many ends of providence to serve in this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his judgements. *1. He expresses the highest indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin; and makes his examples lasting, communicative, and of great effect; it is a little image of hell and we shall the lesse wonder that God with the pains of eternity punishes the sins of time, when with our eyes we see him punish a transient action with a lasting judgement. *2. It arrests the spirits of men, and surprises their loosenesses, and restrains their gaiety, when we observe that the judgements of God finde us out in all relations, and turns our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts into sadnesse, and makes our families the scene of sorrows, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and we can escape him no where; and by sin are made obnoxious not alone to personall judgements; but that we are made like the fountains of the dead sea, springs of the lake of Sodom; in stead of refreshing our families with blessings, we leave them brimstone and drought, and poison, and an evil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and the wrath of God, and a treasure of wrath; and their Fathers sins for their portion and inheritance. *Naturalists say that when the leading goats in the Greek Islands have taken an Eryngus or sea holly into their mouths, all the herd will stand still, till the herds man comes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it out, as apprehending the evil that will come to them all, if any of them especially their Principals, tast an unwholesome plant: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and indeed it is of a General concernment, that the Master of a family, or the Prince of a people, from whom as from a fountain many issues do derive upon their Relatives, should be springs of health and sanctity and blessing. It is a great right and propriety that a King hath in his people, or a Father in his children that even their sins can do these a mischiefe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a direct violence, but by the execution of Gods wrath: God hath made strange bands and vessels, or chanels of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between them, when even the anger of God shal be convei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by the conduits of such relations. That would be considered. It binds them neerer then our new doctrine will endure: but it also binds us to pray for them and for their Holinesse, and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as earnestly as we would be delivered from death, or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or poverty, or war, or the wrath of God in any instance.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 3. This also will satisfie the fearfulnesse of such persons who think the evil prosperous, and <hi>call the proud happy.</hi> No man can be called happy till he be dead; nor then neither, if he lived viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously: Look how God handles him in his children, in his family, in his grand-children; and as it tells that generation which sees the judgement, that God was all the while angry with him; so it supports the spirits of men in the intervall, and entertains them with the expectation of a certain hope; for if I do not live to see his sin punished, yet his posterity may finde themselves accursed, and feel their fathers sins in their own calamity; and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or belief of that, may relieve my oppression, and ease my sorrows, while I know that God will bear my injury in a lasting record, and when I have forgot it, will bring it forth to judgement. The Athenians were highly pleased when they saw honours done to the posterity of Cimon [a good man, and a rare citizen, but murdered for being wise and vertuous] and when at the same time they saw a decree of banishment passe against the children of Lacharis, and Aristo, they laid their hands upon their mouthes, and with silence did admire the justice of the Power above.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The sum of this is; That in sending evils upon the posterity of evil men, God serves many ends of providence, some of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, some of mercy, some of justice, and contradicts none: For the evil of the innocent son is the fathers punishment upon the stock of his sin, and his relation; but the sad accident happens to the son upon the score of nature, and many ends of providence, and mercy. To which I adde, that if any, even the greatest temporall evil may fall upon a man [as blindnesse did upon the blinde man in the Gospel] when <hi>neither he nor his parents have sinned;</hi> much more may it do so, when his parents have, though he have not. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there is a neerer, or more visible commensuration of justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parents sin, and the sons sicknesse, then between the evil of the son, and the innocence of father and son together. The dispensation therefore is righteous and severe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I am now to consider in what degree, and in what cases, this is usuall, or to be expected. It is in the Text instanced in the matter of worshipping images. God is so jealous of his honour, that he will not suffer an image of himself to be made, lest the image dishonour the substance; nor any image of a creature to be worshipped, though with a lesse honour, lest that lesse swell up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a greater: and he that is thus jealous of his honour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so instances it, is also very curious of it in all other particulars; and though to punish the sins of fathers upon the children, be more solemnly threatned in this sin onely, yet we finde it inflicted indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in any other great sin, as appears in the former precedents.</p>
                  <p>This one thing I desire to be strictly observed: That it is with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50231:199"/>
much errour, and great indiligence usually taught in this question, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that the wrath of God descends from fathers to children onely in case the children imitate, and write after their fathers copy; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these words [in them that hate me] to relate to the children. But this is expressely against the words of the Text, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the thing: God afflicts good children of evil parents, for their fathers sins; and the words are plain and determinate: God visits the sins of the fathers <hi>in tertiam &amp; quartam generationem eorum qui oderunt me;</hi> to the third generation <hi>of them, of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> that hate me: that is, upon the great-grand-children of such parents. So that if the great-grandfathers be haters of God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lovers of iniquity, it may intail a curse upon so many generations, though the children be haters of their fathers hatred, and lovers of God. *And this hath been observed even by wise men among the Heathens, whose stories tell, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was punished for the tyranny of his father <hi>Demetrius; Phyleus</hi> for his father <hi>Auge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>;</hi> pious and wise <hi>Nestor</hi> for his father <hi>Neleus:</hi> And it was so in the case of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who lost the Kingdom and his life upon the stock of his fathers sins; and the innocent childe of David was slain by the anger of God, not against the childe, who never had deserved it, but the fathers adultery. I need not here repeat what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I said in vindication of the Divine justice; but I observed this, to represent the danger of a sinning father, or mother, when it shall so infect the family with curses; that it shall ruine a wise and an innocent son; and that vertue and innocence which shall by God be accepted as sufficient through the Divine mercy to bring the son to Heaven, yet it may be shall not be accepted to quit him from feeling the curse of his fathers crime, in a load of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infelicities: And who but a villain would ruine and undo a wise, a vertuous, and his own son? But so it is in all the world, A traytor is condemned to suffer death himself, and his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are made beggers, and dishonourable, his Escutcheon is rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, his arms of honour are extinguished, the noblesse of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours is forgotten, but his own sin is not, while men by the characters of infamy are taught to call that family accursed which had so base a father. <hi>Tiresias</hi> was esteemed unfortunate because he could not see his friends and children: the poor man was blinde with age: But <hi>Athamas</hi> and <hi>Agave</hi> were more miserable, who did see their children, but took them for Lions, and Stags; The parents were miserably frantick; But of all, they deplored the misery of Hercules; who when he saw his children, took them for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enemies, and endeavoured to destroy them. And this is the case of all vitious parents. That <hi>a mans enemies were they of his own house,</hi> was accounted a great calamity: but it is worse, when we love them tenderly, and fondly, and yet do them all the despite we wish to enemies; But so it is, that in many cases we do more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50231:199"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to our children, then if we should strangle them when they are newly taken from their mothers knees, on tear them in pieces as <hi>Media</hi> did her brother <hi>Absyrtus;</hi> For to leave them to inherit a curse, to leave them an intaild calamity, a misery, a disease, the wrath of God for an inheritance, that it may descend upon them, and remark the family like their coat of arms, is to be the parent of evil; the ruine of our family, the causes of mischief to them, who ought to be dearer to us then our own eyes. And let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, when we are tempted to provoke the jealous God: let us consider that his anger hath a progeny, and a descending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> line, and it may break out in the dayes of our Nephews. A Greek woman was accused of adultery, because she brought forth a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor; and could not acquit her self till she had proved that she had descended in the fourth degree from an Ethiopian: Her great Grand-father was a Moor. And if Naturalists say true, that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews are very often liker to their Grandfathers then to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; we see that the semblance of our souls, and the character of the person, is conveyed by secret and undiscernable conveyances. Naturall production conveyes originall sin; and therefore, by the chanels of the body, it is not strange that men convey an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sin: And lustfull sons are usually born to Satyrs; and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of intemperance to the drunkards; and there are also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary diseases: which if in the fathers they were effects of their sin, as it is in many cases, it is notorious that the fathers sin is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and the punishment conveyed by naturall instruments: so that it cannot be a wonder, but it ought to be a huge affrightment from a state of sin; If a man can be capable of so much charity, as to love himself in his own person, or in the images of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and heirs of his fortunes, and the supports of his family, in the children that God hath given him. Consider therefore that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> you do not onely act your own tragedies when you sin, but you represent and effect the fortune of your children; you slay them with your own barbarous and inhumane hands. Onely be pleased to compare the variety of estates; of your own and your children. If they on earth be miserable many times for their fathers sins, how great a state of misery is that in hell which they suffer for their own? And how vile a person is that father, or mother, who for a little money, or to please a lust, will be a parricide, and imbrue his hands in the blood of his own children? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

IAm to consider what remedies there are for sons to cut off this intall of curses; and whether, and by what means it is possible for sons to prevent the being punished for their fathers sins? And since this thing is so perplext and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, hath so easie an objection, and so hard an answer, looks so like a cruelty, and so unlike a justice, (though it be infinitely just, and very severe, and a huge enemy to sin) it cannot be thought but that there are not onely wayes left to reconcile Gods proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the strict rules of justice, but also the condition of man to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the possibilities of Gods usuall mercies. One said of old, <hi>Ex tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate si Dij soutes praetereant, &amp; insontes plectant, justitiam suam non sic rectè resarciunt.</hi> If God be so slow to punish the guilty, that the punishment be deferred till the death of the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and that God shall be forced to punish the innocent, or to let the sin quite escape unpunished, it will be something hard to joyn that justice with mercy, or to joyn that action with justice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it will seem strange, but the reason of its justice, I have already discoursed: If now we can finde how to reconcile this to Gods mercy too, or can learn how it may be turned into a mercy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we need to take no other care, but that for our own particular we take heed we never tempt Gods anger upon our families, and that by competent and apt instruments, we indeavour to cancell the decree, if it be gone out against our families; for then we make use of that severity which God intended; and our selves shall be refreshed in the shades, and by the cooling brooks of the Divine mercy; even then when we see the wrath of God breaking out upon the families round about us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first means to cut off the intail of wrath and cursings from a family, is for the sons to disavow those signall actions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> impiety, in which their fathers were deeply guilty, and by which they stained great parts of their life, or have done something of very great unworthinesse and disreputation. <hi>Si quis paterni vitij nascitur haeres, nascitur &amp; poenae?</hi> The heir of his fathers wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is the heir of his fathers curse; and a son comes to inherite a

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wickednesse from his father three wayes. 1. By approving, or any wayes consenting to his fathers sin: As by speaking of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regret, or shame; by pleasing himself in the story; or by having an evil minde, apt to counsell or do the like, if the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances should occur. For a son may contract a sin, not onely by derivation, and the contagion of example, but by approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not onely by a corporall, but by a virtuall contact; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by transcribing an evil copy, but by commending it: and a man may have <hi>animum leprosum in cute mundâ,</hi> a leprous and a polluted minde even for nothing, even for an empty and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective lust. An evil minde may contract the curse of an evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and though the son of a covetous father prove a prodigall, yet if he loves his fathers vice for ministring to his vanity, he is disposed not onely to a judgement for his own prodigality, but also to the curse of his fathers avarice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The son may inherit his fathers wickednesse by imitation and direct practise, and then the curse is like to come to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; a curse by accumulation, a treasure of wrath: and then the children as they arrive to the height of wickednesse by a speedy passage, as being thrust forward by an active example, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by education, by a seldom restraint, by a remisse disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; so they ascertain a curse to the family, by being a perverse generation, a family set up in opposition against God, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and increasing the provocation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sons inherit their fathers crimes, by receiving, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the purchases of their rapine, injustice, and oppression, by rising upon the ruine of their fathers souls, by sitting warme in the furres which their father stole, and walking in the grounds which are water'd with the tears of oppressed orphanes, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.

                  <p n="3">3. But concerning the third; there is yet more difficulty. Those sons that inherit their Fathers sins by possessing the price of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers souls, that is, by enjoying the goods gotten by their Fathers rapine, may certainly quit the inheritance of the curse, if they quit the purchase of the sin, that is, if they pay their Fathers debts; his debts of contract, and his debts of justice; his debts of entercourse, and his debts of oppression. I do not say that every man is bound to restore all the land which his Ancestors have unjustly snatched: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for when by law the possession is established, though the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father entred like a thief, yet the Grand-child is <hi>bonae fidei possessor,</hi> and may enjoy it justly: and the reasons of this are great, and necessary; for the avoiding eternal suites, and perpetual diseases of rest and conscience: because there is no estate in the world that could be enjoyed by any man honestly, if posterity were bound to make restitution of all the wrongs done by their progenitors. But although the children of the far removed lines, are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to restitution, yet others are; and some for the same, some for other reasons. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sons are tied to restore what their Fathers did usurpe, or to make agreement, and an acceptable recompence for it, if the case be visible, evident and notorious, and the oppressed party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; because in this case the law hath not setled the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session in the new tenant: or if a judge hath, it is by injury; and there is yet no collateral accidental title transferred by long pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, as it is in other cases: and therefore if the son continues to oppresse the same person, whom his Father first injured, he may well expect to be the heire of his Fathers curse, as well as of his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed purchase. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether by law and justice, or not, the person be obliged, nay although by all the solemnities of law the unjust purchase be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, and that in conscience the Grand-children be not obliged to restitution in their own particulars, but may continue to enjoy it without a new sin; yet if we see a curse descending upon the family
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50231:202"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for the old oppression done in the dayes of our Grandfathers; or if we probpably suspect that to be the cause; then if we make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution we also most certainly remove the curse: because we take away the matter upon which the curse is grounded: I do not say, we sin, if we do not restore: but that, if we do not, we may still be punished; The reason of this is clear and visible: For as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our faults, in many cases we may enjoy those lands which our forefathers got unjustly: so without our faults we may be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. For as they have transmitted the benefit to us, it is but reasonable we should suffer the appendant calamity. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> good, we must also venture the evil that comes along withit: <hi>res transit cum suo onere.</hi> All lands and possessions passe with their proper burdens. And if any of my Ancestors was a Tenant, and a servant, and held his lands as a Villane to his Lord, his posterity also must do so, though accidentally they become noble. The case is the same If my Ancestors entred unjustly, there is a curse and a plague that is due to that oppression and injustice; and that is <hi>the burden of the land,</hi> and it descends all along with it: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I by the consent of laws am a just possessor, yet I am obliged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the burden that comes with the land: I am indeed anotherkinde of person then my Grand-father; he was an usurper, but I am a just possessor; but because in respect of the land this was but an accidentall change, therefore I still am liable to the burden, and the curse that descends with it but the way to take off the curse is to quit the title; and yet a man may choose. It may be to loose the land would be the bigger curses but if it be not, the way is certain how you may be rid of it. * There was a custome among the Greeks that the children of them that dyed of consumptions or dropsies, all the while their Fathers bodies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were burning in their funeral piles did sit with their feet in cold water, hoping that such a lustration, and ceremony would take off the lineal and descending contagion from the children: I know not what cure they found by their superstition; but we may be sure, that if we wash (not our feet, but) our hands of all the unjust pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases which our Fathers have transmitted to us, their hydropick thirst of wealth shall not transmit to us a consumption of estate, or any other curse. But this remedy is onely in the matter of injury, or oppression, not in the case of other sins: because other sins were transient; and as the guilt did not passe upon the children, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> neither did the exteriour and permanent effect: and therefore in other sins (in case they do derive a curse) it cannot be removed, as in the matter of unjust possession, it may be; whose effect (we may so order it) shall no more stick to us then the guilt of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers personal actions.</p>
                  <p>The summe is this. As Kingdoms use to expiate the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by acts of justice: and as Churches use to remove the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thing from sticking to the communities of the faithful, and the

By refusing to rejoyce in the ungodly purchases in which their Fathers did amisse and dealt wickedly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But after all this, many cases do occur, in which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> finde that innocent sons are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>istied. The remedies I have already discoursed of, are for such children who have in some manner or other contracted and derived the sin upon themselves. But if we inquire, how those sons who have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, or affinity with their fathers sins; or whose fathers sins were so transient, that no benefit or effect did passe upon their posterity, how they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or take off the curse that lyes upon the family, for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faults; this will have some distinct considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The pious children of evil Parents are to stand firme upon the confidence of the Divine grace and mercy; and upon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to begin to work upon a new stock. For it is as certain that he may derive a blessing upon his Posterity, as that this Parents could transmit a curse: and if any man by piety shall procure Gods favour to his Relatives and children, it is certain that he hath done more, then to escape the punishment of his Fathers follies. If <hi>sin doth abound,</hi> and evils by sin are derived from his Parents, <hi>much more shall grace super abound,</hi> and mercy by grace. If he was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the crimes of others, much rather shall he be secured by his own piety. For if God punishes the sins of the fathers to four <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> generations, yet he rewards the piety of fathers to ten, to hundreds, and to thousands. Many of the Ancestors of <hi>Abraham</hi> were persons not noted for religion; but suffered in the publike impiety, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most universal idolatry of their ages; and yet all the evils that could thence descend upon the family, were wiped off; and God began to reckon with <hi>Abraham</hi> upon a new stock of blessings and piety; and he was under God, the Original of so great a blessing, that his family for 1500. years together had from him a title to many favours; and what ever evils did chance to them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending ages, were but single evils, in respect of that treasure of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mercies which the fathers piety had obtained to the whole nation. And it is remarkable to observe; how blessings did stick to them for their fathers sakes, even whether they would or no. For first, his Grand-childe <hi>Esau</hi> proved a naughty man, and he lost the great blessing which was in tailed upon the family; but he got, not a curse, but a lesse blessing: and yet because he lost the greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, God excluded him from being reckoned in the elder time;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50231:203"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for God foreseeing the event, so ordered it that he should first lose his birth-right, and then lose the blessing; for it was to be certain, the family must be reckoned for prosperous in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per line; and yet God blessed <hi>Esau</hi> into a great Nation, and made him the Father of many Princes. Now the line of blessing being reckoned in <hi>Jacob,</hi> God blessed his family strangely, and by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, for almost five generations; he brought them from Egypt by mighty signes and wonders; and when for sin they all died in their way to Canaan, two onely excepted, God so ordered it, that they were all reckoned as single deaths, the Nation still descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> like a river whose waters were drunk up for the beauvrage of an army, but still it keeps its name and current, and the waters are supplied by showers, and springs, and providence. After this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity still increased, and then God struck deeper, and spread curses upon whole families: he translated the Priesthood from line to line, he removed the Kingome from one family to another; and still they sinned worse; and then we read that God smote almost a whole tribe; the tribe of Benjmin was almost extinguished about the matter of the Levites Concubine: but <hi>still God remembred his promise</hi> which he made with their forefathers, and that breach was made up. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this we finde a greater rupture made; and ten tribes fell into ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ten tribes were carried captives into Assyria and never came again: But <hi>still God remembred his covenant with Abraham,</hi> and left two Tribes; but they were restlesse in their provocation of the God of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and they also were carried captive: But still God was the God of their fathers and brought them back, and placed them safe, and they grew again into a Kingdom and should have remained for ever but that they killed one that was greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> even the Messias; and then they were rooted out, and the old covenant cast off, and God delighted no more to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be called <hi>the God of Abraham;</hi> but the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> As long as God kept that relation, so long <hi>for the fathers sakes</hi> they had a title and an inheritance to a blessing: for so saith Saint <hi>Paul. [As touching the election they are beloved for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I did insist the longer upon this instance that I might remonstrate how great and how sure, and how persevering mercies, a pious Father of a family may derive upon his succeeding generations: And if we do but <hi>tread in the footsteps of our Father Abraham,</hi> we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> shall inherit as certain blessings. But then I pray, adde these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If a great impiety, and a clamorous wickednesse hath stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the honour of a family, and discomposed its title to the Divine mercies and protection, it is not an ordinary piety that can restore this family. An ordinary, even course of life, full of sweetnesse, and innocency will secure every single person in his own eternal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50231:204"/>
interest: but that piety which must be a spring of blessings, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> communicative to others, that must plead against the sins of their Ancestors, and begin a new bank of mercies for the Relatives; that, must be a great, and excellent, a very religious state of life. A smal pension will maintain a single person: but he that hath a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous family, and many to provide for, needs a greater providence of God, and a bigger provision for their maintenance: and a small revenue will not keep up the dignity of a great house; especially, if it be charged with a great debt: And this is the very state of the present question. That piety that must be instrumental to take off the curse imminent upon a family; to blesse a numerous posterity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to secure a fair condition to many ages, and to pay the debts of their Fathers sins, must be so large as that all necessary expences, and dutyes for his own soul being first discharged, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable in great expressions, it may be exemplar to all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it may be of universal efficacie, large in the extension of parts, deep in the intension of degrees: and then, as the root of a tree receives nourishment, not onely sufficient to preserve its own life, but to transmit a plastick juice to the trunk of the tree, and from thence to the utmost branch and smallest gem that knots in the most distant part: So shall the great and exemplar piety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the father of a family, not onely preserve to the interest of his own soul the life of grace, and hopes of glory, but shall be a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirit, active and communicative of ablessing, not onely to the trunk of the tree, to the body and rightly descending line, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the collateral branches, to the most distant relatives, and all that shall claim a kinred, shall have a title to a blessing. And this was the way that was prescribed to the family of <hi>Eli,</hi> upon whom a sad curse was intailed that there should not be an old man of the family for ever, and that they should be beggers, and lose the office of Priesthood: by the counsel of R. <hi>Johanan</hi> the son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of <hi>Zacheus</hi> all the family betook themselves to a great, a strict and a severe religion; and God was intreated to revoke his decree, to be reconciled to the family, to restore them to the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, from whence they stood separate by the displeasure of God against the crime of <hi>Eli,</hi> and his Sons <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas.</hi> This course is sure either to take off the judgement, or to change it into a blessing; to take a way the rod, or the smart and evil of it; to convert the punishment into a meer naturall, or humane chance, and that chance to the opportunity of a vertue, and that vertue to the occasion of a crown. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is of great use for the securing of families, that every Master of a family order his life so that his piety and vertue be as communicative as is posible; that is, that he secure the religion of his whole family, by a severe supravision and animadversion, and by cutting off all those unprofitable and hurtful branches

Calvisius Sabinus laid out vast sums of mony upon his servants, to stock his house with learned men; and bought one that could recite all Homer by heart; a second that was ready at Hesiod; a third at Pindar; and for every of the Lyricks one: having this fancy that all that learning was his own, &amp; whatsoever his servants knew, made him so much the more skilful. It was noted in the man for a rich and a prodigal folly: but if he had chang'd his instance, &amp; bought none but vertuous servants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his house, he might better have reckoned his wealth upon their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> stock, &amp; the piety of his family might have helped to blesse him, and to have increased the treasure of the Masters vertue. Every man that would either cut off the title of an old curse, or secure a blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a new stock, must make vertue as large in the fountain as he can that it may the sooner water all his Relatives with fruitfulnesse and blessings. And this was one of the things that God noted in Abraham, and blessed his family for it, and his posterity. <hi>I know that Abraham will teach his sons to fear me.</hi> When a man teaches his family to know and fear God, then he scatters a blessing round about his habitation. And this helps to illustrate the reason of the thing as well as to prove <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> its certainty. We hear it spoken in our books of Religion, that the faith of the parents is imputed to their children to good purposes, &amp; that a good husband sanctifies an ill wife, &amp; <hi>a beleeving wife, an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving husband;</hi> and either of them makes the children to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>else they were unclean, and unholy;</hi> that is, the very designing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the service of God is a sanctification of them; and therefore S. Hierom cals Christian children <hi>Candidatos fidei Christianae:</hi> and if this very designation of them makes them holy; that is, acceptable to God, intitled to the promises, partakers of the Covenant, within the condition of sons; much more shall it be effectual to greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when the Parents take care that the children shall be actually pious, full of sobriety, full of religion, then it becomes a holy house, <hi>a chosen generation, an elect family;</hi> and then there can no evil happen to them, but such which will bring them neerer to God; that is, no crosse, but the crosse of Christ; no misfortune, but that which shall lead them to felicity: and if any semblance of a curse happens in the generations, it is but like the anathema of a sacrifice; not an <hi>accursed,</hi> but a <hi>devoted</hi> thing: for so the sacrifice upon whose neck the Priests knife doth fall, is so far from being accursed, that it helps to get a blessing to all that joyn in the oblation: so every misfortune that shal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> discompose the ease of a pious and religious family shall but make them fit to be presented unto God; and the rod of God shall be like the branches of fig-trees, bitter and sharp in themselves, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of most delicious fruit: no evil can curse the family whose stock is pious, and <hi>whose branches are Holinesse unto the Lord.</hi> If any leaf, or any boughs shall fall untimely, God shall gather it up, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50231:205"/>
place it in his Temple, or at the foot of his throne; and that family <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must needs be blessed, whom infelicity it self cannot make accursed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If a curse be feared to descend upon a family for the fault of their Ancestors; pious sons have yet another way to fecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp; to withdraw the curse from the family, or themselves from the curse; and that is, by doing some very great &amp; illustrious act of piety, an action <hi>in gradu heroico</hi> (as Aristotle cals it) an heroicall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If there should happen to be one Martyr in a family, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the whole kinred to God, &amp; make him who is more inclined to mercy then to severity, rather to be pleased with the Relatives of the Martyr, then continue to be angry with the Nephews of a decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sinner. I cannot insist long upon this: But you may see it proved by one great instance in the case of Phinehas, who killed an unclean Prince, &amp; turned the wrath of God from his people: he was zealous for God and for his countreymen, &amp; did an heroicall action of zeal: Wherefore (saith God) <hi>Behold I give unto him my covenant of peace,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and he shall have it, &amp; his seed after him, even the covenant of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, &amp; made an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the children of Israel.</hi> Thus the sons of Rechab obtain d the blessing of an enduring and blessed family, because they were most strict &amp; religious observers of their fathers precept, and kept it after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his death, &amp; abstained from wine for ever; and no temptation could invite them to taste it; for they had as great reverence to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ashes, as being children they had to his rod, &amp; to his eyes. Thus a man may turn the wrath of God from his family, &amp; secure a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing for posterity, by doing some great noble acts of charity, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable chastity, like that of Joseph; or an expensive, an effectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate religion and love to Christ and his servants (as Mary Magdalene did). Such things as these which are extraordinary egressions and transvolations beyond the ordinary course of an even piety, God loves to reward with an extraordinary favour; and gives it testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by an extraregular blessing.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I have to adde by way of advice; and that is, that all parents and fathers of families, from whose loyns a blessing or a curse usually does descend, be very carefull, not onely generally in all the actions of their lives (for that I have already pressed) but, particularly in the matter of repentance; that they be curious that they finish it, &amp; do it thorowly: for there are certain <gap reason="foreign">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God deals thus. For this thing hath been so, and therefore it may be so again: we see it was done in the case of <hi>Ahab;</hi> he humbled himself and went softly, and lay in sackcloth, and called for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and God took from him a judgement which was falling hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon him: but we all know his repentance was imperfect and lame: The same evil fell upon his sons; for so said God; I will bring the evil upon his house in his sons dayes. Leave no arreares for thy posterity to pay; but repent with an integral, a holy and excellent repentance, that God being reconciled to thee thoroughly, for thy sake also he may blesse thy seed after thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And after all this, adde a continual, a fervent, a hearty, a never ceasing prayer for thy children, ever remembring when they beg a blessing, that God hath put much of their fortune into your hands; and a transient formal <hi>[God blesse thee]</hi> will not out-weigh the load of a great vice; and the curse that scatters from thee by virtual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, and by the chanels of relation, if thou beest a vicious person: Nothing can issue from thy fountain but bitter waters, And as it were a great impudence for a condemned Traitor to beg of his injured Prince a province for his son, for his sake: so it is an ineffective blessing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we give our children, when we beg <hi>for them,</hi> what we have no title to for our selves, Nay, when we can convey to them nothing but a curse.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of himself, but they are such which are made so by his own gracious acceptation. For God cannot be glorified by any thing but by himself, and by his own instruments, which he makes as mirrours to reflect his own excellency, that by seeing the glory of such emanations; he may rejoyce in his own works, because they are images of his infinity. Thus when he made the beauteous frame of heaven and earth, he rejoyced in it, and glorified himself, because it was the glasse in which he beheld his wisedom, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power: And when God destroyed the old world, in that also he glorified himself; for in those waters he saw the image of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his justice; they were the looking glasse for that Attribute; and God is said <hi>to laugh at,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce in the destruction of a sinner,</hi> because he is pleased with the Oeconomy of his own lawes, and the excellent proportions he hath made of his judgements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to our sins. But above all, God rejoyced in his Holy Son, for he was the image of the Divinity, <hi>the character and expresse image of his person,</hi> in him he beheld his own Essence, his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his power, his justice, and his person, and he was that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent instrument, designed from eternall ages to represent as in a double mirrour, not onely the glories of God to himself, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to all the world; and he glorified God by the instrument of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in which God beheld his own dominion, and the sanctity of his lawes clearly represented; and he saw his justice glorified, when it was fully satisfied by the passion of his Son; and so he hath transmitted to us a great manner of the Divine glorification, being become to us the Authour, and the Example of giving glory to God after the manner of men, that is, by well-doing, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient suffering, by obeying his lawes, and submitting to his power, by imitating his holinesse, and confessing his goodnesse, by remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent, <hi>or becoming penitent;</hi> for this also is called in the Text <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> [GIVING GLORY TO THE LORD OUR GOD.]</p>
                  <p>For he that hath dishonoured God by sins, that is, hath denied, by a morall instrument of duty, and subordination, to confesse the glories of his power, and the goodnesse of his lawes, and hath dishonoured, and despised his mercy, which God intended as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of our piety, hath no better way to glorifie God, then by returning to his duty, to advance the honour of the Divine Attributes in which he is pleased to communicate himself, and to have entercourse with man. He that repents, confesses his own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the righteousnesse of Gods lawes, and by judging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesses that he deserves punishment, and therefore that God is righteous if he punishes him: and by returning, confesses God to be the fountain of felicity, and the foundation of true, solid, and permanent joyes, saying in the sense and passion of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Whither shall we go? for thou hast the words of eternall life:</hi> and by humbling himself, exalts God by making the proportions

of distance more immense, and vast: and as repentance does <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it all the parts of holy life which can be performed by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning sinner (all the acts, and habits of vertue, being but parts, or instances, or effects of repentance): so all the actions of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life do constitute the masse and body of all those instruments whereby God is pleased to glorifie himself. *For if God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sunne and Moon, in the rare fabrick of the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, in the discipline of Bees, in the oeconomy of Pismires, in the little houses of birds, in the curiosity of an eye, God being pleased to delight in those little images and reflexes of himself from those pretty mirrours, which like a crevice in a wall thorow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a narrow perspective transmit the species of a vast excellency: much rather shall God be pleased to behold himself in the glasses of our obedience, in the emissions of our will and understanding; these being rationall and apt instruments to expresse him, farre better then the naturall, as being neerer communications of himself.</p>
                  <p>But I shall no longer discourse of the Philosophy of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; certain it is, that in the stile of Scripture, <hi>repentance</hi> is the great <hi>glorification of God;</hi> and the Prophet, by calling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>give God glory,</hi> calls upon them to <hi>repent;</hi> and so expresses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> both the duty and the event of it; the event being <hi>[Glory to God on high, and peace on earth, and good will towards men]</hi> by the sole instrument of <hi>repentance.</hi> And this was it which Joshuah said to Achan, [Give I pray thee glory to the Lord God of Israel, <note place="margin">Joshuah 7. 19.</note> and make confession unto him: that one act of repentance is one act of glorifying God: and this, David acknowledged, Against <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> thee onely have I sinned, <hi>ut tu justificeris,</hi> that thou mightest be justified, or cleared, that is, that God may have the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteous, and we, the shame of receding from so excellent a perfection: or as S.

                  <p>This exhortation of the Prophet was alwayes full of caution and prudence, but now it is highly necessary; since men who are so clamorously called to repentance that they cannot avoid the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, yet that they may reconcile an evil life with the hopes of heaven, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have crowded this duty into so little room, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most strangled and extinct; and they have lopped off so many members, that they have reduced the whole body of it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of a little finger, sacrificing their childhood to vanity, their youth to lust, and to intemperance, their manhood to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and rage, pride and revenge, secular desires, and unholy actions; and yet still further, giving their old age to covetousnesse and oppression, to the world, and to the Devil; and after all this what remains for God and for Religion? Oh, for that, they wll <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> do well enough; upon their death-bed they will think a few godly thoughts, they will send for a Priest to minister comfort to them; they will pray and ask God forgivenesse, and receive the holy Sacrament, and leave their goods behinde them, disposing them to their friends and relatives, and some Dole, and issues of the almes-basket to the poor; and if after all this they die quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and like a lambe, and be canoniz'd by a brib'd flatterer in a funerall sermon, they make no doubt but they are children of the kingdom, and perceive not their folly, till without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy they roar in their expectations of a certain, but a horrid eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of pains. * Certainly nothing hath made more ample harvests for the Devil, then the deferring of repentance upon vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and lessening it in the extension of parts, as well as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of degrees, while we imagine that a few tears, and scatterings of devotion are enough to expiate the basenesse of a fifty or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yeers impiety. This I shall endeavour to cure, by shewing what it is to repent, and that repentance implies in it the duty of a life, or of many and great, of long and lasting parts of it; and then by direct arguments, shewing that repentance put off to our death-bed is invalid and ineffectuall, sick, languid, and impotent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> like our dying bodies and disabled faculties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First therefore, Repentance implies a deep sorrow, as the beginning and introduction of this duty; not a superficiall sigh, or tear, not a calling our selves sinners, and miserable persons; this is far from that <hi>godly sorrow that worketh repentance;</hi> and yet I wish there were none in the world, or none amongst us, who cannot remember that ever they have done this little towards the

That it makes us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> really to hate, &amp; 2. actually to decline sin, and 3. produce in us a fear fo Gods anger, a sense of the guilt of his displeasure; and 4. Then, such consequent trouble as can consist with such apprehension of the Divine displeasure: which if it expresse not in tears and hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, must be expressed in watchings and strivings against sin, in confessing the goodnesse and justice of God threatning or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing us, in patiently bearing the rod of God, in confession of our sins, in accusation of our selves, in perpetual begging of pardon, and mean and base opinions of our selves, and in al the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from these; according to our temper and constitution; it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> must be a sorrow of the reasonable faculty, the greatest in its kinde; and if it be lesse in kinde; or not productive of these effects, it is not a godly sorrow, not the exordium of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>But I desire that it be observed, that sorrow for sins, is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50231:208"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not that duty which gives glory to God, so as to obtain of him that he will glorifie us. Repentance is a great volume of duty; and Godly sorrow is but the frontispiece or title page: it is the harbinger or first introduction to it; or if you will consider it in the words of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> [Godly sorrow worketh repentance] <note place="margin">2 Cor 7.</note> sorrow is the Parent, and repentance is the product; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a high piece of ignorance to suppose that, a crying out and roaring for our sins upon our deathbed can reconcile us to God; our crying to God must be so early, and so lasting, as to be able to teeme, and produce such a daughter, which must live long, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and grow from an Embryo to an infant, from infancy to childhood, from thence to the fulnesse of the stature of Christ, and then it is a holy and a happy sorrow: but if it be a sorrow onely of a death-bed, it is a fruitlesse shower, or like the rain of Sodom not the beginning of repentance, but the kindling of a flame, the comencement of an eternal sorrow. For Ahab had a great sorrow but it wrought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon his spirit, it did not reconcile his affections to his duty, and his duty to God. <hi>Judas</hi> had so great a sorrow for betraying the innocent blood of his Lord, that it was intolerable to his Spirit, and he burst in the middle: and if meer sorrow be repentance, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hell is full of penitents, for <hi>[there is weeping and wailing, and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of teeth for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore beg of God (as <hi>Calebs</hi> daughter did of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>dedisti mihi terram aridam, da etiam &amp; irriguam,</hi> thou hast given me a dry land, give me also a land of waters, a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place in tears, rivers of tears, <hi>ut quoniam non sumus digni ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los orando ad coelum levare, at simus digni oculos plorando caecare,</hi> as Saint <hi>Austins</hi> expression is, that because we are not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven in prayer, yet we may be worthy to weep our selves blinde for sin, the meaning is, that we beg sorrow of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God, such a sorrow as may be sufficient to quench the flames of lust, and surmount the hills of our pride, and may extinguish our thirst of covetousnesse; that is, a sorrow that shall be an effective principle of arming all our faculties against sin, and heartily set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the work of grace, and the persevering labours of a holy life. *I shall onely adde one word to this: That our sorrow for sin is not to be estimated by our tears, and our sensible expressions, but by our active hatred, and dereliction of sin: and is many times unperceived in outward demonstration. It is reported of the Mother of Peter Lombard, Gratian, and Comestor, that she having <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had three sons begotten in unhallowed embraces, upon her death-bed did omit the recitation of those crimes to her confessour; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this for Apology, that her three sons proved persons so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Church that their excellency was abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for her demerit: and therefore she could not grieve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God had glorified himself so much by three instruments so
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50231:209"/>
excellent; and that although her sin had abounded; yet Gods grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> did superabound. Her Confessor replied, <hi>at dole Saltent quod dolere non possis,</hi> grieve that thou canst not grieve: and so must we; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fear that our trouble for sin is nor great enough, that our sorrow is too remisse, that our affections are indifferent; but we can onely be sure that our sorrow is a godly sorrow, when it worketh repentance; that is, when it makes us hate and leave all our sin, and take up the crosse of patience or penance: that is, confesse our sin, accuse our selves, condemn the action by hearty sentence; and then, if it hath no other emanation but fasting and prayer for its pardon, and hearty industry towards its abolition, our sorrow is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not reproveable.</p>
                  <p>For, sorrow alone will not do it, there must follow a total dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of our sin; and this is the first part of repentance. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I consider, that it is a sad mistake amongst many that do some things towards repentance, that they mistake the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, and instruments of this part of repentance for the whole duty it self. Confession of sins is in order to the dereliction of them; but then confession must not be like the unlading of a ship to take in new stowage; or the vomits of intemperance, which ease the stomack that they may continue the merry meeting: but such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is too frequent, in which men either comply with custome or seek to ease a present load, or gripe of conscience, or are willing to dresse up their souls against afestiyal, or hope for pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so easie terms: these are but retirings baok to leap the further into mischief; or but approaches to God with the lips; no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession can be of any use, but as it is an instrument of shame to the person, of humiliation of the man, and dereliction of the sin, and receives its recompence but as it ads to these purposes: all other, is like the bleating of the calves, and the lowing of the Oxen which <hi>Saul</hi> reserved after the spoil of <hi>Agag:</hi> they proclaim the sin, but do nothing towards its cure; they serve Gods end to make us just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be condemned out of our own mouthes, but nothing at all towards our absolution. * Nay, if we proceed further, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est expressions of humiliation, (parts of which I reckon, fasting, praying for pardon, judging and condemning of our selves by instances of a present indignation, against a crime) yet unlesse this proceed so far as to a total deletion of the sin, to the extirpation of every vitious habit, God is not glorified by our repentance, nor we secured in our eternal interest. Our sin must be brought to judgement, and like Antinous in <hi>Homer,</hi> layed in the mids as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sacrifice and the cause of all the mischief.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Well? let us suppose our penitent advanced thus far, as that he decrees against all sin, and in his hearty purposes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to decline it, as in a severe sentence he hath condemned it as his betrayer and his murderer; yet we must be curious (for now onely the repentance properly begins) that it be not onely like the springings of the thorny of the high way ground, soon up and soon down: For some men when a sadnesse or an unhandsome accident surprizes them, then they resolve against their sin, but like the goats in Aristotle they give their milk no longer then they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stung: as soon as the thorns are removed, these men return to their first hardnesse, and resolve then to act their first tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others there are who never resolve against a sin, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they have no temptation to it, or when their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are newly satisfied with it, like those who immediately after a full dinner resolve to fast at supper, and they keep it till their appetite returnes, and then their resolution unties like the cords of vanity or the gossamere against the violence of the Northen winde. Thus a lustfull person fills all the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his lust, and when he is wearied, and the sin goes off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with unquietnesse and regret, and the appetite falls down like a horseleech when it is ready to burst with putrifaction and an unwholsome plethory; then he resolves to be a good man and could almost vow to be a Hermit, and hates his lust, as Amnon hated his sister Thamar, just when he had newly acted his unworthy rape; but the next spring tide that comes, every wave of the temptation, makes an inrode upon the resolution and gets ground, and prevailes against it more then his resolution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed against his sin: How many drunken persons, how many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Swearers resolve daily and hourely against their sin, and yet act them not once the lesse for all their infinite heape of shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ret eating purposes * That resolution that begins upon just grounds of sorrow and severe judgement, upon fear and love, that is made in the midst of a temptation, that is inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive into all the means and instruments of the cure, that prayes perpetually against a sin; that watches continually against a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50231:210"/>
surprize, and never sinks into it by deliberation; that fights <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> earnestly and carries on the war prudently and prevailes by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceasing diligence against the temptation; that onely is a pious and well begun repentance. They that have their fits of a quartan, well and ill for ever, and think themselves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, when the ague is retired till its period returnes, are dangerously mistaken. Those intervals of imperfect and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resolution, are nothing but states of death: and if a man should depart this world in one of those godly fits (as he thinks them) he is no neerer to obtain his blessed hope, then a man in the stone collick is to health when his pain is eased for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his disease still remaining, and threatning an unwelcome return. That resolution onely is the beginning of a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which goes forth into act, and whose acts enlarge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to habits, and whose habits are productive of the fruits of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
                  <p>From hence we are to take our estimate, whence our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of piety must commence. He that resolves not to live well till the time comes that he must die, is ridiculous in his great designe, as he is impertinent in his intermedial purposes, and vain in his hope. Can a dying man to any real effect resolve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be chast? (for vertue must be an act of election, and chastity is the contesting against a proud and an imperious lust, active flesh, and insinuating temptation) And what doth he resolve against who can no more be tempted to the sin of unchastity then he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne back again to his youth and vigour. And it is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that since all the purposes of a holy life which a dying man can make, cannot be reduced to act, by what law, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or covenant, or revelation are we taught to distinguish the resolution of a dying man from the purposes of a living and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous person? Suppose a man in his youth and health mooved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by consideration of the irregularity and deformity, of sin, the danger of its productions, the wrath and displeasure of Almightie God, should resolve to leave the puddles of impurity, and walk in the paths of righteousnesse; can this resolution alone put him into the state of grace; is he admitted to pardon and the favour of God before he hath in some measure performed actually what he so reasonably hath resolved? By no means. For, [resolution and purpose] is in its own nature and constitution an imperfect act, and therefore can signifie nothing without its performance and consummation. It is as a faculty is to the act, as spring is to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> harvest, as seed time is to the Autumne, as Egges are to birds, or as a relative to its correspondent; nothing without it. And can it be imagined that a resolution in our health and life shall be ineffectual without performance and shall a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution barely such, do any Good upon our deathbed? Can such
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50231:210"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> purposes prevail against a long impiety rather then against a young and a newly begun state of sin? Will God at an easier rate pardon the sins of fifty or sixty yeers, then the sins of our youth onely, or the iniquity of five yeers, or ten? If a holy life be not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be liv'd, why shall it be necessary to resolve to live it? But if a holy life be necessary, then it cannot be sufficient meerly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it, unlesse this resolution go forth in an actuall and reall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Vain therefore is the hope of those persons who either go on in their sins; before their last sicknesse, never thinking to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wayes of God, from whence they have wandred all their life, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> never renewing their resolutions and vows of holy living; or if they have, yet their purposes are for ever blasted with the next violent temptation. More prudent was the prayer of David, <hi>[Oh spare me a little, that I may recover my strength before I go hence and be no more seen:]</hi> And something like it was the saying of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Charles the fifth, <hi>Inter vitae negotia &amp; mortis diem oportet spacium intercedere:</hi> When ever our holy purposes are renewed, unlesse God gives us time to act them, to mortifie and subdue our lusts, to conquer and subdue the whole kingdom of sin, to rise from our grave and be clothed with nerves and flesh and a new skin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to overcome our deadly sicknesses, and by little and little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to health and strength; unlesse we have grace and time to do all this, our sins will lie down with us in our graves. *For when a man hath contracted a long habit of sin, and it hath been grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him ten or twenty, fourty or fifty yeers, whose acts he hath daily or hourly repeated, and they are grown to a second nature to aim, and have so prevailed upon the ruines of his spirit, that the man is taken <hi>captive by the Devil at his will,</hi> he is fast bound as a slave tugging at the oar, that he is grown in love with his fetters, and longs to be doing the work of sin, is it likely that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all this progresse and groweth in sin (in the wayes of which he runs fast without any impediment) is it (I say) likely, that a few dayes or weeks of sicknesse can recover him? [the especiall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances of that state I shall afterwards consider] but, Can a man be supposed so prompt to piety and holy living, a man (I mean) that hath lived wickedly a long time together, can he be of so ready and active a vertue upon the sudden, as to recover in a moneth, or a week what he hath been undoing in 20, or 30 yeers? Is it so easie to build, that a weak and infirm person, bound hand and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> foot shall be able to build more in three dayes, then was a building above fourty yeers? Christ did it in a figurative sence; but in this, it is not in the power of any man so suddenly to be recovered from so long a sicknesse. Necessary therefore it is, that all these instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our conversion, <hi>[Confession of sins, praying for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and resolutions to lead a new life]</hi> should begin, <hi>[before our feet slum le upon the dark mountains,]</hi> lest we leave the work onely
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50231:211"/>
resolved upon to be begun, which, it is necessary we should in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> many degrees finish if ever we mean to escape the eternall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: <q>For that we should actually abolish the <hi>whole body of sin and death,</hi> that we should <hi>crucifie the old man with his lusts,</hi> that we should <hi>lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us,</hi> that we should <hi>cast away the works of darknesse,</hi> that we should <hi>awake from sleep, and arise from death,</hi> that we should <hi>redeem the time,</hi> that we should <hi>cleanse our hands and purifie our hearts,</hi> that we should have <hi>escaped the corruption,</hi> (all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) <hi>that is in the whole world through lust,</hi> that <hi>nothing of the old leaven should remain in us,</hi> but that we be <hi>wholly a new</hi>

It is true that <hi>a contrite and broken heart, God will not despise.</hi> No, he will not. For if it be a hearty and permanent sorrow, it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beginning of repentance; and God will to a timely sorrow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> give the grace of repentance: He will not give pardon to sorrow alone; but that which ought to be the proper effect of sorrow, that God shall give. He shall then open the gates of mercy, and admit you to a possibility of restitution; so, that you may be within the covenant of repentance, which if you actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, you may expect Gods promise. And in this sense Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession will obtain our pardon; and humiliation will be accepted; and our holy purposes, and pious resolutions shall be accounted for; that is, these being the first steps and addresses to that part of repentance, which consists in the abolition of sins, shall be accepted so far, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as to procure so much of the pardon, to do so much of the work of restitution, that God will admit the returning man to a further degree of emendation, to a neerer possibility of working out his salvation: but then if this sorrow, and confession, and strong purposes begin then when our life is declined towards the West,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50231:211"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and is now ready to set in darknesse and a dismall night; because of themselves they could but procure an admission to repentance, not at all to pardon, and plenary absolution; by shewing that on our death-bed these are too late and ineffectuall, they call upon us to begin betimes, when these imperfect acts may be consummate, and perfected in the actuall performing those parts of holy life, to which they were ordained, in the nature of the thing, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, suppose all this be done, and that by a long course of strictnesse and severity, mortification and circumspection we have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> overcome all our vitious and baser habits contracted and grown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, like the ulcers and evils of a long surfet, and that we are clean and swept; Suppose that he hath wept and fasted, prayed and vowed to excellent purposes; yet all this is but the one half of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; (so infinitely mistaken is the world, to think any thing to be enough to make up repentance;) but to renew us, and restore us to the favour of God, there is required far more then what hath been yet accounted for. See it in the second of S. Peter, 1 Chap. 4, 5. vers. <hi>Having escaped the corruption that is in the world thorough lust:</hi>

                     <q>For all our hopes of heaven rely upon that Covenant which God made with us in Baptisme; which is, That being redeemed from our vain conversation, we should serve him in holinesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all our dayes.</q> Now when any of us hath prevaricated our part of the Covenant, we must return to that state, and redeem the intermedial time spent in sin by our doubled industry in the wayes of grace: we must be reduced to our first estate, and make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some proportionable returns of duty, for our sad omissions, and great violations of our Baptismal vow. For God having made no covenant with us, but that which is consigned in Baptisme; in the same proportion in which we retain, or return to that, in the same we are to expect the pardon of our sins, and all the other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Evangelicall; but no otherwise; unlesse we can shew a new Gospel, or be baptized again by Gods appointment. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that by a long habit, by a state and continued course of sin, hath gone so far from his baptismal purity, as that he hath nothing of the Christian left upon him but his name; that man hath much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to do to make his garments clean, to purifie his soul, to take off all the stains of sin, that his spirit may be presented pure to the eyes of God who beholds no impurity. It is not an easie thing to cure a long contracted habit of sin: Let any intemperate person but try in his own instance of drunkennesse; or the swearer in the sweetning his unwholesome language: but then so to command his tongue that he never swear, but that his speech be prudent, pious and apt to edific the hearer, or in some sense to glorifie God; or to become temperate, to have got a habit of sobriety, or chastity, or humility, is the work of a life: And if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that he that lives well from his younger yeers, or takes up at the end of his youthfull heats, and enters into the courses of a sober life early, diligently, and vigorously, shall finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self after the studies and labours of 20. or 30. yeers, piety, but a very imperfect person: many degrees of pride left unrooted up,

                  <p>First, That repentance is not onely an abolition, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body of sin, a bringing it to the altar, and slaying it before God and all the people; but that we must also <gap reason="foreign">

Faith is a sacrifice of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God: Repentance sacrifices the whole will: That, gives the knowing; this, gives up all the desiring faculties: That makes us Disciples; this, makes us servants of the Holy Jesus.

                  <p>Neither is the duty of <hi>Repentance</hi> to be bought at an easier rate in the New Testament. You may see it described in the 2 Cor. 7. 11. <hi>Godly sorrow worketh repentance.</hi> Well? but what is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> repentance which is so wrought? This it is. <q>Behold the self same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulnesse it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your selves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, ye what vehement desire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge.</q> These are the fruits of that sorrow that is effectual: these are the parts of repentance; <hi>clearing our selves</hi> of all that is past, and great <hi>carefulnesse</hi> for the future, <hi>anger</hi> at our selves for our old sins, and <hi>fear</hi> lest we commit the like again, <hi>vehement desires</hi> of pleasing God, and <hi>zeal</hi> of holy actions, and <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> upon our selves for our sins, called by Saint Paul in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> place, <hi>a judging our selves lest we be judged of the Lord.</hi> And <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note> in pursuance of this truth, the primitive Church did not admit a sinning person to the publike communions with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, till besides their sorrow they had spent some years in an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, saith Hierocles. He that never repents till a violent fear be upon him, till he apprehend himself to be in the jawes of death, ready to give up his unready and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50231:214"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> accounts, till he sees the Judge sitting in all the addresses of dreadfulnesse and Majesty, just now (as he beleeves) ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that fearfull and intolerable sentence of [Go ye cursed into everlasting fire] this man does nothing for the love of God, nothing for the love of vertue; It is just as a condemned man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents that he was a Traytor, but repented not till he was arrested, and sure to die. Such a repentance as this may still consist with as great an affection to sin as ever he had; and it is no thanks to him, if when the knife is at his throat, then he gives good words and flatters. But suppose this man in his health, and the middest of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his lust, it is evident that there are some circumstances of action in which the man would have refused to commit his most pleasing sin. Would not the son of Tarquin have refused to ravish Lucrece if Junius Brutus had been by him? Would the impurest person in the world act his lust in the market place? or drink off an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate goblet if a dagger were placed at his throat? In these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, their fear would make them declare against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent acting their impurities. But does this cure the intemperance of their affections? Let the impure person retire to his closet, and Junius Brutus be ingaged in a far distant war, and the dagger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be taken from the drunkards throat, and the fear of shame, or death, or judgement be taken from them all, and they shall no more resist their temptation, then they could before remove their fear; and you may as well judge the other persons holy, and haters of their sin, as the man upon his death-bed to be penitent; and rather they then he, by how much this mans fear, the fear of death, and of the infinite pains of hell, the fear of a provoked God, and an angry eternall Judge, are far greater then the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of publike shame, or an abused husband, or the poniard of an angry person. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>I shall end this first Consideration, with a plain exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that since repentance is a duty of so great and giant-like bulk; let no man croud it up into so narrow room, as that it be strangled in its birth for want of time and aire to breath in. Let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it not be put off to that time when a man hath scarce time enough to reckon all those particular duties which make up the integrity of its constitution. Will any man hunt the wild boare in his garden, or bait a bull in his closet, will a woman wrap her childe in her handkerchiefe, or a Father send his son to school when he is 50 yeers old? These are undecencies of providence, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contradicts the end; And this is our case. There is no roome for the repentance, no time to act all its essentiall parts; and a childe who hath a great way to go before he be wise, may defer his studies, and hope to become very learned in his old age, and upon his deathbed, as well as a vitious person, may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> think to recover from all his ignorances and prejudicate opinions, from all his false principles and evil customs, from his wicked incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and ungodly habits, from his fondnesses of vice, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of vertue, from his promptnesse to sin, and unwillingnesse to grace, from his spiritual deadnesse and strong sensuality; upon his deathbed (I say) when he hath no naturall strength, and as little spirituall, when he is criminal and impotent, hardned in his vice, and soft in his fears, full of passion, and empty of wisdom, when he is sick and amazed, and timorous and confounded, and impatient, and extremely miserable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now when any of you is tempted to commit a sin, remember, that sin will ruine you unlesse you repent of it. * But this (you say) is no news, and so far from affrighting you from sin, that (God knows) it makes men sin the rather. For therefore they venture to act the present temptation, because they know, if they repent, God will forgive them; and therefore they resolve upon both, to sin now, and to repent hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Against this folly I shall not oppose the consideration of their danger, and that they neither know how long they shall live, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whether they shall die or no in this very act of sinne; though this consideration is very materiall, and if they should die in it, or before it is washed off, they perish; But I consider these things. 1 That he that resolves to sin upon a resolution to repent, by every act of sin, makes himself more uncapable of repenting, by growing more in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50231:215"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> love with sin, by remembring its pleasures, by serving it once more, and losing one degree more of the liberty of our spirit: and if you resolve to sin now, because it is pleasant, how do ye know that your appetite will alter? will it not appear pleasant to you next week, and the next week after that, and so for ever? And still you sin, and still you will repent; that is, you will repent when the sin can please you no longer. For so long as it can please you, so long you are tempted not to repent, as well as now to act the sin. And the longer you lie in it, the more you will love it. So that it is in effect to say; I love my sin now, but I will hereafter hate it; onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I will act it a while longer, and grow more in love with it, and then I will repent, that is, then I will be sure to hate it, when I shal most love it. 2. To repent signifies to be sorrowful, to be ashamed, and to wish it had never been done. And then see the folly of this temptation. I would not sin, but that I hope to repent of it, that is, I would not do this thing but that I hope to be sorrowful for doing it, and I hope to come to shame for it, heartily to be ashamed of my doings, and I hope to be in that condition, that I would give all the world I had never done it; that is, I hope to feel and apprehend an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil infinitely greater then the pleasures of my sin; &amp; are these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fit to move a man to sin? what can affright a man from it, if these invite him to it? it is asifa man should invite one to be a partner of his treason by telling him, if you will joyn with me, you shal have all these effects by it; you shall be hang'd, drawn and quarter'd, and your blood shall be corrupted, and your estate forfeited, and you shall have many other reasons to wish you had never done it: He that should use this Rhetorick in earnest, might well be accounted a mad man: This is to scare a man, not to allure him, and so is the other when we understand it truely. 3. For I consider, He that repents, wishes he had never done that sin. Now I ask, does he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wish so upon reason, or without reason? Surely, if he may when he hath satisfied his lust, ask God pardon, and be admitted upon as easie termes for the time to come as if he had not done the sin, he hath no reason to be sorrowful, or wish he had not done it. For though he hath done it, and pleased himself by enjoying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sin for that season, yet all is well again; and let him onely be carefull now, and there is no hurt done, his pardon is certain. How can any man that understands the reason of his actions and passions wish, that he had never done that sin in which then he had pleasure, and now he feels no worse inconvenience. But he that truely repents, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wishes, and would give all the world he had never done it. Surely then his present condition in respect of his past sin hath some very great evil in it, why else should he be so much troubled? True, and this it is. He that hath committed sins after baptisme, is fallen out of the favour of God, is tied to hard duty for the time to come, to ory vehemently unto God, to call night and day for pardon, to be in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50231:216"/>
great fear and tremblings of heart, lest God should never forgive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him, lest God will never take off his sentence of eternal paines, and in this fear and in some degrees of it he will remain all the dayes of his life, and if he hopes to be quit of that, yet he knowes not how many degrees of Gods anger still hang over his head; how many sad miseries shall afflict, and burne, and purifie him in this world with a sharpnesse so poinant as to divide the marrow from the bones; and for these reasons, a considering man that knows what it is to repent, wishes with his soul, he had never sinned; and therefore grieves in proportion to his former crimes, and present misery and future danger. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, suppose that you can repent when you will, that is, that you can grieve when you will, (though no man can do it, no man can grieve when he please) though he could shed tears when he list, he cannot grieve without a real, or an apprehended infelicity, but, suppose it, and that he can fear when he please, and that he can love when he please, or what he please; that is, suppose a man to be able to say to his palate, though I love sweet meats, yet to morrow I will hate and loath them and believe them bitter and distastful things; suppose (I say) all these impssibilties, yet since, repentance does suppose a man to be in a state of such real misery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that he hath reason to curse the day in which he sinned, is this a fit argument to invite a man, that is in his wits, to sin? to sin in hope of repentance? as if dangers of falling into hell, and fear of the Divine anger, and many degrees of the Divine judgements, and a lasting sorrow, and a perpetual labour, and a never ceasing tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and a troubled conscience and a sorrowful spirit were fit things to be desired or hoped for.</p>
                  <p>The sum is this. He that commits sins shall perish eternally if he never does repent. And if he does repent and yet untimely, he is not the better; and if he does not repent with an intire, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and complete repentance, he is not the better: But if he does, yet repentance is a duty full of fears and sorrow, and labour; a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the spirit an asslictive, paenal, or punitive duty, a duty which suffers for sin, and labours for grace, which abides and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers little images of hell in the way to heaven; and though it be the onely way to felicity, yet it is beset with thorns and daggers of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, and with rocks and mountains of duty. Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dare to sin upon hopes of repentance: for he is a foole and a hypocrite, that now chooses and approves, what he knows here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he must condemn. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

To what purpose are all those Commandements in Scripture, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> every page almost in it, [of <hi>living holily,</hi> and according to the Commandements of God, of <hi>adorning the Gospel of God,</hi> of <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in the day, of walking in light, of pure and undefiled religion,</hi> of <hi>being holy as God is holy,</hi> of <hi>being humble and meek, as Christ is humble,</hi> of <hi>putting on the Lord Jesus,</hi> of <hi>living a spirituall life,]</hi> but that it is the purpose of God, and the intention and designe of Christ dying for us, and the Covenant made with man, that we should expect heaven upon no other termes in the world, but of a holy life, in the faith and obedience of the Lord Jesus.</p>

                  <p>And now it will be a vain question to ask, whether or no God cannot save a dying man that repents after a vitious life? For it is true, God can do it if he please; and he can raise children to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham out of the stones, and he can make ten thousand worlds if he sees good, and he can do what he list, and he can save an ill living man though he never repent at all, so much as upon his death-bed. All this he can do; but Gods power is no ingredient into this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we are never the better that God can do it, unlesse he also will; and whether he will, or no, we are to learn from himself, and what he hath declared to be his will in holy Scripture. Nay since God hath said, that without actuall holinesse no man shall see God, God by his own will hath restrained his power, and though abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely he can do all things, yet he cannot do against his own word. *And indeed the rewards of heaven are so great and glorious, and Christs <hi>burden is so light, his yoke is so easie,</hi> that it is a shamelesse impudence to expect so great glories at a lesse rate then so little a service, at a lower rate then a holy life. It cost the Eternall Son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of God his life blood to obtain heaven for us upon that condition, and who then shall die again for us, to get heaven for us upon easier conditions. What would you do if God should command you to kill your eldest son? or to work in the mines for a thousand yeers together? or to fast all thy life time with bread and water? were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50231:217"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not heaven a great bargain even after all this? and when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing of us but to live soberly, justly, and godly, (which very things of themselves, to man are a very great felicity, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to his present well-being) shall we think this to be a load, and an unsufferable burden? and that heaven is so little a purchase at that price, that God in meer justice will take a death-bed sigh or groan, and a few unprofitable tears and promises in exchange for all our duty? Strange it should be so: but stranger that any man should rely upon such a vanity, when from Gods word he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to warrant such a confidence. But these men do like the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Dionysius, who stole from Apollo his golden cloak, and gave him a cloak of Arcadian home-spun, saying that this was lighter in summer, and warmer in winter. These men sacrilegiously rob God of the service of all their golden dayes, and serve him in their hoary head, in their furs and grave clothes; and pretend that this late service is more agreeable to the Divine mercy on one side, and humane infirmity on the other, and so dispute themselves into an irrecoverable condition, having no other ground to rely upon a death-bed, or late-begun-repentance, but because they resolve to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> enjoy the pleasures of sin, and for heaven, they will put that to the venture of an after-game. These men <hi>sow in the flesh,</hi> and would <hi>reap in the spirit,</hi> live to the Devil, and die to God, and therefore it is but just in God that their hopes should be desperate, and their craft be folly, and their condition be, the unexpected, unfeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of an eternall sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Lastly. Our last inquiry is into the time, the last or latest time of beginning our repentance. Must a man repent a yeer, or two, <note place="margin">3.</note> or seven yeers, or ten, or twenty before his death? or what is the last period after which all repentance will be untimely and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> To this captious question I have many things to oppose. 1. We have entred into covenant with God, to serve him from the day of our Baptisme to the day of our death. <q>He hath <hi>[sworn</hi>

                     </q> These things speak and exhort,] saith Saint Paul. But more plainly yet, in S. Peter <hi>[Christ bare our sins in his own body on the tree.]</hi> To what <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 24.</note> end? <hi>[that we being dead unto sin should live unto righteousnesse.]</hi> since therefore our living a holy life is the end of Christs dying that sad and holy death for us, he that trusts on it to evil purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and to excuse his vicious life, does (as much as lies in him) make void the very purpose and designe of Christs passion, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours the blood of the everlasting covenant: which covenant was confirmed by the blood of Christ: but as it brought peace from God, so it requires a holy life from us.</p>
                  <p>But why may not we be saved as well as the thief upon the crosse? even because our case is nothing alike. When Christ dies <note place="margin">See! se of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Disc. of Repentance. part 2.</note> once more for us, we may look for such another instance; not till then. But this thiefe did but then come to Christ; he knew him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and his case was as if a Turk or heathen should be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to Christianity, and be baptized, and enter newly into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant upon his deathbed. Then God pardons all his sins; and so God does to Christians when they are baptized, or first give up their names to Christ by a voluntarie confirmation of their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal vow: but when they have once entred into the Covenant, they must performe what they promise, and to what they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged. The thief had made no contract with God in Jesus Christ, and therefore failed of none; onely the defaillances of the state of ignorance Christ paid for at the thiefes admission. But we that have made a covenant with God in baptisme, and failed of it all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dayes, and then returne at night, when we cannot work; have nothing to plead for our selves, because we have made all that to be uselesse to us which God with so much mercy and miraculous wisdom, gave us to secure our interest, and hopes of heaven.</p>
                  <p>And therefore let no Christian man who hath covenanted with God to give him the service of his life, think that God will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with the sighs and prayers of a dying man; for all that great obligation which lies upon us cannot be transacted in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, when we have loaded our souls with sin, and made them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty of vertue; we cannot so soon grow up to <hi>a perfect man in Christ</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Olly and subtiltie divide the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and there is no other difference but this, that some are crafty enough to deceive; Others foolish enough to be cozened and abused: And yet the scales also turn, for they that are the most craftie to cozen others, are the veriest Fools and most of all abused themselves. They rob their neighbour of his mony, and loose their own innocency; they disturb his rest, and vex their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> own Conscience; they throw him into prison, and themselves into Hell; they make poverty to be their brothers portion, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be their own. Man entred into the world first alone; but as soon as he met with one companion, he met with three to cozen him; The Serpent, and Eve, and himself, all joyned; first to make him a foole, and to deceive him, and then to make him miserable.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50231:220"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But he first cozened himself, giving himself up to believe a lie, and being desirous to listen to the whispers of a tempting spirit, he sinned, before he fell, that is, he had within him a false understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a depraved will, and these were the Parents of his disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and this was the parent of his infelicity, and a great occasion of ours. And then it was that he entred for himself and his posterity into the condition of an ignorant, credulous, easie, wilful, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and impotent person; apt to be abused, and so loving to have it so, that if no body else will abuse him, he will be sure to abuse himself, by ignorance and evil principles, being open to an enemy, and by wilfulnesse and Sensuality, doing to himself the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> injuries in the whole world. So that the condition of Man, in the rudenesses and first lines of its visage, seemes very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, deformed, and accursed.</p>
                  <p>For a man is helplesse and vain; of a condition so exposed to cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that a raisin is able to kill him; any trooper out of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian army, a flie can do it, when it goes on Gods errand; the most contemptible accident can destroy him, the smallest chance affright him, every future contingency, when but considered as possible, can amaze him; and he is incompass'd with potent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enemies, subtle and implacable: what shall this poor help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thing do? trust in God? Him he hath offended, and he fears him as an enemy; and God knows, if we look onely on our selves, and our own demerits, we have to much reason so to doe. Shall he rely upon Princes? God help poor Kings: they rely upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they fight with their swords, levy forces with their money, consult with their Counsels, hear with their ears, and are strong onely in their union, and many times they use all these things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; but however, they can do nothing without them while they live and yet if ever they can die, they are not to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. Now Kings and Princes die so sadly and not criously; that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was used for a proverbe in holy scripture, <hi>ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.</hi> Who then shall we trust in? in our Friend? Poorman! he may help thee in one thing, and need thee in ten; he may pull thee out of the ditch, and his foot may slip and fal into it himself; he gives thee counsel to choose a wife, and himself is to seek how prudently to choose his religion; he counsels thee to abstain from a duel, and yet slayes his own soul with drinking, like a person void of all understanding he is willing enough to preserve thy interest, and is very carelesse of his own: for he does highly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> despise to betray or to be false to thee, and in the mean time is not his own friend, and is false to God, and then his friendship may be useful to thee in some circumstances of fortune; but no security to thy condition. But what then? shall we relie upon our patron, like the Roman Clients, who waited hourly upon their persons, and daily upon their baskets, and nightly upon their lusts, and married
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50231:221"/>
their friendships, and contracted also their hatred and quarrels; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> This is a confidence will deceive us. For they may lay us by, justly or unjustly, they may grow weary of doing benefits, or their fortunes may change or they may be charitable in their gifts and burthensom in their offices; able to feed you, but unable to counsel you; or your need may be longer then their kindnesses, or such in which they can give you no assistance; and indeed generally it is so in all the instances of men: we have a friend that is wise; but I need not his counsel, but his meat; or my patron is bountiful in his largesses, but I am troubled with a sad spirit; and money and presents do me no more ease, then perfumes do to a broken arme: we seek life of a Physician that dies, and go to him for health, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> who cannot cure his own breath, or gowt; and so become vain in our imaginations, abused in our hopes, restlesse in our passions, impatient in our calamity, unsupported in our need, exposed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, wandring and wilde, without counsel and without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. At last after the infatuating and deceiving all our confidences without, we have nothing left us, but to return home, and dwell within our selves: for we have a sufficient stock of self-love, that we may be confident of our own affections, we may trust our selves surely; for what we want in skill, we shall make up in diligence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and our industry shall supply the want of other circumstances: and no man vnderstands my own case so well as I do my self, and no man will judge so faithfully as I shall do for my self; for I am most concern'd not to abuse my self; and if I do, I shall be the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and therefore may best rely upon my self Alas! and God help us! we shall finde it to be no such matter: For we neither love our selves well, nor understand our own case, we are partial in our own questions, deceived in our sentences, carelesse of our interests, and the most false, perfidious creatures to our selves in the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> world: even the <hi>Heart of a man</hi> a mans own heart <hi>is deceitful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> And who can choose but know it?</p>
                  <p>And there is no greater argument of the deceitfulnesse of our Hearts, then this, that no man can know it all; it cosens us in the very number of its cosenage: But yet we can reduce it all to two heads. We say concerning a false man, trust him not for he will deceive you, and we say concerning a weak and broken staffe, lean not upon it, for that will also deceive you. The man deceives because he is false, and the staffe because it is weak, and the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> because it is both. So that it is deceitful above all things, that is, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and disabled to support us in many things; but in other things where it can, it is false and desperately wicked. The first sort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse is its calamitie, and the second is its iniquity, and that is the worst Calamitie of the two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The heart is deceitfull in its strength; and when we have the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50231:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> groweth of a Man, we have the weaknesses of a childe: nay more yet, and it is a sad consideration, the more we are in age, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in our courage. It appears in the heats and forwardnesses of new converts, which are like to the great emissions of Lightning, or like huge fires, which flame and burn without measure, even all that they can; till from flames they descend to still fires, from thence to smoak, from smoak to embers, from thence to ashes; cold and pale, like ghosts, or the phantastick images of Death. And the primitive Church were zealous in their Religion up to the degree of Cherubins, and would run as greedily to the sword of the hangman, to die for the cause of God, as we do now to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> joy and entertainment of a Christian spirit, even to the receiving of the holy Sacrament. A man would think it reasonable that the first infancy of Christianity should, according to the nature of first beginnings, have been remisse, gentle, and unactive, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording us the object or evidence of faith grew, which in every Age hath a great degree of Argument superadded to its confirmation; so should the habit also and the grace, the longer it lasts &amp; the more obiections it runs through, it still should shew a brighter and more certain light to discover the divinity of its principle; and that after the more examples, and new accidents and strangenesses of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and daily experience, and the multitude of miracles, still the Christian should grow more certain in his faith, more refreshed in his hope, and warm in his charity; the very nature of these graces increasing and swelling upon the very nourishment of experience, and the multiplication of their own acts. And yet because the heart of man is false, it suffers the fires of the Altar to go out, and the flames lessen by the multitude of fuel. But indeed it is because we put on strange fire, &amp; put out the fire upon our hearths by letting in a glaring Sun beam, the fire of lust; or the heates of an angry spirit, to quench the fires of God, and suppresse the sweet cloud of incense. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The heart of man hath not strength enough to think one good thought of itself, it cannot command its own attention to a prayer of ten lines long; but before its end it shall wander after some thing that is to no purpose: and no wonder then that it grows wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a holy religion, which consists of so many parts as make the businesse of a whole life. And there is no greater argument in the world of our spiritual weaknesse and falsnesse of our hearts in the matters of religion, then the backwardnesse which most men have alwayes, and all men have somtimes to say their prayers: so weary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of their length, so glad when they are done, so wittie to excuse and frustrate an opportunity; and yet there is no manner of trouble in the duty, no wearinesse of bones, no violent labours; nothing but begging a blessing, and receiving it; nothing but doing our selves the greatest honour of speaking to the greatest person, and greatest king of the world; and that we should be unwilling to do this, so
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50231:222"/>
unable to continue in it, so backward to return to it; so without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> gust and relish in the doing it, can have no visible reason in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, but something within us, a strange sicknesse in the heart, a spiritual nauseating or loathing of Manna, something that hath no name, but we are sure it comes from a weake, a faint, and false heart.</p>
                  <p>And yet this weak heart is strong in passions, violent in desires, unresistable in its appetites, impatient in its lust, furious in anger; here are strengths enough, one would think: But so have I seen a man in a feaver, sick and distempered, unable to walk, lesse able to speak sence, or to do an act of counsel; and yet when his feaver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath boild up to a delirium, he was strong enough to beat his nurse keeper and his doctor too; and to resist the loving violence of all his friends, who would faine binde him down to reason and his bed: And yet we still say he is weak and sick to death. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for these strengths of madnesse are not health, but furiousnesse and disease; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <note place="margin">Arriart.</note> It is weaknesse another way; And so are the strengths of a mans heart; they are fetters and manacles; strong, but they are the cordage of imprisonment, so strong, that the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is not able to stir. And yet it cannot but be a huge sadnesse, that the heart shall pursue a temporal interest with wit and diligence, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied industry, and shall not have strength enough in a matter that concerns its Eternal interest to answer one obiection, to resist one assault, to defeate one art of the divel; but shall certainly and infallibly fall when ever it is tempted to a pleasure.</p>
                  <p>This, if it be examined, will prove to be a deceit indeed, a pretence, rather then true upon a just cause, that is, it is not a natural, but a moral &amp; a vicious weaknesse; and we may try it in one or two familiar instances. One of the great strengths, shall I call it? or weaknesses of the heart is, that it is strong, violent and passionate in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> its lusts, and weak and deceitful to resist any. Tell the tempted person, that if he act his lust, he dishonours his body, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a servant to follie, and one flesh with a harlot, he defiles the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and him that defiles a Temple will God destroy: Tell him that the Angels who love to be present in the nastinesse and filth of prisons, that they may comfort and assist chast souls, and holy persons there abiding yet they are impatient to behold or come neer the filthynesse of a lustful person: Tell him, that this sin is so ugly, that the divels, who are spirits, yet they delight to counterfeit the acting of this crime, and descend unto the daughters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or sons of men, that they may rather lose their natures, then not help to set a lust forward: Tell them these and ten thousand things more; you move them no more, then if you should read one of Tullies orations to a mule; for the truth is, they have no power to resist it, much lesse to master it, their heart fails them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50231:222"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when they meet their Mistresse; and they are driven like a fool to the stocks, or a Bull to the slaughter-house: And yet their heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them; not because it cannot resist the temptation, but because it will not go about it: For it is certain, the heart can, if it list: For let a Boy enter into your chamber of pleasure, and discover your folly, either your lust disbands, or your shame hides it; you will not, you care not do it before a stranger Boy; and yet that you dare do it before the eyes of the All-seeing God, is impudence and folly, and a great conviction of the vanity of your pretence, and the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your heart. If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thou beest a man given to thy appetite, and thou lovest a pleasant morsell as thy life, do not declame against the precepts of Temperance, as impossible: Try this once; abstain from that draught, or that dish. I cannot. No? Give this man a great blow on the face, or tempt him with twenty pound, and he shall fast from morning till night, and then feast himself with your money, and plain wholesome meat. And if <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> be so easie, that a man may be brought to either of them with so ready and easie instruments; Let us not suffer our hearts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us by the weaknesse of its pretences, and the strength of its <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> desires: For we do more for a Boy, then for God; and for 20. pound, then Heaven it self.</p>
                  <p>But thus it is in every thing else; take an Hereticke, a Rebel, a person that hath an ill cause to mannage; what he wants in the strength of his reason, he shall make it up with diligence; and a person that hath Right on his side is cold, indiligent, lazie, and unactive, trusting that the goodnesse of his Cause will do it alone; But so, wrong prevails, while evil persons are zealous in a Bad matter, and others are remisse in a Good; And the same person shall be very industrious alwayes when he hath least reason so to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be. Thats the first particular. The heart is deceitfull in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of its naturall strengths; it is Naturally and Physically strong, but Morally weak, and impotent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Heart of man is deceitfull in making judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its own Acts. It does not know when it is pleased, or displeased, it is peevish and trifling, it would and it would not, and it is in many Cases impossible to know whether a mans heart desires such a thing or not. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath an odde saying, <hi>Facilius inveneris innocentem, quam qui poenitentiani digne egerit,</hi> It is easier to finde a man that hath lived innocently, then one that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath truly repented him, with a grief and care great according to the merit of his sins. Now suppose a man that hath spent his younger yeers in vanity and folly, and is by the grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of it, and thinks of returning to sober counsels, this man will finde his heart so false, so subtil and fugitive, so secret and undiscernable, that it will be very hard to discerne, whether he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or no. For if he considers that he hates sin, and therefore
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50231:223"/>
repents; Alas! he so hates it, that he dares not, if he be wise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tempt himself with an opportunity to act it: for in the midst of that which he calls hatred, he hath so much love left for it, that if the sin comes again and speaks him fair, he is lost again, he kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the fire, and dies in its embraces. And why else should it be necessary for us to pray, that <hi>we be not lead into temptation?</hi> but because we hate the sin, and yet love it too well; we curse it, and yet follow it; we are angry at our selves, and yet cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; we know it undoes us, but we think it pleasant; And when we are to execute the fierce anger of the Lord upon our sins, yet we are kinde-hearted, and spare the <hi>Agag,</hi> the reigning sin, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> splendid temptation, we have some kindnesses left towards it.</p>
                  <p>These are but ill signes. How then shall I know by some infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible token, that I am a true Penitent? What and if I weep for my sins? will you not then give me leave to conclude my heart right with God, and at enmity with sin? It may be so. But there are some friends that weep at parting; and is not thy weeping a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of affection? It is a sad thing to part with our long companion. Or it may be thou weepest, because thou wouldest have a signe to cozen thy self withall; for some men are more desirous to have a signe, then the thing signified; they would do something to shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their Repentance, that themselves may beleeve themselves to be Penitents, having no reason from within to beleeve so. And I have seen some persons weep heartily for the losse of six pence, or for the breaking of a glasse, or at some trifling accident; and they that do so cannot pretend to have their tears valued at a bigger rate then they will confesse their passion to be when they weep, and are vexed for the durting of their linnen, or some such trifle, for which the least passion is too big an expence. So that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell his own heart by his tears, or the truth of his repentance by those short gusts of sorrow. How then? Shall we suppose a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> man to pray against his sin? So did Saint Austin, when in his youth he was tempted to lust and uncleannesse, he prayed against it, and secretly desired that God would not hear him: for here the heart is cunning to deceive it self. For no man did ever heartily pray against his sin in the midst of a temptation to it, if he did in any sence or degree listen to the temptation: For to pray against a sin, is to have desires contrary to it, and that cannot consist with any love, or any kindnesse to it. We pray against it, and yet do it, and then pray again, and do it again; and we desire it, and yet pray against the desires, and thats almost a contradiction: Now because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no man can be supposed to will against his own will, or choose against his own desires; it is plain that we cannot know whether we mean what we say, when we pray against sin, but by the event; If we never act it, never entertain it, alwayes resist it, ever fight against it; and finally do prevail; then at length we may judge our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50231:223"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> own heart to have meant honestly in that one particular.</p>
                  <p>Nay our heart is so deceitfull in this matter of Repentance, that the Masters of spirituall life are fain to invent suppletory Arts and stratagems to secure the duty. And we are advised to mourn, because we do not mourn, to be sorrowfull because we are not sorrowfull. Now if we be sorrowfull in the first stage, how happens it that we know it not? Is our heart so secret to our selves? But if we be not sorrowfull in the first period, how shall we be so, or know it in the second period? For we may as well doubt concerning the sincerity of the second or reflex act of sorrow, as of the first and direct action. And therefore we may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> also as well be sorrowfull the third time, for want of the just measure, or hearty meaning of the second sorrow, as be sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the second time for want of true sorrow at the first; and so on to infinite. And we shall never be secure in this Artifice, if we be not certain of our naturall and hearty passion in our direct and first apprehensions.</p>
                  <p>Thus many persons think themselves in a good estate, and make no question of their salvation, being confident onely because they are confident; and they are so, because they are bidden to be so; and yet they are not confident at all, but extreamly timerous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fearfull. How many persons are there in the world, that say they are sure of their salvation, and yet they dare not die? And if any man pretends, that he is now sure he shall be saved, and that he cannot fall away from grace; there is no better way to confute him, then by advising him to send for the Surgeon, and bleed to death. For what should hinder him? not the sin: for it cannot take him from Gods favour: not the change of his condition: for he sayes he is sure to go to a Better: why does he not then say <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, like the Romane gallants when they decreed to die. The reason is plainly this. They say they are confident, and yet are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> timerous; they professe to beleeve that Doctrine, and yet dare not trust it: nay they think they beleeve, but they do not; so false is a mans heart; so deceived in its own Acts, so great a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to its own sentence and opinions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The heart is deceitfull in its own resolutions and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for many times men make their resolutions onely in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, not in their wills; they resolve it sitting to be done, not decree that they will do it; And instead of beginning to be reconciled to God, by the renewed and hearty purposes of holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> living, they are advanced so far onely, as to be convinced, and apt to be condemned by their own sentence.</p>
                  <p>But suppose our resolutions advanced further, and that our Will and Choices also are determined; see how our hearts deceive us. 1. We resolve against those sins that please us not, or where temptation is not present, and think by an over-acted zeal against
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50231:224"/>
some sins to get an indulgence for some others. There are some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> persons who will be Drunk; The Company, or the discourse, or the pleasure of madnesse, or an easie nature, and a thirsty soul; something is amisse, that cannot be helped; But they will make amends, and the next day pray twice as much. Or it may be they must satisfie a beastly lust; but they will not be drunk for all the world; and hope by their Temperance to Commute for their want of Chastity: But they attend not the eraft of their secret enemy, <hi>their Heart:</hi> for it is not love of the vertue; if it were, they would love Vertue in all its Instances; for Chastity is as much a vertue as Temperance, and God hates Lust as much as he hates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Drunkennesse. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Virtutem unam si vnise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris etsi amiui non potest vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, sed si unam confessus sueris te non habere, nullam te esse habiturum] an nescis?</hi> Cicer.</note> But this sin is against my health, or it may be it is against my lust, it makes me impotent, and yet impatient, full of desire, and empty of strength. Or else I do an act of Prayer, lest my conscience become unquiet, while it is not satisfied or cozened with some intervals of Religion: I shall think my self a damned wretch, if I do nothing for my soul; but if I do, I shall call the one sin that remains nothing but my Infirmity; and therefore it is my excuse; and my Prayer is not my Religion, but my Peace, and my Pretence, and my Fallacy. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We resolve against our sin, that is, we will not act it in those circumstances as formerly; I will not be drunk in the streets; but I may sleep till I be recovered, and then come forth sober; or if I be overtaken, it shall be in Civill and Gentile company; Or it may be not so much; I will leave my intemperance and my Lust too, but I will remember it with pleasure, I will revolve the past action in my minde, and entertain my fancy with a moros delectation in it, and by a fiction of imagination will represent it present, and so be satisfied with a little effeminacy, or phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick pleasure. Beloved, suffer not your hearts so to cozen you, as if any man can be faithfull in much, that is faithlesse in a little. He certainly is very much in love with sin, and parts with it very unwillingly, that keeps its Picture, and wears its Favour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the fancy of it, even with the same desire, as a most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate widow parts with her dearest husband, even when she can no longer enjoy him: But certainly her staring all day upon his picture, and weeping over his Robe, and wringing her hands over his children, are no great signes that she hated him: And just so do most men hate, and accordingly part with their sins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We resolve against it when the opportunity is slipped, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> lay it aside as long as the temptation please, even till it come again, and no longer. How many men are there in the world, that against every Communion renew their vowes of holy living? Men, that for twenty, for thirty yeers together, have been perpetually resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving against what they daily Act; and sure enough they did beleeve themselves: And yet if a man had daily promised us a curtesie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50231:224"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and failed us but ten times, when it was in his power to have done it, we should think, we had reason never to beleeve him more: And can we then reasonably beleeve the resolutions of our hearts, which they have falsified so many hundred times? We resolve against a religious Time, because then it is the Custome of men, and the Guise of the Religion; Or we resolve when we are in a great danger, and then we promise any thing, possible or impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, likely or unlikely, all is one to us, we onely care to remove the present pressure, and when that is over, and our fear is gone, and no love remaining, our condition being returned to our first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> securities, our resolutions also revert to their first indifferencies: Or else we cannot look a temptation in the face, and we resolve against it, hoping never to be troubled with its arguments and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. <hi>Epictetus</hi> tells us of a Gentleman returning from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, in his journey towards home called at his house, told a sad story of an Imprudent life, the greatest part of which being now spent, he was resolved for the future to live Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and entertain no businesse, to be candidate for no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to go to the Court, not to salute Caesar with ambitious attendancies, but to study, and worship the gods, and die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, when nature, or necessity called him. It may be this man beleeved himself, but <hi>Epictetus</hi> did not. And he had reason. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Letters from Caesar met him at the doors, and invited him to Court, and he forgot all his promises, which were warm upon his lips, and grew pompous, secular, and ambitious, and gave the gods thanks for his preferment. Thus many men leave the world, when their fortune hath left them, and they are severe and philosophicall, and retired for ever, if for ever it be impossible to return: But let a prosperous Sunshine warm and refresh their sadnesses, and make it but possible to break <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their purposes, and there needs no more temptation; Their own false heart is enough; they are like Ephraim in the day of Battell, starting a side like a broken Bow.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The heart is false, deceiving and deceived in its intensions and designes. A man hears the precepts of God injoyning us to give Alms of all we possesse; he readily obeys with much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and alacrity; And his charity, like a fair spreading tree, looks beauteously: But there is a Canker at the heart; The man blowes a Trumpet to call the poor together, and hopes the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood will take notice of his Bounty. Nay he gives Alms pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and charges no man to speak of it, and yet hopes by some Accident or other to be praised both for his Charity and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And if by chance, the Fame of his Alms comes abroad, it is but his duty to let his light so shine before men, that God may bè glorified, and some of our neighbours be relieved, and others edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But then to distinguish the intention of our heart in this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50231:225"/>
Instance, and to seek Gods glory in a particular, which will also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> conduce much to our reputation, and to have no filthy adherence to stick to the heart, no reflexion upon our selves, or no compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and delight in popular noyses, is the nicity of abstraction, and requires an Angel to do it. Some then are so kind-hearted, so true to their friend, that they will watch his very dying groans, and receive his last breath, and close his eyes; And if this be done with honest intention, it is well: But there are some that do so; and yet are vultures and harpyes, they watch for the Carcasse, and prey upon a Legacy. A man with a true story may be malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his enemy, and by doing himself right, may also do him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wrong: And so false is the heart of man, so clancular and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory are its Actions and Intentions, that some men pursue vertue with great earnestnesse, and yet cannot with patience look upon it in another: It is Beauty in Themselves, and Deformity in the Other. Is it not plain, that not the Vertue, but its Reputation is the thing that is pursued? And yet if you tell the man so, he thinks he hath reason to complain of your malice or detraction. Who is able to distinguish his fear of God from fear of punishment? when from fear of punishment we are brought to fear God: And yet the difference must be distinguishable in new Converts &amp; old Disciples; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And our fear of punishment must so often change its Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it must be at last a fear to offend out of pure Love, and must have no formality left to distinguish it from Charity: It is easie to distinguish these things in Precepts, and to make the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Schooles: The Head can do it easily, and the Tongue can do it: But when the Heart comes to separate Alms from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Gods glory from Humane praise, fear from fear, and sincerity from Hypocrisie; it does so intricate the questions and confound the ends, and blend and entangle circumstances, that a man hath reason to doubt, that his very best Actions are sullied with some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> excrescencie something to mak them very often to be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, but alwayes to be imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Here a man would think were enough to abate our confidence and the spirit of pride, and to make a man eternally to stand upon his guard, and to keep as strict watch upon his own heart, as upon his greatest enemy from without. <hi>Custodi, libera we de meipso, Deus.</hi> It was S. Augustines prayer, Lord keep me, Lord deliver me from my self. If God will keep a man, that he be not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> that he lay no violent hands upon himself, it is certain nothing else can do him mischief, <gap reason="foreign">

The Devil can but Tempt, and offer a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the heart; unlesse our hands thrust it home, the Devil can do nothing, but what may turne to our advantage. And in this sence we are to understand the two seeming Contradictories in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50231:225"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Scripture, <hi>Pray that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> said our Blessed Saviour, and <hi>count it all joy when you enter into divers Temptations,</hi> said one of Christs Disciples: The case is easie.

                     </gap> he means it but as a trial of our faith, as the exercise of our vertues, as the opportunity of reward, and in such cases we have reason to count it all joy; since the <hi>Trial of our faith worketh Patience and Patience experience, and experience causeth hope, and hope maketh not ashamed:</hi> But yet for all this, <hi>pray against temptations:</hi> for when we get them into our hands, we use them as blind men do their clubs, neither distinguish person nor part; as soone they strike the face of their friends as the back of the Enemie; our hearts betray us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the enemie, we fall in love with our mischief, we contrive how to let the lust in, and leave a port open on purpose, and use arts to forget our duty, and to give advantages to the Divel.

A man does not begin to know him self till he be old, and then he is well stricken in death: A mans heart at first being like a plain table, unspotted indeed, but then there is nothing legible in it. As soon as ever we ripen towards the imperfect uses of our reason, we write upon this table such crooked characters, such imperfect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> configurations, so many fooleries; and stain it with so many blots, and vitious inspersions, that there is nothing worth the reading in our hearts for a great while; and when education and ripenesse, reason and experience, Christian philosophy and the grace of God hath made fair impressions and written the law in our hearts with the finger of Gods holy spirit, we blot out this handwriting of Gods ordinances, or mingle it with false principles, and interlinings of our our own; we disorder the method of God, or deface the truth of God; either we make the rule uneven we bribe or abuse our guide, that we may wonder with an excuse.

                  <p n="1">1. Our hearts are blinde, wilfully blind. I need not instance in <note place="margin">1.</note> the ignorance and involuntary nescience of men, though if we speak of the necessary parts of religion, no man is ignorant of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own fault: such ignorance is alwayes a direct sin, or the direct punishment of a sin.

This hath God done for us; and see what we do for Him. We stand in our own light, and quench Gods: we love darknesse more then light, and entertain our selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> accordingly. For how many of us are there, that understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the wayes of God; that know no more of the laws of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, then is remaining upon them since they learned the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Catechisme? But amongst a thousand how many can expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and unfold for his own practise the ten Commandments; And how many sorts of sins are there forbidden? which therefore passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action and never passe under the scrutinies of repentance; because they know not that they are sinnes?

And yet these are duties set down plainly for our practise, necessary to be acted in order to our Salvation. We brag of light, and reformation, and fulnesse of the spirit: in the mean time we understand not many parts of our dutie.

For, if we did not wink hard we must needs see, that obedience to supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Denying of our selves, Humility, Peacefulnesse and Charity, are written in such Capital text letters, that it is impossible to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them. And if the heart of man had not rare arts to abuse the understanding, it were not to be imagined that any man should

Chapter to the Romans to prove the lawfulnesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> taking up Armes against our rulers: but so we may abuse our selves at noon and go to bed, if we please to call it midnight. And there have been a sort of wittie men that maintained that snow was hot: I wonder not at the probleme; but that a man should beleeve his paradox, and should let eternity go away with the fallacie, and rather lose heaven then leave his foolish argument, is a signe that wilfulnesse and the deceiving heart is the Sophister, and the great ingredient into our Deception.</p>

And yet our heart is so impatient of seeing its own staines, that like the Elephant, it tramples in the pure streames, and first troubles them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then stoops and drinks, when he can least see his huge defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>

And then we are zealous for the Lord God of Hosts, and will live and die in that quarrel. But is it not a strange cozenage, that our hearts shall be the main wheel in the engine, and shall set all the rest on working? The heart shall first put his own candle out, then put out the eye of reason; then remove the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and dig down the causeywayes, and then either hire a blinde guide, or make him so; and all these Arts to get ignorance, that they may secure impiety. At first, man lost his innocence onely in hope to get a little knowledge; and ever since then lest knowledge should discover his errour, and make him returne to innocence, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are content to part with that now, and to kow nothing that may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or discountenance our sins, or discompose our secular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe. And as God made great revelations and furnished out a wise Religion, and sent his spirit to give the gift of Faith to his Church, that upon the foundation of Faith he might build a holy life; now our hearts love to retire into Blindnesse, &amp; sneak under the covert of False principles, and run to a cheape religion, and an unactive disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and make a faith of our own, that we may build upon it ease and ambition and a tall fortune, and the pleasures of revenge, and do what we have a minde to; scarce once in seven years denying a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> strong and an unruly appetite upon the interest of a just conscience and holy religion. This is such a desperate method of impiety; so certain arts and apt instruments for the Divel, that it does his work intirley, and produces an infallible damnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the heart of man hath yet another stratagem to secure its iniquity by the means of ignorance; and that is, Incogitancy or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration. For there is wrought upon the spirits of many men great impression by education, by a modest and temperate nature, by humane Laws, and the customes &amp; severities of sober persons, and the fears of religion, and the awfulnesse of a reverend man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the several arguments and endearments of vertue: And it is not in the nature of some men to do an act in despite of reason, and Religion, and arguments, and Reverence, and modesty, and fear; But men are forced from their sin by the violence of the grace of God, when they heare it speak. But so a Roman Gentleman kept off a whole band of souldiers, who were sent to murther him; and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50231:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his eloquence was stronger then their anger and designe: But sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a rude trooper rushed upon him, who neither had, nor would heare him speak; and he thrust his spear into that throat, whose musick had charmed all his fellows into peace and gentlenesse. So do we. The Grace of God is Armour and defence enough against the most violent incursion of the spirits, and the works of darknesse, but then we must hear its excellent charms, and consider its reasons, and remember its precepts, and dwell with its discourses. But this the heart of man loves not. If I be tempted to uncleannesse, or to an act of oppression, instantly the grace of God represents to me, that the pleasure of the sin is transient, and vain, unsatisfying and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> empty; That I shall die, and then I shall wish too late, that I had never done it. It tells me that I displease God who made me, who feeds me, who blesses me, who fain would save me. It represents to me all the joyes of Heaven, and the horrours and amazements of a sad eternity And if I will stay and heare them, ten thousand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things besides, fit to be twisted about my understanding for ever. But here the heart of man shuffles all these discourses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to disorder; and will not be put to the trouble of answering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; but by a meer wildenesse of purpose and rudnesse of resolution ventures <hi>super totam materiam,</hi> at all, and does the thing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not because it thinks it fit to do so, but because it will not consider whether it be or no: it is enough that it pleases a present appetite, and if such incogitancy comes to be habitual, as it is in very many men; (first by resisting the motions of the holy spirit, then by quenching him,) we shall find the consequents to be, first an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie,</hi> then <hi>a dulnesse,</hi> then <hi>a Lethargie,</hi> then a direct <hi>Hating</hi> the wayes of God; and it commonly ends in a <hi>wretchlessenesse of spirit</hi> to be manifested on our death-bed; when the man shall passe hence not <hi>like the shadow,</hi> but like the dog, <hi>that departeth,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sence or interest, or apprehension, or real concernment in the considerations of eternity: and tis but just, <hi>when we will not heare our king speak and plead,</hi> not to save himself, but us, to speak for our peace, and innocency and Salvation, to prevent our ruine, and our intolerable calamity: certainly we are much in love with the wages of death, when we cannot endure to heare God cal us back; and stop our ears against the voice of the charmer, charme he never so wisely.</p>
                  <p>Nay further yet; we suffer the Arguments of Religion to have so little impression upon our spirits, that they operate but like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the discourses of childhood, or the Problems of uncertain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy: A man talks of Religion but as of a dream, and from thence he awakens into the Businesses of the world, and acts them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, with perfect Action and full Resolution, and contrives, and considers, and lives in them: But when he falls asleep again, or is taken from the Scene of his own employment and choice;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50231:228"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then he dreams again, and Religion makes such Impressions as is the conversation of a Dreamer, and he acts accordingly. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> tells of a Fisherman that dreamed he had taken <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Fish of gold, upon which being over-joyed he made a vow, that he would never fish more: But when he waked, he soon declared his vow to be null, because he found his golden Fish was scaped away through the holes of his eyes, when he first opened them. Just so we do in the purposes of Religion; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a good mood we seem to see Heaven opened, and all the streets of Heavenly Jerusalem paved with gold and precious stones, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and we are ravished with spirituall apprehensions, and resolve never to return to the low affections of the world, and the impure adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies of sin, but when this flash of lightning is gone, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse again with the Inclinations, and habituall desires of our false hearts, those other desires and fine considerations disband, and the Resolutions taken in that pious fit melt into Indifferency, and old Customes. He was prettily and fantastically troubled, who having used to put his trust in Dreams, one night dreamed, that all dreams were vain; For he considered, If so, then This was vain, and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dreams might be true for all this: But if they might be true, then this dream might be so upon equall reason; And then dreams were vain, because This dream, which told him so, was true, and so round again. In the same Circle runs the Heart of man; All his cogitations are vain, and yet he makes especiall use of this, that, that Thought which thinks so, That is vain; and if That be vain, then his other Thoughts, which are vainly declared so, may be Reall, and Relied upon; And so we do. Those religious thoughts, which are sent into us, to condemne and disrepute the thoughts of sin and vanity, are esteemed the onely dreams; And so all those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Instruments, which the grace of God hath invented for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Impiety, are rendred ineffectuall, either by our direct opposing them, or (which happens most commonly) by our want of considering them.</p>
                  <p>The effect of all is this, That we are ignorant of the things of God; we make Religion to be the work of a few hours in the whole yeer; we are without fancy or affection to the severities of holy Living; we reduce Religion to the Beleeving of a few Articles, and doing nothing that is considerable; we Pray sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and then but very coldly and indifferently; we Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not so often as the Sun salutes both the Tropicks; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christ, but dare not die for him; we are factious for a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and will not live according to its precepts; we call our selves Christians, and love to be ignorant of many of the Lawes of Christ: lest our knowledge should force us into shame, or into the troubles of a holy Life. All the mischiefs that you can suppose to happen to a furious inconsiderate person, running after the wilde-fires of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50231:229"/>
the night, over Rivers and Rocks, and Precipices without Sun or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> starre, or Angel or Man to guide him: All that, and ten thousand times worse may you suppose to be the certain Lot of him, who gives himself up to the conduct of a passionate blinde Heart, whom no fire can warm, and no Sun enlighten; who hates light and loves to dwell in the Regions of darknesse. Thats the first generall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of the Heart; It is possessed with Blindnesse, wilfull and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the <hi>Heart is Hard</hi> too. Not onely Folly, but Mischief <note place="margin">2.</note> also is bound up in the Heart of man. If God strives to soften it with sorrow and sad Accidents, it is like an Ox, it grows callow, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and hard. Such a heart was <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> When God makes the clouds to gather round about us, we wrap our heads in the clouds, and like the male-contents in Galba's time, <hi>Tristitiam simulamus Contumaciae propiores.</hi> We seem sad and troubled, but it is dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gednesse and murmur. Or else if our fears be pregnant, and the heart yeelding, it sinks low into pusillanimity and superstition; and our hearts are so childish, so timerous, or so impatient in a sadnesse, that God is weary of making us, and we are glad of it. And yet when the Sun shines upon us, our hearts are hardned with that too, and God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But here also I must descend to particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Heart of man is strangely Proud; If men commend us we think we have reason to distinguish our selves from others, since the voice of discerning men hath already made the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If men do not commend us, we think they are stupid, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand us not, or envious and hold their tongues in spite. If we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are praised by many, then <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei.</hi> Fame is the voice of God. If we be praised but by few, then <hi>Satis unus, satis nullus.</hi> We cry, these are wise, and one wise man is worth a whole herd of the People. But if we be praised by none at all, we resolve to be even with all the world, and speak well of no body, and think
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50231:229"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> well onely of our selves: And then we have such beggerly Arts, such tricks to cheat for praise; we inquire after our faults and failings onely to be told we have none, but did excellently, and then we are pleased; we rail upon our actions onely to be chidden for so doing; and then he is our friend who chides us into a good opinion of our selves; which however all the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make us part with. Nay, Humility it self makes us proud; so false, so base is the the Heart of man. For Humility is so noble a vertue, that even Pride it self puts on its upper Garment; And we do like those, who cannot endure to look upon an ugly or a deformed person, and yet will give a great price for a picture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> like him. Humility is despised in substance, but courted and admired <hi>in effigie.</hi> And Aesops picture was sold two talents, when himself was made a slave at the price of two Philippicks. And because Humility makes a man to be honoured; Therefore we imitate all its garbs and postures, its civilities and silence, its modesties and condescensions. And to prove that we are extreamly proud in the midst of all this pagentry, we should be extreamly angry at any man, that should say, we are proud; And that's a sure signe we are so. And in the middest of all our Arts to seem Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we use devices to bring our selves into talk; we thrust our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> selves into company; we listen at doors; and like the great Beards in Rome, that pretended Philosophy and strict life, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Heart of man is deeply in love with wickednesse, and with nothing else: Against, not onely the Lawes of God, but against his own Reason, its own Interest, and its own Securities. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For is it imaginable, that a man who knows the Lawes of God, the rewards of Vertue, the cursed and horrid effects of sin; that knows and considers, and deeply sighes at the thought of the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pains of Hell; that knowes the joyes of Heaven to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, and that concerning them there is no temptation, but that they are too big for man to hope for; And yet he certainly beleeves, that a holy life shall infallibly attain thither; Is it I say imaginable, that this man should for a transient Action forfeit all this Hope, and certainly and knowing incur all that calamity? Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but the sin is pleasant, and the man is clothed with flesh and blood, and their appetites are materiall, and importunate, and present; And the discourses of Religion are concerning things spirituall, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate and apt for spirits, Angels and souls departed. To take off this also; We will suppose the man to consider, and really to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the pleasure of the sin, is sudden, vain, empty and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50231:230"/>
transient; that it leaves bitternesse upon the tongue, before it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> descended into the bowels: that there it is poison, and makes the Belly to swell, and the Thigh to rot; That he remembers and actually considers, that as soon as the moment of sin is past, he shall have an intolerable Conscience; and does at the instant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare moments with Eternity, and with horrour remembers that the very next minute he is as miserable a man as is in the world; Yet that this man should sin? Nay, suppose the sin to have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at all; such as is the sin of swearing; Nay, suppose it really to have pain in it: such as is the sin of Envy, which never can have pleasure in its actions, but much torment and consumption of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> very heart; What should make this man sin so for nothing, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself, so against all Reason and Religion and Interest, without pleasure for no reward? Here the heart betrayes it self to be desperately wioked. What man can give a reasonable account of such a man, who to prosecute his revenge will do himself an injury that he may do a lesse to him that troubles him. Such a man hath given me ill language; <gap reason="foreign">

But then let it be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you are not undone, let not him be so. Oh yes; for else my revenge triumphs not. Well, if you do, yet remember he will defend himself, or the Law will right him; at least do not do wrong to your self by doing him wrong. This were but Prudence, and self-Interest. And yet we see, that the heart of some men hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them to such furiousnesse of Appetite, as to make them willing to die, that their enemie may be buried in the same Ruines. Jovius Pontanus tells of an Italian slave (I think) who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against his Lord, watched his absence from home, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> employment and inadvertency of his fellow-servants: he locked the doors, and secured himself for a while, and Ravished his Lady; then took her three sons up to the battlements of the house, and at the return of his Lord, threw one down to him upon the pavement, and then a second to rend the heart of their sad Father, seeing them weltring in their blood and brains. The Lord begd for his third, and now his onely Son, promising pardon and libertie, if he would spare his life. The slave seemed to bend a little, and on condition his Lord would cut off his own Nose, he would spare his Son. The sad Father did so, being willing to suffer any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thing, rather then the losse of that Childe; But as soon as he saw his Lord all bloody with his wound, he threw the third Son, and himself down together upon the Pavement. The story is sad enough, and needs no lustre and advantages of sorrow to represent it: But if a man sets himself down, and considers sadly, he cannot easily tell upon what sufficient inducement, or what principle the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50231:230"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> slave should so certainly, so horridly, so presently, and then so eternally ruine himself. What could he propound to himself as a recompence to his own so immediate Tragedy? There is not in the pleasure of the revenge, nor in the nature of the thing, any thing to tempt him; we must confesse our ignorance, and say, that The Fleart of man is desperately wicked; and that is the truth in generall, but we cannot fathom it by particular compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
                  <p>For when the heart of man is bound up by the grace of God, and tied in golden bands, and watched by Angels, tended by those Nurse-keepers of the soul; it is not easie for a man to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And the evil of his heart is but like the ferity and wildnesse of Lyons-whelps: But when once we have broken the hedge, and got into the strengths of youth, and the licenciousnesse of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed age, it is wonderfull to observe, what a great inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mischief in a very short time will overflow all the banks of Reason and Religion. <hi>Vice</hi> first is <hi>pleasing,</hi> then it grows <hi>easie,</hi> then <hi>delightfull,</hi> then <hi>frequent,</hi> then <hi>habituall,</hi> then <hi>confirmed,</hi> then the <hi>man is impenitent,</hi> then he is <hi>obstinate,</hi> then he <hi>resolves never to Repent,</hi> and then he is <hi>Damned.</hi> And by that time he is come half way in this progresse, he confutes the Philosophy of the old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For they, not knowing the vilenesse of mans Heart, not considering its desperate amazing Impiety, knew no other degree of wickednesse but This, That men preferred Sense before Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and their understandings were abused in the choice of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall before an intellectuall and eternall good: But they alwayes concluded that the Will of man must of necessity follow the last dictate of the understanding, declaring an object to be good in one sence or other. Happy men they were, that were so Innocent; that knew no pure and perfect malice, and lived in an Age, in which it was not easie to confute them. But besides that, now the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wells of a deeper iniquity are discovered, we see by too sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that there are some sins proceeding from the heart of man, which have nothing but simple, and unmingled malice; Actions of meer spite; doing evil, because it is evil; sinning without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall pleasures; sinning with sensuall pain, with hazard of our lives; with actuall torment, and sudden deaths, and certain and present damnation; sins against the Holy Ghost; open hostilities, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enmities against God and all vertue. I can go no further; because there is not in the world, or in the nature of things, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> greater Evil. And that is the Nature and Folly of the Devil; he tempts men to ruine, and hates God, and onely hurts himself, and those he tempts; and does himself no pleasure, and some say, he increases his own accidentall torment.</p>

                  <p>But because God sent wise men into the world and they were treated rudely by the world, and exercised with evil accidents, and this seemed so great a discouragement to vertue, that even these wise men were more troubled to reconcile vertue, and misery, then to reconcile their affections to the suffering; God was pleased to enlighten their reason with a little beame of faith, or else height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their reason by wiser principles then those of vulgar under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; and taught them in the clear glasse of faith, or the dim perspective of Philosophy, to look beyond the cloud, and there to spie that there stood glories behinde their curtain, to which they could not come but by passing through the cloud, and being wet with the dew of heaven and the waters of affliction. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the world grew more enlightned by faith so it grew more dark with mourning &amp; sorrowes: God sometimes sent a light of fire and pillar of a cloud and the brightnesse of an angel and the lustre of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a star, and the sacrament of a rainbowe to guide his people thorough their portion of sorrows, and to lead them through troubles to rest: But as the Sun of righteousnesse approached towards the chambers of the East, and sent the harbingers of light peeping through the curtains of the night, and leading on the day of faith and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est revelation; so God sent degrees of trouble upon wise and good men, that now in the same degree in the which the world <hi>lives by faith</hi> and not by sense, in the same degree they might be able to live in vertue even while she lived in trouble, and not reject so great a beauty because she goes in mourning, and hath a black cloud of cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> drawn before her face: literally thus; God first entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their services, and allured and prompted on the infirmities of the infant world by temporal prosperity; but by degrees changed his method; and as men grew stronger in the knowledge of God and the expectations of heaven, so they grew weaker in their fortunes, more afflicted in their bodies, more abated in their expectations, more subject to their enemies, and were to endure <hi>the contradiction of sinners</hi> and the immission of the sharpnesses of providence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oeconomy.</p>
                  <p>First Adam was placed in a Garden of health and pleasure, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which when he fell, he was onely tied to enter into the covenant of <hi>natural sorrows</hi> which he and all his posteritie till the flood run through: but in all that period they had the whole wealth of the earth before them, they need not fight for empires or places for their cattle to grase in; they lived long and felt no want, no sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, no tyrannie, no war: and the evils that happened were <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, personal,</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> and no violences were then done, but they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50231:233"/>
were like those things which the law calls <hi>rare contingencies;</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which as the law can now take no care, and make no provisions, so then there was no law; but men lived <hi>free</hi> and <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> and they exercised no <hi>vertues</hi> but <hi>natural,</hi> and knew no <hi>felicity</hi> but <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:</hi> and so long their prosperity was, just as was their vertue, because it was a natural instrument towards all that which they knew of happinesse. *But this publick easinesse and quiet, the world turned into sin; and unlesse God did compel men to do themselves good they would undoe themselves: and then God broke in upon them with a flood and destroyed that generation, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the government of the world upon a new stock, and binde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vertue upon mens spirits by new bands, endeared to them by new hopes and fears.</p>
                  <p>Then God made new laws and gave to Princes the power of the sword, and men might be punshed to death in certain cases, and mans life was shortened, and slavery was brought into the world and the state of servants; and then war began, and evils multiplied upon the face of the earth; in which it is naturally certain, that they that are most violent and injurious prevailed upon the weaker and more innocent; and every tyranny that began from Nimrod to this day, and every usurper was a peculiar argument to shew that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to teach the world, vertue by suffering; and that therefore he suffered <hi>Tyrannies</hi> and <hi>usurpations,</hi> to be in the world, and to be prosperous, and the rights of men to be snatched away from the owners, that the world might be established in potent and setled governments and the sufferers be taught al the passive vertues of the soul. For so God brings good out of evil, turning <hi>Tyranny</hi> into the benefits of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> into <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> into <hi>rewards:</hi> and this was the second change of the world: <hi>personal miseries</hi> were brought in upon Adam and his posterity, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin in the first period: and in the second, <hi>publick evils</hi> were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> brought in by <hi>tyrants</hi> and <hi>usurpers,</hi> and God suffered them as the first elements of vertue, men being just newly put to schoole to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant sufferings. But all this was not much.</p>
                  <p>Christs line was not yet drawn forth: it began not to appear in what family the <hi>King of sufferings</hi> should descend till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and therefore till then there were no greater sufferings then what I have now reckoned. But when Abrahams family was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from among the many nations, and began to belong to God, by a special right, and he was designed to be the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> then God found out a new way to trie him, even with a sound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> commanding him to offer his beloved <hi>Isaac;</hi> but this was accepted and being intended by Abraham was not intended by God: for this was a type of Christ, and therefore was also but a type of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, excepting the sufferings of the old periods and the sufferings of nature and accident, we see no change made, for a long while
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50231:233"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> after, but God having established a law in Abrahams family did build it upon promises, of <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>victory,</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> and <hi>riches:</hi> and so long as they did not prevaricate the law of their God, so long they were prosperous: but God kept a remnant of Cananites in the land like a rod held over them to vex or to chastise them into obedience, in which while they persevered, nothing could hurt them; and that saying of David needs no other sence, but the letter of its own expression, <hi>I have been young and now am old, and yet saw I never the righteous for saken nor his seed begging their bread:</hi> The godly generally were prosperous, and a good cause sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had an ill end, and a good man never died an ill death, till the law had spent a great part of its time, and it descended towards its declension and period; But that the great prince of sufferings might not appear upon his stage of tragedies without some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of sorrow, God was pleased to choose out some good men, and honour them, by making them to become little images of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: <hi>I saiah, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> were martyrs of the law; but these were single deaths; <hi>Shadrac, Meshec,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were thrown into a burning furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> into a den of lions, and <hi>Susanna</hi> was accused for adultery; but these were but little arrests <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the prosperity of the Godly: as the time drew neerer that Christ should be manifest, so the sufferings grew bigger and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: and <hi>Antiochus</hi> raised up a sharp persecution in the time of the Maccabees, in which many passed through the red sea of blood into the bosome of Abraham; &amp; then Christ came: and that was the <hi>third period</hi> in which the changed method of Gods providence was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for Christ was to do his great work by sufferings, &amp; <hi>by sufferings</hi> was to <hi>enter into blessednesse;</hi> &amp; by his passion he was made prince of the Catholickchurch, and as our Head was, so must the members be: God made the same covenant with us, that he did with his most holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Son; &amp; Christ obtaind no better conditions for us, then for himself; that was not to be looked for; <hi>the servant must not be above his master, it is well if he be as his Master: if the world persecuted him, they will also persecute us; and from the dayes of John the Baptist, the kingdome of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force: not the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent doers,</hi> but <hi>the sufferers of violence</hi> for though the old law was established in the promises of temporal prosperity, yet the gospel is founded in temporal adversity. It is directly a covenant of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and sorrows; <hi>for now the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God:</hi> thats the sence and designe of the text; and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it as a direct antinomy to the common perswasions of tyrann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, carnal, and vicious men, who reckon nothing good, but what is <hi>prosperous:</hi> for though that proposition had many degrees of truth in the beginning of the law, yet the case is now altered; God hath established its contradictory: and now every good man must look for persecution, and every good cause must expect to thrive by

the sufferings and patience of holy persons; and as men do well, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> suffer evil, so they are dear to God: and whom he loves most, he afflicts most, and does this with a designe of the greatest mercy in the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then the state of the Gospel is a state of sufferings, not of temporal prosperities, this was foretold by the prophets; <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain shall go out of the house of the Lord, &amp; irrigabit torrentem spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum;</hi>

                  <p>All that Christ came for, was, or was mingled with sufferings: For all those little joyes which God sent, either to recreate his person, or to illustrate his office, were abated, or attended with afflictions; God being more carefull to establish in him the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of sufferings, then to refresh his sorrows: Presently after the Angels had finished their Halleluiahs, he was forced to fly to save his life; and the air became full of shrikes of the desolate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mothers of Bethlehem for their dying Babes. God had no sooner made him illustrious with a voyce from heaven, and the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him in the waters of Baptisme, But he was delivered over to be tempted and assaulted by the Devil in the wildernesse: His transfiguration was a bright ray of glory, but then also he entred into a cloud, and was told a sad story what he was to suffer at Jerusalem: And upon Palme-Sunday, when he rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, and was adorned with the acclamations of a King, and a God, he wet the Palmes with his tears, sweeter then the drops of Mannah, or the little pearls of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> heaven, that descended upon mount Hermon, weeping in the midst of this triumph over obstinate, perishing, and maliciour <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> For this Jesus was like the rain-bowe which God set in the clouds as a sacrament to confirm a promise, and establish a grace, he was half made of the glories of the light, and half of the moisture of a cloud; in his best dayes he was but half tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and half sorrow; he was sent to tell of his Fathers mercies,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50231:235"/>
and that God intended to spare us; but appeared not but in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> company, or in the retinue of a shower, and of foul weather: But I need not tell that Jesus, beloved of God, was a suffering person: that which concerns this question most, is that he made for us a covenant of sufferings: His <hi>Doctrines</hi> were such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely and by consequent enjoyne and suppose <hi>sufferings,</hi> and a state of affliction; His very <hi>promises</hi> were <hi>sufferings,</hi> his <hi>beatitudes</hi> were <hi>sufferings,</hi> his <hi>rewards,</hi> and his <hi>arguments</hi> to invite men to follow him, were onely taken from <hi>sufferings</hi> in this life, and the reward of <hi>sufferings</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p>For if we summon up the <hi>Commandements</hi> of Christ, we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> finde <hi>humility, mortification, self-deniall, repentance, renouncing the world, mourning, taking up the crosse, dying for him, patience</hi> and <hi>poverty,</hi> to stand in the chiefest rank of Christian precepts, and in the direct order to heaven: <hi>He that will be my Disciple must deny himself, and take up his crosse and follow me.</hi> We must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him that was crowned with thorns and sorrows, him that was drenchd in Cedron, nailed upon the Crosse, that deserved all good, and suffered all evil: That is the summe of Christian Religion, as it distinguishes from all the Religions of the world.

                  <p>If I begin with the Apostles, who were to perswade the world to become Christian, and to use proper Arguments of invitation, we shall sinde that they never offered an Argument of temporall prosperity: they never promised Empires and thrones on earth, nor riches, nor temporall power, and it would have been soon confuted, if they who were whipt and imprisoned, banished and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> scattered, persecuted and tormented, should have promised Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine dayes to others, which they could not to themselves: Of all the Apostles there was not one that died a naturall death but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saint John; and did he escape?

                  <p>And now began to work the greatest glory of the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: here was the case of Christianity at stake. The world was rich and prosperous, learned and full of wise men, the Gospel was preached with poverty and persecution, in simplicity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and <hi>in demonstration of the Spirit:</hi> God was on one side, and the Devil on the other; they each of them dressed up their city; <hi>Babylon</hi> upon Earth, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from above; the Devils city <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was full of pleasure, triumphs, victories and cruelty; good news and great wealth, conquest over Kings, and making nations tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; <hi>They bound Kings in chains, and the Nobles with links of iron,</hi> and <hi>the inheritance of the Earth was theirs:</hi> the Romans were Lords over the greatest parts of the world; and God permitted to the Devil the Firmament and increase, the wars and the successe of that people, giving to him an intire power of disposing the great changes of the world, so as might best increase their greatnesse and power: and he therefore did it, because all the power of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane greatnesse was a professed enemy to Christianity: and on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> other side God was to build up <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the kingdom of the Gospel: and he chose to build it of hewen stone, cut and broken: the Apostles he chose for Preachers, and they had no learning; women and mean people were the first Disciples, and they had no power: the Devil was to lose his kingdom, and he wanted no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: and therefore he stirred up, and as well as he could, he made active all the power of Rome, and all the learning of the Greeks, and all the malice of Barbarous people, and all the prejudice and the obstinacy of the Jews, against this doctrine and institution; which preached and promised, and brought persecution along with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it. On the one side there was <hi>scandalum crucis,</hi> on the other <hi>patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia sanctorum,</hi> and what was the event?

This I say lasted for three hundred yeers, that the prayers and the backs, and the necks of Christians fought against the rods and axes of the persecutours, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> till the Countrey, and the Cities, and the Court it self was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Christians: And by this time, <hi>the army of Martyrs</hi> was vast and numerous, and the number of sufferers blunted the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans sword: For Christ first triumphed over the princes and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, before he would admit them to serve him; he first felt their malice before he would make use of their defence,

to shew that it was not his necessity that required it, but his grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that admitted <hi>Kings and Queens to be nurses of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Church was at ease, and she that sucked the blood of the Martyrs so long, began now to suck the milk of Queens: Indeed it was a great mercy in appearance and was so intended, but it proved not so. But then the Holy Ghost in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the designe of Christ, who meant by sufferings to perfect his Church, as himself was by the same instrument, was pleased now that persecution did cease, to inspire the Church with the spirit of mortification and austerity; and then they made Colleges of sufferers, persons who to secure their inheritance in the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to come, did cut off all their portion in this, excepting so much of it as was necessary to their present being; and by instruments of humility, by patience under, and a voluntary undertaking of the Crosse, <hi>the burden of the Lord,</hi> by self deniall, by fastings and sackcloth, and pernoctations in prayer, they chose then to exercise the active part of the religion, mingling it as much as they could with the suffering.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it is so glorious a thing to be like Christ; to be dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed like the prince of the Catholick church, who was so a man of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and to whom a prosperous and unafflicted person is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that in all ages the servants of God have <hi>put on the armour of righteousnesse, on the right hand, and on the left,</hi> that is, in the sufferings of persecution, or the labours of mortification, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under the rod of God, or by election of our own; by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, or self denial, by actual martyrdom, or by aptnesse or disposition towards it, by dying for Christ or suffering for him; by being willing to part with all when he calls for it, and by parting with what we can, for the relief of his poor members.

                  <p n="1">1.

And what hurt is it to thee if a persecution draws thee from the vanities of a former prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and forces thee into the sobrieties of a holy life? What losse is it, what misery? Is not the least sin a greater evil then the greatest of sufferings? God smites some at the beginning of their sin: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Others not till a long while after it is done. The first cannot say, that God is slack in punishing; and have no need to complain that the wicked are prosperous; for they finde that God is apt enough to strike; and therefore that he strikes them, and strikes not the other, is not defect of justice, but because there is not mercy in store, for them that sin and suffer not: 15. For if God strikes the godly that they may repent, it is no wonder that God is so good to his servants; but then we must not call that a misery, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make an instrument of saving them. And if God forbears <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to strike the wicked out of anger, and because he hath decreed death and hell against them, we have no reason to envy that they ride in a gilded chariot to the gallows: But if God forbears the wicked, that by his long sufferance they may be invited to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then we may cease to wonder at the dispensation, and argue comforts to the afflicted Saints, thus; 1. For if God be so gracious
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50231:241"/>
to the wicked; how much more is he to the godly? And if sparing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the wicked be a mercy, then smiting the godly being the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his greater kindnesse; affliction is of it self the more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition.

Sorrow cannot be the reward of vertue, it may be its instrument, and hand-maid, but not its reward; and therefore it may be intermedial to some great purposes, but they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> must look for their portion in the other life: <hi>For if in this life onely we had hope, then we were of all men the most miserable.</hi> It is Sain Pauls argument to prove a beatificall resurrection: And we therefore may learn to estimate, the state of the afflicted godly to be a mercy great, in proportion to the greatnesse of that reward, which these afflictions come to secure and to prove.</p>

                     <hi>will reveal this unto you,</hi> this, of the covenant of sufferings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the old Prophets, and holy men of the Temple had many thoughts of heart; but in the full sufferings of the Gospel, there hath been a full revelation of the excellency of the sufferings. I have now given you an account of some of those reasons, why God hath so disposed it, that at this time, that is, under the period of the Gospel, judgement must begin at the house of God, and they are either, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But now besides all the premises, we have another account to make concerning the prosperity of the wicked: <hi>For if judgment first begin at us? what shall the end be of them that obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of God?</hi> that is the question of the Apostle, and is the great instrument of comfort to persons ill treated in the actions of the world. The first ages of the Church lived upon <hi>promises,</hi> and <hi>prophecies;</hi> and because some of them are already fulfilled for ever, and the others are of a continuall and a successive nature, and are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> verified by the actions of every day: Therefore we and all the following Ages live upon <hi>promises</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> and although the servants of God have suffered many calamities, from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and prevalency of evil men their enemies, yet still it is preserved as one of the fundamentall truths of Christianity; That all the fair fortunes of the wicked are not enough to make them happy, nor the persecutions of the godly, able to make a good man miserable; nor yet their sadnesses arguments of Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against them. For when a godly man is afflicted and dies, it is his work and his businesse; and if the wicked prevail, that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> if they persecute the godly, it is but that which was to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them: For who are fit to be hangmen, and executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of publike wrath but evil and ungodly persons? And can it be a wonder that they whose cause wants reason, should betake themselves to the sword? that what he cannot perswade he may

                     </gap>, the things of men have this world for their stage, and their reward, but <hi>the things of God</hi> relate to <hi>the world to come:</hi> and for our own particulars we are to be guided by rule, and by <hi>the end of all,</hi> not by events intermedial, which are varied by a thousand irregular causes. For if all the evil men in the world were unprosperous (as most certainly they are) and if all good persons were temporally blessed (as most certainly they are not) yet this would not move us to become vertuous: <hi>If an angel should come from heaven,</hi> or <hi>one arise from the dead</hi> and preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or justice, and temperance, all this would be ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to those to whom the plain doctrines of God, delivered in the Law and the Prophets will not suffice.</p>
                  <p>For why should God work a signe to make us to beleeve that we ought to do justice; if we already beleeve, he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, no man can need a miracle for the confirmation of that which he already beleeves to be the command of God: And when God hath expressely bidden us to <hi>obey every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, the King as supreme, and his deputies as sent by him:</hi> It is a strange infidelity to think, that a rebellion against the ordinance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, can be sanctified by successe and prevalency, of them that destroy <hi>the authority,</hi> and <hi>the person,</hi> and <hi>the law,</hi> and <hi>the religion:</hi> The sin cannot grow to its height if it be crushed at the beginning; unlesse it prosper in its progresse, a man cannot easily fill up the measure of his iniquity: but then that the sin swels to its fulnesse by prosperity, and grows too big to be suppressed without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is so far from excusing, or lessening the sin, that nothing doth so nurse the sin as it: It is not vertue, because it is prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but if it had not been prosperous, the sin could never be so great.</p>

Then the crime grows big and loud, then it calls to Heaven for vengeance, when it hath been long a growing, when it hath thrived under the Devils managing; when

God hath long suffered it, and with patience in vain expecting the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> repentance of a sinner: he that treasures up wrath against the day of wrath, that man hath been a prosperous, that is an unpunished and a thriving sinner: but then it is the <hi>sin</hi> that thrives <hi>not the man:</hi> and that is the mistake upon this whole question: for the sin cannot thrive, unlesse the man goes on without apparent punishment, and restraint. And all that the man gets by it is, that by a continual course of sin, he is prepared for an intollerable ruine. The Spirit of God bids us look upon <hi>the end of these men;</hi> not the way they walk or the instrument of that pompous death. When Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas was asked, which of the three was happiest, himself, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or Iphicrates, bid the man stay till they were all dead; for till then that question could not be answered.

Augustine die with grief that very night, would have perceived his calamity more visible then the reward of his piety and holy religion. When Lewis sirnamed <hi>Pius</hi> went his voyage to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Palestine upon a holy end, and for the glory of God to fight against the Saracens and Turks, and Mamalukes, the world did promise to themselves that a good cause should thrive in the hands of so holy a man: but the event was far otherwise; his brother Robert was killed, and his army destroyed, and himself taken prisoner, and the money which by his Mother was sent for his redemption was cast away in a storm, and he was exchanged for the last town the Christians had in Egypt, and brought home the crosse of Christ upon his shoulder in a real pressure and participation of his Masters sufferings. When Charles the fifth went to Algier to suppresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> pirates and unchristned villains, the cause was more confident then the event was prosperous: and when he was almost ruined in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious storme, he told the minutes of the clock, expecting that at midnight, when religious persons rose to Mattins, he should be eased by the benefit of their prayers: but the providence of God trod upon those waters, and left no footstoops for discovery: his navie was beat in pieces, and his designe ended in dishonour, and his life almost lost by the bargain. Was ever cause more baffled then the Christian cause by the Turks, in all Asia and Africa, and some parts of Europe, if to be persecuted and afflicted be reckoned a calamity? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> What prince was ever more unfortunate then Henry the sixt of England, and yet that age saw none more pious and devout, and the title of the house of Lancaster was advanced against the right of York, for three descents; but then what was the end of these things? the persecuted men were made Saints, and their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are preserved in honour, and their souls shall reigne for ever;

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and some good men were ingaged in a wrong cause, and the good cause was sometimes managed by evil men, till that the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed cause was lifted up by God in the hands of a young and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous prince, and at last, both interests were satisfied in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of two roses, which was brought to issue by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful chain of causes managed by the divine providence: and there is no age, no history, no state, no great change in the world, but hath ministred an example of <hi>an afflicted truth,</hi> and <hi>a prevailing sin:</hi> For I will never more call that sinner prosperous, who after he hath been permitted to finish his businesse, shall die, and perish mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for at the same rate, we may envie the happinesse of a poor fisherman, who while his nets were drying, slept upon the rock and dreamt that he was made a King; on a sudden starts up, and leaping for joy, fals down from the rock, and in the place of his imaginary felicities, loses his little portion of pleasure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent folaces, he had from the sound sleep and little cares of his humble cottage.</p>
                  <p>And what is the prosperity of the wicked? to dwel in fine houses, or to command armies, or to be able to oppresse their brethren, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or to have much wealth to look on, or many servants to feed, or much businesse to dispatch, and great cares to master; these things are of themselves neither good nor bad; but consider: would any man amongst us, looking and considering before hand, kill his lawful King to be heire of all that which I have named? would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you choose, to have God angry with you upon these terms? would any of you be a perjured man for it all? A wise man or a good, would not choose it: would any of you die an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist that you might live in plenty and power? I believe you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of it. It cannot therefore be a happinesse to thrive, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the stock of a great sin: for if any man should contract with an impure spirit, to give his soul up at a certain day, it may be 20. years hence, upon the condition he might for 20. years have his vain desires, should we not think that person infinitely miserable; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prosperous thriving sinner is in the same condition; within these twenty years, he shall be thrown into the portion of Devils, but shall never come out thence in twenty millions of years. His wealth must needs sit uneasie upon him, that remembers that within a short space he shall be extreamely miserable; and if he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, he does but secure it the more. And that God defers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the punishment, and suffers evil men to thrive in the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their sin, it may and does serve many ends of providence, and mercy, but serves no end that any evil men can reasonably wish or propound to themselves eligible.</p>

And after all our fears of sequestration and poverty, of death or banishment, our prayers against the persecution, and troubles under it, we may please to remember that twenty years hence (it may be sooner, it wil not be much longer) all our cares and our troubles shall be dead, and then it shall be enquired how we did bear our sorrows, and who inflicted them, and in what cause, and then he shall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that keeps company with the <hi>persecuted,</hi> and the <hi>persecutors</hi> shall be shut out <hi>amongst dogs and unbelievers.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. They that suffer any thing for Christ, and are ready to die for him, let them do nothing against him. For certainly they think too highly of martyrdom, who beleeve it able to excuse all the evils of a wicked life. A man may give his body to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and yet have no charity; and he that dies without charity, dies without God, <hi>for God is love:</hi> And when those who fought in the dayes of the Maccabees, for the defence of true Religion, and were killed in <hi>those holy warres,</hi> yet being dead, were found having about their necks, <gap reason="foreign">

resurrection. He that overcomes his fear of death does well; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but if he hath not also overcome his lust, or his anger, his <hi>baptisme of blood</hi> will not wash him clean. Many things may make a man willing to die in a good cause: Publike reputation, hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, gallantry of spirit, a confident resolution, and a mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line courage; or a man may be vexed into a stubborn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting suffering: But nothing can make a man live well, but the grace and the love of God. But those persons are infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by their last act, who professe their religion to be worth dying for, and yet are so unworthy, as not to live according to its institution. It were a rare felicity, if every good cause could be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> mannaged by good men onely; but we have found that evil men have spoiled a good cause, but never that a good cause made those evil men good and holy. If the Governour of Samaria had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Simon Magus for receiving Christian Baptisme, he had no more died a martyr, then he lived a saint. For dying is not enough, and dying in a good cause is not enough, but then onely we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the crown of martyrdom, when our death is the seal of our life, and our life is a continuall testimony of our duty, and both give testimony to the excellencies of the religion, and glorifie the grace of God. If a man be gold, the fire purges him, but it burns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him if he be like stubble, cheap, light, and uselesse: For martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the consummation of love: But then it must be supposed, that this grace must have had its beginning, and its severall stages, and periods, and must have passed thorow <hi>labour</hi> to <hi>zeal,</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the regions of duty, to the perfections of sufferings; and therefore it is a sad thing to observe, how some empty souls will please themselves with being of such a religion, or such a cause, and though they dishonour their religion, or weigh down the cause with the prejudice of sin, beleeve all is swallowed up by one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name, or the appellative of one vertue: If God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> nothing but heresie and treason, then to have been <hi>a loyall man,</hi> or <hi>of a good beleef,</hi> had been enough; but he that forbad rebellion, forbids also swearing, and covetousnesse, rapine, and oppression, lying, and cruelty: And it is a sad thing to see a man not onely to spend his time, and his <hi>wealth and his money,</hi> and <hi>his friends</hi> upon his lust, but to spend <hi>his sufferings</hi> too, to let the canker-worm of a deadly sin, devour his Martyrdom: He therefore that suffers in a good cause, let him be sure to walk worthy of that honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which God hath called him; Let him first deny his sins, and then deny himself, and then he may take up his crosse and follow Christ; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ever remembring that no man pleases God in his death, who hath walked perversely in his life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that suffers in a cause of God, must be indifferent what the instance be, so that he may serve God. I say, he must be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the cause, so it be a cause of God, and indifferent in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50231:247"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> suffering, so it be of Gods appointment. For some men have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall aversation to some vices, or vertues, and a naturall affection to others. One man will die for his friend, and another will die for his money: Some men hate to be a rebell and will die for their Prince; but tempt them to suffer for the cause of the Church, in which they were baptized, and in whose communion they look for heaven, and then they are tempted, and fall away. Or if God hath chosen the cause for them, and they have accepted it, yet themselves will choose the suffering. Right or wrong, some men will not endure a prison; and some that can, yet choose the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> part of the burden, the pollution and stain of a sin, rather then lose their money; and some had rather die twice then lose their estates once. In this our rule is easie. Let us choose God, and let God choose all the rest for us, it being indifferent to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by poverty or shame, by lingring or a sudden death, by the hands of a Tyrant Prince, or the despised hands of a base usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or a rebell, we receive the crown, and do honour to God and to Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whoever suffer in a cause of God, from the hands of cruell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and unreasonable men, let them not be too forward to prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate evil and death to their enemies; but let them solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the assurance of the divine justice, by generall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in particular, pray for them that are our persecutours. Nebuchadnezzar was the rod in the hand of God against the Tyrians, and because he destroyed that city, God rewarded him with the spoil of Egypt; and it is not alwayes certain, that God will be angry with every man, by whose hand affliction comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And sometimes two armies have met and fought, and the wisest man amongst them could not say, that either of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had prevaricated either the lawes of God, or of Nations, and yet it may be some superstitious, easie, and half witted people of either side, wonder that their enemies live so long! And there are very many cases of warre concerning which God hath declared nothing: and although in such cases, he that yeelds and quits his title rather then his charity, and the care of so many lives, is the wisest and the best man: yet if neither of them will do so, let us not decree judgements from heaven, in cases where we have no word from heaven, and thunder from our Tribunals, where no voice of God hath declared the sentence. But in such cases where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there is an evident tyranny or injustice, let us do like the good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, who dressed the wounded man, but never pursued the thief; let us do charity to the afflicted, and bear the crosse with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, and look up to Jesus, <hi>who endured the crosse, and despised the shame;</hi> but let us not take upon us the office of God, who will judge the Nations righteously, and when he hath delivered up our bodies will rescue our souls from the hands of unrighteous judges.

I remember in the story that Plutarch tels concerning the soul of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Thespesius, that it met with a Prophetick Genius, who told him many things that should happen afterwards in the world, and the strangest of all was this, That there should be a King, <hi>Qui bonus cum sit, tyrannide vitam finiet:</hi> An excellent Prince, and a good man should be put to death by a rebell and usurping power; and yet that Prophetick soul could not tell that those rebels should within three yeers die miserable and accursed deaths; and in that great prophecy recorded by Saint Paul, <hi>That in the last dayes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Do not trouble your self by thinking how much you are afflicted, but consider how much you make of it: For reflex acts upon the suffering it self, can lead to nothing but to pride, or to impatience to temptation, or a postacy. He that measures the grains and scruples of his persecution, will soon sit down and call for ease, or for a reward; will think the time long, or his burden great; will be apt to complain of his condition, or set a greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> value upon his person. Look not back upon him that strikes thee, but upward to God that supports thee, and forward to <hi>the crown that is set before thee;</hi> and then consider, if the losse of thy estate hath taught thee to despise the world? whether thy poor fortune hath made thee poor in spirit? and if thy uneasie prison sets thy soul at liberty, and knocks off the fetters of a worse captivity. For then the rod of suffering turns into crowns and scepters, when every suffering is a precept, and every change of condition produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a holy resolution, and the state of sorrows makes the resolution actuall, and habituall, permanent, and persevering. For as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> silk-worm eateth it self out of a seed to become a little worm, and there feeding on the leaves of mulberies, it grows till its coat be off, and then works it self into a house of silk, then casting its pearly seeds for the young to breed, it leaveth its silk for man, and dieth all white and winged in the shape of a flying creature: So it

                  <p n="5">5. Let our suffering be entertained by a direct election, not by collateral ayds and phantastick assistances. It is a good refreshment to a weak spirit to suffer in good company: and so Phocion encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged a timerous Greek condemned to die; and he bid him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident because that he was to die with Phocion; and when 40 Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in Cappadocia suffered, and that a souldier standing by came and supplyed the place of the one Apostate, who fell from his crown, being overcome with pain, it added warmth to the frozen confessors, and turnd them into consummate Martyrs.

by second thoughts to have our infirmities excused, and our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sins forgiven, our habits lessened, and our malice cured after we were wounded, and sick, and dead, and buried, and in the possession of the Devil; this was such a blessing, so great riches of the Divine goodnesse, that as it was taught to no religion but the Christian, revealed by no law-giver but Christ, so it was a favour greater then ever God gave to the Angels and Devils: for although God was rich in the effusion of his goodnesse towards them, yet they were not admitted to the condition of second thoughts; Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shed one drop of blood for them, <hi>his goodnesse did not lead them to repentance:</hi> but to us it was that he made this largesse of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> goodnesse; to us, to whom he made himself a brother, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the paps of our mother; he paid the scores of our sin, and shame, and death, onely that we might be admitted to repent and that this repentance might be effectuall to the great purposes of felicity and salvation: And if we would consider this sadly, it might make us better to understand our madnesse and folly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to repent; That is, <hi>to be sorrowfull,</hi> and <hi>to leave all our sins,</hi> and <hi>to make amends by a holy life.</hi> For that we might be admitted and suffered to do so, God was fain to pour forth all the riches of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his goodnesse: It cost our deerest Lord the price of his deerest blood, many a thousand groans, millions of prayers and sighes, and at this instant, he is praying for our repentance: nay he hath prayed for our repentance these 1600. yeers incessantly, night and day, and shall do so till doomes day, <hi>[He sits at the right hand of God making intercession for us.]</hi> And that we may know what he prayes for, he hath sent us Embassadours to declare the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of all his designe, for Saint Paul saith, <hi>[We are Embassadours for Christ, as though he did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead to be reconciled to God.]</hi> The purpose of our Embassy and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Ministery, is a prosecution of the mercies of God, and the work of Redemption, and the intercession and mediation of Christ: It is the work of atonement and reconciliation that God designed, and Christ died for, and still prayes for, and we preach for, and you all must labour for.</p>
                  <p>And therefore here consider, if it be not infinite impiety to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the riches of such a goodnesse, which at so great a charge, with such infinite labour, and deep mysterious arts, invites us to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that is, to such a thing which could not be granted to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Christ should die to purchase it; such a glorious favour, that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the issue of Christs prayers in heaven, and of all his labours, his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and his sufferings on earth: if we refuse to repent now, we do not so much refuse to do our own duty as to accept of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; it is the greatest and the dearest blessing that ever God gave to Men, that they may repent, and therefore to deny it, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it, is to refuse health, brought us by the skill and industry of

                  <p>After the enumeration of these glories, these prodigies of mercies &amp; loving kindnesses, of Christs dying for us, and interceding for us and merely that we may repent, and be saved; I shall lesse need to instance those other particularities wherby God continues, as by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so many arguments of kindnesse to sweeten our natures and make them malleable to the precepts of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> the twinne daughters of holy <hi>repentance;</hi> but the poorest person amongst us, besides the blessing and graces already reckoned hath enough about him, and the accidents of every day to shame him into repentance. Does not God send his angels to keep thee in all thy wayes? are not they ministring spirits sent forth to wait upon thee as thy guard? art not thou kept from drowning, from fracture of bones, from madnesse, from deformities, by the riches of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> goodnesse? Tell the joynts of thy body, dost thou want a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? and if thou doest not understand how great a blessing that is, do but remember how ill thou canst spare the use of it when thou hast but a thorn in it? The very privative blessings, the blessings of immunity, safeguard, and integrity, which we all enjoy deserve a thanks giving of a whole life. If God should send a cancer upon thy face or a wolf into thy brest, if he should spread a crust of leprosie upon thy skin, what wouldest thou give to be but as now thou art it wouldest thou not repent of thy sins upon that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? which is the greater blessing to be kept from them, or to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cured of them? and why therfore shall not this greater blessing lead thee to repentance? why do we not so aptly promise repentance when we are sick upon the condition to be made well, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually forget it when we are well? as if health never were a blessing, but when we have it not; rather I fear the reason, is when we are sick we promised to repent, because then we cannot sin the sins of our former life; but in health our appetites return to their capacity and in all the way we despise <hi>the riches of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> which preserves us from such evils which would be full of horror and amazement if they should happen to us.</p>

                  <p>Indeed many times this forbearance makes men impudent, it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so in the case of Pharaoh when God smote him, and then forbore; Pharaohs heart grew callous and insensible till God struck again; and this was the meaning of these words of God, <hi>I will harden the heart of pharaoh,</hi> that is, I wil forbear him, smite him, and then take the blow off, <hi>Sic enim Deus induravit Pharaonis cor,</hi> said Saint Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.

                  <p>And do not we finde all this to be a great truth in our selves? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are we so great strangers to our own weaknesses and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as not to remember when God scared us with judgements in the neighbourhood, whence we lived in a great plague, or if were ever in a storm, or God had sent a sicknesse upon us; then we may please to remember that repentance was our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, that we designed mountains of piety, renewed our holy purposes, made vows and solemn sacraments to God to become penitent, and obedient persons; and we may also remember without much considering, that assoon as God began to forbear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us, we would no longer forbear to sin, but adde flame to flame, a heap of sins to a treasure of wrath, already too big; being like Pharaoh or Herod, or like the oxe and mule, more hardy and callous for our stripes; and melted in the fire, and frozen har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the cold, worse for all our afflictions, and the worse for all Gods judgements; not bettered by his goodnesse, nor molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his threatnings: and what is there more left for God to do unto us?

                  <p>When thy gluttony gave thee a surfet, and God gave thee a remedy, his meaning then was, that thy gluttony rather should be cured then thy surfet; that repentance should have been thy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and abstinence and fasting should be thy cure: Did ever thy proud or revengefull spirit engage thee upon a Duell, or a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Law-suit, and God brought thee off with life or peace? his purpose then was, that his mercy should teach thee charity: and he that cannot read the purposes of God written with the <hi>finger</hi> of judgement (for as yet his whole hand is not laid on) either is consigned to eternall ruine, because God will no more endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his cure, or if his mercy still continues and goes on in long-suffering, it shall be by such vexatious instruments, such causticks, and corrosives, such tormenting and desperate medicaments, <hi>such</hi> which in the very cure will soundly punish thy folly and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

                     </gap> it by the change wrought upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our selves. For what Plato said concerning his dream of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is true here: <hi>Quicunque non purgatus migrat ad inferos, jace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in luto: quicunque verò mitratus illuc accesserit, habitabit cum Deis: He that dies in his impurities shall lie in it for ever, but he that descends to his grave purged and mitred,</hi> that is, <hi>having quitted his vices, &amp; superinduens justitiam, being clothed with righteousnesse,</hi> shall dwell in light and immortality. It is sad that we put God to such extremities, and as it happens in long diseases, those which Physitians use for the last remedies seldom prevail; and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive persons come to have their heads shaven, they do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> escape: So it is when we put God to his last remedies; God indeed hath the glory of his patience, and his long-suffering, but we seldom have the benefit and the use of it. For if when our sin was young, and our strength more active, and our habits lesse, and vertue not so much a stranger to us, we suffered sin to prevail upon us, to grow stronger then the ruins of our spirit, and to lesson us into the state of sicknesse and disability, in the midst of all those remedies which God used to our beginning diseases: much more desperate is our recovery, when our disease is stronger and our faculties weaker, when our sins raigne in us, and our thoughts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vertue are not alive.</p>
                  <p>How ever, although I say this, and it is highly considerable, to the purpose that we never suffered things to come to this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet if it be upon us, we must do as well as we can: But then we are to look upon it as a designe of Gods last mercy, beyond which if we protract our repentance, our condition is desperately miserable. The whole state of which mercy we understand by the parable of the King reckoning with his servants that were in arrears to him: <hi>One was brought to him, which owed him ten thousand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: but for as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him</hi>

                     <hi>to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made:</hi> The man you see was under the arrest; the sentence was passed upon him, he was a condemned man; but before the execution of it, he fell down and worshipped and said, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I remember what Bion observed wittily of the punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the daughters of Danaeus, whom the old Poets fained to be condemned in hell to fill a bottomlesse tub with water, and to increase the pain (as they fancied) this water they were to carry in sieves, and never to leave work till the tub were full; It is well (sayes he) since their labour must be eternall, that it is so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> gentle, for it were more pains to carry their water in whole vessels, and a sad burden to go loaden to a leaking tub with unfruitfull labours: Just so is the condition of these persons upon whom a wrath is gone out; it is a sad sentence, but acted with a gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument; and since they are condemned to pay the scores of their sins with the sufferance of a load of judgements, it is well they are such as will run quite thorough them, and not stick upon them to eternity. <hi>Omnes enim poenae non exterminantes sunt medicinales:</hi> All punishments whatsoever which do not destroy us, are intended to save us; they are lancets which make a wound but to let forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the venome of our ulcers; when God slue twenty three thousand of the Assyrians for their fornication that was a finall justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their persons, and consigned them to a sad eternity: for beyond such an infliction there was no remedy. But when God sent lions to the Assyrian inhabitants of Samaria, and the judgements drave them to inquire after the manner of the God of the land, and they sent for Priests from Jerusalem to teach them how to worship the God of Israel, that was a mercy and a judgement too: the long forbearance of God who destroyed not at all the inhabitants, lead the rest into repentance.</p>

And I must make this observation to you; That when things come to this passe that God is forced to the last remedies of judgements, this long-sufferance will little or nothing concern particular persons, but nations and communities of men: for those who are smitten with judgement if God takes his hands off again and so opens a way for their repentance by prolonging their time; that comes under the second part of Gods method, <hi>the</hi>

But concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whole nations, or communities of men this long-sufferance is a Sermon of repentance; loud, clamorous, and highly argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. When God suffered the mutinies, the affronts, the base: nesse, and ingratitude, the follies, and relapses of the children of Israel, who murmured against God ten times in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, God sent evil angels among them, and fiery serpents, and pestilence, and fire from heaven, and prodigies from the earth, and a prevailing sword of the enemies, and in all these accidents, although some innocent persons felt the contingencies and variety of mortality, yet those wicked persons who fell by the designe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Gods anger, were made examples unto others and instances of Gods forbearance to the Nation: and yet this forbearance was such that although God preserved the Nation in being and in title to the first promises, yet all the particular persons that came from Egypt died in the wildernesse, two onely excepted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And I desire you to observe this, that you may truly estimate the arts of the Divine justice and mercy: For all the world being one continuall and intire argument of the Divine mercy, we are apt to abuse that mercy to vain confidences and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; First, mistaking the end, as if Gods mercy would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> indulgent to our sin, to which it is the greatest enemy in the world, for it is a certain truth that the mercy of God is as great an enemy to sin as his justice is, and as Gods justice is made the hand-maid of his mercy to cure sin, so it is the servant also and the instrument to avenge our despight and contempt of mercy; and in all the way where a difference can be there, justice is the lesse principall. And it were a great signe of folly and a huge mistake to think our Lord and friends do us offices of kindnesse, to make themselves more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of affronts; and that our fathers care over us, and provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for us can tempt us to disobey them: The very purpose of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> those emanations is, that their love may return in duty, and their providence be the parent of our prudence, and their care be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with our piety, and then we shall all be crowned, and shall return like the yeer, the ends into its own circle; and the fathers and the children, the benefactours and the beneficiary shall knit

                  <p n="3">3 For if God suffers men to go on in sins and punishes them not, it is not a mercy, it is not a forbearance; it is a hardning them, a consigning them to ruine, and reprobation; and themselves give the best argument to prove it; for they continue in their sin, they multiply their iniquity, and every day grow more enemy to God, and that is no mercy that increases their hostility and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with God. A prosperous iniquity, is the most unprosperous condition in the whole world; <hi>when he slew them, that sought him, and turned them early and enquired after God:</hi> but as long as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon their enemies then <hi>they forgat that God was their strength and the high God was their redeemer.</hi> It was well observed by the Persian Embassadour of old, when he was telling the King a sad sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the overthrow of all his army by the Athenians; he addes this of his own; that the day before the fight, the young Persian gallants being confident they should destroy their enemies, were drinking drunk, and railing at the timerousnesse and fears of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and against all their Gods, saying, there were no such things, and that all things came by chance, &amp; industry, nothing by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the supreme power. But the next day when they had fought unprosperously and flying from their enemies, who were eager in their pursuit, they came to the river <hi>strymon,</hi> which was so frozen, that their boats could not lanch, and yet it began to thaw, so that they feared the ice would not bear them. Then you should see the bold gallants that the day before said there was no God, most timorously and superstitiously fall upon their faces and begged of God that the river strymon might bear them over from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their enemies. What wisdom and Philosophy and perpetual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and revelation and promises and blessings cannot do, a mighty fear can; it can allay the confidences of a bold lust, and an imperious sin, and soften our spirit into the lownesse of a Childe, our revenge into the charity of prayers, our impudence into the blushings of a chidden girle; and therefore God hath taken a course proportionable: for he is not so unmercifully merciful, as to give milk to an infirm lust, and hatch the egge to the bignesse of a coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice: and therefore observe how it is, that Gods mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> over all his works; it is even then when nothing can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, but his judgements. For as when a famin had been in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in the dayes of Ahab for three years and a half, when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry prophet Elijah met the King and presently a great winde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, and the dust blew into the eyes of them that walked abroad, and the face of the heavens was black and all tempest, yet then the

prophet was the most gentle, and God began to forgive, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heavens were more beautiful, then when the Sun puts on the brightest ornaments of a bridegrome going from his chambers of the east: so it is in the Oeconomy of the divine mercy; when God makes our faces black and the windes blow so loud till the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage cracks, and our gay fortunes split, and our houses are dressed with Cypresse and yew, <hi>and the mourners go about the streets,</hi> this is nothing but the <hi>pompa misericordiae,</hi> this is the funeral of our sins, dressed indeed with emblems of mourning, and proclaimed with sad accents of death, but the sight is refreshing, as the beauties of the <hi>field, which God hath blessed,</hi> and the founds are healthful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as the noise of a physitian.</p>
                  <p>This is that riddle spoken of in the psalme, <hi>Calix in manu</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 94. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Dom. vini meri plenus misto; the pure impure, the mingled unmingled cup;</hi> for it is a cup in which God hath poured much of his severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and anger, and yet it is pure and unmingled; for it is all mercy: and so the riddle is resolved, and our cup is full and made more wholsome <hi>lymphatum crescit, dulcescit, laedere nescit,</hi> it is some justice and yet it is all mercy; <hi>the very justice of God being an act of mercy,</hi> a forbearance of the man, or the nation, and the punishing the sin. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Thus it was in the case of the children of Israel, when they ran af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bleating of the idolatrous calves, Moses prayed passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and God heard his prayer, and forgave their sin upon them. And this was Davids observation of the manner of Gods mercy to them; <note place="margin">Psal. 98. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou wast a God and forgavest them, though thou tookest veangeance of their inventions:</hi> for Gods mercy is given to us by parts; and to certain purposes; sometimes God onely so forgives us, that he does not cut us off in the sin, but yet layes on a heavy load of judgements: so he did to his people, when he sent them to schoole under the discipline of 70 years captivity; somtimes he makes a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> judgement lesse and forgives in respect of the degree of the infliction; he strikes more gently; and whereas God had designed it may be the death of thy self or thy neerest relative he is content to take the life of a childe, and so he did to David when he forbore him. <hi>the Lord hath taken away thy sin, thou shalt not die, neverthelesse the childe that is born unto thee that shall die:</hi> sometimes he puts the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil off to a further day, as he did in the case of Ahab, and Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah: to the first he brought the evil upon his house, and to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he brought the evil upon his kingdom, in his sons dayes; God forgiving onely so as to respite the evil, that they should have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> peace in their own dayes. And thus when we have committed a sin, against God, which hath highly provoked him to anger, even upon our repentance we are not sure to be forgiven, so as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand forgivenes; that is, to hear no more of it, never to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account; but we are happy, if God so forgives us, as not to throw us into the insufferable flames of hell, though he smite us
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50231:262"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> still we groan for our misery <hi>till we chatter like a swallow</hi> (as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide expression is) and though David was an excellent penitent, yet after he had lost the childe begotten of Bathsheba, and God had told him he had forgiven him, yet he raised up his darling son against him, and forced him to an inglorious flight, and his son lay with his Fathers concubins in the face of all Israel: so that when we are forgiven, yet it is ten to one, but GOD will make us to smart <hi>and roar for our sinnes, for the very disquietnesse of our souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if we sin and ask God forgivenesse and then are quiet, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feele so little inconvenience in the trade that we may more easily be tempted to make a trade of it indeed. I wish to God that for every sin we have committed, we should heartily cry God mercy and leave it, and judge our selves for it to prevent Gods anger, but when we have done all that we commonly call repentance, and when pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly God hath forgiven us to some purposes, yet it may be he punishes our sin when we least think of it; that sin which we have long since forgotten. It may be for the lust of thy youth thou had a healthlesse old age; an old religious person long agoe complained, it was his case.</p>

                  <p>It may be thy sore eyes are the punishment of thy intemperance seven years ago, or God cuts thy dayes shorter and thou shalt die in a florid age, or he raises up afflictions to thee in thine own house, in thine own bowels, or hath sent a gangren into thy estate, or with any arrow out of his quiver he can wound thee, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> arrow shall stick fast in thy flesh, although God hath forgiven thy sin to many purposes. Our blessed Saviour was heard in all that he prayed for (said the Apostle) and he prayed for the Jews, that crucified him: Father forgive them for they know not what they do, and God did forgive that great sin, but how far? whereas it was just in God to deprive them of all possibility of receiving benefit from the death of Christ, yet God admitted them to it, he gave them time and possibilities, and helps, and great advantages to bring them to repentance; he did not presently shut them up, in his final and eternal anger: and yet he had finally resolved to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> destroy their city and nation and did so, but forbore them forty years, &amp; gave them al the helps of miracles and sermons apostolical to shame them, and force them into sorrow for their fault. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any man can repent God hath forgiven the man in one degree of forgivenesse; for he hath given him grace of repentance and taken from him that final anger of the spirit of reprobation; and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50231:263"/>
when a man hath repented, no man can say that God hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him to all purposes, but he hath reserves of anger to punish the sin, to make the man affraid to sin any more, and to represent that when any man hath sinned what ever he does afterwards he shall be miserable as long as he lives, vexed with its adherencies and its neighbour-hood, and evil consequence. For as no man that hath sinned, can during his life ever returne to an integral and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect innocence: so neither shall he be restored to a perfect peace, but must alwayes watch and strive against his sinne, and alwayes mourn and pray for its pardon, and alwayes finde cause to hate it by knowing himself to be for ever in danger of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> some grievous calamity, even for those sinnes for which he hath truely repented him, for which God hath in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious degrees passed his pardon; this is the manner of the dispensation of the divine mercy in respect of particular persons, and nations too.</p>
                  <p>But sometimes we finde a severer judgement happening upon a people, and yet in that sad story, Gods mercy sings the triumph which although it be much to Gods glory, yet it is a sad story to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning people. 600000. fighting men besides women and children, and decrepit persons, came out of Egypt and God destroyed them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all in the wildernesse except Caleb and Joshuah, and there it was that <hi>Gods mercy prevailed over his justice,</hi> that he did not destroy the nation; but still preserved a succession to Jacob, to possesse the promise. God <hi>drowned all the world except eight persons</hi> his mercy there also <hi>prevailed over his justice,</hi> that he preserved a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to mankinde; his justice devoured all the world, and his mercy which preserved but eight, had the honour of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing attribute. God destroyed Sodom, and the five cities of the plain, and rescued but four from the flames of that sad burning, and of the four lost one in the flight and yet his mercy prevailed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his justice, because he did not destroy all.</p>
                  <p>And in these senses we are to understand the excellency of the divine mercy even when he smites, when <hi>he rebukes us for sin,</hi> when he makes <hi>our beauty to fail</hi> and <hi>our flesh to consume away like a moth fretting a garment,</hi> yet then his mercy is the prevailing ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. If his judgements be but fines set upon our heads accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mercy of our old lawes, <hi>Salvo contenemento,</hi> so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our estates, to continue our hopes and possibilities of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and all the other judgements can be nothing but mercies, excellent instruments of grace arts to make us sober and wise, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> take off from our vanity to restrain our wildnesses, which if they were left unbridled would set all the world on fire, Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ars like the censures of the Church in which a sinner is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to Satan to be buffetted <hi>that the spirit may be saved;</hi> the result of all this, is, that Gods mercies are not, ought not, cannot

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be, instruments of confidence to sin, because the very purpose of his mercy is to the contrary, and the very manner of his Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and dispensation is such that Gods mercy goes along in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection and conjunction with his judgements; the riches of his forbearance is this, that he forbears to throw us into hell, and sends the mercies of his rod to chide us unto repentance, and the mercies of his rod to punish us for having sinned, and that when we have sinned we may never think our selves secured, nor ever be reconciled to such dangers and deadly poisons. This, this is the manner of the divine mercy. Go now fond man, and because God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> presume to sin, as heaving grounds to hope that thou mayest sin and be safe all the way. If this hope (shall I call it) or sordid flattery could be reasonable, then the mercies of God would not leade us to repentance; so unworthy are we in the sense and largenesse of a wide fortune and pleasant accident.

                  <p>The use of all the premises is, that which Saint Paul expresses in the text, that <hi>we do not despise all this:</hi> and he onely despises <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not, who serves the ends of God in all these designes of mercy, that is, he that repents him of his sins. But there are a great many despisers all they that live in their sins, they that have more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings then they can reckon houres in their lives, that are courted by the divine favour and woed to salvation, as if mankinde were to give, not to receive so great a blessing, all they that answer not to so friendly summons, they are despisers of Gods mercies: and although God overflows with mercies and does not often leave us to the onely hopes of being cured by unctions and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cataplasmes, but proceeds further and gives us stibium or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> steele, sharp arrows of his anger, and the sword, and the hand of sicknesse, yet we are not sure of so much favour as to be entertained longer in Gods hospital, but may be thrust forth among the <hi>incurabili.</hi> Plutarch reports concerning swine that then optick nervs are so disposed to turne their eyes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

But however, then begins the first step of the judgement, and pungent misery, we are perishing people, or if not, yet at the last, not to be cured without the abscision of a member, without the cutting of a hand or leg; or the putting out of an eye: we must be cut to take the stone out of our hearts, and that is a state of a very great infelicity: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if we scape the stone, we cannot escape the surgeons knife; if we scape death, yet we have a sicknesse; and though that be a great mercy in respect of death, yet it is as great a misery in respect of health: and that is the first punishment for the despite done to the first, and most sensible mercies: we are fallen into a sicknesse, that cannot be cured but by disease and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>But if this despite runs further, and when the mercies look on us with an angry countenance, and that God gives us onely the mercy of a punishment, if we despise this too, we increase <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but our misery as we increase our sin: the summe of which is this, that if Pharaoh will not be cured by one plague, he shall have ten, and if ten will not do it, the great and tenth wave, which is far bigger then all the rest, the severest and the last arrow of the quiver, then we shall perish in the red sea, the sea of flames and blood, in which the ungodly shall roule e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.</p>
                  <p>But some of these despisers are such as are unmooved when God smites others; like Gallio when the Jews took Softhenes and beat him in the pleading place, he cared for none of these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> things; he was not concerned in that interest; and many Gallio's there are amongst us, that understand it not to be a part of the divine method, of Gods <hi>longsufferance</hi> to strike others to make us afraid. But however, we sleep in the midst of such alarums, yet know, that there is not one death in all the neighbour-hood, but is intended to thee; every crowing of the cock is to awake thee

But beyond this, some are despisers still, and hope to drown the noises of mount Sinai, the sound of Canons, of thunders, and lightnings, with a counternoise of revelling and clamorous roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with merry meetings; like the sacrifices to Moloch, they sound drums and trumpets, that they might not hear the sad shrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their children as they were dying in the cavety of the brazen idoll, and when their conscience shrikes out or murmurs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in a sad melancholy; or something that is dear to them is smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they attempt to drown it in a sea of drink, in the heathenish noises of idle and drunken company; and that which God sends to lead them to repentance, leads them to a taverne not to refresh their needs of nature, or for ends of a tolerable civility, or innocent purposes, but like the condemned persons among the Levantines, they tasted wine freely that they might die and be insensible.

                  <p>But grow in grace] Thats the remedy, and that would make us all wise and happy, blessed in this world, and sure of heaven: Concerning which, we are to consider first; what the estate of grace is, into which every one of us must be entred, that we may grow in it; secondly the proper parts, acts and offices of growing in grace, 3. The signes, consequences, and proper significations, by which if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive <hi>the growing,</hi> yet afterwards we may perceive that <hi>we are grown,</hi> and so judge of the state of our duty, and concerning our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> finall condition of being saved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the state of grace, I consider that no man can be said to be in the state of grace, who retaines an affection to any one sin. The state of pardon and the divine favour, begins at the first instance of anger against our crimes, when we leave our fondnesses and kinde opinions, when we excuse them not, and will not endure their shame; when we feele the smarts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their evil consequents; for he that is a perfect lover of sin, and is <hi>sealed up to a reprobate sense,</hi> endures all that sin brings along with it, and is reconciled to all its mischiefes, can suffer the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his own drunkennesse, and yet call it pleasure, he can wait like a slave to serve his lust, and yet count it no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he can suffer the dishonour of being accounted a base and dishonest person, and yet look confidently, and think himself no worse. But when the grace of God begins to work upon a mans spirit, it makes the conscience nice and tender and although the sin as yet does not displease the man, but he can endure the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and alluring part, yet he will not endure to be used so ill by his sin; he will not be abused and dishonoured by it; But because God hath so allayed the pleasures of his sin, that he that drinks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the sweet should also strain the dregs through his throat, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Gods grace doth irreconcile the convert, and discovers, first its base attendance, then its worse consequents, then the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, that here commences the first resolutions of leaving the sin, and trying if in the service of God, his spirit and the whole appetite of man may be better entertained. He that is thus far entred shall quickly perceive the difference, and meet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enough to invite him further; For then God treats the man as he treated the spies, that went to discover the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he ordered the year in plenty and directed them to a pleasant and a fruitful place, and prepared bunches of grapes of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and prodigious greatnesse that they might report good things of Canaan, and invite the whole nation to attempt its conquest: so Gods grace represents to the new converts and the weak ones in faith the pleasures and first deliciousnesses of religion: and when
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50231:268"/>
they come to spie the good things of that way that leads to heaven, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they presently perceive themselves cased of the load of an evil conscience, of their fears of death, of the confusion of their shame, and Gods spirit gives them a cup of sensible comfort, and makes them to rejoyce in their prayers, and weep with pleasures ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with innocent passions, and religious changes; and although God does not deal with all men in the same method, or in manners that can regularly be described, and all men do not feele, or do not observe, or cannot for want of skill discern such accidental sweetnesses, and pleasant grapes at his first entrance into religion: yet God to every man does minister excellent arguments of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and such that if a man will attend to them they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly move either his affections or his will, his fancy or his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and most commonly both: But while the spirit of God is doing this work of man, man must also be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>fellow worker with God,</hi> he must entertain the spirit, attend his inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, receive his whispers, obey all his motions, invite him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and utterly renounce all confederacy with his enemy, sin; at no hand suffering any <hi>root of bitternesse to spring up,</hi> not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himself any reserve of carnal pleasure, no clancular lust, no private oppressions, no secret covetousnesse, no love to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> world that may discompose his duty; for if a man prayes all day and at night is intemperate if he spends his time in reading, and his recreation be sinful; if he studies religion, and practises self interest; if he leaves his swearing and yet retaines his pride; if he becomes chast and yet remains peevish and imperious; this man is not changed from the state of sin, into the first stage of the state of grace: he does at no hand belong to God, he hath suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be scared from one sin, and tempted from another by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and hath left a third, by reason of his inclination, and a fourth for shame, or want of opportunity: But the spirit of God hath not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet planted one perfect plant there; God may make use of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally prepared advantages. But as yet the spirit of God hath not begun the proper and direct work of grace in his heart, But when we leave every sin, when we resolve never to return to the chaines, when we have no love for the world, but such as may be a servant of God; then I account that we are entred into a state of grace, from whence I am now to begin to reckon the commencement of this precept, <hi>grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And now the first part of this duty is <hi>to make religion to be</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>the businesse of our lives;</hi> for this is the great instrument, which will naturally produce our growth in grace, and the perfection of a Christian. For a man cannot after a state of sin be instantly a Saint: the work of heaven is not done by a flash of lightning, or a dash of affectionate raine, or a few tears of a relenting pity; God
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50231:268"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and his Church have appointed holy intervals, and have taken por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our time for religion, that we may be called off from the world, and remember the end of our creation, and do honour to God, and think of heaven with hearty purposes and peremptory designes to get thither. But as we must not neglect those times which God hath reserved for his service, or the Church hath pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently decreed, nor yet act religion upon such dayes with forms and outsides, or to comply with customs; or to seem religious; so we must take care that all the other portions of our time be hallowed with little retirements of all thoughts, and short conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with God; and all along be guided with a holy intention, that even our works of nature may passe into the relations of grace, and the actions of our calling may help towards the obtaining <hi>the price of our high calling;</hi> while our eatings are actions of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, our labours are profitable our humiliations are acts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and our almes are charity: our marriages are chast, and <hi>whether we eat or drink, sleep or wake we may do all to the glory of God,</hi> by <hi>a direct intuition</hi> or by a reflex act, by designe or by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, by fore sight or by an after election: and to this purpose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we must not look upon religion as our trouble, and our hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; nor think almes chargeable or expensive; nor our fastings vexatious and burdensom; nor our prayers a wearinesse of spirit; But we must make these and all other the dutis of religion, our imployments, our care the work and end for which we came into the world; and remember that we never do the work of men, nor serve the ends of God, nor are in the proper imployment and businesse of our life, but when we worship God or live like wise or sober persons, or do benefit to our brother.</p>
                  <p>I will not turne this discourse into a reproofe, but leave it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as a duty: Remember that God sent you into the world for religion; we are but to passe through our pleasant fields, or our hard labours; but to lodge a little while in our faire palaces or our meaner cottages; but to bait in the way at our full tables or with our spare diet; but then onely, man does his proper imployment, when he prayes and does charity, and mortifies his unruly appetites, and restrains his violent passions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like to God, and imitates his holy Son, and writes after the coppies of Apostles, and Saints. Then he is dressing himself for eternity, where he must dwell or abide, either in an excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atifical <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> country, or in a prison of amazment and eternal horrour: And after all this, you may if you please call to minde, how much time you allovv to God and to your souls every day, or every moneth, or in a year if you please; for I fear the account of the time is soon made; but the account for the neglect, vvill be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And it vvill not easily be ansvvered, that all our dayes and years are little enough to attend perishing things, and to be svval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50231:269"/>
up in avaritious and vain attendances, and we shall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to religion with a zeal so great as is our revenge, or as is the hunger of one meale. Without much time, and a wary life, and a diligent circumspection, we cannot mortify our sins, or do the first works of grace. I pray God we be not found to have grown like the sinnews of old age, from strength to remisnesse, from thence to dissolution, and infirmity and death; Menedemus was wont to say that the young boyes that went to Athens the first year were <hi>wise men,</hi> the second year, <hi>Philosophers,</hi> the third, <hi>Orators,</hi> and the fourth were but <hi>Plebeians</hi> and understood nothing but their own ignorance. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And just so it happens to some in the progresses of religion: at first they are violent and active; and then they satiate all the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of religion; and that which is left, is, that they were soon weary, and sat down in displeasure, and return to the world and dwell in the businesse of pride, or mony; and by this time they understand that their religion is declined, and passed from the heats and follies of youth, to the coldnesse and infirmities of old age; The remedies of which is onely a diligent spirit and a busie religion a great industry &amp; a full portion of time in holy offices; that as the Oracle said to the Cirrheans, <hi>noctes diesque belligeran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they could not be happy unlesse they waged war night and day: that is, unlesse we perpetually fight against our own vices; and repell our Ghostly enemies, and stand upon our guard, we must stand for ever in the state of babes, in Christ, or else return to the first imperfections of an unchristened soul, and an unsanctified spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Thats the first particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second step of our growth in grace is, <hi>when vertues grow habitual,</hi> apt and easie in our manners, and dispositions. For although many new converts have a great zeal, and a busie spirit, apt enough as they think to contest against all the difficulties of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> spiritual life, yet they meet with such powerful oppositions from without, and a false heart within, that their first heats are soon broken, and either they are for ever discouraged, or are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to march more slowly and proceed more temperately for ever after.</p>

                  <p>Now, the spirit of grace is like a new soul within him, and he hath new appetites and new pleasures, when the things of the world grow unsavory and the things of religion are delicious; when his temptations to his old crimes return but seldom, and they prevail not at all, or in very inconsiderable instances, and stay not at all, but are reproached with a penitentiall sorrow, and speedy amendment; when we do actions of vertue quickly, frequently, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and with delight: then we have grown in grace in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which they can perceive these excellent dispositions. Some persons there are who dare not sin: they dare not omit their hours of prayer; and they are restlesse in their spirits till they have done; but they go to it as to execution; they stay from it as long as they can, and they drive like Pharoahs charets with the wheels off, sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavily: and besides that such persons have reserved to themselves, the best part of their sacrifice, and do not give their will to God, they do not love him with all their heart; they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> also soonest tempted to retire and fall off. <hi>Sextius Romanus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the honours and offices of the city, and betook himself to the severity of a Philosophical life. But when his unusual diet and hard labour began to pinch his flesh, and he felt his propositions smart, and that which was fine in discourse at a Symposiack, or an Academical dinner, began to sit uneasily upon him in the practise; he so despaired that he had like to have cast himself into the sea, to appease the labours of his religion; Because he never had gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to think it a fine thing to be a wise man: he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, but he was loth to pay for it at the price that God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Philosopher sot upon it. But he that is <hi>grown in grace</hi> and hath made religion habitual to his spirit, is not at ease but when he is doing the works of the new man, he rests in religion and comforts his sorrows with thinking of his prayers, and in all crosses of the world he is patient, because his joy is at hand to refresh him when he list, for he cares not so he may serve God: and if you make him poor here, he is rich there, and he counts that to be his proper <hi>service,</hi> his <hi>worke,</hi> his <hi>recreation,</hi> and <hi>reward.</hi>

But because in the course of holy living, although the duty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be regular and constant, yet the sensible relishes and the flowrings of affections, the zeal and the visible expressions do not alwayes make the same emission; but sometimes by designe, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by order, sometimes by affection we are more busie; more intire, and more intent upon the actions of religion; in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we are to judge of our growth in grace, if after every interval of exraordinary piety, the next return be more devout and more

Are your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions more frequent? and when they are, do ye approach neerer to God? have you made firmer resolutions and entertained more hearty purposes of amendment? Do you love God more dutifully and your neighbour with a greater charity? do you not so easily return to the world as formerly? are not you glad when the thing is done? do you go to your secular accounts with a more weaned affection then before? if you communicate well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is certain, that you will still do it better: if you do not communicate well, every opportunity of doing it is but a new trouble, easily excused, readily omitted, done because it is necessary, but not because we love it: and we shall finde that such persons in their old age do it worst of all; And it was observed by a Spanish Confessor, who was also a famous preacher, that in persons not very religious, the confessions which they made upon their deathbed were the coldest, the most imperfect, and with lesse contrition then all that he had observed them to make in many years before. For so the Canes of Egypt when they newly arise from their bed of mud and slime of Nilus, start up into an equal and continual length, and are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but with few knots, and are strong and beauteous with great distances, and intervals: but when they are grown to their full length they lessen into the point of a pyramis, and multiply their knots and joynts, interrupting the finenesse and smoothnesse of its body: so are the steps &amp; declensions of him that does not grow in grace: at first when he springs up from his impurity, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of baptisme and repentance, he grows straight and strong, and suffers but few interruptions of piety, and his constant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of religion are but rarely intermitted; till they ascend up to a full age or towards the ends of their life, then they are weak and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their devotions often intermitted, and their breaches are frequent, and they seek excuses, and labour for dispensations, and love God and religion lesse and lesse, till their old age instead of a crown of their vertue and perseverance ends in levity and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courses; light and uselesse as the tufted feathers upon the cane, every winde can play with it and abuse it, but no man can make it useful. When therefore our piety interrupts its greater and more solemn expressions, and upon the return of the greater offices, and bigger solemnities we finde them to come upon our spirits like the wave of a tide, which retired onely because it was natural so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to do and yet came further upon the strand at the next rolling; When every new confession, every succeeding communion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time of separation for more solemn and intense prayer is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spent and more affectionate, leaving a greater relish upon the spirit, and possessing greater portions of our affections, our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

                  <p n="4">4. To discern our growth in grace, we must inquire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our passions, whether they be mortified and quiet, comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our ends of vertue and under command. For since the passions are the matter of vertue and vice respectively, he that hath brought into his power all the strengths of the enemy, and the forts from whence he did infest him, he onely hath secured his holy walking with God. But because this thing is never perfectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> done, and yet must alwayes be doing, grace grows according as we have finished our portions of this work. And in this we must not onely inquire concerning our passions, whether they be sinfull and habitually prevalent; for if they be, we are not in the state of grace; But whether they return upon us in violences and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies, in transportation and unreasonable, and imprudent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; for although <hi>a good man</hi> may be incident to a violent passion, and that without sin, yet <hi>a perfect man</hi> is not; a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Christian hath seldom such sufferings; to suffer such things sometimes may stand with <hi>the being of vertue,</hi> but not with <hi>its</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>security:</hi> For if passions range up and down and transport us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and violently, we may keep in our forts, and in our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but our enemy is master of the field, and our vertues are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, and apt to be starved, and will not hold out long; <hi>a good man</hi> may be spotted with a violence, but <hi>a wise man</hi> will not: and he that does not adde <hi>wisedom</hi> to his <hi>vertue,</hi> the <hi>knowledge of Jesus Christ</hi> to his vertuous habits, will be a good man but till a storm comes. But beyond this, inquire after the state of your passions, in actions of religion: Some men fast to mortifie their lust, and their fasting makes them peevish: some reprove a vice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but they do it with much inpatience; some charitably give excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent counsell, but they do that also with a pompous and proud spirit; and passion being driven from open hostilities, is forced to march along in the retinue and troops of vertue: And although this be rather a deception and a cosenage then an imperfection; and supposes a state of sin rather then an imperfect grace; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it tacitly and secretly creeps along among the circumstances of pious actions, as it spoils a vertue in some, so it lessens it in others, and therefore is considerable also in this question.</p>
                  <p>And although no man must take accounts of his <hi>being in, or</hi>

                     <hi>out of the state of grace,</hi> by his being dispassionate, and free from all the assaults of passion, yet as to the securing his being in the state of grace, he must provide that he be not a slave of passion, so <hi>to declare his growth in grace,</hi> he must be sure to take the measures of his affections, and see that they be lessened; more apt to be suppressed; not breaking out to inconvenience and imprudencies,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50231:271"/>
not rifling our spirit and drawing us from our usuall and more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sober tempers. Try therefore if your fear be turned into caution, your lust into chast friendships, your imperious spirit into prudent government, your revenge into justice, your anger into charity, and your peevishnesse and rage, into silence and suppression of language. Is our ambition changed into vertuous and noble thoughts? can we emulate without envy? is our covetousnesse les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd into good husbandry, and mingled with alms, that we may certainly discern the love of money to be gone? do we leave to despise our inferiours, and can we willingly endure to admit him that excels us in any gift or grace whatsoever, and to commend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it without abatement, and mingling allayes with the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and disparagements to the man? If we be arrived but thus farre, it is well, and we must go further. But we use to think that all disaffections of the body are removed, if they be changed into the more tolerable, although we have not an athletick health, or the strength of porters or wrastlers: For although it be felicity to be quit of all passion, that may be sinfull or violent; and part of the happinesse of heaven shall consist in that freedom; yet our growth in grace consists in the remission and lessening of our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: onely he that is incontinent in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> lust, or in his anger, in his desires of money, or of honour, in his revenge, or in his fear, in his joyes, or in his sorrows, that man is not grown at all in the grace <hi>and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> This onely; in the scruting and consequent judgement concerning our passions, it will concern the curiosity of our care, to watch against passions in the reflex act; against pride, or lust, complacency, and peevishnesse attending upon vertue. For he was noted for a vain person, who being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for the cure of his pride (as he thought) cried out to his wife, <hi>Cerne Dionysia deposui fastum, behold I have laid aside all my pride:</hi> and of that very dream the silly man thought he had reason to boast; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but considered not that <hi>it</hi> was an act of pride, and levity besides. If thou hast given a noble present to thy friend, if thou hast rejected the unjust desire of thy Prince; if thou hast endured thirst and hunger for religion or continence; if thou hast refused an offer like that which was made to Joseph, sit down and rest in thy good conscience, and do not please thy self in opinions, and phantastick noises abroad, and do not despise him that did not do so as thou hast done; and reprove no man with an upbraiding circumstance: for it will give thee but an ill return, and a contemptible reward, if thou shalt over-lay thy infant-vertue, or drown it with a flood of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> breast-milk.</p>

HE is well grown in, or towards the state of grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who is more patient of a sharp reproof, then of a secret flattery. For a reprehension contains so much mortification to the pride and complacencies of a man; is so great an affront to an easie and undisturbed person, is so empty of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so full of profit, that he must needs love vertue in a great degree, who can take in that which onely serves her end, and is displeasant to himself, and all his gayeties. A severe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendor of anothers vice, comes dressed like Iacob when he went to cozen his brother of the blessing: his outside is rough and hairy, but the voice is Jacobs voice; rough hands, and a healthfull lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> get the blessing, even against the will of him that shall feel it; but he that is <hi>patient,</hi> and <hi>even,</hi> not apt to excuse his fault, that is lesse apt to anger, or to scorn him that snatches him rudely from the flames of hell, he is vertues Confessor, and suffers these lesser stripes for that interest which will end in spirituall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall benedictions.</p>
                  <p>They who are furious against their monitors are incorrigible: but it is one degree of meeknesse to suffer discipline: and a meek man cannot easily be an ill man, especially in the present instance: he appears, at least, to have a healthfull constitution; he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good flesh to heal; his spirit is capable of medicine, and that man can never be despaired of, who hath a disposition so neer his health as to improve all physick, and whose nature is relieved by every good accident from without. But that which I observe is, That this is not onely a good disposition towards repentance, and restitution, but is a signe of growth in grace, according as it becomes <hi>naturall, easie,</hi> and <hi>habituall.</hi> Some men chide themselves for all their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50231:272"/>
misdemeanours, because they would be represented to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and opinions of other men, with a fair Character, and such as need not to be reproved: others out of inconsideration sleep in their own dark rooms, and untill the charity of a Guide, or of a friend draws the curtain and lets in a beam of light, dream on untill the graves open, and hell devours them; But if they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by the grace of God, let down with a sheet of counsels and friendly precepts, they are presently inclined to be obedient to the heavenly monitions, but unlesse they be dressed with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of honour and civility, with arts of entertainment, and insinuation they are rejected utterly, or received unwillingly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Therefore although upon any termes, to endure a sharp reproof be a good signe of amendment; yet the growth of grace is not properly signified by every such sufferance: For when this dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition begins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amendment also begins, and goes on in proportion to the increment of this. To endure a reproof without adding a new sin is the first step to amendments, that is, to endure it without scorn, or hatred, or indignation. 2. The next is to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reproof without excusing our selves: For he that is apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himself is onely desirous in a civill manner to set the reproof aside, and to represent the charitable monitour to be too hasty in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his judgement, and deceived in his information; and the fault to dwell there, not with himself. 3. Then he that proceeds in this instance admits the reprovers sermon, or discourse, without a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate regret: he hath no secret murmurs. or unwillingnesses to the humiliation, but is onely ashamed that he should deserve it: but for the reprehension it self, that troubles him not; but he looks on it as his own medicine, and the others charity. 4. But if to this he addes, that he voluntary confesses his own fault, and of his own accord vomits out the loads of his own intemperance, and eases his spirit of the infection, then it is certain he is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a professed and hearty enemy against sin, but a zealous, and a prudent, and an active person against all its interest; and never counts himself at ease but while he rests upon the banks of <hi>Sion,</hi> or at the gates of the temple; never pleased but in vertue and religion: Then he knows the state of his soul, and the state of his danger, he reckons it no objection to be abased in the face of man, so he may be gracious in the eyes of God: And that's a signe of a good grace, and a holy wisdom; <hi>That man is grown in the grace of God,</hi> and <hi>in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

But Diogenes told him, <hi>Quanto magis intraveris tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to magis eris in cauponâ:</hi> The more you go back, the longer you are in the place where you are ashamed to be seen; and he that conceals his sin, still retains that which he counts his shame, and his burden.

I did the rather insist upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, because it is a consideration of huge concernment, and yet much neglected in all its instances and degrees.

For it is not onely inconsistent with the love of God, to entertain any undecency or beginning of a crime, any thing that displeases him, but he alwayes remembers how much it cost him to arrive at the state of good things, whether the grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of God hath already brought him: He thinks of the prayers and tears, his restlesse nights, and his daily fears, his late escape, and his present danger, the ruines of his former state, and the difficult and imperfect reparations of this new; his proclivity and aptnesse to, vice, and naturall aversnesse and uneasie inclinations to the strictnesse of holy living; and when these are considered truly, they naturally make a man unwilling to entertaine any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50231:273"/>
of a state of life contrary to that which with so much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and difficulty, through so many objections and enemies he hath attained. And the truth is, when a man hath escaped the dangers of his first state of sin, he cannot but be extreamly unwilling to return again thither, in which he can never hope for heaven: (and so it must be) for a man must not flatter himself in a small crime, and say as Lot did when he begged a reprieve for Zoar, <hi>Alas Lord, is it not a little one and my soul shall live?</hi> And it is not therefore to be entertained because it is little; for it is the more without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, if it be little; the temptations to it are not great; the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not mighty; the promises not insnaring, the resistance easie; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and a wise man considers, it is a greater danger to be overcome by a little sin, then by a great one; <hi>a greater danger</hi> (I say) not directly, but accidentally; not in respect of the crime, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the person: for he that cannot overcome a small crime, is in the state of infirmity, so great, that he perishes infallibly, when he is arrested by the sins of a stronger temptation: But he that easily can, and yet will not; he is in love with sin, and courts his danger, that he may at least kisse the apples of Paradise, or feast himself with the parings: since he is by some displeasing instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affrighted from glutting himself with the forbidden fruit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in ruder and bigger instances: But the well-grown Christian is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of his newly trimmed soul, and like a nice person with clean clothes, is carefull that no spot or stain sully the virgin whitenesse of his robe: whereas another whose <hi>albes of baptisme</hi> are sullied in many places with the smoak and filth of Sodom and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, cares not in what paths he treads, and a shower of dirt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not his state, who already lies wallowing in the puddles of impurity; It makes men negligent and easie, when they have an opinion or certain knowledge that they are persons extraordinary in nothing; that a little care will not mend them; that another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sin cannot make them much worse: But it is as a signe of a tender conscience, and a reformed spirit, when it is sensible of every al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, when an idle word is troublesom, when a wandering thought puts the whole spirit upon its guard; when too free a merriment is wiped off with a sigh and a sad thought, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere recollection, and a holy prayer: Polycletus was wont to say, That they had work enough to do, who were to make a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruious picture of clay and dirt, when they were to take accounts for the handling of mud and morter: A mans spirit is naturally carelesse of baser and uncostly materials; but if a man be to work <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in gold, then he will save the filings, and his dust, and suffer not a grain to perish: And when a man hath laid his foundations in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, he will not build vile matter, stubble and dirt upon it: So it is in the spirit of a man; If he have built upon the rock Christ Jesus, and is grown up to a good stature in Christ, he will

He that is grown in grace pursues vertue for its own interest, purely and simply without the mixture and allay of collateral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and equally inclining purposes; God in the beginning of our returns to him entertains us with promises and threatnings, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of temporal advantages, with fear and shame, and with reverence of friends and secular respects, with reputation and coercion of humane laws and at first men snatch at the lesser and lower ends of vertue and such rewards are visible, and which God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sometimes gives in hand to entertain our weak, and imperfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: The young Philosophers were very forward to get the precepts of their sect, and the rules of severity, that they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with Kings, not that they might reform their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and some men study to get the ears and tongues of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rather then to gain their souls to God; and they obey good laws, for fear of punishment, or to preserve their own peace; and some are worse they do good deeds out of spite, and <hi>preach Christ out of envy,</hi> or to lessen the authority and fame of others: some of these lessen the excellency of the act, others spoil it quite: it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in some, imperfect, in others, criminal; in some it is consistent with a beginning infant-grace, in others it is an argument of the state of sin and death: but in all cases, the well grown Christian, he that improoves or goes forward in his way to heaven, brings ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue forth, not into discourses and panegyrickes, but into his life and manners; his vertue although it serves many good ends acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally; yet by his intention it onely suppresses his inordinate passions, makes him temperate and chast, casts out his devils of drunkennesse and lust, pride and rage, malice and revenge: it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> makes him useful to his brother and a servant of God; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these flowers cannot choose but please his eye, and delight his smell, yet he chooses to gather honey, and licks up the dew of heaven and feasts his spirit upon the Manna, and dwells not in the collateral usages and accidental sweetnesses which dwell at the gates of the other senses, but like a Bee loads his thighs with

wax and his bag with honey; that is, with the useful parts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in order to holinesse and felicity. Of which the best signes and notices we can take will be if we as earnestly pursue vertues which are acted in private, as those whose scene lies in publick, If we pray in private, under the onely eye of God and his ministring angels as in Churches; if we give our almes in secret rather then in publick; if we take more pleasure in the just satisfaction of our consciences, and securing our reputation; if we rather pursue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence then seek an excuse; if we desire to please God, though we lose our fame with men; if we be just to the poorest servant as to the greatest prince, if we choose to be among the jewels of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God though we be the <gap reason="foreign">

And I doubt not but many good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons come to that growth of Charity that the goodnesse and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God are more incumbent and actually pressing upon their spirit then any considerations of reward: But then I shall adde this; that when persons come to that hight of grace (or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather) and they love God for himself and do their duties in order to the fruition of him and his pleasure; <hi>all that,</hi> is but heaven in another sense, and under another name; just as the mystical The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is the highest duty and the choicest parts of obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new method: but in order to the present, that which I call a signification of our growth in grace, is a pursuance of vertue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such reasons as are propounded to us, as motives in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (such as are to glorifie God, and to enjoy his promises in the way, and in our country, to avoid the displeasure of God, and to be united to his glories) and then to exercise vertue in such parts and to such purposes as are useful to good life, and profitable to our neighbours; not to such onely where they serve reputation, or secular ends. For though the great Physitian of our souls hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mingled profits and pleasures with vertue to make its chalice sweet and apt to be drank off, yet he that takes out the sweet ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and feasts his palate with the lesse wholsome part, because it is delicious, serves a low end of sense or interest, but serves not God at all; and as little does benefit to the soul: such a person is like Homers bird, deplumes himselfe to feather all the naked callows

The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of vertue to a good and perfect man are not like the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Nard Pistick, which is very delightful when the box is newly broken, but the want of it is no trouble; we are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without it; but vertue is like <hi>hunger and thirst</hi> it must be satisfied or we die; and when we feel great longings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter religion and faintings for want of holy nutriment, when a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the word and sacraments is more intolerable; and we think our selves really most miserable, when the Church doors are shut against us, or like the Christians in the persecution of the Vandals, who thought it worse then death, that there Bishops were taken from them; If we understand excommunication, or Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> censures (abating the disreputation and secular appendages) in the sense of the spirit to be a misery next to hell it self, then we have made a good progresse in the Charity and grace of God; till then we are but pretenders, or infants, or imperfect, in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which our affections are cold, and our desires remisse; For a constant and prudent zeal is the best testimony of our mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and vigorous heats, and an houre of fervour is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God then a moneth of luke-warmnesse, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency.</p>

R. Moses will not allow a man to be a true penitent untill he hath left all his sin, and in all the like circumstances refuses those temptations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which formerly he sinned and died: and indeed it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that such a trial onely can secure our judgement concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our selves: and although to be tried in all the same accidents be not safe, nor alwayes contingent, and in such cases it is sufficient to resist all the temptations we have, and avoid the rest and decree against all, yet if it please God we are tempted, as David was by his eyes, or the Martyrs by tortures, or Joseph by his wanton Mistris, then to stand sure and to ride upon the temptation like a ship upon a wave, or to stand like a rock in an impetuous storm, thats the signe of a great grace and of a well-grown Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>

No man is grown in grace but he that is ready for every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> work, that chooses not his employment, that refuses no imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God or his superiour; a ready hand, an obedient heart, and a willing cheerful soul in all the work of God and in every office of religion is a great <hi>index</hi> of a good proficient in the wayes of Godlinesse. The heart of a man is like a wounded hand or arme, which if it be so cured that it can onely move one way and cannot turn to all postures and natural uses it is but imperfect, and still half in health, and half wounded: so is our spirit; if it be apt for prayer and close sifted in almes, if it be sound in faith and dead in charity, if it be religious to God and unjust to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there wants some integral part, or there is a lamenesse; and the deficiency in any one duty implyes the guilt of all (said Saint James) and <hi>bonum exintegrâ causâ malum exquâlibet particulari,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very fault spoils a grace. But one grace alone cannot make a good man. But as to be universal in our obedience is necessary to the being in the state of grace: so readily to change imployment from

Can you be content to descend from ruling of a province to the keeping of a herd: from the work of an Apostle to be confined into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, from disputing before Princes to a conversation with Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds? can you be willing to all that God is willing, and suffer all that he chooses as willingly as if you had chosen your own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? In the same degree, in which you can conform to God, in the same you have approached towards that perfection whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we must by degrees arrive in our journey towards heaven.</p>
                  <p>This is not to be expected of <hi>beginners;</hi> for they must be enticed with apt imployments; and it may be, their office and work so fits their spirits, that it makes them first in love with it, and then with God for giving it; and many a man goes to heaven in the dayes of peace, whose faith, and hopes, and patience would have been dashed in pieces, if he had fallen into a storm or persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Oppression will make a wise man mad</hi> (saith Solomon): there are some usages that will put a sober person out of all patience, such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which are besides the customes of this life, and contrary to all his hopes, and unworthy of a person of his quality: and when <hi>Nero</hi> durst not die, yet when his servants told him that the Senators had condemned him to be put to death <hi>more Majorum,</hi> that is, by scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a slave, he was forced into a preternatural confidence, and fel upon his own sword; but when God so changes thy estate that thou art fallen into accidents to which thou art no otherwise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed, but by grace and a holy spirit, and yet thou canst passe through them with quietnesse, and do the work of suffering as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as the works of a prosperous imployment; this is an argument of a great grace and an extraordinary spirit. For many persons in a change of fortune perish, who if they had still been prosperous had gone to heaven; being tempted in a persecution to perjuries and Apostacy and unhandsome compliances, and hypocricy, and irreligion: and many men are brought to vertue, and to God, and to felicity by being persecuted and made unprosperous: and these are effects of a more absolute and irrespective predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but when the grace of God is great and prudent, and mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and well grown, it is unalter'd in all changes, save onely that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> every accident that is new and violent brings him neerer to God, and makes him with greater caution and severity to dwell in vertue.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Lastly, some there are who are firme in all great and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soen changes and have laid up in the store-houses of the spirit <hi>(reason and religion)</hi> arguments and discourses enough to defend
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50231:276"/>
them against all violencies and stand at watch so much, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they are safe where they can consider, and deliberate; but there may be something wanting yet; and in the direct line, in the strait progresse to heaven, I call that an infallible signe of a great grace, and indeed the greatest degree of a great grace, when a man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared against sudden invasions of the spirit, surreptions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary assaults: Many a valiant person dares sight a battle who yet will be timorous and surprised in a mid-night alarme; or if he falls into a river; And how many discreet persons are there, who, if you offer them a sin, and give them time to consider, and tell them of it before hand, will rather die then be perjured, or tell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a deliberate lie, or break a promise; who (it may be) tell many sudden lies, and excuse themselves, and break their promises, and yet think themselves safe enough; and sleep without either affrightments, or any apprehension of dishonour done to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or their religion. Every man is not armed for all sudden ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of passions: few men have cast such fetters upon their lusts and have their passions in so strict confinement, that they may not be over run with a midnight flood or an unlooked for inundation; He that does not start when he is smitten suddenly, is a constant person: and that is it which I intend in this instance; that he is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a perfect man and well grown in grace, who hath so habitual a resolution and so unhasty and wary a spirit, as that he decrees up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no act before he hath considered maturely, and changed the sudden occasion into a sober counsel. David by chance spied Bathsheba washing her self, and being surprised, gave his heart away before he could consider, and when it was once gone, it was hard to recover it; and sometimes a man is betrayed by a sudden opportunity and all things fitted for his sin ready at the door; the act stands in all its dresse, and will not stay for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear; and incosideration is the defence and guard of the sin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and makes that his conscience can the more easily swallow it what shall the man do then? unlesse he be strong by his old strengths, by a great grace, by an habitual vertue, and a sober unmoved spirit, he falls and dies in the death and hath no new strengths; but such as are to be imployed for his recovery; none for his present guard; unlesse upon the old stock, and if he be a well grown Christian.</p>
                  <p>These are the parts, acts, and offices of our growing in grace, and yet I have sometimes called them signes; but they are signes, as eating and drinking are signes of life, they are <hi>signes</hi> so as also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they are <hi>parts of life;</hi> and these are parts of our growth in grace, so that a man can grow in grace to no other purpose but to these or the like improvements.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which I have a caution or two to interpose. 1. The growth of grace is to be estimated as other morall things are, not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50231:276"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> according to the growth of things naturall: Grace does not grow by observation, and a continuall efflux, and a constant proportion; and a man cannot call himself to the account for the growth of every day, or week, or moneth; but in the greater portions of our life in which we have had many occasions and instances to exercise and improve our vertues, we may call our selves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but it is a snare to our consciences to be examined in the growth of grace in every short resolution of solemn duty, as against every Communion, or great Festivall. 2. Growth in grace is not alwayes to be discerned either <hi>in single instances,</hi> or <hi>in single gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Not in single instances; for every time we are to exercise a vertue, we are not in the same naturall dispositions, nor do we meet with the same circumstances, and it is not alwayes necessary that the next act should be more earnest and intence then the former; <hi>all single acts</hi> are to be done after the manner of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not alwayes capable of increasing; and they have their termes beyond which easily they cannot swell: and therefore if it be a good act and zealous, it may proceed from a well grown grace, and yet a younger and weaker person may do some acts as great and as religious as it; But neither do single graces alwayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> affoord a regular and certain judgement in this affair; for some persons at the first, had rather die then be unchast, or perjured: and <hi>greater love then this no man hath, that he lay down his life</hi> for God: he cannot easily grow in the substance of that act; and if other persons, or himself, in processe of time do it more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or with fewer fears, it is not alwayes a signe of a greater grace, but some times of greater collaterall assistances, or a better habit of body, or more fortunate circumstances: for he that goes to the block tremblingly for Christ, and yet endures his death certainly, and endures his trembling too, and runs through all his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the bigger temptations; looks not so well many times in the eyes of men, but suffers more for God, then those confident Martyrs that courted death in the primitive Church; and therefore may be much dearer in the eyes of God: But that which I say in this particular, is that a smallnesse in one, is not an argument of the imperfection of the whole estate: Because God does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes give to every man occasions to exercise, and therefore not <hi>to improve</hi> every grace; and the passive vertues of a Christian are not to be expected to grow so fast in prosperous, as in suffering Christians: but in this case we are to take accounts of our selves by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the improvement of those graces which God makes to happen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our lives; such as are charity and temperance in young men, liberality and religion in aged persons, ingenuity and humility in schollers, justice in merchants and artificers, forgivenesse of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in great men, and persons tempted by law-suits; for since ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues grow like other morall habits, by use; diligence, and assiduity,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50231:277"/>
there where God hath appointed our work and in our instances, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there we must consider concerning our growth in grace, in other things we are but beginners: But it is not likely that God will trie us concerning degrees hereafter, in such things of which in this world he was sparing to give us opportunities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be carefull to observe that these rules are not all to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>negatively,</hi> but <hi>positively,</hi> and <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that is, that a man may conclude that he is grown in grace if he observes these characters in himself, which I have here discoursed of; but he must not conclude <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is not grown in grace, if he cannot observe such signall testimonies: for sometimes God covers the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> graces of his servants, and hides the beauty of his tabernacle with goats hair, and the skins of beasts, that he may rather suffer them to want present comfort, then the grace of humility; for it is not necessary to preserve the gayeties and their spirituall pleasures; but if their humility fails, (which may easily do under the sunshine of conspicuous and illustrious graces) their vertues and themselves perish in a sad declension. But sometimes men have not skill to make a judgement; and all this discourse seems too artificiall to be tried by in the hearty purposes of religion. Sometimes they let passe much of their life, even of their better dayes, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of particulars; sometimes their cases of conscience are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, or allayed with unavoydable infirmities; sometimes they are so uninstructed in the more secret parts of religion, and there are so many illusions and accidentall miseariages, that if we shall conclude negatively in the present Question, we may produce scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples infinite, but understand nothing more of our estate, and do much lesse of our duty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In considering concerning our growth in grace, let us take more care to consider matters that concern justice, and charity, then that concern the vertue of religion: because in this there may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be <hi>much,</hi> in the other there cannot easily be <hi>any illusion,</hi> and cose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. That is a good religion that beleeves, and trusts, and hopes in God through Jesus Christ, and for his sake does all justice, and all charity, that he can; and our Blessed Lord gives no other deseripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love to God, but obedience and keeping his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Justice and charity are like the matter, religion is the form of Christianity; but although the form be more noble and the principle of life, yet it is lesse discernable, lesse materiall, and lesse sensible; and we judge concerning the form by the matter, and by materiall accidents, and by actions: and so we must of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that is of our love to God, and of the efficacy of our prayers, and the usefulnesse of our fastings; we must make our judgements by the more materiall parts of our duty, that is, by sobriety, and by justice, and by charity.</p>
                  <p>I am much prevented in my intention for the perfecting of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50231:277"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this so very materiall consideration: I shall therefore onely tell you, that to these parts and actions of good life, or of our growth in grace, some have added some accidentall considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are rather signes then parts of it: Such are. 1. To praise all good things, and to study to imitate what we praise. 2. To be impatient that any man should excell us; not out of envy to the person, but of noble emulation to the excellency; For so Themistocles could not sleep after the great victory at Marathon purchased by Miltiades; till he had made himself il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious by equall services to his countrey. 3. The bearing of sicknesse patiently, and ever with improvement, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of some excellent principle, and the firm pursuing it. 4. Great devotion, and much delight in our prayers. 5. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inspirations, and often whispers of the Spirit of God prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting us to devotion, and obedience, especially if we adde to this, a constant and ready obedience to all those holy invitations. 6. Offering peace to them that have injured me, and the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the circumstances of honour, or of right, when either justice, or charity, is concerned in it. 7. Love to the brethren. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 8. To behold our companions, or our inferiours full of honour and fortune; and if we sit still at home and murmur not, or if we can rejoyce both in their honour, and our own quiet, that's a fair work of a good man; And now 9. After all this, I will not trouble you with reckoning a freedom from being tempted, not onely from being overcome, but from being tried: for though that be a rare felicity, and hath in it much safety, yet it hath lesse honour and fewer instances of vertue, unlesse it proceed from a confirmed and heroicall grace; which is indeed a little image of heaven, and of a celestiall charity; and never happens signally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to any, but to old and very eminent persons. 10. But some also adde an excellent habit of body and materiall passions, such as are chast and vertuous dreams, and suppose that as a disease abuses the fancy, and a vice does prejudice it; so may an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue of the soul smooth and Calcine the body, and make it serve perfectly, and without rebellious indispositions. 11. Others are in love with Mary Magdalens tears, and fancy the hard knees of Saint James, and the sore eyes of Saint Peter, and the very recreations of Saint John. <hi>Proh! quam virtute praeditos omnia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent!</hi> thinking all things becomes a good man; even his gestures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and little incuriosities: And though this may proceed from a great love of vertue, yet because some men do thus much and no more, and this is to be attributed to the lustre of vertue, which shines a little thorow a mans eye-lids, though he perversely winks against the light; yet as the former of these two is too Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; so as the later too Phantasticall: he that by the fore-going materiall parts and proper significations of a growing grace does

habits and degrees of perversnesse, that the very kindes of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are reducible to a method, and make up the part of a science: There are variety of stages and descents to death; as there are diversity of torments, and of sad regions of misery in hell, which is the centre and kingdom of sorrows. But that we may a little refresh the sadnesses of this consideration; for every one of these stages of sin, God hath measured out a proportion of mercy; for if sin abounds, grace shall much more abound, and God hath concluded all under sin, not with purposes to destroy us, but, <hi>Ut omnium misereatur, that he might have mercy upon all;</hi> that light may break forth from the deepest inclosures of darknesse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> mercy may rejoyce upon the recessions of justice, and grace may triumph upon the ruins of sin, and God may be glorified in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of our conversion, and the wonders of our preservation, and glories of our being saved. There is no state of sin, but if we be persons capable (according to Gods method of healing) of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving antidotes, we shall finde a sheet of mercy spread over our wounds and nakednesse. If our diseases be small, almost necessary, scarce avoidable, then God does, and so we are commanded to cure them, and cover them with a vail of pity, compassion, and gentle remedies: If our evils be violent, inveterate, gangrened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and incorporated into our nature by evil customes, they must be pulled from the flames of hell with censures, and cauteries, and punishments, and sharp remedies, quickly and rudely; their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is present and sudden, its effect is quick and intolerable, and there is no soft counsels then to be entertained; they are already in the fire; but they may be saved for all that; so great, so infinite, so miraculous is Gods mercy, that he will not give a sinner over, though the hairs of his head be singed with the flames of hell; Gods desires of having us to be saved continue, even when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be damned; even till we will not be saved, and are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Gods method, and all the revelations of his kindnesse. And certainly that is a bold and a mighty sinner whose iniquity is sweld beyond all the bulk and heap of Gods revealed loving kindnesse: If sin hath sweld beyond grace, and superabounds over it, that sin is gone beyond the measures of a man; such a person is removed beyond all the malice of humane nature, into the evil and spite of Devils, and accursed spirits; there is no greater sadnesse in the world then this. God hath not appointed a remedy in the vast treasures of grace for some men, and some sins; they have sinned like the falling Angels; and having over run the ordinary evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> inclinations of their nature, they are without the protection of the divine mercy; and the conditions of that grace which was designed to save all the world, was sufficient to have saved twenty. This is a condition to be avoyded with the care of God and his Angels, and all the whole industry of man. In order to

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which end my purpose now is to remonstrate to you the several states of sin, and death, together with those remedies which God had proportioned out to them, that we may observe the evils of the least, and so avoid the intolerable mischiefs of the greater, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of those sins which still are within the power and possibilities of recovery, lest insensibly we fall into those sins and into those circumstances of person for which Christ never died, which the Holy Ghost never means to cure, and which the eternal God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will pardon; for there are of this kinde more then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men imagine, whilest they amuse their spirits with gaietyes and false principles, till they have run into horrible impieties, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whence they are not willing to withdraw their foot, and God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved never to snatch and force them thence.</p>
                  <p>I [of some have compassion] and these I shall reduce to four heads or orders of men and actions; all which have their proper cure pro portionable to their proper state, gentle remedies to the lesser irregularities of the soul. The first are those that sin without observation of their particular state; either because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instructed in the special cases of conscience, or because they do an evil against which there is no expresse commandment. It is a sad calamity that there are so many milions of men and women that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are entred into a state of sicknesse and danger, and yet are made to believe they are in perfect health; and they do actions concerning which they never made a question whether they were just or no; nor were ever taught by what names to call them.

But so men think they sleep free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when their spirits are loaden with a Lethargy and they call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a hestick-feaver the vigour of a natural heat, tell nature changes those lesse discerned states into the notorious images of death. Very many men never consider whether they sin or no in 10000. of their actions, every one of which is very disputable; and do not think they are bound to consider: these men are to be pitied and instructed, they are to be called upon to use religion like a daily

diet; their consciences must be made tender and their Catechis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> enlarged; teach them, and make them sensible and they are cured.</p>
                  <p>But the other in this place are more considerable; Men sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out observation because their actions have no restraint of an expresse Commandment, no letter of the law to condemn them by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse sentence. And this happens, when the crime is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under a general notion without the instancing of particulars; for if you search over all the Scripture you shall never finde <hi>incest named</hi> and marked with the black character of death; and there are diveres sorts of uncleannesse, to which Scripture therefore gives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> no name, because she would have them have no being; And it had been necessary that God should have described all particulars and all kindes, if he had not given reason to man. For so it is fit that a guide should point out every turning, if he be to teach a childe or a fool to return under his fathers roof: But he that bids us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void intemperance for fear of a feaver, supposes you to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently instructed that you may avoid the plague; and when to look upon a woman with lust is condemned, it will not be necessary to adde, you must not do more, when even the least is forbidden; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and when to uncover the nakednesse of Noah brought an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal plague upon the posterity of Cham, it was not necessary that the law-giver should say you must not ascend to your fathers bed, or draw the curtains from your sisters retirements. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians forbad to transport figs from Athens, there was no need to name the gardens of Alcibiades, much lesse was it necessary to adde that Chabrias should send no plants to Sparta. What so ever is comprised under the general notion, and partakes of the common nature and the same iniquity needs no special prohibition, unlesse we think we can mock God and elude his holy precepts with an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> absurd trick of mistaken Logick. I am sure that will not save us harmlesse from a thunderbolt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men sin without an expresse prohibition when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a thing that is <hi>like</hi> a forbidden evil. And when Saint Paul had reckoned many works of the flesh he addes <hi>[and such like]</hi> all that have the same unreasonablenesse &amp; carnallity. For thus, poligamy is unlawful; for if it be not lawful for a Christian to put away his wife and marry another (unlesse for adultery) much lesse may he keep a first and take a second, when the first is not put away; If a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may not be drunk with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wine, neither may he be drunk with passion; if he may not kill his neighbour, neither then must he tempt him to sin; for that destroyes him more: if he may not wound him, then he may not perswade him to intemperance, and a drunken feaver; if it be not lawful to cozen a man, much lesse is it permitted that he make a man a fool, and a beast, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to every mans abuse and to all ready evils. And yet men are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50231:280"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> taught to start at the one half of these, and make no conscience of the other half; whereof some have a greater basenesse then the other that are named, and all have the same unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man is guilty, even when no law names his action, if he does any thing that is a cause or an effect, a part or unhandsome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of a forbidden instance; he that forbad all intemperance, is as much displeased with the infinite of foolish talk that happens at such meetings, as he is at the spoiling of the drink and the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the health. If God cannot endure wantonnesse, how can he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> suffer lascivious dressings, tempting circumstances, wanton eyes, high diet if idlenesse be a sin, then al immoderate mispending of our time, all long and tedious games, all absurd contrivances how to throw away a precious hour and a <hi>day of salvation</hi> also, are against God and against religion. He that is commanded to be charitable it is also intended he should not spend his money vainely, but be a good husband and provident that he may be able to give to the poor, as he would be to purchase a Lordship, or pay his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters portion: and upon this stock it is that Christian religion forbids jeering, and immoderate laughter and reckon <hi>jestings</hi> amongst the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>things that are unseemly.</hi> This also would be considered.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Besides the expresse laws of our religion, there is an universal line and limit to our passions and designes, which is called <hi>the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of Christianity;</hi> that is, the proportion of its sanctity and strictnesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> holy precepts. This is not forbidden, but does this become you? Is it decent to see a Christian live in plenty and ease and heap up mony and never to partake of Christs passions, there is no law against a Judge, his being a dresser of gardens or a gatherer of Sycamore fruits, but it becomes him not, and deserves a reproof. If I do exact justice to my neighbour and cause him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be punished legally for all the evils he makes me suffer, I have not broken a fragment from the stony tables of the law: but this is against the <hi>analogy of our religion;</hi> It does not become a Disciple of so gentle a master to take all advantages that he can. Christ, that quitted all the glories that were essential to him, and that grew up in his nature when he lodged in his Fathers bosom, Christ that suffered all the evils due for the sins of mankinde, himself remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most innocent, Christ, that promised persecution, injuries and affronts as part of our present portion, and gave them to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as a legacy, and gave us his spirit to enable us to suffer inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and made that the parts of suffering evils should be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of three or four Christian graces, of <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>fortitude of long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity</hi> and <hi>perseverance;</hi> he that of eight beatitudes made that five of them should be instanced in the matter of humiliation and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering temporal inconvenience, <hi>that blessed Master</hi> was certainly desirous that his Disciples should take their crowns from the crosse,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50231:281"/>
not from the evennesse and felicities of the world; He intended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we should give something, and suffer more things, and forgive all things, all injuries whatsoever; and though together with this may consist our securing a just interest; yet in very many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances we shall be put to consider how far it becomes us, to quit something of that, to pursue peace; and when we have secured the letter of the law, that we also look to its analogy; when we do what we are strictly bound to, then also we must consider what becomes us, who are disciples of such a Master, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed with such principles, charmed with so severe precepts and invited with the certainty of infinite rewards. Now although this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> discourse may seem new and strange, and very severe, yet it is infinitely reasonable, because Christianity is a law of love, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary services; it can in no sense be confined with laws and strict measures; well may the Ocean receive its limits, and the whole capacity of fire be glutted, and the grave have his belly so full, that it shal cast up al its bowels and disgorge the continual meal of so many thousand years; but love can never have a limit; and it is indeed to be <hi>swallowed up</hi> but nothing can <hi>fill</hi> it but God, who hath no bound. Christianity is a law for sons, not for servants; and God that gives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his grace without measure, and rewards without end, and acts of favour beyond our askings, and provides for us beyond our needs, and gives us counsels beyond commandments, intends not to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited out by the just evennesses and stricken measures of the words of a commandment. Give to God <hi>full measure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>analogy</hi> of Christianity stirres him up to jealousie: He hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect our hearts are not right with him, when we are so reserved in the matter and measures of our services: and if we will give God but just what he calls for by expresse mandate, it is just in him to require all of that at our hands without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement &amp; then we are sure to miscarry. And let us remember that when God said he was <hi>a jealous God</hi> he expressed the meaning of it to be, he did punish to <hi>the third and fourth genoration.</hi> Jelousie is like the rage of a man: but if it be also like the anger of God, it is insupportable and will crush us into the ruines of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> grave.</p>
                  <p>But because these things are not frequently considered, there are very many sins committed against religion, which because the commandment hath not marked men, refuse to mark, and think God requires no more. I am entred into a sea of matter, which I must not now prosecute; but I shall onely note this to you that it is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50231:281"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but reasonable, we should take accounts of our lives, by <hi>the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as well as by the <hi>expresse rules,</hi> of our religion; because in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and civil actions all the nations of the world use so to call their subjects to account. For that which in the accounts of men is called <hi>reputation</hi> and <hi>publick honesty,</hi> is the same which in religion we call <hi>analogy</hi> and <hi>proportion;</hi> in both cases there being some things, which are besides the notices of laws, and yet are the most certain consignations of an excellent vertue. He is a base person that does any thing against <hi>publick honesty</hi> and yet no man can be punished if he marries a wife the next day after his first wives funeral: and so he that prevaricates the proportions and excellent reasons of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is a person <hi>without zeal,</hi> and <hi>without love:</hi> and unlesse care be taken of him he will quickly be <hi>without religion.</hi> But yet these I say are a sort of persons which are to be used with gentlenesse, and treated with compassion; for no man must be handled rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to force him to do a kindnesse: and coercion of laws and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Judges, serjeants and executioners are against offenders of commandments; But the way to cure such persons is the easiest and genteliest remedy of all others. They are to be instructed in all the parts of duty, and invited forward by the consideration of the great rewards which are laid up for all the sons of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who serve him without constraint, without measures and allaves, even as fire burns, and as the roses grow, even as much as they can, and to all the extent of their natural and artificial capacities For it is a thing fit for our compassion, to see men fettered in the <hi>iron bands of laws</hi> and yet to break <hi>the golden chains of love</hi> but all those instruments which are proper to enkindle the love of God and to turn fear into charity are the proper instances of that compassion which is to be used towards these men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next sort of those who are in the state of sin, and yet to be handled gently and <hi>with compassion</hi> are those who entertain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> themselves with the beginnings and little entrances of sin, which as they are to be more pitied because they often come by reason of inadvertancy, and an unavoidable weaknesse in many degrees, so they are more to be taken care of, because they are underval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued &amp; undiscernably run into incovenience; when we see a childe strike a servant rudely, or jeere a silly person, or wittily cheat his play-fellow, or talk words light as the skirt of a summer garment, we laugh and are delighted with the wit and confidence of the boy; and incourage such hopeful beginnings; and in the mean time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we consider not that from these beginnings he shall grow up till he become a Tyrant, an oppressor, a Goat and a Traytor. <hi>Nemo simul malus fit &amp; malus esse cernitur; sicut nec scorpijs tum innas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And the case is the same when men enter upon a new stock of any sin; the vice is at first apt to be put out of countenance and a little thing discourages it; and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muses the spirit with words, and phantastick images, and cheape <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> instances of sin; and men think themselves safe because they are as yet safe from laws, and the sin does not as yet out cry the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noise of Christs loud cryings and intercession with his Father, nor call for thunder or an amazing judgement; but according to the old saying <hi>the thornes of Dauphine will never fetch blood if they do not scratch the first day:</hi> &amp; we shal finde that the little undecencies and riflings of our souls, the first openings and disparkings of our vertue differ onely from the state of perdition, as infancy does from old age, as sicknesse from death; It is the entrance into those regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether whosoever passes finally, shall lie down and groan with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an eternal sorrow. Now in this case it may happen that a compassion may ruine a man, if it be the pity of an indiscreet mother, and nurse the sin from its weaknesse to the strength of habit and impudence; The compassion that is to be used to such persons is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of a Phisitian or a severe Tutor; chastise thy infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinne by discipline, and acts of vertue; and never begin that way from whence you must return with some trouble, and much shame, or else if you proceed, you finish your eternal ruine.</p>

And how many Tenents and Relatives are known to have a servile conscience and to know no affirmation or negation but such as shall serve their Land-lords interest? Alas the poor men live by it, and they must beg their bread if ever they turn recreant, or shall offer to be honest. There are some trades whose very foundations

Although no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation is bigger then the grace of God, yet many temptations are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> greater then our strengths, and we do not live at the rate of a mighty and a victorious grace.</p>

                  <p>Of the same consideration it is, when ignorant people are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized into false doctrine, and know nothing but such principles which weaken the nerves, and enfeeble the joynts of holy living; they never heard of any other; those that follow great and evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> examples; the people that are ingaged in the publike sins of a kingdom wihch they understand not, and either must venture to be undone upon the strength of their own little reasonings, and weak discoursings, or else must go <hi>quâ itur, non quâ enndum est,</hi> there where the popular misery hath made the way plain before their eyes, though it be uneven and dangerous to their consciences. In these cases I am forced to reckon a Catalogue of mischiefs; but it will be hard to cure any of them. Aristippus in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses was a great flatterer of Dionysius of Sicily, and did own doctrines which might give an easinesse to some vices, and knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not how to contradict the pleasures of his Prince; but seemed like a person disposed to partake of them, that the example of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, and the practise of a King might do countenance to a shamefull life. But when Dionysius sent him two women, slaves, fair, and young, he sent them back and shamed the easinesse of his doctrine by the severity of his manners, he daring to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous when he was alone, though in the presence of him, whom he thought it necessary to flatter, he had no boldnesse to own the vertue: So it is with too many; if they be left alone, and that they stand unshaken with the eye of their tempter, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of their Lord, they go whither their education or their custome carries them: but it is not in some natures to deny the face of a man, and the boldnesse of a sinner; and which is yet worse, it is not in most mens interest to do it; these men are in a pitiable condition, and are to be helped by the following rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let every man consider that he hath two relations to serve,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50231:283"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and he stands between God and his Master, or his neerest relative: and in such cases it comes to be disputed whether interest be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; which of the persons is to be displeased, God or my Master, God or my Prince, God or my Friend? If we be servants of the man; remember also that I am a servant of God; adde to this, that if my present service to the man be a slavery in me, and a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in him, yet Gods service is a noble freedom: And Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius said well. It was for slaves to lie, and for free men to speak the truth. <hi>If you be freed by the blood of the Son of God, then you are free indeed:</hi> and then consider how dishonourable it is to lie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the displeasure of God, and onely to please your fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. The difference here is so great, that it might be sufficient onely to consider the antithesis. Did the man make you what you are? Did he pay his blood for you, to save you from death? Does he keep you from sicknesse? True. You eat at his table; but they are of Gods provisions that he and you feed of. Can your master free you from a fever, when you have drunk your self into it? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store your innocence when you have forsworn your self for his interest? Is the change reasonable? He gives you meat and drink for which you do him service. But is not he a Tyrant, and an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an oppressor, and an extortioner, if he will force thee to give thy soul for him? to sell thy soul for old-shoes, and broken bread? But when thou art to make thy accounts of eternity, will it be taken for an answer, My Patron, or my Governour, my Prince, or my Master, forced me to it? or if it will not. Will he undertake a por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of thy flames? or if that may not be, will it be in the midst of all thy torments, any ease to thy sorrows to remember all the rewards and clothes, all the money, and civilities, all the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full looks, and familiarity, and fellowship of vices which in your life time made your spirit so gay and easie? It will in the eternall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> loads of sorrow, adde a duplicate of groans and indignation, when it shall be remembred for how base and trifling interest, and upon what weak principles we fell sick and died eternally.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next advise to persons thus tempted is, that they would learn to separate duty from mistaken interest; and let them be both served in their just proportions, when we have learned to make a difference. A wife is bound to her husband in all his just designes, and in all noble usages and Christian comportments: But a wife is no more bound to pursue her husbands vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, then to serve and promote his unlawfull and wandring loves: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> It is not alwayes a part of duty to think the same propositions, or to curse the same persons, or to wish him successe in unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes: And yet the sadnesse of it is, that a good woman is easily tempted to beleeve the cause to be just, and when her affection hath forced her judgement, her judgement for ever after shall carry the affection to all its erring and abused determinations. A
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50231:284"/>
friend is turned a flatterer if he does not know, that the limits of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> friendship extend no further then the pale and inclosures of reason and religion. No Master puts it into his covenant that his servant shall be drunk with him, or give in evidence in his Masters cause, according to his Masters scrolls: and therefore it is besides and against the duty of a servant to sin by that authority; it is as if he should set Mules to keep his sheep, or make his Dogs to carry bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: it is besides their nature and designe; and if any person falls under so tyrannicall relation, let him consider how hard a Master he serves; where the Devil gives the imployment, and shame is his entertainment, and sin is his work, and hell is his wages. Take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> therefore the counsel of the son of Syrac. <hi>Accept no person against</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus. 4. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>thy soul, and let not the reverence of any man cause thee to fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When passion mingles with duty, and is a necessary instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of serving God, let not that passion run its own course and passe on to liberty, and thence to licence and dissolution: but let no more of it be entertained, then will just do the work. For no zeal of duty will warrant a violent passion to prevaricate a duty. I have seen some officers of Warre in passion and zeal of their duty have made no scruple to command a souldier with the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of cursing and accents of swearing, and pretended they could not else speak words effective enough, and of sufficient authority; and a man may easily be overtaken in the issues of his government; while his authority serves it still with passion, if he be not curious in his measures, his passion will also serve it self upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and over rule the Ruler.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let every such tempted person remember, that all evil comes from our selves, and not from others; and therefore all pretences and prejudices, all commands and temptations, all opinions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, are but instances of our weaknesse, and arguments of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> folly: For unlesse we listed, no man can make us drink beyond our measures: And if I tell a lie for my Masters or my friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, it is because I prefer a little end of money, or flattery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my honour and my innocence. They are huge follies which go up and down in the mouthes and heads of men, <hi>[He that knows not how to dissemble, knows not how to reigne.</hi> [He that will not do as his company does, must go out of the world, and quit all soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of men: We create necessities of our own, and then think we have reason to serve their importunity. <hi>Non ego sum ambitiosus, sed nemo aliter Romae potest vivere, non ego sumptuosus, sed urbs</hi>

                     <hi>ipsa magnas impensas exigit. Non est meum vitium quod iracundus sum, quod nondum constitui certum vitae genus adolescentia haec facit.</hi> The place we live in makes us expensive, the state of life I have chosen renders me ambitious, my age makes me angry or lustfull, proud or peevish. These are nothing else but resolutions never to mend as long as we can have excuse for our follies, and untill we
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50231:284"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> can cozen our selves no more. There is no such thing as a necessity for a Prince to dissemble, or for a servant to lie, or for a friend to flatter, for a civil person and a sociable, to be drunk: we cozen our selves with thinking the fault is so much derivative from others, till the smart and the shame falls upon our selves, and covers our heads with sorrow. And unlesse this gap be stopped, and that we build our duty upon our own bottoms, as supported with the grace of God, there is no vice but may finde a Patron; and no age or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or state of life, but will be an engagement to sin: And we shall think it necessary to be lustfull in our youth, and revengefull in our man hood, and covetous in our old age: and we shall perceive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that every state of men, and every trade and profession, lives upon the vices of others, or upon their miseries; and therefore they will think it necessary to promote, or to wish it. If men were tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Physitians would be poor: and unlesse some Princes were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, or others injurious, there would be no imployment for souldiers. The Vintners retail supports the Merchants trade, and it is a vice that supports the Vintners retail; and if all men were wise and sober persons, we should have fewer beggers, and fewer rich; and if our Law-givers should imitate Demades of Athens, who condemned a man that lived by selling things belonging to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as supposing he could not choose but wish the death of men, by whose dying he got his living, we should finde most men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted criminalls, because vice is so involved in the affairs of the world, that it is made the support of many trades and the businesse of great multitudes of men: Certainly from hence it is that iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does so much abound; and unlesse we state our questions right, and perceive the evil to be designed onely from our selves, and that no such pretence shall keep off the punishment, or the shame from our selves we shall fall into a state which is onely capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion because it is irrecoverable: and then we shall be infinitely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> miserable, when we can onely receive an uselesse and ineffective pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whatsoever is necessary cannot be avoided: He therefore that shall say, he cannot avoid his sin, is out of the mercies of this Text: they who are appointed Guides, &amp; Physitians of souls cannot to any purpose do their offices of pity. It is necessary that we serve God, and do our duty, and secure the interest of our souls, and be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preserve our relations to God, as to our friend, or Prince. But, if it can be necessary for any man, in any condition to sin, it is also necessary for that man to perish. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

I do not mean that a mans life can be as pure as the Sun or the rayes of celestial Jerusalem; but like the Moon in which there are spots; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but they are no deformity; a lessening onely and an abatement of light, no cloud to hinder and draw a vail before its face; but sometimes it is not so serene and bright as at other times.

When Polemon of Athens by chance coming into the schools of Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was reformed upon the hearing of that one lecture, some wise men gave this censure of him; <hi>peregninatus est hujus animus in nequitiâ, non habitavit,</hi> his minde wandred in wickednesse and travelled in it, but never dwelt there; the same is the case of some men; they make inroads into the enemies countrey, not like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to spoil, but like Dinah to be satisfied with the stranger beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the land, till their vertues are defloured and they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tragedies, and are possessed by death, and intolerable sorrows; but because this is like the fate of Jacobs daughter and happens not by designe, but folly, not by malice, but surprise, not by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> strength of will, but by the weaknesse of grace, and yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a man to the same place whether a great vice usually does, it is hugely pitiable, and the persons are to be treated with compassion and to be assisted by the following considerations and exercises.</p>
                  <p>First let us consider, that for a good man to be overtaken in a single crime is the greatest dishonour and unthriftinesse in the whole world. <hi>As a fly in a box of ointment, so is a little folly to him who is accounted wise,</hi> said the <hi>Son of Sirach:</hi> No man chides a fool for his weaknesses, or scorns a childe for playing with flies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the present appetite, before all the possibilities of to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows event: But men wondered when they saw <hi>Socrates</hi> ride upon a cane; and when Solomon laid his wisdom at the foot of Pharaohs daughter, and changed his glory for the interest of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton sleep, he became the discourse of heaven and earth: and men think themselves abused, and their expectation cousened when they see a wise man do the actions of a fool, and a good man seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the dishonours of a crime. But the losse of his reputation is the least of his evil. <hi>It is the greatest improvidence in the world</hi> to let a healthful constitution be destroyed in the surfet of one night. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> For although, when a man by the grace of God and a long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hath obtained the habit of Christian graces, every single sin does not spoil the habit of vertue, because that cannot be lost but as it was gotten, that is, by parts, and succession, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crime interrupts <hi>the acceptation</hi> of the grace, and makes the man

These great examples bear men of weak discourses and weaker resolutions from the severity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of vertues. But as Diagoras to them that shewed to him the votive garments of those that had escaped shipwrack upon their prayers and vows to Neptune answered, that they kept no account of those that prayed and vowed, and yet were drowned: So do these men keep catalogues of those few persons who broke the thrid of a fair life in sunder with the violence of a great crime, and by the grace of God recovered and repented and lived; But they consider not concerning those infinite numbers of men, who died in their first fit of sicknesse, who after a fair voyage have thrown themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> boord, and perished in a sudden wildnesse, One said well, <hi>Si quid Socrates, aut Aristippus contra morem et consuetudinem fecerunt, idem sibi ne arbitretur licere.

Remember that all the damned soules shall bear an eternity of torments for the pleasures of a short sinfulnesse; but for a single transient action, to die forever, is an intolerable exchange and the effect of so great a folly, that whosoever falls into and then considers it, it will make him mad and distracted for ever.</p>

And in this manner God scourged the Corinthians for their irreverent and disorderly receiving the Holy Sacrament. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For although even the least of the sins that I have discoursed of, will lead to death eternall, if their course be not interrupted, and the disorder chastised, yet because we do not stop their progresse instantly, God many times does, and visits us with proportionable judgements, and so not onely checks the rivulet from swelling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rivers and a vastnesse, but plainly tells us, that although smaller crimes shall not be punished with equall severity as the greatest, yet even in hell there are eternal rods as well as eternal scorpions; and the smallest crime that we act with an infant-malice, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> deliberation, shall be revenged with the lesser stroaks of wrath; but yet with the infliction of a sad eternity. But then that we also should make a difference, is a precept concerning Church discipline, and therefore not here proper to be considered, but onely as it may concern our own particulars in the actions of repentance; and our brethren in internal correction:</p>

And although in this there is no fear that we would be excessive; yet when we are to reprove a brother we are sharp enough, and either by pride, or by animosity, by the itch of government, or the indignation of an angry minde, we run beyond the gentlenesse of a Christian Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; we must remember that by Christs law some are to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>privately,</hi> some to be shamed and corrected <hi>publikely,</hi> and beyond these, there is an <hi>abscission,</hi> or <hi>a cutting off</hi> from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of faithfull people, <hi>A delivering over to Sathan.</hi> And to this purpose is that old reading of the words of my Text, which is still in some Copies, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.]</hi> Some sins there are, which <hi>in their own nature</hi> are <hi>damnable,</hi> and some are such as <hi>will certainly bring a man to damnation;</hi> the first are cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but with much danger; the second are desperate and irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; when a man is violently tempted, and allured with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is proportionable and pleasant to his vigorous appetite, and his unabated, unmortified nature, this man falls into death, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but yet we pity him as we pity a thief that robs for his necessity: this man did not tempt himself, but his spirit suffers violence, and his reason is invaded, and his infirmities are mighty, and his aids not yet prevailing: But when this single temptation hath prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a single instance, and leaves a relish upon the palate, and this produces another, and that also is fruitfull and swels into a family and kinred of sin, that is, it grows first into approbation, then to a clear assent, and an untroubled conscience, thence into frequency, from thence unto a custome, and easinesse, and a habit, this man is fallen into the fire. There are also some single <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> acts of so great a malice that they must suppose a man habitually sinfull before he could arrive at that height of wickednesse. No man begins his sinfull course with killing of his Father or his Prince; and Simon Magus had preambulatory impieties; he was covetous and ambitious, long before he offered to buy the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <q>Nemo repente fuit turpissimus—</q>
                  <p>and although such actions may have in them the malice and the mischief, the disorder and the wrong, the principle and the permanent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, of a habit and a long course of sin, yet because they never or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> very seldom go alone, but after the praedisposition of other huisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crimes, we shall not amisse comprise them under the name of habituall sins. For such they are, either formally or equivalently: and if any man hath fallen into a sinfull habit, into a course and order of sinning, his case is little lesser then desperate; but that little hope that is remanent hath its degree according to the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or the growth of the habit. 1. For all sins lesse then habitual, it is certain, a pardon is ready to penitent persons: that is, to all that sin in ignorance, or in infirmity, by surprize, or inadvertency, in smaller instances, or infrequent returns, with involuntary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or imperfect resolutions, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, said Clemens in his Epistles: <hi>Lift up your hands to Almighty God, and pray him to be mercifull to you in all things when you sin unwillingly;</hi> that is, in which you sin with an imperfect choice: for no man sins against his will directly, but when his understanding is abused by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50231:290"/>
or an intolerable weaknesse, our wills follow their blind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> guide, and are not the perfect mistresses of their own actions, and therefore leave a way and easinesse to repent, and be ashamed of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore a possibility and readinesse for pardon. And these are the sins that we are taught to pray to God that he would pardon, as he gives us our bread, that is, <hi>every day.</hi> For <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> said Saint James, that is, in many smaller matters, in matters of surprize, or inevitable infirmity: And therefore Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices said, that <hi>Saint Austin</hi> was used to say, That <hi>he would not have even good and holy Priests go from this world without the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of equall and worthy penances:</hi> and the most innocent life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in our account is not a competent instrument of a peremptory confidence, and of justifying our selves: <hi>I am guilty of nothing,</hi> (said Saint Paul) that is, of no ill intent, or negligence in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, <hi>yet I am not hereby justified,</hi> for God it may bee knows many little irregularities, and insinuations of sin: In this case we are to make a difference; but humility, and prayer, and watchfulnesse, are the direct instruments of the expiation of such sinnes.</p>
                  <p>But then secondly, whosoever sins without these abating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that is, in great instances, in which a mans understanding cannot be cozened; as in drunkennesse, murder, adultery, and in the frequent repetitions of any sort of sin whatsoever, in which a mans choice cannot be surprized, and in which it is certain there is a love of the sin, and a delight in it, and a power over a mans resolutions; in these cases it is a miraculous grace, and an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary change, that must turn the current and the stream of the iniquity: and when it is begun, the pardon is more uncertain, and the repentance more difficult, and the effect much abated, and the man must be made miserable that he may be accursed for ever. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I say his pardon is uncertain, because there are some sins which are unpardonable, (as I shall shew) and they are not all named in particular, and the degrees of malice being uncertain, the salvation of that man is to be wrought with infinite <hi>fear and trembling.</hi> It was the case of Simon Magus, <hi>Repent and ask pardon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>for thy sin, if peradventure the thought of thy heart may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee.</hi> If peradventure;] it was a new crime, and concerning its possibility of pardon no revelation had been made, and by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to other crimes it was very like an unpardonable sin; for it was <hi>a thinking a thought against the Holy Ghost,</hi> and that was next <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to <hi>speaking a word against him.</hi> Cains sin was of the same nature; <hi>It is greater then it can be forgiven,</hi> his passion and his fear was too severe and decretory: it was <hi>pardonable,</hi> but truly we never finde that God did pardon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But besides this, it is uncertain in the pardon, because it <note place="margin">2.</note> may be the time of pardon is passed, and though God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50231:290"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to other people the same sins, and to thee too some times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it may be he will not now: he hath not promised par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don so often as we sin, and in all the returns of impudence, aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and it gratitude; and it may be <hi>thy day is past,</hi> as was Jerusalems in the day that they crucified the Saviour of the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Pardon of such habitual sins is uncertain, because life is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; <note place="margin">3.</note> and such sins require much time for their abolition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation. And therefore although these sins are not <hi>necessariò morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fera,</hi> that is, unpardonable, yet by consequence they become <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> because our life may be cut off before we have finished or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed those necessary parts of repentance, which are the severe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and yet the onely condition of getting pardon. So that you may perceive, that not onely every <hi>great single crime,</hi> but <hi>the habit of any sin</hi> is dangerous; and therefore these persons are to be <hi>snatched</hi> from the fire, if you mean to rescue them, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. To which I adde this fourth consideration, that every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay <note place="margin">4.</note> of return is in the case of habitual sins an approach to desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the nature of habits is like that of Crocodiles they grow as long as they live; and if they come to <hi>obstinacy,</hi> or <hi>confirmation,</hi> they are in hell already, and can never return back. For so the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Bears, when they have clasped a dart in the region of their Liver, wheel themselves upon the wound and with anger and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious revenge strike the deadly barbe deeper, and cannot be quit from that fatal steel, but in flying bear along that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves make the instrument of a more hasty death: So is every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious person struck with a deadly wound, and his own hands forced it into the entertainments of his heart. And because it is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to draw it forth by a sharp and salutary repentance he still rouls and turns upon his wound, and carries his death in his bowels, where it first entered by choice, and then dwelt by love, and at last shall finish the tragedy by divine judgements, and an unalterable decree.</p>
                  <p>But as the pardon of these sins is uncertain, so the conditions of restitution are hard, even to them who shall be pardoned: their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and themselves too, must be fetched from the fire; water will not do it, tears and ineffective sorrow cannot take off a habit, or a great crime.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>I have now done with my Text, and should adde no more but that the nature of these sins is such that they may increase in their <hi>weight,</hi> and <hi>duration,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and then they increase in <hi>mischief,</hi> and <hi>fatality,</hi> and so go beyond the Text.

                  <p>But besides all this, I shall name one thing more unto you; for</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>There are some single actions of sin of so great a malice, that in their own nature they are beyond the limit of <hi>Gospel pardon:</hi> they are not such things for the pardon of which God entered into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; because they are such sins which put a man into perfect indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and incapacities of entring into, or being in the covenant. In the first ages of the world, <hi>Atheisme</hi> was of that nature; it was against their whole religion; and the sin is worse now, against the whole religion still, and against a brighter light. In the ages after the flood <hi>idolatry</hi> was also just such another: for as God was known first one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And now if we would know in the Gospel what answers these precedent sins? I answer, first the same sins acted by a resolute hand and heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are worse now then ever they were: and a third or fourth is also to be added; and that is <hi>Apostacy</hi> or <hi>or a voluntary malicious renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the faith:</hi> The Church hath often declared that sin to be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: <hi>witchcraft</hi> or <hi>final impenitence,</hi> and <hi>obstinacy</hi> in any sin are infallibly desperate: and in general, and by a certain parity of reason, whatsoever does destroy charity or the good life of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an with the same general venom and deletery as <hi>Apostacy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes <hi>faith;</hi> and he that is a <hi>Renegado</hi> from charity, is as unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable as he that returns to solemn <hi>Atheisme</hi> or <hi>infidelity:</hi> for all that, is directly the sin against the holy Ghost, that is a throwing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> away wherby onely we can be Christians, wherby onely we can hope to be saved; <hi>to speak a word against the holy Ghost</hi> in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, was declared unpardonable, because it was such a word which if it had been true, or believed, would have destroyed the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for they said that Christ wrought by Beelzebub, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence did not come from God: He that destroyes al the whole order of Priesthood, destroyes one of the greatest parts of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; one of the greatest effects of the holy Ghost: He that destroyes government destroyes another part; but that we may come neerer to our selves; <hi>to quench the spirit of God</hi> is worse then to speak some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> words against him; <hi>to grieve the spirit of God</hi> is a part of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, <hi>to resist the holy Ghost</hi> is another part; and if we consider, that every great sin does this in its proportion, it would concern us to be careful, lest we fal into <hi>presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us;</hi> out of this that I have spoken you may easily gather what sort of men those are, who cannot be snatched from the fire; for whom as <hi>S. John</hi> saies, <hi>we are not to pray,</hi> and how neer men come to it that continue in any known sin; if I should descend to particulars, I might lay a snare to scrupulous and nice consciences. This onely every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> habitual sinner does manifest the divine justice in punishing the sins of a short life with a never dying worm, and a never quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flame, because we have an affection to sin that no time will dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, but such as would increase to eternal ages; and accordingly as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hath a degree of love, so he hath lodged in his soul a spark which unless it be speedily &amp; effectively quenched will break forth into unquenchable fire.</p>

Are not his subjects fields bedewed with the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> showers that water his gardens of pleasure?</p>
                  <p>Nay those things which he esteems his ornament and his singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his possessions, are they not of more use to others then to himself. For suppose his garments splendid and shining like the robe of a cherub or the clothing of the fields, all that he that wears them enjoyes, is that they keep him warm, and clean and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest; and all this is done by clean and lesse pompous vestments; &amp; the beauty of them which distinguishes him from others, is made to please the eyes of the beholders; and he is like a fair bird, or the meretricious painting of a wanton woman made wholly to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> looked on, that is to be enjoyed by every one but himself; and the fairest face and the sparkling eye cannot perceive or enjoy their own beauties but by reflection. It is I that am pleased with beholding his gayety, and the gay man in his greatest bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is onely pleased because I am pleased with the sight: so borrowing his little and imaginary complacency, from the delight that I have, not from any inherency of his own pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Suppose a man Lord of all the world, (for still we are but in supposition) yet since every thing is received, not according to its own greatnesse and worth, but according to the capacity of the receiver, it signifies very little as to our content; or to the riches of our possession. If any man should give to a Lion a fair meadow full of hay, or a thousand quince trees, or should give to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bull, the master and the fairest of the whole heard, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fair Stags; If a man should present to a childe a ship laden with Persian carpets, and the ingredients of the rich scarlet, all these being either disproportionate to the appetite or to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> could adde nothing of content and might declare the freenesse of the presenter, but they upbraid the incapacity of the receiver: and so it does if God should give the whole world to any man; He knows not what to do with it; he can use no more but according to the capacities of a man. He can use nothing but meat and drink and cloths; and infinite riches that can give him changes of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every day, and a full table, do but give him a clean trencher every bit he eats, it signifies no more but wantonnesse, and variety to the same, not to any new purposes; He to whom the world can be given to any purpose greater then a private estate can mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> must have new capacities created in him; He needs the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of an Angel to take the accounts of his estate; He had need have a stomach like fire or the grave: for else he can eat no more then one of his healthful subjects, and unlesse he hath an eye like the Sun, and a motion like that of a thought, and a bulk as big as one of the orbs of heaven; the pleasures of his eye can be no greater then to behold the beauty of a little prospect from a hill, or to look upon the heap of gold packt up in a little room or to dote upon a cabinet of Jewels better then which there is no man that sees at all but sees every day; For not to name the beauties and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sparkling diamonds of heaven, a mans or a womans or a haukes eye is more beauteous and excellent, then al the Jewels of his crown. And when we remember, that a beast who hath quicker senses then a man, yet hath not so great delight in the fruition of any object, because he wants understanding and the power to make reflex acts upon his perception, it will follow, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowledge is the greatest instrument of pleasure, and he that is most knowing hath a capacity to become happy, which a lesse knowing prince or a rich person hath not: and in this onely a mans capacity is capable of enlargement: but then although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they onely have power to relish any pleasure rightly, who right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand the nature and degrees and essences, and ends of things, yet they that do so, understand also the vanity and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfyingnesse of the things of this world so that the relish which could not be great, but in a great understanding appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50231:294"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> because its vanity appears at the same time; the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing sees all, and sees thorow it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greatest vanity of this world is remarkable in this, that all its joyes summed up together are not big enough to counterpoise the evil of one sharp disease, or to allay a sorrow. For imagine a man great in his dominion as Cyrus, rich as Solomon, victorious as David, beloved like Titus, learned as Trismegist, powerful as all the Roman greatnesse, all this, and the results of all this, give him no more pleasure in the midst of a feaver, or the tortures of the stone, then if he were only lord of a little dish, and a dishfull of fountain water. Indeed the excellency of a holy conscience is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and a magazine of joy, so great, that it sweetens the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter potion of the world, and makes tortures and death not only tolerable, but amiable; and therefore to part with this whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is so great, for the world that is of so inconsiderable a worth as not to have in it recompence enough, for the sorrows of a sharp disease, is a bargain fit to be made by none but fools and mad men. Antiochus, Epiphanes &amp; Herod the great &amp; his grand child Agrippa, were sad instances of this great truth; to every of which it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the grandeur of their fortune, the greatnesse of their possessions, and the encrease of their estate disappeared, and expired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> like Camphire at their arrest, by those several sharp diseases, which covered their head with Cypresse and hid their crowns in an inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grave.</p>
                  <p>For what can all the world minister to a sick person? If it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents all the spoils of nature and the choicest delicacies of land and sea. Alas his appetite is lost, and to see a pibble stone is more pleasing to him: For he can look upon that without loathing, but not so upon the most delicious fare that ever made famous the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man luxury. Perfumes make his head ake; if you load him with jewels, you presse him with a burden as troublesome as his grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and what pleasure is in all those possessions, that cannot make his pillow easie, nor tame the rebellion of a tumultuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, not restore the use of a withered hand, or straighten a crooked finger: vain is the hope of that man whose soul rests upon vanity, and such unprofitable possessions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Suppose a man lord of all this world, an universal Monarch, as some princes have lately designed, all that cannot minister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to him; not that content which a poor contemplative man by the strength of Christian Philosophy, and the support of a very small <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fortune daily does enjoy. All his power and greatnesse cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the sea to overflow his shores or to stay from the retiring to the opposit strand. It cannot make his children dutiful or wise &amp; though the world admired at the greatness of Philip the second's fortune in the accession of Portugal and the East Indies to his principalities, yet this could not allay the infelicitie of his family, and the unhandsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50231:295"/>
of his condition in having a proud and indiscreet and a vitious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> young prince likely to inherit all his greatnesse. And if nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the face of such a fortune, to tell all the world that it is spotted and imperfect; yet there is in all conditions of the world, such wearinesse and tediousnesse of the spirits, that a man is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more pleased with hopes of going off for the present, then in dwelling upon that condition which it may be others admire, and think beauteous, but none knoweth the smart of it, but he that drank off the little pleasure, and felt the ill relish of the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. How many Kings have groaned under the burden of their crowns, and have sunk down and died? How many have quitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their pompous cares, and retired into private lives, there to enjoy the pleasures of Philosophy and religion, which their thrones denied?</p>
                  <p>And if we consider the supposition of the Text, the thing will demonstrate it self. For he who can be supposed the owner and purchaser of the whole world, must either be a King or a private person. A private person can hardly be supposed to be the man. For if he be subject to another, how can he be Lord of the whole world? But if he be a King, it is certain, that his cares are greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then any mans, his fears are bigger, his evils mountainous, the accidents that discompose him are more frequent, and sometimes intolerable: and of all his great possessions he hath not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est use and benefit. But they are like a great harvest which more labourers must bring in and more must eat of; onely he is the centre of all the cares, and they fix upon him; but the profits run out to all the lines of the circle: to all that are about him; whose good is therefore greater then the good of the Prince: Because what they enjoy is the purchase of the Princes care; and so they feed upon his cost. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

And then let him consider how much of felicity can this <note place="margin">Rare volte hà fame chjsta sempre à tavola</note> condition contribute to him. In which he is not further gone beyond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a person of a little fortune, in the greatnesse of his possession, then he is fallen short in the pleasures and possibility of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it is a sad thing to see an ambitious, or a covetous person, make his life unpleasant, troublesome, and vexatious, to grasp a power bigger then himself; To fight for it with infinite hazards of his life, so that it is a thousand to one but he perishes in the attempt, and gets nothing at all, but an untimely grave, a reproachfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and an early damnation.

that the unhappy party is but to begin a new game, then to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the fears, the watchfulnesse, the diligence, the laborious arts to secure a possession, lest the desperate party should recover a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate game: And suppose this with a new stock of labours, danger and expence, be seconded by a new successe; then to look upon the new emergencies, and troubles, and discontents among his friends, about parting the spoil, the envies, the jealousies, the slanders, the underminings, and the perpetuall inscourity of his condition; all this I say, is to see a man take infinite pains to make himself mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; but if he will be so unlearned, as to call this gallantry, or a splendid fortune, yet by this time when he remembers, he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> certainly spent much of his time in trouble; and how long he shall enjoy this he is still uncertain; he is not certain of a moneth, and suppose it be seven yeers, yet when he comes to die, and cast up his accounts, and shall finde nothing remaining, but a sad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of evils, and troubles past, and expectations of worse, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worse he must acknowledge himself convinced, that to gain all this world is a fortune not worth the labour and the dangers, the fears, and transportations of passions, though the souls losse be not considered in the bargain.</p>

Thus the Well where the woman of Samaria sate was Jacobs Well, and he drank of it, but so did his wives, and his children, and his cattel; so that what we call ours, is really ours, but for our portion of expence and use; we have so little of it, that our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> servants have far more, and that which is ours is nothing but the title, and the care, and the trouble of securing and dispensing; save onely that God whose stewards we all are, will call such owners (as they are pleased to call themselves) to strict accounts for their disbursments. And by this account the possession or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is but a word, and serves a fancy or a passion, or a vice, but no reall end of nature; it is the use and spending it that makes a man, to all reall purposes of nature to be the owner of it, and in this the lord and master have but a share.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, consider how far short of the whole world the greatest Prince that ever reigned did come. Alexander that wept because he had no more worlds to conquer, was in his knowledge deceived, and bruitish, as in his passion; he over-run much of Asia, but he could never passe the Ganges, and never thrust his sword in the bowels of Europe, and knew nothing of America. And the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                     </gap>, or the whole world began to have an appropriate sence, and was rather put to the Romane Greatnesse as an honourable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative then did signifie that they were lords of the world, who never went beyond Persia, Egypt, nor Britain.</p>
                  <p>But why do I talk of great things in this Question of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the soul for the world? Because it is <hi>a reall bargain,</hi> which many men (too many God knows) do make, we must consider it as applicable to practice. Every man that loses his soul for the purchase of the world, must not looke to have the portion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of a King. How few men are Princes, and of those that are not born so, how seldom instances are found in story, of persons that by their industry became so? But we must come far lower yet. Thousands there are that damne themselves, and yet their purchase at long-running, and after a base and weary life spent, is but five hundred pounds a yeer; nay it may be they onely cozen an easie person out of a good estate, and pay for it at an easie rate, which they obtain by lying, by drinking, by flattery, by force; and the gain is nothing but a thousand pound in the whole, or it may bee nothing but a convenience. Nay how many men hazard their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for an acre of ground, for twenty pound, to please a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, to get a smile and a kinde usage from a Superiour? These men get but little, though they did not give so much for it. So little, that Epictetus thought the purchase deer enough, though you paid nothing for it but flattery, and observance, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Observance was the price of his meal, and he paid too dear for one that gave his birth-right for it: but he that exchanges his soul for it, knowes not the vanity of his purchase, nor the value of his losse. He that gains the purchase and spoil of a kingdom hath got <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that which to all that are placed in heaven or to a man, that were seated in the paths of the Sun seem but like a spot in an eye, or a Mathematical point, so without vastnesse that it seems to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dimensions. But he whose purchase is but his neighbours field, or a few unjust acres, hath got that which is inconsiderable, below the notice and description of the Map; for by such Hieroglyphicall representments, Socrates chid the vanity of a proud Athenian.</p>

3. Although these premises may suffice to shew that the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> purchase is but vain, and that all which men use really to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is lesse then trifles, yet even the possession of it whatsoever it be is not meer and unmixt, but allaid with sorrow and uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the gain hath but enlarged our appetite, and like a draught to an hydropick person, hath enraged his thirst; and still that which he hath not is infinitely bigger then what he hath, since the first enlargement of his purchase was not to satisfie necessity, but his passion, his lust or his avarice, his pride or his revenge, these things cease not by their fewell but their flames grow bigger, and the capacities are stretched, and they want more then they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> did at first. For who wants most, he that wants five pound, or he that wants five thousand: And supposing a man naturally suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and provided for in the dispensations of nature there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but that the poor hath enough to fill his belly, and the rich man can never have enough to fill his eye. The poor mans wants are no greater then what may be supplied by charity; and the rich mans wants are so big, that none but Princes can relieve them, and they are left to all the temptations of great vices, and huge cares to make their reparations.</p>

He that enjoyes a great portion of this world hath most commonly the allay of some great crosse, which although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God designes in mercy, to wean his affections from the world, and for the abstracting them from sordid adherencies and cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to make his eyes like stars, to fix them in the orbs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the regions of felicity, yet they were an inseparable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant and condition of humanity. Solomon observed the vanity of some persons, that heaped up great riches for their heits, and yet knew not whether a wise man or a fool should possesse them, this is a great evil under the Sun.

And lastly, his soul so gets nothing that wins all this world, if he loses his soul, that it is ten to one but he that gets the one, therefore shall lose the other; For to a great and opulent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sin is so adherent and insinuating, that it comes to him in the nature of civility; It is a sad sight to see a great personage under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take an action passionately and upon great interest; and let him manage it as indiscreetly, let the whole designe be unjust, let it be acted with all the malice and impotency in the world, he shall have enough to tell him that he proceeds wisely enough, to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his interest, and promoters of his sin, instruments of his malice and actors of revenge. But which of all his relatives shall dare to tell him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his indiscretion, of his rage and of his folly? he had need be a bold man and a severe person, that shall tell him of his danger; and that he is in a direct progresse towards hell; and indeed such personages have been so long nourished up in soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes flattery and effeminancy, that too often themselves are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of a monitor, and think the charity and duty of a modest reprehension to be a rudenesse and incivility that Prince is a wise man that loves to have it otherwise; and certainly it is a strange civility and dutifulnesse in friends and relatives, to suffer him to go to hell uncontrolled; rather then to seem unmannerly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a great sinner. But certainly this is none of the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities of them who are Lords of the world and masters of great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> possessions.</p>
                  <p>I omit to speak of the habitual intemperance, which is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly annexed to Festival and delicious tables, where there is no other measure or restraint upon the appetite, but its fulnesse and satiety, and when it cannot or dare not eat more. Oftentimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the intemperance of a poor table is more temperate and hath lesse of luxury in it, then the temperance of a rich. To this are consequent all the evil accidents and effects of fulnesse; pride, lust, wantonnesse, softnesses of disposition and dissolution of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, huge talking, imperiousnesse, despite and contempt of poor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> persons, and at the best it is a great temptation for a man to have in his power, whatsoever he can have in his sensual desires: who then shall check his voracity or calm his revenge or allay his pride or mortify his lust or humble his spirit? it is like as when a lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young and tempted person lives perpetually with his amorous and delicious mistris, if <hi>he scapes</hi> burning, that is inflamed

from within and set on fire from without it is a greater miracle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then the escaping from the flames of the furnace, by the three children of the captivity. And just such a thing is the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, it furnishes us with abilities to sin and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ruine, and it makes us to dwell with poisons and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and enemies.</p>
                  <p>And although the grace of God is sufficient to great personages, and masters of the world, and that it is possible for a young man to be tyed upon a bed of flowers and fastned by the arms and band of a curtesan and tempted wantonly and yet to escape the danger and the crime, and to triumph gloriously: (for so Saint Hierome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> reports of a son of the king of Nicomedia) and riches and a free fortune are designed by God to be a mercy and an opportunity of doing noble things, and excellent charity, and exact justice, and to protect innocence, and to defend oppressed people; yet it is a mercy mixt with much danger; yet it is like the present of a whole vintage to a man in a hectick feaver, he will be shrewdly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to drink of it, and if he does, he is inflamed and may chance to die with the kindnesse. Happy are those persons who use the world and abuse it not, who possesse a part of it and love it for no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> other ends, but for necessities of nature, and conveniencies of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and discharge of all their duty and the offices of religion, and in charity to Christ and all Christs members; but since he that hath all the world cannot command nature to do him one office extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and enjoyes the best parts but in common with the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est man in the world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and can use no more of it but according to a limited and a very narrow capacity, and whatsoever he can use or possesse cannot out-weigh the present pressure of a sharp disease, nor can it at all give him content without which there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of felicity; since a prince in the matter of using the world, differs nothing from his subjects, but in mere accedents and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and yet these very many trifling differences are not to be obtained but by so much labour and care, so great expence of time and trouble, that the possession will not pay thus much of the price, and after all this, the man may die two hours after he hath made his troublesome and expensive purchase and is certain not to enjoy it long.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this last, that most men get so little of the world that it is all together of a trifling and inconsiderable interest, that they who have the most of this world, have the most of that but in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> title and in supreme rights, and reserved priviledges, the real use descending upon others to more substantial purposes; that the possession of this trifle is mixt with sorrow upon other accidents, and is allayed with fear, and that the greatnesse of mens pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions increase their thirst, and enlarge their wants, by swelling their capacitie, and above all, is of so great danger to a mans vertue

                  <p>And therefore when the soul is at stake, not for its tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but for its eternal interest, it is not good to be hasty in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, without taking just measures of the exchange.

                  <p>But we shall better understand the nature of this bargain if we consider the soul that is exchanged, what it is in it self in order not of nature but to felicity and the capacities of joy, secondly what price the Son of God payed for it, and thirdly what it is to lose it, that is, what miseries and tortures are signified by losing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a mans soul.</p>
                  <p>First if we consider what the soul is in its own capacity to happinesse, we shall finde it to be an excellency greater then the sun; of an angelicall substance, sister to a cherubin, an image of the divinity, and the great argument of that mercy, whereby God did distinguish us from the lower form of beasts and trees and minerals.</p>
                  <p>For so it was the scripture affirmes, that <hi>God made man after his own image,</hi> that is, <hi>secundum illam imaginem &amp; ideam quam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepitipse,</hi> not according to the likenesse of any of those creatures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which were prexistent to mans production; not according to any of those images or ideas whereby God created the heavens, and the earth; but by a new form; to distinguish him, from all other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; he made him by a new idea of his own, by an uncreated exemplar; and besides that this was a donation of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent faculties, such as we understand to be perfect, and essential, or rather the essence of God, it was also a designation of him to a glorious immortality and a communication of the rayes and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own essential felicities.</p>
                  <p>But the soul is al that whereby we may be, and without which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cannot be happy. It is not the eye that sees the beauties of the heaven, nor the ear that hears the sweetnesses of musick, or the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings of a prosperous accident, but the soul that perceives all the relishes of sensual and intellectual perfections and the more noble and excellent the soul is the greater and more savory are its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50231:299"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and if a childe beholds the rich Ermine, or the Diamonds of a starry night, or the order of the world, or hears the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of an Apostle, because he makes no reflex acts upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and sees not that he sees; he can have but the pleasure of a fool or the deliciousnesse of a mule. But although the reflection of its own acts be a rare instrument of pleasure or pain respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet the souls excellency is upon the same reason not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, by which the sapidnesse of pleasant things of nature, are not understood by a childe; even because the soul cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect far enough. For as the Sun which is the fountain of light and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> heat, makes violent and direct emission of his rayes from himself but reflects them no further then to the bottom of a cloud, or the lowest imaginary circle of the middle region, and therefore receives a duplicate of his own heat; so is the soul of man, it reflects upon its own inferiour actions of particular sense or general understanding; but because it knows little of its own nature, the manners of volition the immediate instruments of understanding, the way how it comes to meditate, and cannot discern how a sudden thought arrives, or the solution of a doubt, not depending upon preceding premises, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therefore above halfe its pleasures are abated, and its own worth lesse understood; and possibly it is the better, it is so. If the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant knew his strength, or the horse the vigorousnesse of his own spirit, they would be as rebellious against their rulers, as unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men against government: nay the Angels themselves, because their light reflected home to their orbs, and they understood all the secrets of their own perfection, they grew vertiginous and fell from the battlements of heaven. But the excellency of a humane soul shall then be truly understood, when the reflection will make no distraction of our faculties, nor enkindle any ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fires; when we may understand our selves without danger.</p>
                  <p>In the mean this consideration is gone high enough when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the soul of a man to be so excellently perfect, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand how excellently perfect it is: that being the best way of expressing our conceptions of God himself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall not need by distinct discourses to represent that the will of man is the last resort and sanctuary of true pleasure, which in its formality can be nothing else but a conformity of possession or of being to the will; that the understanding being the chanel and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conveyance of the noblest perceptions feeds upon pleasures in all its proportionate acts, and unlesse it be disturbed by intervening sins and remembrances, derived hence, keeps a perpetual festival; that the passions are every of them fitted with an object, in which they rest as in their centre; that they have such delight in these their proper objects, that too often they venture a damnation, rather then quit their interest and possession; but yet from these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50231:300"/>
it would follow that to lose a soul, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to be an immense sea of pleasures, even in its natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities is to lose all that whereby a man can possibly be, or be supposed happy; and so much the rather is this understood to be an insupportable calamity, because losing a soul in this sense, is not a meer privation of those felicities of which a soul is naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be a partaker, but it is an investing it with contrary objects, and crosse effects, and dolorous perceptions: For the will if it mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses its desires, is afflicted, and the understanding when it ceases to be ennobled with excellent things is made ignorant as a swine, dull as the foot of a rock, and the afflictions are in the destitution of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their perfective actions, made tumultuous, vexed and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, to the height of rage and violence. But this is but the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the beginning of those throes which end not but in eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly if we consider the price that the Son of God payed for the redemption of a soul, we shall better estimate of it, then from the weak discourses of our imperfect and unlearned Philosophy: not the spoil of rich provinces, not the aestimate of kingdoms, not the price of Cleopatra's draught, not any thing that was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible or perishing; for that, which could not one minute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the tearm of its own natural dissolution, could not be a price for the redemption of one perishing soul. And if we list but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and then consider that a miserable, lost, and accursed soul does so infinitely undervalue, and disrelish all the goods and riches that this world dotes on; that he hath no more gust in them, or pleasure, then the fox hath in eating a turfe: that if he could be imagined to be the Lord of ten thousand worlds, he would give them all for any shaddow of a hope of a possibility of returning to life again; that Dives in hell would have willingly gone on em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy to his fathers house that he might have been quit a little from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his flames, and on that condition would have given Lazarus the fee-simple of all his temporal possessions, though he had once denied to relieve him with the superfluities of his table, will soon confesse that a moment of time is no good exchange for an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of duration; and a light unprofitable possession is not to be put in the ballance against <hi>a soul,</hi> which is the glory of the creation; <hi>a soul,</hi> with whom God had made a contract, and contracted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent relations, it being one of Gods appellatives, that he is [the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of souls.]</p>
                  <p>When God made a soul, it was onely, <hi>faciamus hominem ad</hi>

To which also I adde this additionall account, that a soul is so greatly valued by God, that we are not to venture the losse of it, to save all the world For therefore whosoever should commit a sin to save kingdoms from perishing, or if the case could be put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that all the good men, and good causes, and good things in this world, were to be destroyed by Tyranny, and it were in our power by perjury to save all these, that doing this sin would be so farre from hallowing the crime, that it were to offer to God a sacrifice of what he most hates, and to serve him with swines blood: and the rescuing all these from a Tyrant, or a hangman, could not be pleasing to God upon those termes, because a soul is lost by it, which is in it self a greater losse and misery, then all the evils in the world put together can out-ballance; and a losse of that thing for which Christ gave his blood a price: Persecutions and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> death in holy men and in a just cause, are but seeming evils, and therefore not to be bought off with the losse of a soul, which is a real but an intolerable calamity: And if God for his own sake would not have all the world saved by sin, that is by the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a soul, we should do well for our own sakes not to lose a soul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for trifles, for things that make us here to be miserable, and even here also to be ashamed.</p>

                  <p>I shall not need to represent to your considerations those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Scripture, which the Holy Ghost hath set down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to our capacities the greatnesse of this perishing; choosing such circumstances of character as were then usuall in the world, and which are dreadful to our understanding as any thing: <hi>Hell fire]</hi> is the common expression; for the Eastern nations accounted burnings the greatest of their miserable punishments: and burning malefactours was frequent, <hi>[brimstone and fire]</hi> to Saint John <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 10. calls the state of punishment, <hi>prepared for the Devil and all his servants,</hi> he adding the circumstance of brimstone, for by this time the Devil had taught the world more ingenious pains, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and himself was new escaped out of boiling oil and brimstone, and such bituminous matter; and the Spirit of God knew right well the worst expression was not bad enough, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as two Apostles, Saint Peter and Saint Jude call it, The blacknesse of darknesse for ever. In which although it is certain, that God whose Justice there rules, will inflict but just so much as our sins deserve, and not superadde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> degrees of undeserved misery, as he does to the Saints of glory (for God gives to blessed souls in heaven more, infinitely more then all their good works could possibly deserve, and therefore their glory is infinitely bigger glory then the pains of hell are great pains) yet because Gods Justice in hell rules alone, without the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes and sweeter abatements of mercy, they shall have pure and unmingled misery; no pleasant thought to refresh their wearinesse, no comfort in an other accident to alleviate their pressures, no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to cool their flames; but because when there is a great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon a man, every such man thinks himself the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and though there are great degrees of pain in hell, yet there are none perceived by him that thinks he suffers the greatest; It follows that every man that loses his soul in this darknesse is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable beyond all those expressions which the tortures of this world could furnish to the Writers of holy Scripture.</p>

But I shall choose to represent this consideration in that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> the 9. the 44. verse; which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self took out of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> the 66. verse the 24. <hi>Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched;</hi> this is the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet; for although this expression was a prediction of that horrid calamity and abscision of the Jewish Nation, when God poured out a full vial of his wrath upon the crucifiers of his Son, and that this which was the greatest calamity which ever did or ever shall happen to a Nation, Christ with great reason took to describe the calamity of accursed souls, as being the greatest instance to signifie the greatest torment: yet we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that the difference of each state makes the same words in the several cases to be of infinite distinction: The worm stuck close to the Jewish Nation, and the fire of Gods wrath flamed out till they were consumed with a great and unheard of destruction; till many millions did die accursedly, and the small remnant became vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and were reserved, like broken pieces, after a storm, to shew the greatnesse of the storm, and misery of the shipwrack; but then this being translated to signifie the state of accursed souls, whose dying is a continual perishing, who cannot cease to be, it must mean an eternity of duration, in proper and naturall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we may understand it fully, observe the places. In the 34. <hi>Esa.</hi> 8. The Prophet prophecies of the great destruction of Jerusalem for all her great iniquities. <hi>It is the day of the Lords vengeance, and the yeer of recompences, for the controversie of Sion, and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day, the smoak thereof shall go up for ever, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It shall lie wast, none shall passe thorow it for ever and ever.</hi> This is the final destruction of the Nation; but this destruction shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have an end, because the Nation shall end, and the anger also shall end in its own period, even then when God shall call the Jews into the common inheritance with the Gentiles, <hi>and all the sons of God.</hi> And this also was the period of their <hi>worme,</hi> as it is of their <hi>fire, The fire of the Divine vengeance</hi> upon the Nation; which was not to be extinguished till they were destroyed, as we see it come to passe. And thus also in Saint Jude, the Angels who kept not their first state, are said to be reserved by God <hi>in everlasting chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darknesse:</hi> which word [everlasting] signifies not absolutely to eternity, but to the utmost end of that period, for so it follows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>[unto the judgement of the great day]</hi> that <hi>[everlasting]</hi> lasts no longer; and in verse the seventh, the word <hi>[eternal]</hi> is just so used: <hi>The men of Sodom and Gomorrha are set forth for an example suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the vengeance</hi> of [eternal fire,] that is, of a fire, which burned till they were quite destroyed, and the cities and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

                  <p>That these words <hi>[for ever, everlasting, eternal, the never-dying worme, the fire unquenchable,]</hi> being words borrowed by our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour and his Apostles from the stile of the old Testament, must have a signification just proportionable to the state in which they signifie; so that as this worme when it signifies a temporal infliction meanes a worme that never ceases, giving torment, till the body is consumed: So when it is translated to an immortall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> state, it must signifie as much in that proportion: that <hi>[eternal,]</hi> that <hi>everlasting,</hi> hath no end at all: because the soul cannot be killed in the natural sense, but is made miserable and perishing for ever; that is, <hi>the worme shall not die</hi> so long as the soul shall be unconsumed: <hi>the fire shall not be quenched,</hi> till the period of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall nature comes, and that this shall be <hi>absolutely for ever</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any restriction, appears unanswerably in this, because the same <hi>(for ever)</hi> that is, for the blessed souls, the same <hi>for ever,</hi> is for the accursed souls; but the blessed <hi>souls that die in the Lord, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi>

So that because <hi>for ever</hi> hath no end, till the thing or the duration it self have end, in the same sense in which the Saints and Angels give glory to God <hi>for ever,</hi> in the same sense the lost souls shall suffer the evils of their sad inheritance; and since after this death of nature, which is a separation of soul and body, there remains no more death, but this second death, this eternal perishing of miserable accursed souls, whose duration must be eternall; It follows that <hi>the worm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and <hi>the unquenchable fire</hi> of hell have no period at all; but shall last as long as God lasts, or the measures of a proper eternity; that they who provoke God to wrath, by their base, unreasonable, and sottish practises, may know what their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be in the everlasting habitations: and yet suppose that Origens opinion had been true; and that accursed souls should have ease and a period to their tortures after a thousand years; I pray let it be considered, whether it be not a great madnesse to choose the pleasures, or the wealth of a few years here, with trouble, with danger, with uncertainty, with labour, with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of sicknesse, and for this to endure the flames of hell for a thousand yeers together? The pleasures of the world no man can have for a hundred yeers, and no man hath pleasure a hundred dayes together, but he hath some trouble intervening: or at least a wearinesse and a loathing of the pleasure; and therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure insufferable calamities (suppose it be) for a hundred yeers, without any interruption, without so much comfort as the light

                  <p>If a man were condemned but to lie still, or to lie a bed in one posture without turning, for seven yeers together, would he not buy it off with the losse of all his estate? If a man were to be put upon the rack, for every day, three moneths together, (suppose him able to live so long) what would he do to be quit of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Wouldany man curse the King to his face, if he were sure to have both his hands burnt off, and to be tormented with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments three yeers together? Would any man in his wits accept of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a hundred pound a yeer for fourty yeers, if he were sure to be tormented in the fire for the next hundred yeers together without intermission? Think then what a thousand yeers signifie: Ten ages, the age of two Empires; but this account I must tell you is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short, though I thus discourse to you, how great fools wicked men are, though this opinion should be true: A goodly comfort surely! that for two or three yeers sottish pleasure, a man shall be infinitely tormented but for <hi>a thousand yeers.</hi> But then when we cast up the minutes, and yeers, and ages of eternity, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self is a great hell to those persons who by their evil lives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are consigned to such sad and miserable portions.</p>
                  <p>A thousand yeers is a long while to be in torment; we finde a fever of 21. dayes to be like an age in length: but when the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an intolerable misery is for ever in the height, and for ever beginning, and ten thousand yeers hath spent no part of its terme, but it makes a perpetual efflux, and is like the centre of a circle, which ever transmits lines to the circumference; this is a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so sad that the horrour of it and the reflexion upon its abode and duration, make a great part of the hell; for hell could not be hell without the despair of accursed souls; for any hope were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and a drop of water, which would help to allay those flames, which as they burn intolerably, so they must burn for ever.</p>
                  <p>And I desire you to consider that although the Scripture uses the word [fire] to expresse the torments of accursed souls, yet fire can no more equal the pangs of hell then it can torment a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial substance; the pains of perishing souls being as much more afflictive then the smart of fire, as the smart of fire is troublesome beyond the softnesse of Persian carpets, or the sensuality of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Luxury: for the pains of hell; and the perishing or losing of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> soul is to suffer the wrath of God, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our B. Saviour entailed a law &amp; a condition of sufferings, &amp; promised a state of persecution to his servants, and withall had charmed them with the bands &amp; unactive chains of so many passive graces, that they should not be able to stir against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Tyrants, or abate the edge of axes, by any instrument, but their own blood; being <hi>sent forth as sheep among wolves,</hi> innocent and silent, harmlesse, and defencelesse, certainly exposed to sorrow, and uncertainly guarded in their persons; their condition seemed nothing else, but a designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to slaughter: and when they were drawn into the folds of the church, they were betrayed into the hands of evil men, infinitely and unavoidably; and when an Apostle invited a proselyte to come to Christ, it was in effect a snare laid for his life, and he could neither conceal his religion, nor hide his person, nor avoid a captious question, nor deny his accusation, nor elude the bloody
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50231:306"/>
arts of Orators and informers, nor break prisons, nor any thing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> die. If the case stood just thus, it was well eternity stood at the outer doors of our life, ready to receive such harmlesse people; but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there could be no art in the designe, no pitying of humane weaknesses, no complying with the condition of man, no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances made for customs and prejudices of the world, no inviting men by the things of men, no turning nature into religion; but it was all the way a direct violence, and an open prostitution of our lives; and a throwing away our fortune into a sea of rashnesse and credulity. But therefore God ordered the affaires and necessities of religion in other wayes and to other purposes. Although God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> bound our hands behinde us, yet he did not tie our understandings up: although we might not use our swords, yet we might use our reason: we were not suffered to be violent, but we might avoid violence by all the arts of prudence and innocence; if we did take heed of sin, we might also take heed of men: &amp; because in al conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between <hi>wit and violence, prudence &amp; rudenesse, learning</hi> and <hi>the sword,</hi> the strong hand took it first, and the strong head possessed it last: the strong man first governed, and the witty man succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and lasted longer; it came to passe that the wisdom of the Father hath so ordered it, that all his Disciples should overcome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the power of the Roman legions by a wise religion; and <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>innocence</hi> should become the mightiest guards; and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an although exposed to persecution, yet is so secured that he shall never need to die But when the circumstances are so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that his reason is convinced that then it is fit he should; fit (I say) in order to Gods purposes and his own.</p>
                  <p>For he that is <hi>innocent</hi> is safe against all the rods and the axes of all the Consuls of the world, if they rule by justice; and he that is <hi>prudent</hi> will also escape from many rudenesses and irregular vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that can come by injustice: and no wit of man, no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, no armies can do more; for Caesar perished in the midst of all his legions and all his honours, and against <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities</hi> there is no provision lesse then infinite, that can give secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and although <hi>prudence</hi> alone cannot do this; yet <hi>innocence</hi> gives the greatest title to that providence which onely can if he pleases, and will if it be fitting. Here then are the two armes defensive of a Christian: <hi>Prudence</hi> against the evils of men, <hi>Innocence</hi> against the evils of Devils and all that relates to his kingdom.</p>

                     </gap>. Every good man is incircled with many enemies, and dangers: and his vertue shall be rifled, and the decency of his soul and spirit shall be discomposed and turned into a heap of inarticulate and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fancies, unlesse by the methods and guards of prudence it be mannaged and secured.</p>
                  <p>But in order to the following discourse and its method, we are first to consider whether this be, or indeed can be a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or what is it? For can all men that give up their names in baptisme, be enjoyned to be wise and prudent? It is as if God would command us to be eloquent, or witty men, fine speakers, or strait bodied, or excellent schollers, or rich men: If he please to make us so, we are so; and prudence is a gift of God, a blessing of an excellent nature, and of great leisure, and a wise opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and a severe education, and a great experience, and a strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and good company; all which being either wholly, or in part out of our power, may be expected as free gifts, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imposed as commandments.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, That Christian prudence is in very many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances a direct duty; in some an instance and advice, in order to degrees and advantages: where it is a duty, it is put into every mans power; where it is an advice it is onely expected according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not: and even here, although the events of prudence are out of our power, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the endeavours and the observation, the diligence and caution, the moral part of it, and the plain conduct of our necessary duty (which are portions of this grace) are such things which God will demand in proportion to the talent which he hath intrusted into our Banks. There are in indeed some Christians very unwary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the conduct of their religion, and they cannot all help it, at least not in all degrees; but yet they may be taught to <hi>do prudent things,</hi> though <hi>not to be prudent persons;</hi> if they have not the <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of <hi>advice,</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> yet they may have the <hi>prudence</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>obedience,</hi> and of <hi>disciples:</hi> and the event is this; without prudence their vertue is unsafe, and their persons defenselesse, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is unguarded; for prudence is a hand-maid waiting at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and birth of vertue: It is a nurse to it in its infancy, its patron an assaults, its guide in temptations, its security in all porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of chance and contingency: And he that is imprudent, if he

Its parts and proper acts consist in the following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the duty of Christian prudence to choose the end of a Christian, that which is perfective of a man, satisfactory to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the rest of a Christian, and the beatification of his spirit; and that is, to choose and desire, and propound to himself heaven, and the fruition of God, as the end of all his acts and arts, his designes and purposes. For in the nature of things that is most eligible, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> most to be pursued, which is most perfective of our nature, and is the acquiescence, the satisfaction, and proper rest of our most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable appetites. Now the things of this world are difficult and uneasie, full of thornes, and empty of pleasures, they fill a disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed faculty, or an abused sense, but are an infinite dissatisfaction to reason, and the appetites of the soul: they are short, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient, and they never abide, unlesse sorrow like a chain be bound about their leg, and then they never stir, till the grace of God and religion breaks it, or else that the rust of time eats the chain in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: they are dangerous and doubtfull, few and difficult, sordid and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> particular, not onely not communicable to a multitude, but not diffusive upon the whole man; there being no one pleasure or object in this world, that delights all the parts of man: and after all this, they are originally from earth, and from the creatures, onely that they oftentimes contract alliances with hell and the grave, with shame and sorrow; and all these put together make no great ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or proportion to a wise mans choice: But on the other side, the things of God are the noblest satisfactions to those desires, which ought to be cherished and swelled up to infinite; their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse is vast and full of relish, and their very appendant thorns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are to be chosen, for they are gilded, they are safe and medicinall, they heal the wound they make, and bring forth fruit of a blessed and a holy life: The things of God and of religion are easie and sweet, they bear entertainments in their hand, and reward at their back, their good is certain and perpetual, and they make us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50231:307"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to day, and pleasant to morrow; and spiritual songs end not in a sigh and a groan; neither like unwholesome physick do they let loose a present humour, and introduce an habitual indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But they bring us to the felicity of God, the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever; they do not give a private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar delight, but their benefit is publike, like the incense of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, it sends up a sweet smell to heaven, and makes atonement for the religious man that kindled it, and delights all the standers by, and makes the very air wholesome; there is no blessed soul goes to heaven, but he makes a generall joy in all the mansions where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Saints do dwell, and in all the chappels where the Angels sing: and the joyes of religion are not univocal, but productive of rare and accidental, and praeternatural pleasures; for the musick of holy hymnes delights the ear, and refreshes the spirit, and makes the very bones of the Saint to rejoyce: and charity, or the giving alms to the poor, does not onely ease the poverty of the receiver, but makes the giver rich, and heals his sicknesse, and <hi>delivers from death;</hi> and temperance though it be in the matter of meat, and drink, and pleasures, yet hath an effect upon the understanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and makes the reason sober, and his will orderly, and his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons regular, and does things beside, and beyond their natural and proper efficacy; for all the parts of our duty are watered with the showers of blessing, and bring forth fruit according to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of heaven, and beyond the capacities of nature.</p>
                  <p>And now let the voluptuous person go and try whether put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his wanton hand to the bosome of his Mistris will get half such honour as Scaevola put upon his head, when he put his hand into the fire. Let him see whether a drunken meeting will cure a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or make him wise? A hearty and a persevering prayer will. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Let him tell me, if spending great summes of money upon his lusts will make him sleep soundly, or be rich? Charity will; Alms will increase his fortune, and a good conscience shall charme all his cares and sorrows into a most delicious slumber; well may a full goblet wet the drunkards tongue, and then the heat rising from the stomack will dry the spunge, and heat it into the scorchings and little images of hell: and the follies of a wanton bed will turn the itch into a smart, and empty the reins of all their lustfull powers; but can they do honour, or satisfaction in any thing that must last, and that ought to be provided for? No: All the things of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this world are little, and trifling, and limited, and particular, and sometimes necessary because we are miserable, wanting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but they never do any thing toward perfection, but their pleasure dies like the time in which it danced a while, and when the minute is gone, so is the pleasure too, and leaves no footstep but the impression of a sigh, and dwells no where, but in the same house where you shall finde <hi>yesterday,</hi> that is in forgetfulnesse, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50231:308"/>
annihilation, unlesse its onely childe, <hi>sorrow,</hi> shall marry, and breed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> more of its kinde, and so continue its memory and name to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ages. It is therefore the most necessary part of prudence to choose well in the main stake; and the dispute is not much; for if eternall things be better then temporall, the soul more noble then the body, vertue more honourable then the basest vices, a lasting joy to be chosen before an eternall sorrow, <hi>much</hi> to be preferred before <hi>little, certainty</hi> before <hi>danger, publike good things,</hi> before <hi>private evils, eternity</hi> before <hi>moments,</hi> then let us set down in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and make heaven to be our end, God to be our Father, Christ our elder Brother, the Holy Ghost the earnest of our inheritance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vertue to be our imployment, and then we shall never enter into the portion of fools and accursed ill-choosing spirits. Nazianzen said well, <hi>Malim prudentiae guttam quàm foecundioris fortunae pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus:</hi> One drop of prudence is more usefull, then an ocean of a smooth fortune; for prudence is a rare instrument towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and a great fortune is made oftentimes the high-way to hell and destruction. However, thus farre, prudence is our duty; every man can be so wise, and is bound to it, to choose heaven and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with God, before the possessions and transient vanities of the world. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a duty of Christian prudence to pursue this great end, with apt means and instruments in proportion to that end. No wise man will sail to Ormus in a cock-boat, or use a childe for his interpreter; and that Generall is a Cyclops without an eye, who chooses the sickest men to man his Towns, and the weakest to fight his battels. It cannot be a vigorous prosecution unlesse the means have an efficacy or worth commensurate to all the difficulty, and something of the excellency of that end which is designed. And indeed men use not to be so weak in acquiring the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of their temporals; But in matters of religion they think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any thing effective enough to secure the greatest interest; as if all the fields of heaven, and the regions of the Kingdom were waste ground, and wanted a Colony of planters; and that God invited men to heaven upon any terms, that he might rejoyce in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of subjects. For certain it is, men do more to get a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, then for all the glories of heaven: Men <hi>rise up early,</hi> and <hi>sit up late,</hi> and <hi>eat the bread of carefulnesse,</hi> to become richer then their neighbours; and are amazed at every losse, and impatient of an evil accident, and feel a direct storm of passion, if they suffer in their interest: But in order to heaven they are cold in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> indevour in their prayers, incurious in their walking, unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their circumstances, indifferent in the use of their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, infrequent in their discoursings of it, not inquisitive of the way, and yet think they shall surely go to heaven: But a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man knows that by the greatnesse of the purchase, he is to

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> make an estimate of the value and the price: When we ask of God any great thing; As <hi>wisdom, delivery from sicknesse, his holy Spirit, the forgivenesse of sins,</hi> the grace of <hi>chastity, restitution to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> or the like, do we hope to obtain them without a high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the things we ask? and if we value them highly, must we not desire them earnestly? and if we desire them earnestly, must we not pray for them fervently? and whatsoever we ask for fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, must not we beg for frequently? and then because prayer is but one hand toward the reaching a blessing, and God requires our cooperation and endeavour; and we must work with both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hands: are we not convinced that our prayers are either faint, or a designe of lazinesse, when we either ask coldly, or else pray loudly, hoping to receive the graces we need without labour? A prudent person that knows to value the best object of his desires, will also know that he must observe the degrees of labour, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the excellency of the reward: Prayer must be <hi>effectuall, servent, frequent, continuall, holy, passionate,</hi> that must get a grace, or secure a blessing: The <hi>love</hi> that we must have to God must be such as <hi>to keep his commandements,</hi> and to make us willing to part with all our estate, and all our honour, and our life for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of a holy conscience. <hi>Our charity</hi> to our neighbours must be expressive in a language of a reall friendship, aptnesse to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, readinesse to forbear, in pitying infirmities, in relieving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, in giving our goods and our lives, and quitting our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges to save his soul, to secure and support his vertue. <hi>Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> must be full of sorrows and care, of diligence and hatred against sin, it must drive out all, and leave no affections towards it; it must be constant and persevering, fearfull of relapse, and watch-full of all accidents: <hi>Our temperance</hi> must <hi>sometimes</hi> turn into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, and <hi>most commonly</hi> be severe, and <hi>ever</hi> without reproof: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>He that striveth for masteries is temperate</hi> (saith Saint Paul) <hi>in all things;</hi> he that does all this, may with some pretence and reason say, he intends to go to heaven: But they that will not deny a lust, nor refrain an appetite, they that will be drunk when their friends do merrily constrain them, or love a cheap religion and a gentle and lame prayer, short and soft, quickly said, and soon passed over, seldome returning, and but little observed, How is it possible that they should think themselves persons disposed to receive such glorious crowns and scepters, such excellent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they have not faith enough to believe, nor attention <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enough to consider, and no man can have wit enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. But so might an Arcadian shepherd look from the rocks, or thorow the clefts of the valley where his sheep graze, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the messenger stayes so long from comming to him to be crowned King of all the Greek Ilands, or to be adopted heir to the Macedonian Monarchy. It is an infinite love of God, that we have

heaven upon conditions, which we can perform with greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But truely the lives of men are generally such, that they do things in order to heaven, things (I say) so few, so trifling, so unworthy, that they are not proportionable to the reward of a crown of oak, or a yellow riband, the slender reward with which the Romans payed their souldiers for their extraordinary valour. True it is, that heaven is not in a just sense of a commutation, <hi>a reward,</hi> but <hi>a gift,</hi> and <hi>an infinite favour:</hi> but yet it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth but to persons disposed by the conditions of God; which conditions when we pursue in kinde, let us be very carefull we do not fail of <hi>the mighty price of our high calling,</hi> for want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> degrees, and just measures, the measures of zeal and a mighty love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an office of prudence so to serve God that we may at the same time preserve our lives and our estates, our interest and reputation for our selves, and our relatives, so farre as they can consist together. Saint Paul in the beginning of Christianity was careful to instruct the forwardnesse and zeal of the new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into good husbandry, and to catechize the men into good trades, and the women into useful imployments, that they might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not be unprofitable. For Christian religion carrying us to heaven, does it by the way of a man, and by the body it serves the soul, as by the soul it serves God; and therefore it endeavours to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the body and its interest, that it may continue the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of a crown, and prolong the stage in which we are to run <hi>for the mighty price of our salvation:</hi> and this is that part of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is the defensative and guards of a Christian in the time of persecution; and it hath in it much of duty. He that through an indiscreet zeal casts himself into a needlesse danger, hath betrayed his life to tyranny and tempts the sin of an enemy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he loses to God the service of many yeers, and cuts off himself from a fair opportunity of working his salvation (in the main parts of which we shall finde a long life, and very many yeers of reason to be little enough) he betrayes the interest of his relatives, (which he is bound to preserve) he disables himself of making <hi>provision for them of his own house,</hi> and he that fails in this duty by his own fault, <hi>is worse then an infidel,</hi> and denies the faith, by such unseasonably dying, or being undone, which by that testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he did intend gloriously to confesse; he serves the end of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and popular services, but not the sober ends of religion, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> discourages the weak, and weakens the hands of the strong, and by upbraiding their warinesse, tempts them to turn it into rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or despair; he affrights strangers from entring into religion, while by such imprudence, he shall represent it to be impossible at the same time to be wise and to be religious; it turns all the whole religion into a forwardnesse of dying or beggery, leaving

But then when the wolves had entred into the folds and seized upon a lamb the rest fled, and used all the innocent arts of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Saint Athanasius</hi> being overtaken by his persecutors, but not known, and asked whether he saw Athanasius passing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> way; pointed out forward with his finger, <hi>non longè abest Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius;</hi> the man is not far off; a swift foot-man will easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him. And Saint Paul divided the councell of his Judges, and made the Pharisees his parties by a witty insinuation of his own belief of the resurrection, which was not the main question, but an incident to the matter of his accusation. And when Plinius se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus in the face of a Tyrant court was pressed so invidiously to give his opinion concerning a good man in banishment and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the disadvantage of an unjust sentence he diverted the snare of Marcus Regulus by referring his answer to a competent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> according to the laws; being pressed again, by offering a direct answer upon a just condition, which he knew, they would not accept; and the third time, by turning the envy upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and malicious Orator, that he won great honour, the honour of a severe honesty, and a witty man, and a prudent

                  <p>For in this case the rule is easy; If we are commanded to be wise and redeeme our time, that we serve God and religion, we must not use unlawful arts which set us back in the accounts of our time, no lying Subterfuges, no betraying of a truth, no treachery to a good man, no insnaring of a brother, no secret renouncing of any part or proposition of our religion, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to confesse the article when we are called to it. For when the primitive Christians had got a trick to give money for certificates, that they had sacrificed to idols, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they did not do it, but had corrupted the officers and ministers of state, they dishonoured their religion and were marked with the appellative of <hi>libellatici, Libellers;</hi> and were excommunicate and cast off from the society of Christians and the hopes of Heaven, till they had returned to God by a severe repentance; <hi>optanduum est ut quod libenter facis din fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere possis.</hi> It is good to have time long to doe that which wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ought to doe; but to pretend that, which we dare not doe, and to say we have, when we have not, if we know we ought not, is to dishonour the cause and the person too; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly against <hi>confession of Christ,</hi> of which Saint Paul saith, <hi>by the mouth confession is made unto salvation</hi> And our Blessed Saviour, <hi>he that confesseth me before men.

Christian prudence forbids us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a danger; and they were fond persons that run to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and when the Proconsul sate on the life and death, and made strict inquisition after Christians, went and offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

IT is the office of Christian prudence so to order the affaires of our life as that in all the offices of our souls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, we do honour and reputation, to the religion we professe. For the follies and vices of the Professors give great advantages to the adversary to speak reproachfully, and does aliene the hearts and hinder the complyance of those undetermined per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are apt to be perswaded, if their understandings be not prejudiced.</p>
                  <p>But as our necessary duty is bound upon us by one ligament more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in order to the honour of the cause of God: so it particularly bindes us to many circumstances adjuncts and parts of duty which have no other commandment, but the law of prudence. There are some sects of Christians which have some one constant indisposition, which as a character divides them from all others, and makes them reproved on all hands: some are so suspitious and ill natured, that if a person of a facile nature and gentle disposition fall into their hands he is presently sowred and made morose, unpleasant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy in his conversation: Others there are that do things so like to what themselves condemn that they are forced to take sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and labour in the mine of unsignificant distinctions, to make themselves believe they are innocent: and in the mean time they offend all men else, and open the mouths of their adversaries to speak reproachful things; true, or false; (as it happens) And it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great wit to understand all the distinctions and devices thought of, for legitimating the worshipping of images: And those
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50231:312"/>
people that are liberal in their excommunications make men think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they have reason to say their Judges are proud, or self willed, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, or ill natured people. These that are the faults of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and continued, are quickly derived upon the sect and cause a disreputation to the whole society and institution. And who can think that congregation to be a true branch of the Christian, who makes it their profession to kill men to save their souls against their will, and against their understanding? who calling themselves dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of so meek a Master, do live like bears upon prey, and spoil and blood? It is a huge dishonour to the sincerity of a mans purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be too busie in fingring money in the matters of religion: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they that are zealous for their rights and tame in their devotion, furious against sacrilege, and a companion of drunkards; implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against breakers of a Canon, and carelesse and patient enough with them that break the fifth or sixth Commandments of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, tell all the world their private sense is to preserve their own interest with scruple and curiosity, and leave God to take care for his.</p>
                  <p>Thus Christ reproved the Pharisees, for straining at a gnat and swallowing a Camel; the very representation of the manner and matter of fact discovers the vice by reproving the folly of it. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that are factious to get a rich proselyte and think the poor not worth saving dishonour their zeal and teach men to call it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, and though there may be a reason of prudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire one more then the other, because of a bigger efficacy, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the one may have more then the other; yet it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discovered if it be done by secular designe: and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that did not allow the preferring of a gay man before a poor Saint in the matter of place, will not be pleased that in the matter of souls, which are all equal, there should be a faction and designe, and an acceptation of persons. Never let us pollute our religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with arts of the world, nor offer to support the arke with unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hands; nor mingle false propositions with true, nor make religion a pretence to profit or preferment, nor do things which are like a vice; neither ever speak things dishonorable of God, nor abuse thy brother for Gods sake, nor be solicitous and over busie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thy own little things neither alwayes think it fit to lose thy charity by forcing thy brother to do justice; and all those things which are the outsides and faces, the garments and most discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts of religion, be sure that they be dressed according to all the circumstances of men and by all the rules of common honesty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and publick reputation. Is it not a sad thing that the Jew should say, the Christians worship images? or that it should become a proverb, that <hi>the Jew spends all in his passeover, the Moore in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the Christian in his law suits?</hi> that, what the first sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to religion, and the second to publick joy, we should spend
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50231:312"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in malice, covetousnesse, and revenge? <hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis &amp; dici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli.</hi> But among our selves also, we serve the Devils ends, and minister to an eternal dis-union, by saying and doing things which look unhandsomely. One sort of men is superstitious, phantastical, greedy of honour, and tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of propositions to fill the purse, and his religion is thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but policy, and opinion. Another sayes he hath a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but he is the most indifferent and cold person in the world, either to maintain it, or to live according to it; the one dresses the images of Saints with fine clothes, the other lets the poor go <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> naked, and disrobes the priests that minister in the religion. A third uses God worse then all this, and sayes of him such things that are scandalous even to an honest man, and such which would undo a good mans reputation: And a fourth yet endures no governour but himself, and pretends to set up Christ and make himself his lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And a fifth hates all government, and from all this it comes to passe that it is hard for a man to choose his side, and he that chooses wisest takes that, which hath in it least hurt; but some he must endure, or live without communion: and every Church of one denomination is, or hath been too incurious of preventing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or disreputation to their confessions.</p>
                  <p>One thing I desire should be observed, that here the Question being concerning prudence, and the matter of doing reputation to our religion, it is not enough to say, we can with learning justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all that we do, and make all whole with 3. or 4. distinctions; for possibly the man that went to visit the <hi>Corinthian Lais,</hi> if he had been asked why he dishonoured himself with so unhandsome an entrance, might finde an excuse to legitimate his act, or at least to make himself beleeve well of his own person; but he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do himself honour, must take care that he be not suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he give no ocasion of reproachful language; for fame and honour is a nice thing, tender as a womans chastity, or like the face of the purest mirrour, which a foul breath, or an unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some air, or a watry eye can fully, and the beauty is lost although it be not dashed in pieces. When a man or a sect is put to answer for themselves in the matter of reputation, they with their distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions wipe the glasse, and at last can do nothing but make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear it was not broken; but their very abstersion and laborious excuses confesse it was foul and faulty: We must know that all sorts of men, and all sects of Christians, have not onely the mistakes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of men and their prejudices to contest withall, but the calumnies and aggravation of Devils: and therefore it will much ease our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of dooms-day, if we are now so prudent that men will not be offended here, nor the Devils furnished with a libell in the day of our great account.</p>
                  <p>To this rule appertains that we be curious in observing the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50231:313"/>
circumstances of men, and satisfie all their reasonable expectations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and do things at that rate of charity and religion which they are taught to be prescribed in the institution. There are some things which are <hi>undecencies</hi> rather then <hi>sins,</hi> such which may become a just Heathen, but not a holy Christian; a man of the world, but not a man <hi>professing godlinesse.</hi> Because when the greatnesse of the man, or the excellency of the Law, engage us upon great severity, or an exemplar vertue, whatsoever is lesse then it renders the man unworthy of the religion, or the religion unworthy of its fame: Men think themselves abused, and therefore return shame for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We never read of an Apostle that went to law; and it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but reasonable to expect that of all men in the world Christians should not be such fighting people, and Clergy men should not command Armies, and Kings should not be drunk, and subjects should not strike Princes for justice, and an old man should not be youthfull in talk, or in his habit; and women should not swear, and great men should not lie, and a poor man should not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse; for besides the sin of some of them, there is an undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in all of them; and by being contrary to the end of an office, or the reputation of a state, or the sobrieties of a graver or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> person, they asperse the religion as insufficient to keepe the persons within the bounds of fame and common reputation.</p>
                  <p>But above all things those sects of Christians whose professed doctrine brings destruction and diminution to government, give the most intolerable scandal, and dishonour to the institution; and it had been impossible that Christianity should have prevailed over the wisdom and power of the Greeks and Romans, if it had not been humble to superiours, patient of injuries, charitable to the needy, a great exactour of obedience to Kings, even <hi>to heathens,</hi> that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might be won, and convinced; and <hi>to persecutours</hi> that they might be sweetned in their anger, or upbraided for their cruel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: for so doth the humble vine creep at the foot of an oak, and leans upon its lowest base, and begs shade and protection, and leave to grow under its branches, and to give and take mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all refreshment, and pay a friendly influence for a mighty patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and they grow and dwell together, and are the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of friends and married pairs of all the leavie nation. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of it self is soft, easie and defenselesse, and God hath made it grow up with empire, and to leane upon the arms of Kings, and it cannot well grow alone; and if it shall like the <hi>Ivy</hi> suck <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the heart of the oak upon whose body it grew and was support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be pulled down from its usurped eminency, and fire and shame shall be its portion. We cannot complain if Princes arm against those Christians, who if they are suffered to preach will disarm the Princes; and it will be hard to perswade that Kings are bound to protect and nourish those that will prove mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50231:313"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of their own exauctoration: And no Prince can have justci reason to forbid, nor any man have greater reason to deny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to a family, then if they go about to destroy the power of the one, or corrupt the duty of the other. The particulars of this rule are very many; I shall onely instance in one more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of great concernment to the publike interest of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>There are some persons whose religion is hugely disgraced, because they change their propositions according as their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall necessities or advantages do return. They that in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and beginning cry out against all violence as against persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and from being suffered, swell up till they be prosperous, and from thence to power, and at last to Tyranny; and then suffer none but themselves, and trip up those feet, which they humbly kissed, that themselves should not be trampled upon; these men tell all the world that <hi>at first</hi> they were pusillanimous, or <hi>at last</hi> outragious; that their doctrine at first served their fear, and at last served their rage, and that they did not at all intend to serve God: and then who shall believe them in any thing else? Thus some men declaim against the faults of Governours, that themselves may governe; and when the power was in their hands, what was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a fault in others, is in them <hi>necessity;</hi> as if a sin could be hallowed for comming into their hands. Some Greeks at Florence subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Article of Purgatory, and condemned it in their own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses: And the Kings supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical, was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly defended against the pretences of the Bishop of Rome, and yet when he was thrust out, some men were, and are violent to submit the King to their Consistories, as if he were Supreme in defiance of the Pope, and yet not Supreme over his own Clergy. These Articles are mannaged too suspitiously.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50231:314"/>
should speak solaecismes, or a Musician sing like a bittern, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> becomes ridiculous for offending in the faculty he professes: So it is in them who minister to the conversion of souls: If they fail in their own life, when they professe to instruct another, they are defective in their proper part, and are unskilfull to all their purposes; and the Cardinal of Crema did with ill successe tempt the English priests to quit their chaste marriages, when himself was deprehended in unchaste embraces. For good counsel seems to be unhallowed, when it is reached forth by an impure hand, and he can ill be beleeved by another, whose life so confutes his rules, that it is plain he does not beleeve himself. Those Churches <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that are zealous for souls, must send into their ministeries men so innocent, that evil persons may have no excuse to be any longer vitious. When <hi>Gorgias</hi> went about to perswade the Greeks to be at peace, he had eloquence enough to do advantage to his cause, and reason enough to presse it: But <hi>Melanthius</hi> was glad to put him off, by telling him that he was not fit to perswade peace, who could not agree at home with his wife, nor make his wife agree with her maid; and he that could not make peace between three single persons, was unapt to prevail for the reuniting fourteen or fifteen Common-wealths: And this thing Saint Paul remarks by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> enjoyning that a Bishop should be chosen such a one as knew well to rule his own house, or else he is not fit to rule the Church of God. And when thou perswadest thy brother to be chaste, let not him deride thee for thy intemperance; and it will ill become thee to be severe against an idle servant, if thou thy self beest use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to the publike; and every notorious vice is infinitely against the spirit of government, and depresses the man to an evennesse with common persons,
<q>—Facinus quos inquinat, aequat,</q>
to reprove, belongs to a Superiour; and as innocence gives a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> advantage over his brother, giving him an artificiall and adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious authority; so the follies and scandals of a publike and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning man destroyes the efficacy of that authority that is just and naturall. Now this is directly an office of Christian prudence, that good offices and great authority, become not ineffective by ill conduct.</p>
                  <p>Hither also it appertains that in publike or private reproofs, we observe circumstances of <hi>time,</hi> of <hi>place,</hi> of <hi>person,</hi> of <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The vices of a King are not to be opened publikely; and Princes must not be reprehended as a man reproves his servant; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by Categoricall propositions, by abstracted declamations, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of a crime in its single nature, in private, with humility, and arts of insinuation: And it is against Christian prudence not onely to use a Prince or great Personage with common language, but it is as great an imprudence to pretend for such a rudenesse, the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50231:314"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> examples of the Prophets in the old Testament. For their case was extraordinary, their calling peculiar, their commission special, their spirit miraculous, their authority great, as to that single mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they were like thunder or the trump of God, sent to do that office plainly, for the doing of which in that manner, God had given no commission to any ordinary minister: And therefore we never finde that the Priests did use that freedom, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were commanded to use, whose very words being put into their mouthes, it was not to be esteemed an humane act, or a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner of doing an ordinary office; neither could it become a precedent to them whose authority is precarious and without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> coërcion whose spirit is allayed with Christian graces and duties of humility, whose words are not prescribed, but left to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of prudence, as it is to be advised by publike necessities, and private circumstances, in ages where all things are so ordered, that what was fit and pious amongst the old Jews, would be incivil and intolerable to the latter Christians. He also that reproves a vice should also treat the persons with honour, and civilities, and by fair opinions, and sweet addresses place the man in the regions of modesty, and the confines of grace, and the fringes of repentance. For some men are more restrained by an imperfect, feared shame, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so long as they think there is a reserve of reputation which they may secure, then they can be with all the furious declamations of the world, when themselves are represented ugly and odious, full of shame, and actually punished with the worst of temporal evils, beyond which he fears not here to suffer, and from whence because he knows it will be hard for him to be redeemed by an after-game of reputation, it makes him desperate and incorrigible by frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall correption.</p>
                  <p>A zealous man hath not done his duty, when he calls his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drunkard and beast, and he may better do it, by telling him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he is a man, and sealed with Gods Spirit, and honoured with the title of a Christian, and is, or ought to be reputed as a discreet person by his friends; and a governour of a family, or a guide in his countrey, or an example to many, and that it is huge pity so many excellent things should be sullied, and allayed with what is so much below all this: Then a reprover does his duty, when he is severe against the vice, and charitable to the man, and carefull of his reputation, and sorry for his reall dishonour, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his circumstances, and watchfull to surprize his affections <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and resolutions, there where they are most tender, and most tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and men will not be in love with vertue whither they are forced with rudenesse and incivilities; but they love to dwell there whither they are invited friendly, and where they are treated ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, and feasted liberally, and lead by the hand and the eye to honour and felicity.</p>

6. It is a duty of Christian prudence not to suffer our souls to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> walk alone, unguarded, unguided, and more single then in other actions and interests of our lives, which are of lesse concernment. <hi>Uae soli &amp; singulari,</hi> said the Wise man, <hi>Wo to him that is alone:</hi> and if we consider how much God hath done to secure our souls, and after all that, how many wayes there are for a mans soul to miscarry, we should think it very necessary to call to a spirituall man to take us by the hand, to walk in the wayes of God, and to lead us in all the regions of duty, and thorow the labyrinths of danger. For God who best loves, and best knows how to value our souls, set a price no lesse upon it then the life-blood of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Holy Son; he hath treated it with variety of usages according as the world had new guises, and new necessities; he abates it with punishment to make us avoid greater; he shortned our life that we might live for ever; he turns sicknesse into vertue; he brings good out of evil; he turns enmities to advantages, our very sins into repentances, and stricter walking; he defeats all the follies of men, and all the arts of the Devil and layes snares, and uses violence to secure our obedience, he sends Prophets and Priests to invite us, and to threaten us to felicities; he restrains us with lawes, and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> bridles us with honour and shame, reputation, and society, friends, and foes; he layes hold on us by the instruments of all the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he is enough to fill our love, he satisfies our hope, he affrights us with fear, he gives us part of our reward in hand, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all our faculties with the promises of an infinite and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous portion; he curbs our affections; he directs our wills, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs our understandings with Scriptures, with perpetuall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with good books, with frequent discourses, with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar observations, and great experience, with accidents and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with rare events of providence, and miracles; he sends his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Angels to be our guard, and to place us in opportunities of vertue, and to take us off from ill company and places of danger, to set us neer to good example; he gives us his holy Spirit, and he becomes to us a principle of a mighty grace, descending upon us in great variety, and undiscerned events, besides all those parts of it which men have reduced to a method and an art; and after all this he forgives us infinite irregularities, and spares us every day, and still expects, and passes by, and waits all our dayes, still watching to do us good, and to save that soul which he knowes is so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, one of the chiefest of the works of God, and an image of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Now from all these arts and mercies of God, besides that we have infinite reason to adore his goodnesse, we have also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that we ought to do all that possibly we can, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all our faculties, and watch all our opportunities, and take in all assistances to secure the interest of our soul, for which God is pleased to take such care, and use so many arts for its security. If
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50231:315"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it were not highly worth it, God would not do it. If it were not all of it necessary, God would not do it. But if it be worth it, and all of it be necessary, why should we not labour in order to this great end? If it be worth so much to God it is so much more to us: for if we perish, his felicity is undisturbed, but we are undone, infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. It is therefore worth taking in a spirituall guide, so far we are gone.</p>
                  <p>But because we are in the question of prudence, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether it be necessary to do so: For every man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wise enough as to the conduct of his soul, and managing of his eternal interest; and divinity is every mans trade, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Scriptures speak our own language, and the commandments are few and plain, and the laws are the measure of justice, and if I say my prayers, and pay my debts, my duty is soon summed up, and thus we usually make our accounts for eternity, and at this rate onely take care for heaven; but let a man be questioned for a portion of his estate or have his life shaken with diseases, then it will not be enough to employ one agent, or to send for a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to minister a potion of the juices of her country garden, but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ablest Lawyers and the skilfullest Physitians &amp; the advice of friends and huge caution, and diligent attendances and a curious watching concerning all the accidents and little passages of our disease, and truly a mans life, and health is worth all that, and much more, and in many cases it needs it all.</p>
                  <p>But then is the soul the onely safe and the onely trifling thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us? Are not there a thousand dangers, and ten thousand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and innumerable possibilities of a misadventure? Are not all the congregations in the world divided in their doctrines, and all of them call their own way necessary and most of them call all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rest damnable? we had need of a wise instructor and a prudent choice at our first entrance, and election of our side: and when we are well in the matter of Faith for its object, and jnstitution; all the evils of my self and all the evils of the Church and all the good that happens to evil men, every day of danger, the periods of sicknesse and the day of death are dayes of tempest and storm, and our faith wil suffer shipwrack unlesse it be strong and supported and directed. But who shall guide the vessel when a stormy passion or a violent imagination transports the man? who shall awaken his reason and charm his passion into slumber &amp; instruction? How shal a man make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his fears confident, and allay his confidence with fear, and make the allay with just proportions, and steere evenly, between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, or call upon his sleeping purposes or actuate his choices, or binde him to reason in all the wandrings and ignorances, in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and mistakes? For suppose the man of great skil and great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wayes of religion, yet if he be abused by accident, or by his own will, who shall then judge his cases of conscience, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50231:316"/>
his duty and renew his holy principle, and actuate his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> powers? For Physitians that prescribe to others, do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to themselves in cases of danger, and violent sicknesses; and in matter of distemperature we shall not finde that books alone will do all the work of a spiritual Physitian more then of a natural, I will not go about to increase the dangers and difficulties of the soul, to represent the assistance of a spiritual man to be necessary. But of this I am sure; our not understanding, and our not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our soul make us first to neglect, and then many times to lose it. But is not every man an unequal judge in his own case? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wisdom of God and the laws hath appointed tribunals and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Judges and arbitrators and that men are partial in the matter of souls, it is infinitely certain, because amongst those milions of souls that perish, not one in ten thousand but believes himself in a good condition; and all sects of Christians think they are in the right, and few are patient to enquire whether they be or no: then adde to this, that the Questions of souls, being clothed with circumstances of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and particular contingency, are or may be infinite, and most men are so infortunate, that they have so intangled their cases of conscience, that there where they have done something good, it may be, they have mingled half a dozen evils; and when interests <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are confounded and governments altered, and power strives with right, and insensibly passes into right, and duty to God would fain be reconciled with duty to our relatives, will it not be more then necessary that we should have some one that we may enquire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the way to heaven, which is now made intricate by our follies and inevitable accidents? But by what instrument shall men alone and in their own cases be able to discern the spirit of truth from the spirit of illusion, just confidence from presumption, fear from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimity; are not all the things and assistances in the world little enough to defend us against <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> the two great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of temptation? is it not harder to cure a lust then to cure a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? and are not the deceptions and follies of men, and the arts of the Devil and inticements of the world &amp; the deceptions of a mans own heart, and the evils of sin more evil and more numerous then the sicknesses and diseases of any one man? and if a man perishes in his soul, is it not infinitely more sad then if he could rise from his grave and die a thousand deaths over? Thus we are advanced a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond step in this prudential motive; God used many arts to secure our souls interest; and there is infinite dangers, and infinite wayes of miscarriage in the souls interest; and therefore there is great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God should do all those mercies of security, and that we should do all the under-ministeries we can in this great work.</p>
                  <p>But what advantage shall we receive by a spiritual Guide? much every way. For this is the way that God hath appointed who in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age hath sent a succession of spiritual persons, whose office is

                  <p n="7">7. AS it is a part of Christian prudence to take into the conduct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of our soules a spiritual man for a guide, so it is also of great concernment that we be prudent in the choice of him whom we are to trust in so great an interest.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which it will be impossible to give characters and significations particular enough to enable a choice without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval assistances of prayer, experience and the Grace of God; He that describes a man can tell you the colour of his hair, his stature and proportions, and describe some general lines, enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingush him from a Cyclops or a Saracen, but when you chance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to see the man you will discover figures or little features of which the description had produced in you no Phantasme, or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in the exteriour significations of a sect there are more semblances then in mens faces and greater uncertainty in the signes: &amp; what is faulty strives so craftily to act the true and proper images of things, and the more they are defective in circumstances, the more curious they are in forms; and they also use such arts of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proselytes which are of most advantage towards an effect, and therefore such which the true Christian ought to pursue, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles actually did, and they strive to follow their patterns in arts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> perswasion, not onely because they would seem like them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can have none so good, so effective to their purposes; that it follows that it is not more a duty to take care, that we be not corrupted with false teachers, then that we be not abused with false signes; for we as well finde a good man teaching a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50231:317"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as a good cause managed by ill men, and a holy cause is not alwayes dressed with healthful symptomes; nor is there a crosse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes set upon the doores of those congregations, who are infected with the plague of heresy.</p>
                  <p>When Saint John was to separate false teachers from true, he took no other course but to remark the doctrine which was of God, and that should be the mark of cognisance to distinguish right shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards from robbers and invaders: <hi>every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: He that denieth it is not of God.</hi> By this he bids his schollers to avoid the present sects of Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Cerinthus, Simon Magus and such other persons that denied that Christ was at all before he came, or that he came really in the flesh and a proper humanity. This is a clear note and they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with Saint John or believed his doctrine were sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the present Questions. But this note will signify nothing to us; for all sects of Christians <hi>confesse Jesus Christ come in the flesh,</hi> and the following sects did avoid that rock over which a great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had hung out so plain a lantern.</p>
                  <p>In the following ages of the Church men have been so curious to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> signifie misbelievers, that they have invented and observed some signes, which indeed in some cases were true, real appendages of false believers; but yet such which were also, or might be common to them with good men, and members of the Catholick Church; some few I shall remark and give a short account of them that by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the uncertain, we may fix our inquiries and direct them by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain significations; lest this art of prudence turn into folly and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, errour and secular designe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some men distinguish errour from truth by calling their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries doctrine, <hi>new, and of yesterday;</hi> and certainly this is a good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> signe if it be rightly applyed; for since all Christian doctrine is that which Christ taught his Church, and the spirit enlarged, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the Apostles delivered, we are to begin the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>aera</hi> for our faith and parts of religion by the period of their preaching: our account begins then, and whatsoever is contrary to what they taught is new and false, and whatsoever is besides, what they taught, is no part of our religion (and then no man can be prejudiced for believing it or not) and if it be adopted into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of the Church, the proposition is alwayes so uncertain, that its not to be admitted into the faith; and therefore if it be old in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> respect of our dayes, it is not therefore necessary to be believed: if it be new it may be received into opinion according to its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and no sects or interest are to be divided upon such accounts. This onely I desire to be observed, that when a truth returns from banishment by a <hi>postliminium,</hi> if it was from the first, though the Holy fire hath been buried, or the river ran under ground, yet that we do not call that new; since newnesse is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50231:318"/>
of by a proportion to our short lived memories, or to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> broken records and fragments of story lest after the inundation of barbarisme and war, and change of Kingdoms and corruption of Authors; but by its relation to the fountain of our truths and the birth of our religion under our Fathers in Christ, the holy Apostles, and Disciples: a Camel was a new thing to them that saw it in the fable; But yet it was created as soon as a cow or the domestick creatures, and some people are apt to call every thing new, which they never heard of before, as if all religion were to be measured by the standards of their observation, or country customs. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was not taught by Christ, or his Apostles though it came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in by Papias, or Dionysius, by Arius or Liberius, is certainly new as to our account; and whatsoever is taught to us by the Doctors of the present age if it can shew its test from the beginning of our period for revelaltion, is not to be called <hi>new</hi> though it be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a new zeal and discoursed of by unheard of arguments; that is though men be ignorant and need to learn it, yet it is not therefore new or unnecessary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some would have false teachers sufficiently signified by a name or the owning of a private Appellative as of <hi>Papist, Lutheran, Calvenists Zuinglian, Socinian;</hi> &amp; think it is enough to denominat them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not, of Christ if they are called by the name of a man. And indeed the thing is in it self ill: but then if by this mark we shall esteem false teachers sufficiently signified we must follow no man, no Church, nor no communion: for all are by their adversaries marked with an appellative of separation and singularity, and yet themselves are tenacious of a good name, such as they choose or such as is permitted to them by fame, and the people, and a natural neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of making a distinction. Thus the Donatist called themselves <hi>the flock of God,</hi> and the Novatians called the <hi>Catholicks traditors,</hi> and the <hi>Eustathians</hi> called themselves <hi>Catholikes</hi> and <hi>the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>of images</hi> made <hi>Iconoclast</hi> to be a name of scorn, and men made names as they listed, or as the fate of the market went. And if a Doctor preaches a doctrine which another man likes not, but prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the contradictory, he that consents and he that refuses have each of them a teacher by whose name, if they please to wrangle, they may be signified. It was so in the Corinthian Church with this onely difference that they divided themselves by names which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the same religion. <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo and I am of Peter, and I of Christ;</hi> these Apostles were ministers of Christ; and so does every teacher new or old among the Christians pretend himself to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be; Let that therefore be examined; if he ministers to the truth of Christ and the religion of his master, let him be entertained as a servant of his Lord; but if an appellative be taken from his name, there is a faction commenced in it; and there is a fault in the men if there be none in the doctrine; but that the doctrine be true or
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50231:318"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> false, to be received, or to be rejected because of the name is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and extrinsecall; and therefore not to be determined by this signe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Amongst some men a sect is sufficiently thought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, if it subdivides and breaks into little fractions, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges its own opinions: indeed if it declines its own doctrine, no man hath reason to beleeve them upon their word, or to take them upon the stock of reputation, which (themselves being judges) they have forfeited and renounced in the changing that which at first they obtruded passionately. And therefore in this case there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is nothing to be done, but to beleeve the men so farre as they have reason to beleeve themselves: that is, to consider when they prove what they say: and they that are able to do so, are not persons in danger to be seduced by a bare authority, unlesse they list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for others that sink under an unavoidable prejudice, God will take care for them if they be good people; and their case shall be considered by and by. But for the other part of the signe; when men fall out among themselves for other interests or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is no argument, that they are in an errour concerning that doctrine, which they all unitedly teach or condemn respectively; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but it hath in it some probability that their union is a testimony of truth, as certainly as that their fractions are a testimony of their zeal, or honesty, or weaknesse (as it happens): and if we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be too decretory in this instance, it will be hard for any of us to keep a Jew from making use of it against the whole religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which from the dayes of the Apostles hath been rent into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable sects, and under-sects, springing from mistake or interest, from the arts of the Devil, or the weaknesse of man. But from hence we may make an advantage in the way of prudence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sure that all <hi>that doctrine is certainly true,</hi> in which the ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerality <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Christians (who are divided in many things, yet) do constantly agree: and that <hi>that doctrine is also sufficient</hi> since it is certain that because in all Communions and Churches there are some very good men, that do all their duty to the getting of truth, God will not fail in any thing that is necessary to them that honestly and heartily desire to obtain it: and therefore if they rest in the heartinesse of that, and live accordingly, and superinduce nothing to the destruction of that, they have nothing to do but to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods goodnesse: and if they perish, it is certain they cannot help it, and that is demonstration enough that they cannot perish, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> considering the justice and goodnesse of our Lord and Judge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whoever break the bands of a Society, or Communion, and go out from that Congregation in whose Confession they are baptized, do an intolerable scandal to their doctrine and persons, and give suspicious men reason to decline their Assemblies, and not to choose them at all for any thing of their authority, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50231:319"/>
circumstances: and Saint Paul bids the Romans to <hi>mark</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>them that cause divisions and offences.</hi> But the following words make their caution prudent and practicable, <hi>[contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ye have learned and avoid them]</hi> they that recede from the doctrine which they have learned, they cause the offence, and if they also obtrude this upon their congregations, they also make the division. For it is certain, if we receive any doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what Christ gave, and the Apostles taught, for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any man, then we call <hi>men Masters,</hi> and leave <hi>our Master which is in heaven;</hi> and in that case we must separate from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and adhere to Christ; but this is not to be done, unlesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the case be evident and notorious. But as it is hard, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine of a Church should be rifled, and misunderstood, and reproved, and rejected, by any of her wilful or ignorant sons and daughters: so it is also as hard that they should be bound, not to see when the case is plain and evident. There may be mischiefs on both sides; but the former sort of evils men may avoid if they will; for they may be humble and modest, and entertain better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Superiours then of themselves, and in doubtful things give them the honour of a just opinion: and if they do not do so, that evil will be their own private: for that it become not publike, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the King and the Bishop are to take care: but for the latter sort of evil it will certainly become universal; If (I say) an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive false doctrine be imposed, and is to be accepted accordingly; for then all men shall be bound to professe against their conscience, that is, <hi>with their mouthes not to confesse unto salvation,</hi> what <hi>with their hearts they believe unto righteousnesse.</hi> The best way of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying both the evils is, that Governours lay no burden of doctrines or lawes but what are necessary, or very profitable: and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours do not contend for things unnecessary, nor call any thing necessary that is not: till then there will be evils on both sides; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> although the Governours are to carry the Question in the point of law, reputation, and publike government, yet as to Gods Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they will bear the bigger load, who in his right do him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and by the impresses of <hi>his authority</hi> destroy <hi>his truth.</hi> But in this case also, although separating be a suspicious thing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, unlesse it be when a sin is imposed, yet to separate is also accidentall to truth: for some men separate with reason, some men against reason; therefore here all the certainty that is <hi>in the thing,</hi> is <hi>when the truth is secured,</hi> and all the security <hi>to the men</hi> will be in <hi>the humility of their persons,</hi> and the heartinesse and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of their intention, and diligence of inquiry. The Church of England had reason to separate from the Confession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of Rome in many particulars, and yet if her children sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from her they may be unreasonable and impious.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The wayes of direction which we have from holy Scripture
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50231:319"/> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to distinguish false Apostles from true, are taken from their doctrine or their lives. That of the doctrine is the most sure way if we can hit upon it; but that also is the thing signified, and needs to have other signes. Saint John and Saint Paul took this way, for they were able to do it infallibly. <hi>All that confesse Jesus incarnate are of God</hi> said Saint John; those men that deny it are hereticks; avoid them: and Saint Paul bids to <hi>observe them that cause divisions and offences against the doctrine delivered.</hi> Them also avoid, that do so. And we might do so as easily as they, if the world would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take their <hi>depositum,</hi> that doctrine which they delivered to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> men, that is, <hi>the Creed,</hi> and superinduce nothing else, but suffer Christian faith to rest in its own perfect simplicity, unmingled with arts, and opinions, and interests. This course is plain and easie, and I will not intricate it with more words, but leave it directly in its own truth and certainty, with this onely direction. That when we are to choose our doctrine, or our side, we take that which is in the plain unexpounded words of Scripture; for in that onely our religion can consist. Secondly choose that which is most advantageous to a holy life, to the proper graces of a Christian, to humility, to charity, to forgivenesse and alms, to obedience, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> complying with governments, to the honour of God and the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his attributes, and to the conservation and advantages of the publike societies of men; and this last, Saint Paul directs, <hi>Let ours be carefull to maintain goodworks for necessary uses,</hi> for he that heartily pursues these proportions cannot be an ill man, though he were accidentally and in the particular applications decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But because this is an act of <hi>wisdom,</hi> rather then <hi>prudence,</hi> and supposes <hi>science</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> rather then <hi>experience,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns the prudence of a Christian to observe the practise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the rules of practise, their lives, and pretences, the designes, and colours, the arts of conduct, and gaining proselytes, which their Doctors and Catechists do use in order to their purposes, and in their ministery about souls. For although many signes are uncertain, yet some are infallible and some are highly probable.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Therefore those teachers that pretend to be guided by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate spirit are certainly false Doctors. I remember what <hi>Simmias</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> that if he heard any man say he saw a divine vision, he presently esteemed him vain and proud; but if he pretended onely to have heard a voice or the word of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God, he listened to that religiously, and would enquire of him with curiosity. There was some reason in his fancy; for God does not communicate himself by the eye to men but by the ear: <hi>ye saw no figure, but ye heard a voice,</hi> said Moses to the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God: and therefore if any man pretends to speak the word of God, we will enquire concerning it; the man may the better
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50231:320"/>
be heard, because he may be certainly reproved if he speaks amisse: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but if he pretends to <hi>visions</hi> and <hi>revelations,</hi> to a private spirit and a <hi>mission extraordinary,</hi> the man is proud and unlearned, vicious and impudent. <hi>No Scripture is of private interpretation</hi> (saith S. Peter) that is, <hi>of private emission or declaration.</hi> Gods words were delivered indeed by single men, but such as were publikely designed Prophets, remarked with a known character, approved of by the high Priest, and Sanhedrim, indued with a publike spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and his doctrines were alwayes agreeable to the other Scriptures. But if any man pretends now to the spirit, either it must be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or publike; if it be private, it can but be usefull to himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> alone, and it may cozen him too, if it be not assisted by the spirit of a publike man. But if it be a publike spirit, it must enter in at the publike door of ministeries, and divine ordinances, of Gods grace, and mans endeavour, it must be subject to the Prophets, it is discernable and judicable by them, and therefore may be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and then it must pretend no longer. For he that will pretend to an extraordinary spirit, and refuses to be tried by the ordinary wayes, must either prophecy, or work miracles, or must have a voice from heaven to give him testimony. The Prophets in the old Testament, and the Apostles in the New, and Christ between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> both had no other way of extraordinary probation: and they that pretend to any thing extraordinary, cannot, ought not to be beleeved, unlesse they have something more then their own word. <hi>If I bear witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true,</hi> said Truth it self, our Blessed Lord. But secondly, they that intend to teach by an extraordinary spirit, if they pretend to teach accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture must be examined by the measures of Scripture, and then their extraordinary must be judged by the ordinary spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and stands or falls by the rules of every good mans religion, and publike government; and then we are well enough.

                  <p>But this pretence of a single and extraordinary spirit is nothing else but the spirit of pride, errour, and delusion, a snare to catch easie and credulous souls, which are willing to die for a gay word and a distorted face; it is the parent of folly, and giddy doctrine, impossible to be proved, and therefore uselesse to all purposes of religion, reason, or sober counsels; it is like an invisible colour, or musick without a sound, it is, and indeed is so intended to be, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> direct overthrow of order, and government, and publike ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; It is bold to say any thing, and resolved to prove nothing; it imposes upon willing people after the same manner that Oracles and the lying Daemons did of old time, abusing men not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per efficacy of its own, but because the men love to be abused;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50231:320"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is a great disparagement to the sufficiency of Scripture, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perses the Divine providence for giving to so many ages of the Church an imperfect religion, expressely against the truth of their words who said, they <hi>had declared the whole truth of God,</hi> and <hi>told all the will of God:</hi> and it is an affront to the Spirit of God, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wisdom, and knowledge, of order and publike ministeries. But the will furnishes out malice, and the understanding sends out levity, and they marry, and produce a phantastick dream, and the daughter sucking winde instead of the milk of the word, growes up to madnesse and the spirit of reprobation. Besides all this, an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> spirit is extremely unnecessary, and God does not give immissions and miracles from heaven to no purpose, and to no necessities of his Church; for the supplying of which he hath given <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Pastors, Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> the <hi>spirit of Ordination,</hi> and <hi>the spirit of instruction, Catechists,</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences, Scriptures</hi> and <hi>a constant succession of Expositors,</hi> the testimony of Churches, and a constant line of <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> or delivery of Apostolical Doctrine in all things necessary to salvation. And after all this, to have a <hi>fungus</hi> arise from the belly of mud and darknesse, and nourish a gloworm, that shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> challenge to out-shine the lantern of Gods word, and all the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles which God set upon a hill, and all that the Spirit hath set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the candlesticks; and all <hi>the starres in Christs right hand,</hi> is to annull all the excellent, established, orderly, and certain effects of the Spirit of God, and to worship the false fires of the night.

                  <p>Concerning the pretence of a private spirit, for interpretation of the confessed doctrine of God (the holy Scriptures) it will not so easily come into this Question of choosing our spirituall Guides; Because every person that can be Candidate in this office, that can be chosen to guide others, must be a publike man, that is, of a holy calling, sanctified or separate publikely to the office; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then to interpret is part of his calling, and imployment, and to do so is the work of a publike spirit; he is ordained and designed, he is commanded and inabled to do it: and in this there is no other caution to be interposed, but that the more publike the man is, of the more authority his interpretation is; and he comes neerest to a law of order, and in the matter of government is to be observed:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50231:321"/>
but the more holy and the more learnd the man is, his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in matter of Question is more likely to be true: and though lesse to be pressed as to the publick confession yet it may be more effective to a private perswasion, provided it be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scandal, or lessening the authority, or disparagement to the more publick person.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Those are to be suspected for evil guides, who to get authority among the people pretend a great zeal, and use a bold liberty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Princes and Governours, nobility and Prelates; for such homilies cannot be the effects of a holy religion, which lay a snare for authority, and undermine power, and discontent the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and make them bold against Kings, and immodest in their own stations, and trouble the government. Such men may speak a truth or teach a true doctrine; for every such designe does not unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the truth of God; but they take some truthes and force them to minister to an evil end; but therefore, mingle not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of such men, for they will make it a part of your religion to prosecute that end openly which they by arts of the <hi>Tempter</hi> have insinuated privately.</p>
                  <p>But if ever you enter into the seats of those Doctors that speak reproachfully of their Superiours, or detract from government, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or love to curse the King in their heart, or slander him with their mouths, or disgrace their persons, blesse your self and retire quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for there dwells the plague, but the spirit of God is not presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the assembly; and therefore you shall observe in all the characters which the B.

                     <note place="margin">vers. 8. ep. Jude.</note> 
                     <hi>likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion and speak evil of dignities.</hi> These three testimonies are but the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one great contingency; they are the same prophesy decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by three Apostolical men, that had the gift of prophecy: and by this character the Holy Ghost in all ages hath given us caution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to avoid such assemblies, where the speaking and ruling man shall be the canker of government, and a preacher of sedition, who shall either ungirt the Princes sword, or unloose the button of their mantle.</p>

Such as those; that [God sees no sin in his children: that no sin will take us from Gods favour; that all of such a party are elect people: that God requires of us nothing but faith: and that faith which justifies is nothing but a meere believing, that we are Gods chosen: that we are not tied to the law of commandments: that the law of grace is a law of liberty: and that liberty is to do what we list; that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces are to be granted upon many and slight causes: that simple fornication is no sin: these are such doctrines, that upon the belief of them men may doe any thing, and will do that which shall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their own desires and promote their interests and seduce their shee disciples: and indeed it was not without great reason that these three Apostles joyned <hi>lust and treason</hi> together; because the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is so shameful a crime and renders a mans spirit naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to government that if it falls upon the person of a Ruler, it takes from him the spirit of government, and renders him <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, pusillanimous, private,</hi> and <hi>ashamed;</hi> if it happen in the person of a subject, it makes him hate the man that shall shame him and punish him: it hates the light and the Sun, because that opens him, and therefore is much more against government because that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> publishes and punishes too. One thing I desire to be observed, that though the primitive heresies now named and all those others their successors practised and taught horrid impurities, yet they did not invade government at all, and therefore those sects that these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did signifie by prophecy, and in whom both these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred, were to appear in some latter times; and the dayes of the prophecy were not then to be fulfill'd; what they are since, every age must judge, by its own experience, &amp; for its own interest.

                  <p n="10">10.

God will not suffer a good man to be seduced damnably, much lesse can he be a seducer of others: and therefore you shall still observe the false Apostles to be furious and vehement in their reproofs and severe in their animadversions of others; but then if you watch their private, or stay till their numbers are full, or observe their spiritual habits, you shall finde them indulgent to themselves, or to return from their disguises, or so spiritually wicked, that their <hi>pride,</hi> or their <hi>revenge,</hi> their <hi>envie</hi> or their <hi>detraction,</hi> their <hi>scorn</hi> or their <hi>complacency</hi> in themselves, their <hi>desire of preheminence</hi> and <hi>their impatience</hi> of arrival, shall place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them far enough in distance from a poor <hi>carnal sinner,</hi> whom they shall load with censures and an upbraiding scorn; but themselves are like Devils, the spirits of darknesse <hi>the spiritual wickednesses in high places.</hi> Some sects of men are very angry against servants for recreating and easing their labours with a lesse prudent and an unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere refreshment; but the patron of their sect shall oppresse a wicked man and an unbelieving person; they shall chastise a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard and entertain murmurrers; they shall not abide an oath and yet shal force men to break three or four.

                  <p n="1">1. We cannot expect that by these or any other signes we shall be inabled to discover concerning <hi>all men</hi> whether they teach an errour or no. Neither can a man by these reprove a Lutheran, or a Zuinglian, a Dominican or a Franciscan, a Russian or a Greek, a Muscovite or a Georgian, because those which are certain signes of false teachers, do signifie such men, who destroy an article of faith or a commandment; God was careful to secure us from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> death by removing the Lepers from the camp, and giving certain notices of distinction, and putting a term between the living and the dead: but he was not pleased to secure every man from innocent and harmlesse errors, from the mistakes of men, and the failings of mortality. The signes which can distinguish a living man from a dead, will not also distinguish a black man from a brown, or a pale from a white: It is enough that we decline those guides that lead us to hell, but not to think that we are inticed to death by the weaknesses of every disagreeing brother.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In all discerning of sects, we must be careful to distinguish the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> faults of men from the evils of their doctrine; for some there are that say very well, and do very ill, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. Let us make one separation more &amp; then we may consider and act according to the premises: If we espie a designe or an evil mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one doctrine let us divide it from the other that are not so spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for indeed the publick communions of men are at this day so ordered, that they are as fond of their errours as of their truthes, and somtimes moct zealous for what they have least reason to be so: and if we can by any arts of prudence separate from an evil proposition and communicate in all the good, then we may love colleges of religious persons, though we do not worship images, and we may obey our Prelates, though we do no injury to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and we may be zealous against a crime, though we be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious over mens persons, and we may be diligent in the conduct of souls though we be not rapacious of estates, and we may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exactors of Obedience to human laws though we do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the breach of the divine; and the Clergy may represent their calling necessary though their persons be full of modesty and humility, and we may preserve our rights and not lose our charity. For this is the meaning of the Apostle, <hi>Try all things and retain that which is good:</hi> from every sect and communitie of Christians take any thing that is good, that advances holy religion, and the Divine honour; For one hath a better government, a second a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, a third hath excellent spiritual arts for the conduct of souls, a fourth hath fewer errours, and by what instrument soever a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life is advantaged use that though thou grindest thy spears and arrows at the forges of the Philistines; knowing thou hast no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster but Christ, no religion but the Christian, no rule but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the laws and right reason, other things that are helps, are to be used accordingly.</p>
                  <p>These are the general rules of Christian prudence which I have chosen to insist upon; there are many others more particular indeed, but yet worth not onely the enumerating, but observing also, and that they be reduced to practise.

                  <p>We do not live in an age in which there is so much need to bid men be wary, as to take care that they be innocent: Indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion we are usually too loose, and ungirt, exposing our selves to temptation, and others to offence, and our name to dishonour, and the cause it self to reproach, and we are open and ready to every evil but persecution: from that we are close enough, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> alone we call prudence; but in the matter of interest we are wary as serpents, subtil as foxes, vigilant as the birds of the night, rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as Kites, tenacious as grapling hooks and the weightiest anchors, and above all, false and hypocritical as a thin crust of ice, spread upon the face of a deep, smooth, and dissembling pit; if you set your foot, your foot slips, or the ice breaks, and you sink into death, and are wound in a sheet of water, descending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mischief or your grave; suffering a great fall, or a sudden death by your confidence and unsuspecting foot.

Their religion consists in forms and outsides, and serves reputation or a designe, but does not serve God: Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are but fair language, and the civilities of the Piazzas or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, and disband and unty like the air that beat upon their teeth, when they spake the delicious and hopefull words.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> oaths are snares to catch men, and make them confident: Their contracts are arts and stratagems to deceive, measured by profit and possibility; and every thing is lawfull that is gainfull; and their friendships are trades of getting; and their kindnesse of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dying friend, is but the office of a vulture, the gaping for a legacy, the spoil of the carcasse; and their sicknesses are many times policies of state, sometimes a designe to shew the riches of our bed-chamber; and their funeral tears are but the paranymphs and pious solicitors of a second Bride; and every thing that is ugly must be hid, and every thing that is handsome must be seen, and that will make a fair cover for a huge deformity; and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it is (as they think) necessary that men should alwayes have some pretences and forms, some faces of religion, or sweetnesse of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, confident affirmatives, or bold oaths, protracted treaties, or multitude of words, affected silence, or grave deportment, a good name, or a good cause, a fair relation, or a worthy calling, great power, or a pleasant wit; any thing that can be fair, or that can be usefull, any thing that can do good, or be thought good, we use it to abuse our brother, or promote our interests. <hi>Leporina</hi> resolved to die, being troubled for her husbands danger, and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> resolved to die with her that had so great a kindnesse for him as not to out-live the best of her husbands fortune.

                  <p>One thing more there is to be added as an instance to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of religion, and that is that we never deny our religion, or lie concerning our faith, nor tell our propositions, and articles deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, nor instruct Novices or catechumens with fraud, but that when we teach them, we do it honestly, justly, and severely, not alwayes to speak all, but never to speak otherwise then it is, nor to hide a truth from them, whose soules are concerned in it, that it be known, <hi>nequè enim id est celare cum quid reticias, sed cum quod tuscias, id igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare emolumenti tui causâ velis eos, quorum inter est id scire:</hi> So Cicero <note place="margin">So Cicero. lib. 3. offic.</note> determins the case of prudence and simplicity. The discovery of pious frauds, and the disclaiming of false but profitable and rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the quitting honours, fraudulently gotten, and unjustly detained; the reducing every man to the perfect understanding of his own religion so far as can concern his duty, the disallowing false miracles, legends and fabulous stories, of cosening the people into awfulnesse, fear and superstition, these are parts of Christian simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which do integrate this duty: for religion hath strengths enough of its own to support it self; it needs not a devil for its advocate;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50231:328"/>
it is the breath of God, and as it is purer then the beams of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> morning, so it is stronger then a tempest, or the combination of all the windes though united by the prince that ruleth in the aire: And we finde that the Nicene faith prevailed upon all the world though some Arian Bishops went from Ariminum to Nice, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed their own articles, and called it, <hi>the faith read at Nice,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all arts and all violence, and all lying, and all diligence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance it, yet it could not be, it was the truth of God and therefore it was stronger then all the gates of hell, then all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darknesse: and he that tells a lie for his religion or goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by fraud and imposture to gain proselytes, either dares not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> trust his cause or dare not trust God. True religion is open in its articles, honest in its prosecutions, just in its conduct, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent when it is accused, ignorant of falsehood, sure in its truth, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in its sayings: and (as Julius Capitolinus said of the <hi>Emperour Verus)</hi> it is <hi>morum simplicium &amp; quae adumbrare nihil possit: it covers</hi> indeed <hi>a multitude of sins</hi> by curing them, and obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them, but it can dissemble nothing of it self, it cannot tell or do a lie: but it can become a sacrifice; a good man can quit his life but never his integrity.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the honesty of a mans faith and religion is destroyed <hi>cum aliud si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatum aliud actum sit,</hi> when either we conceale what we ought to publish, or do not act what we pretend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christian simplicity or the innocence of prudence relates to laws both in their sanction and execution; that they be decreed with equity and proportioned to the capacity and profit of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and that they be applied to practise with remissions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable interpretations agreeable to the sence of the words and the minde of the lawgiver; but laws are not to be cosened and abused by contradictory glosses, and phantastick elusions as knowing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if the majesty and sacrednesse of them be once abused and subjected to contempt and unreasonable and easy resolutions, their girdle is unloosed and they suffer the shame of prostitution and contempt When Saul made a law, that he that eat before night should die, the people perswaded him directly to rescind it, in the case of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, because it was unequal and unjust that he who had wrought their deliverance, and in that working it, was absent from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the law should suffer for breaking it, in a case of violent necessity and of which he heard nothing upon so faire and probable a cause: and it had been well that the Persian had been so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> rescued who against the laws of his country killed a Lion to save the life of his Prince; in such cases it is fit the law be rescinded and dispensed with all, as to certain particulars, so it be done ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with competent authority, in great necessity, and without partiality: But that which I intend here is, that in the rescission or
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50231:328"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dispensation of the law the processe be open and free, and such as shall preserve the law and its sacrednesse as well as the person and his interest. The laws of Sparta forbad any man to be twice Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but when their affaires required it, they made Araeus titular and Lysander supravisor of him, and Admiral to all real and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective purposes; this wanted ingenuity and laid a way open for them to despise the law which was made patient of such a weak evasion; The Lacedemonian Embassador perswaded Pericles to turn the tables of the law, which were forbidden to be removed, and an other ordained in a certain case that the laws should sleep <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 24. hours; A third decreed that June should be called May, because the time of an election appointed by the law was elapsed; these arts are against the ingenuity and simplicitie of laws, and lawgivers; and teach the people to cheat in their obedience, when their Judges are so fraudulent in the administration of their laws. Every law should be made plain, open, honest, &amp; significant, and he that makes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and intricates it on purpose, or by inconsideration, layes a snare or leaves one there, and is either an imprudent person, and therefore unfit to govern, or else he is a Tyrant and a vultur. It is too much that a man can make a law by an arbitrary power. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when he shall also leave the law so that every of the ministers of Justice and the Judges shall have power to rule by a loose, by an arbitrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a contradictory interpretation, it is intolerable. They that rule by prudence, should above all things see that the patrons and Advocates of innocence should be harmlesse and without an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil sting.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christian simplicity relates to promises and acts of grace and favour; and its caution is, that all promises be simple, ingenuous, agreeable to the intention of the promiser, truly and effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and never going lesse in the performance, then in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and words of the expression: concerning which the cases are several. 1. First all promises in which a third or a second person hath no interest, that is the promises of kindnesse and civilities, are tied to passe into performance, <hi>secundum aequum &amp; bonum:</hi> and though they may oblige to some small inconvenience, yet never to a great one: and I will visit you to morrow morning, because I promised you, and therefore. I will come <hi>etiamsi non concoxero,</hi> although I have not slept my full sleep, but <hi>Si febricitavero</hi> if I be in a feaver or have reason to fear one, I am disobliged. For the nature of such promises bears upon them no bigger burthen, then can be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by reasonable civilities and the common expectation of kinde, and the ordinary performances of just men, who do excuse and are excused respectively, by all rules of reason proportionably to such small entercourses: and therefore although such conditions be not expressed in making promises, yet to perform or rescind them by such laws is not against Christian simplicity. 2. Promises
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50231:329"/>
in matters of justice or in matters of grace as from a superiour to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> an inferiour must be so singly and ingenuously expressed, intended and performed accordingly, that no condition is to be reserved or supposed in them to warrant their non-performance, but impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or that which is next to it, an intolerable inconvenience; in which cases we have a natural liberty to commute our promises, but so that we pay to the interested person a good, at least equal to that which we first promised. And to this purpose it may be added that it is not against Christian simplicity to expresse our promises in such words which we know the interested man will understand to other purposes then I intend so it be not lesse that I mean, then that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hopes for. When our Blessed Saviour told his disciples, that <hi>they should sit upon twelve thrones,</hi> they presently thought they had his bond for a kingdom, and dreamt of wealth, and honour, power and a splendid court; and Christ knew they did, but did not disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle his promise from the enfolded and intricate sence of which his words were naturally capable; but he performed his promise, to better purposes, then they hoped for; they were presidents in the conduct of souls, Princes of Gods people, the chief in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings stood neerest to the crosse, had an elder brothers portion in the Kingdom of grace, were the founders of Churches, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the mysteries of the kingdom and ministers of the spirit of God and chanels of mighty blessings, under mediators in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their Lord and <hi>their names were written in heaven;</hi> and this was infinitely better, then to groan and wake under a head pressed with a golden crown and pungent cares, and to eat alone, and to walk in a croud and to be vexed with all the publick and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the private evils of the people, which is the sum Total of an earthly Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>When God promised to the obedient that they should live long in the land, which he would give them, he meant it of the land of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Canaan, but yet reserved to himself the liberty of taking them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that land and carrying them to a better. He that promises to lend me a staffe to walk withal, and instead of that gives me a horse to carry me, hath not broken his promise, nor dealt deceitfully. And this is Gods dealing with mankinde; he promises more then we could hope for; and when he hath done that, he gives us more then he hath promised. God hath promised to give to them that fear him all that they need, food and raiment; but he addes out of the treasures of his mercy; variety of food and changes of raiment; some to get strength and some to refresh, something for them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that are in health and some for the sick. And though that skins of buls and stagges and foxes and bears could have drawn a vail thick enough to hide the apertures of sin and natural shame and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from heat and cold, yet when he addeth the fleeces of sheep and beavers, and the spoiles of silk worms, he hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50231:329"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that although his promises are the bounds of our certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, yet they are not the limits of his loving kindnesse; and if he does more then he hath promised, no man can complain that he did otherwise, and did greater things then he said: thus God does, but therefore so also must we; imitating that example, and transcribing that copy of divine truth, alwayes remembring that his promises are yea and Amen And although God often goes more, yet he never goes lesse; and therefore we must never go from our promises, unlesse we be thrust from thence by disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or let go by leave, or called up higher by a greater intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and increase of kindnesse: And therefore when Solyman had sworn to Ibrahim-Bassa that he would never kill him so long as he were alive, he quitted himself but ill, when he sent an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch to cut his throat when he slept, because the Priest told him that sleep was death. His act was false and deceitful as his great prophet.</p>
                  <p>But in this part of simplicity <hi>we Christians</hi> have a most especiall obligation, for our religion being ennobled by the most and the greatest promises, and our faith made confident by the veracity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of our Lord, and his word made certain by miracles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and voices from heaven, and all the testimony of God himself, and that truth it self is bound upon us by the efficacy of great endearments and so many precepts; if we shall suffer the faith of a Christian to be an instrument to deceive our brother, and that he must either be incredulous or deceived, uncharitable or deluded like a fool, we dishonour the sacrednesse of the institution and become strangers to the spirit of truth, and to the eternall word of God. Our Blessed Lord would not have his disciples to swear at all (no not in publick Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if the necessities of the world would permit him to be obeyed: If Christians will live according to the religion, the word of a Christian were sufficient instrument to give testimony and to make promises, to secure a faith, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that supposition oathes were uselesse, and therefore forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, because there could be no necessity to invoke Gods name in promises or affirmations if men were indeed Christians: and therefore in that case would be a taking it in vain; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many are not and they that are in name oftentimes are so in nothing else, it became necessary that man should swear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in judgment and in publick courts; but consider who it was that invented and made the necessitie of oaths, of bonds, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities, of statutes, extents, judgements and all the artifices of humane diffidence and dishonesty; These things were indeed found out by men; but the necessity of these was from him that is the father of lies, from him that hath made many faire promises but never kept any. or if he did, it was to do a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50231:330"/>
bigger mischief, to cozen the more: for so does the Devil: He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promises rich harvests and blasts the corn in the spring, he tells his servants they shall be rich, and fills them with beggerly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, makes them base and indigent, greedy and penurious, and they that serve him intirely, as witches and such miserable persons never can be rich: if he promises health, then men grow confident and intemperate and do such things whereby they shall die the sooner, and die longer they shall die eternally. He deceives men in their trust, and frustrates their hopes, and eludes their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and his promises have a period set, beyond which they cannot be true; For wicked men shall enjoy a faire fortune but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> till their appointed time, and then it ends imperfect and most accomplished misery: and therefore even in this performance he deceives them most of all, promising and performing coloured stones, and glasse-gems that he may cozen them of their glorious inheritance. All fraudulent breakers of promises dresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by his glasse whose best imagery, is deformity and lies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <p>But because a man may be deceived by deeds and open actions as well as words; therefore it concerns their duty, that no man by an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> action on purpose done to make his brother believe a lie abuse his persuasion and his interest, When <hi>Pythius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> had a minde to sell his garden to <hi>Cannius</hi> he invited him thither, and caused fishermen (as if by custom) to fish in the chanell by which the gardens stood, and they threw a great store of fish into their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and made <hi>Cannius</hi> believe it was so every day, and the man grew greedy of that place of pleasure, and gave Pythius a double price, and the next day perceived himself abused.

But this pretence of an action signifying otherwise then it looks for, is onely forbidden in matter of contract, and the material interest of a second person. But when actions are of a double signification, or when a man is not abused or defeated of his right by an uncertain signe, it is lawfull to do a thing to other purposes then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood. Flight is a signe of fear; but it is lawfull to fly when a man fears not. Circumoision was the seal of the Jewish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and yet Saint Paul circumcised Timothy though he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he should live like the Centile Christians, and not as do the Jews. Put because that rite did signifie more things beside that one, he onely did it to represent that he was no enemy of Moses law, but would use it when there was just reason, which was one part of the things which the using of circumcision could signifie: So our blessed Saviour pretended that he would passe forth beyond Emaus, out if he intended not to do it, yet he did no injury to the two disciples, for whose good it was that he intended to make this offer: and neither did he prevaricate the strictnesse of simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and sincerity, because they were persons with whom he had made no contracts, to whom he had passed no obligation, and in the nature of the thing it is <hi>proper and natural,</hi> by an offer to give an occasion to another to do a good action; and in case it succeeds not, then to do what we intended not, and so the offer was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. But in all cases of bargaining, although the actions of themselves may receive naturally another sense, yet I am bound to follow that signification which may not abuse my brother, or pollute my own honesty, or snatch, or rifle his interest: Because it can be no ingredient into the commutation, if I exchange a thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which he understands not, and is by errour lead into this mistake, and I hold forth the fire, and delude him, and amuse his eye: for by me he is made worse.</p>

Men use to go about, when they tell a lie, and devise circumstances, and stand off at distance, and cast a cloud of words, and intricate the whole affair, and cozen themselves first, and then cozen their brother, while they have minced the case of conscience
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50231:332"/>
into little particles, and swallowed the lie by crumbs, so that no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> one passage of it should rush against the conscience, nor do hurt, until it is all got into the belly, and unites in the effect; for by that time, two men are abused, the Merchant in his soul, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor in his interest; and this is the certain effect of much talking and little honesty: but he that means honestly, must speak but once, that is, one truth, and hath leave to vary within the degrees of just prices, and fair conditions, which because they have a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude may be enlarged, or restrained according as the Merchant please, save onely he must never prevaricate the measures of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the proportions of reputation, and the publike. But in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the parts of this traffick let our words be the significations of our thoughts, and our thoughts designe nothing, but the advantages of a permitted exchange. In this case, the severity is so great, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and so without variety of case, that it is not lawfull for a man to tell a <hi>truth,</hi> with a collateral designe to cozen and abuse; and therefore at no hand can it be permitted to lie or equivocate, to speak craftily, or to deceive by smoothnesse, or intricacy, or long discourses.</p>
                  <p>But this precept of simplicity in matter of contract hath one step of severity beyond this: In matter of contract it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so much as to conceal the secret and undiscernable faults of the merchandize; but we must acknowledge them, or else affix prices made diminute and lessened to such proportions and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as that fault should make. <hi>Caveat emptor</hi> is a good caution for him that buyes, and it secures the seller in publike Judicature, but not in court of conscience; and the old lawes of the Romans were as nice in this affair, as the conscience of a Christian. <hi>Titus Claudius Centimalus</hi> was commanded by the <hi>Augures</hi> to pull down his house in the <hi>Coelian mountain,</hi> because it hindred their observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the flight of birds; he exposes his house to sale, <hi>Publius</hi>

                     <hi>Calpurnius</hi> buyes it, and is forced to pluck it down; But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to the Judges had remedy, because <hi>Claudius</hi> did not tell him the true state of the inconvenience. He that sels a house in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the plague, or haunted with evil spirits, sels that which is not worth such a price which it might be put to if it were in health and peace: and therefore cannot demand it but openly and upon publication of the evil. To which also this is to be added, that in some great faults and such as have danger, (as in the cases now specified) no diminution of the price is sufficient to make the Merchant just and sincere, unlesse he tels the appendant mischief; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> because to some persons in many cases, and to all persons in some cases, it is not at all valuable, and they would not possesse it if they might for nothing. <hi>Marcus Gratidianus</hi> bought a house of <hi>Sergius Orata,</hi> which himself had sold before; But because <hi>Sergius</hi> did not declare the appendant vassalage and service, he was recompenced
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50231:332"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by the Judges; for although it was certain that <hi>Gratidianus</hi> knew it, because it had been his own, yet <hi>Oportuit ex bonâ fide denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciari</hi> said the law; it concerned the ingenuity of a good man to have spoken it openly. In all cases it must be confessed in the price, or in the words; But when the evil may be personal, and more then matter of interest and money, it ought to be confessed, and then the goods prescribed, lest by my act I do my neighbour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and I receive profit by his dammage. Certain it is, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity is the sweetest and easiest way, there is no difficulty or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of conscience in that, and it can have no objection in it but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> possibly sometimes we lose a little advantage, which it may be we may lawfully acquire, but still we secure a quiet conscience: and if the merchandise be not worth so much to me, then neither is it to him; if it be to him, it is also to me; and therefore I have no losse, no hurt to keep it if it be refused: but he that secures his own profit, and regards not the interest of another, is more greedy of a full purse then of a holy conscience, and prefers gain before justice, and the wealth of his private, before the necessity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like society and commerce, being a son of earth whose centre is it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> self, without relation to heaven that moves upon anothers point, and produces flowers, for others, and sends influence upon all the world, and receives nothing in return, but a cloud of perfume, or the smell of a fat sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>God sent justice into the world, that all conditions in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proportions should be equall; and he that receives a good, should pay one, and he whom I serve is obliged to feed and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me in the same proportions as I serve; and justice is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive terme, and supposes two persons obliged, and though fortunes are unequal, and estates are in majority and subordination, and men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are wise or foolish, honoured or despised; yet in the entercourses of justice God hath made that there is no difference, and therefore it was esteemed ignoble to dismisse a servant when corn was dear, in dangers of shipwrack to throw out an unprofitable boy and keep a fair horse; or for <hi>a wise man</hi> to snatch a plank from a drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>fool,</hi> or if the Master of the ship should challenge the board up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his passenger swims for his life, or to obtrude false mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys upon others, which we first took for true, but at last discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be false; or not to discover the gold which the merchant sold for alchimy: The reason of all these is, because the collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> advantages are not at all to be considered in matter of rights; and though I am dearest to my self, as my neighbour is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet it is necessary that I permit him to his own advantages, as I desire to be permitted to mine. Now therefore simplicity and ingenuity in all contracts is perfectly and exactly necessary, because its contrary destroys that equality which justice hath placed in the affaires of men, and makes all things private, and makes a man
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50231:333"/>
dearer to himself, and to be preferred before Kings, and repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Churches; it destroyes society, and it makes multitudes of men to be but like heards of beasts, without proper instruments of exchange, and securities of possession, without faith and without propriety concerning all which there is no other account to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but that the rewards of craft are but a little money and a great deal of dishonour and much suspicion: and proportionable scorn; watches and guards, spies and jealousies are his portion; But the crown of justice is a fair life and a clear reputation, &amp; an inheritance there where justice dwells since she left the earth, even <hi>in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the just,</hi> who shall call us to <hi>judgement for every word, and</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Christian simplicity hath also its necessity and passes obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon us towards enemies in questions of law or war. Plutarch commends Lysander and Philopaemen for their craft and subtilty in war, but commends it not as an ornament to their manners, but that which had influence into prosperous events; just as Ammianus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> affirms, <hi>nullo discrimine virtutis ac doli prosperos omnes laudari debere bellorum eventus:</hi> whatsoever in war is prosperous, men use to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: But he that is a good souldier is not alwayes a good man.

The good old man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Chiron was my Tutor, and he taught me to use simplicity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty in all my manners. It was well and noble; But yet some wise men do not condemn all souldiers that use to get victories by deceit: Saint Austin allows it to be lawful; and Saint Chrysostome <note place="margin">Quae. 10. <hi>super Joshuam lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de sacerdotio.</hi>
                     </note> commends it. These Good men supposed that a crafty victory was better then a bloody war; and certainly so it is, if the power got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by craft be not exercised in blood: But this businesse (as to the case of conscience) will quickly be determined. Enemies are no persons bound by contract and society, and therefore are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to open hostilities and ingenuous prosecutions of the war; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and if it be lawful to take by violence, it is not unjust to take the same thing by craft. But this is so to be understood, that where there is an obligation either by the law of nations or by special contracts, No man dare to violate his faith or honour, but in these things deal with an ingenuity equal to the truth of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promises, and acts of favour and endearment to our relatives. Josephus tells of the sons of Herod, that in their enmities with their Vncle Pherora and Salome they had disagreeing manners of prosecution, as they had disagreeing hearts; some railed openly, and thought their enmity the more honest, because it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but by their ignorance and rude, untutor'd malice lay open to the close designes of the elder brood of foxes. In this because it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist l.</hi> 16. cap. 6</note> was a particular and private quarrel, there is no rule of conscience but that it be wholly laid aside, and appeased with charity; for the opennesse of the quarrel was but the rage and indiscretion of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> malice: and the close designe was but the craft and advantage of the malice: But in just wars on that side where a competent authority and a just cause warrants the arms and turns the active opposition into the excuse and licence of defence, there is no restraint upon the actions and words of men in the matter of sincerity, but that the laws of nations be strictly pursued and all parties; promises, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts observed religiously &amp; by the proportion of a private &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ingenuity. We finde it by wise and good men mentioned with honour, that the Romans threw bread from the besieged Capitol into the stations of the Gauls, that they might think them full of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> corn: and that Agesilaus discouraged the enemies by causing his own men to wear crowns in token of a Navall victory gotten by Pisander who yet was at that time destroyed by Conon, and that Flaccus said the city was taken by Emilius, or that Joshua dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a flight at Ai, and the Consul Quinctius told aloud that the left wing of the enemies was fled, and that made the right wing fly; or that Valerius Levinus bragged prudently that he had killed Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus, and that others use the ensigns of enemies colours and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, concerning which sort of actions and words Agesilaus, in Plutarch said <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>It is just and pleasant, profitable and glorious,</hi> but to call a parley and fall in upon the men that treat; to swear a peace and watch advantage; to entertain Heralds and then to torment them, to get from them notices of their party; these are such which are dishonorable and unjust, condemned by the laws of nations and essential justice, &amp; by all the world and the Hungarian army was destroyed by a divine judgement at the prayer &amp; appeal of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan enemy, for their violating their faith and honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning the name of Christ by using it in a solemn oath to deceive their enemies, <gap reason="foreign">

In other cases liberty hath been taken by all men and it is reproved by no man, since the first simplicity of fighting &amp; down right blows did cease by the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed people of the world: which was as is usually compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, about the end of the second Carthaginian war; since that time,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50231:334"/>
some few persons have been found so noble as to scorn to steal a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> victory, but had rather have the glory of a sharp sword, then of a sharp wit; But their fighting gallantry is extrinsecal to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of lawful or unlawful</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus we see how far the laws of ingenuity and Christian simplicity have put fetters upon our words and actions and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the paths of truth and noblenesse, and the first degrees of permission of <hi>simulation</hi> is in the arts of war, and the cases of just hostility. But here it is usually inquired whether it be lawful to tell a lie, or dissemble to save a good mans life, or to do him a great benefit? a Question which Saint Austine was much troubled withal affirming it to be of the greatest difficulty: for he saw gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all the Doctors before his time allowed it; and of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers no man is noted to have reproved it but Saint Austin alone, and he also (as his manner is) with some variety: those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him are to be accounted upon his score: and it relies upon such precedents which are not lightly to be disallowed; for so Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Isaac told a lie in the case of their own danger to Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech; so did the Israelitish midwives to Pharaoh and Rachab con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cering the spies, and David to the King of Gath, and the prophet that anointed Saul, and Elisha to Hazael, and Solomon in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the stolen childe; concerning which Irenaeus hath given us a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> rule that those whose actions the Scripture hath remarked, &amp; yet not chastised or censured, we are not without great reason and certain rule to condemn: but whether his rule can extend to this case is now to be enquired.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain that children may be cozned into goodnesse, and sick men to health, and passengers in a storm into fafety; and the reason of these is, because not onely the end is fair and charitable and just, but the means are such which do no injury to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which are to receive benefit: Because these are persons who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are either naturally or accidentally ignorant and incompetent judges of affaires: and if they be also wilful as such persons most commonly are, there is in art and nature left no wayes to deal with them but with innocent, charitable, and artificial deceptions; they are not capable of reason and solid discourses, and therefore either must be exposed to all harms like Lions whelps when their nurse and sire are taken in a toile, or else be provided for in wages proportionable to their capacitie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinners may not be treated with the liberty we take to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and sick persons, because they must serve God with choice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and election; and therefore although a sick man may be cozened into his health, yet a man must not be cozened into his duty, which is no duty at all or pleasing to God, unlesse it be voluntary and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen: and therefore they are to be treated with arguments proper to move their wills by the instrument of understanding specially,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> being persons of perfect faculties and apt to be moved by the wayes of health and of a man. It is an argument of infirmity that in some cases it is necessary to make pretences; but those pretences are not made legitimate, unlesse it be the infirmity of the interested man with whom we do comply. My infirmity can not make it lawful to make colours and images of things: But the infirmity of him with whom I deal, may be such, that he can be defended or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed no other way: But sinners that offend God by choice must have their choice corrected, and their understandings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed or else their evill is not cured nor their state amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

For it is here very observable, that in entercourses of this nature we are to regard a double duty; the matter of justice, and the rights of charity: that is, that good be done by lawful instruments; for it is certain it is not lawful to abuse a mans understanding, with a purpose to gain him 6. d. it is not fit to do evil for a good end, or to abuse one man to preserve or do advantage to another: and therefore it is not sufficient that I intend to do good to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for I may not therefore tell a lie and abuse his credulity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his understanding hath a right as certain as his will hath, or as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his money; and his right to truth is no more to be cozened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, then his right unto his money; and therefore such arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial entercourses are no wayes to be permitted, but to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons over whose understandings we have power and authority. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to said it was lawful for Kings and Governours to dissemble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is great necessity for them so to do: but it was but crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, so nakedly to deliver the doctrine for in such things which the people cannot understand and yet ought to obey, there is a liberty to use them as we use children, who are of no other condition or capacities then children; but in all things where they can and ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to choose, because their understanding is onely a servant to God, no man hath power to abuse their credulity and reason, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their estates, and peace.

It is better for children to have warm clothes then a true proposition, and therefore in all senses they and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their like may be so treated: But other persons who have distinct capacities have an injury done them by being abused into advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and although those advantages make them recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, yet he that is tied to make a man recompence, hath done him injury and committed a sin, by which he was obliged to restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; &amp; therefore the man ought not to be cozened for his own good</p>

I remember that Secundus extremely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Arria for deluding her husbands fears concerning the death of his beloved boy, and wiped her eyes and came in confidently and sate by her husbands bed-side, and when she could no longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to weep, her husbands sicknesse was excuse enough to legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that sorrow, or else she could retire; but so long she forbore to confess the boy's death til Caecinna Paetus had so far recovered that he could go forth to see the boy and need not fear with sorrow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his disease. It was indeed a great kindnesse and a rare pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as their affaires and laws were ordered; but we have better means to cure our sick; our religion can charme the passion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the spirit to entertain and master a sorrow; and when we have such rare supplies out of the store-houses of reason and religion we have lesse reason to use these arts and little deviees, which are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an infirmity as great as is the charity: and therefore we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to keep our selves strictly to the foregoing measures; <hi>Let every man speak the truth to his neighbour, putting away lying, for we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another:</hi> and <hi>be as harmlesse as doves</hi> saith our <hi>blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are founded upon justice and charity: and therefore wherever a lie is in any sense against justice, and wrongs any thing of a man, his judgement and his reason, his right or his liberty, it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden in the Christian religion: what cases we can truly suppose to be besides these, the law forbids not and therefore it is lawful to say that to my self which I believe not, for what inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent purpose I please and to all those over whose understanding I have or ought to have right.</p>
                  <p>These cases are intricate enough, and therefore I shall return plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to presse the doctrine of simplicity which ought to be so sacred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that a man ought to do nothing indirectly which it is not lawful to own; to receive no advantage by the sin of another, which I should account dishonest if the action were my own; for whatsoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes may be concerning the lawfulnesse of pretending craftily in some rare and contingent cases, yet it is on all hands condemned that my craft should do injury to my brother. I remember that when some greedy and indigent people forged a will of Lucius Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Basilius and joyned M. Crassus, and Q. Hortensius in the inheritance that their power for their own interest might secure the others share, they suspecting the thing to be a forgery, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not principals and actors in the contrivance <hi>alieni facinoris mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus culum non repudiaverunt,</hi> refused not to receive a present made them by anothers crime; but so they entred upon a moiety of the estate and the biggest share of the dishonour: we must not be crafty to anothers injury so much as by giving countenance to the wrong; for Tortoises and the Estrich hatch their egges with their looks one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and some have designes which a dissembling face or an acted gesture can produce; but as a man may commit adultery with his eye so with his eye also he may tell a lie, and steal with one finger and do injury collaterally and yet designe it with a direct intuition upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which he looks with his face over his shoulder: and by whatsoever instrument my neighbour may be abused, by the same instrument I sin if I do designe it antecedently, or fal upon it together with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, or rejoyce in it when it is done.</p>

Poor Adam being banished and undone, went and lived a sad life in the mountains of <hi>India,</hi> and turned his face and his prayers towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Paradise; thither he sent his sighes, to that place he directed his devotions; there was his heart now, and his felicity sometimes had been; but he knew not how to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for God was his enemy, and by many of his attributes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself against him. <hi>Gods power</hi> was armed against him; and <hi>poor man,</hi> whom a fly, or a fish could kill, was assaulted and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50231:337"/>
beaten with a sword of fire in the hand of a Cherubim. <hi>Gods eye</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> watched him, <hi>his omniscience</hi> was mans accuser, <hi>his severity</hi> was the Judge, <hi>his justice</hi> the executioner. It was a mighty calamity that man was to undergo, when he that made him, armed himself against his creature, which would have died or turned to nothing, if he had but withdrawn the miracles and the Almightinesse of his power. If God had taken his arm from under him, man had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; but it was therefore a greater evil when God laid his arm upon him and against him, and seemed to support him that he might be longer killing him. In the midst of these sadnesses God remembered his own creature, and pitied it, and by his <hi>mercy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him from <hi>the hand of his power,</hi> and <hi>the sword of his justice,</hi> and <hi>the guilt of his punishment,</hi> and <hi>the disorder of his sin,</hi> and placed him in that order of good things where he ought to have stood: It was <hi>mercy</hi> that preserved the noblest of Gods creatures here below; he who stood condemned and undone under all the other attributes of God, was onely saved and rescued by his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> that it may be evident that <hi>Gods mercy is above all his works,</hi> and above <hi>all ours,</hi> greater then the creation, and greater then our sins; <hi>as is his Majesty, so is his mercy,</hi> that is, without measures, and without rules, sitting in heaven and filling all the world, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for a duty that he may give a blessing, making man that he may save him, punishing him that he may preserve him: and Gods <hi>justice</hi> bowed down to his <hi>mercy,</hi> and all his <hi>power</hi> passed into <hi>mercy,</hi> and his <hi>omniscience</hi> converted into <hi>care and watchfulnesse,</hi> into <hi>providence,</hi> and <hi>observation</hi> for mans avail, and Heaven gave its influence for man, and rained showers for our food and drink, and the Attributes and Acts of God <hi>sat at the foot of mercy,</hi> and <hi>all that mercy descended upon the head of man:</hi> For so the light of the world in the morning of the creation was spread abroad like a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and dwelt no where, but filled the <hi>expansum</hi> with a dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> great as the unfoldings of the airs looser garment, or the wilder fringes of the fire, without knots, or order or combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but God gathered the beams in his hand, and united them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a globe of fire, and all the light of the world became the body of the Sun, and he lent some to his weaker sister that walks in the night, and guides a traveller and teaches him to distinguish a house from a river, or a rock from a plain field; so is the mercy of God; a vast <hi>expansum</hi> and a huge Ocean, from eternall ages it dwelt round about the throne of God, and it filled all that infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and space, that hath no measures but the will of God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God desiring to communicate that excellency and make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, <hi>created Angels,</hi> that he might have persons capable of huge gifts, <hi>and man,</hi> who he knew would need forgivenesse; for so the Angels our elder Brothers dwelt for ever in the house of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and never brake his commandements; but we the younger
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50231:337"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> like prodigals, forsook our fathers house, and went into a strange countrey, and followed stranger courses, and spent the portion of our nature, and forfeited all our title to the family, and came to need another portion: for ever since the fall of Adam, who like an unfortunate man spent all that a wretched man could need, or a happy man could have, <hi>our life is repentance,</hi> and <hi>forgivenesse is all our portion:</hi> and though Angels were objects of Gods <hi>bounty,</hi> yet man onely is (in proper speaking) the object of his <hi>mercy.</hi> And the mercy which dwelt in an infinite circle, became confin'd to a little ring, and dwelt here below, and here shall dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> till it hath carried all Gods portion up to heaven, where it shall reigne and glory upon our crowned heads for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>But for him that considers Gods mercies, and dwels a while in that depth, it is hard not to talk wildly and without art, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of discoursings: Saint Peter talked he knew not what, when he entered into a cloud with Jesus upon mount Tabor, though it passed over him like the little curtains that ride upon the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde, and passe between the Sun and us: And when we converse with a light greater then the Sun, and tast a sweetnesse more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then the dew of heaven, and in our thoughts entertain the ravishments and harmony of that atonement which reconciles God to man, and man to felicity, it will be more easily pardoned, if we should be like persons that admire much, and say but little: and indeed we can best confesse the glories of the Lord by dazeled eyes and a stammering tongue, and a heart overcharged with the miracles of this infinity; For so those little drops that <hi>run over,</hi> though they be not much in themselves, yet they tell that the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was full, and could expresse the greatnesse of the shower no otherwise, but by spilling, and inartificiall expressions and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> over. But because I have undertaken to tell the drops of the Ocean, and to span the measures of eternity, I must do it by the great lines of revelation, and experience, and tell concerning Gods mercy as we do concerning God himself, that he is that great fountain of which we all drink, and the great rock of which we all eat, and on which we all dwell, and under whose shadow we all are refreshed. Gods mercy is all this, and we can onely draw great lines of it, and reckon the constellations of our hemisphere instead of telling the number of the stars: we onely can reckon what we feel, and what we live by; And though there be in every one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> these lines of life enough to ingage us for ever to do God service, and to give him praises, yet it is certain there are very many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God <hi>upon us, and toward us, and concerning us,</hi> which we neither feel, nor see, nor understand as yet; but yet we are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them, and are preserved and secured; and we shall then know them, when we come to give God thanks in the festivities
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50231:338"/>
of an eternall sabbath. But that I may confine my discourse into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> order, since the subject of it cannot, I consider;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That mercy being an emanation of the Divine goodnesse upon us, and supposes us, and found us miserable; In this account concerning the mercies of God, I must not reckon the miracles and graces of the creation, or any thing of the nature of man; nor tell how great an endearment God passed upon us that he made us men, capable of felicity, apted with rare instruments of discourse, and reason, passions, and desires, notices of sense, and reflections <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upon that sense, that we have not the deformity of a Crocodile, nor the motion of a Worm, nor the hunger of a Wolf, nor the wildenesse of a Tigre, nor the birth of Vipers, nor the life of flies, nor the death of serpents.</p>
                  <p>Our excellent bodies, and usefull faculties, the upright moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the tenacious hand, the fair appetites, and proportioned satisfactions, our speech and our perceptions, our acts of life, the rare invention of letters, and the use of writing, and speaking at distance, the intervals of rest and labour, (either of which if they were perpetual would be intolerable) the needs of nature, and the provisions of providence, sleep, and businesse, refreshments of the body, and entertainment of the soul; these are to be reckoned as acts of bounty rather then mercy; God gave us these when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> made us, and before we needed mercy; these were portions of our nature, or provided to supply our consequent necessities; but when we forfeited all Gods favour by our sins, then that they were continued, or restored to us, became a mercy, and therefore ought to be reckoned upon this new account; for it was a rare mercy that we were suffered to live at all, or that the Anger of God did permit to us one blessing; that he did punish us so gently: But when the <hi>rack</hi> is changed into an <hi>ax,</hi> and the <hi>ax</hi> into an <hi>imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>imprisonment</hi> changed into an <hi>enlargement,</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>enlargement</hi> into an <hi>entertainment</hi> in the family, and this <hi>entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> passes on to an <hi>adoption,</hi> these are steps of a mighty favour, and perfect redemption from our sin: and the returning back our own goods is <hi>a gift,</hi> and a perfect donative, sweetned by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the calamity, from whence every lesser punishment began to free us; and thus it was, that God punished us and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sin of Adam upon his posterity. He threatned we should die, and so we did, but not so as we deserved; we waited for death and stood sentenced, and are daily summoned by sicknesses and uneasinesse; and every day is a new reprieve, and brings a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> favour, certain as the revolution of the Sun upon that day, and at last when we must die by the irreversible decree, <hi>that death,</hi> is changed into <hi>a sleep,</hi> and <hi>that sleep is in the bosom of Christ,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> dwels <hi>all peace</hi> and <hi>security,</hi> and it shall passe forth into <hi>glories</hi> and <hi>felicities.</hi> We looked for <hi>a Judge,</hi> and behold <hi>a Saviour;</hi> we
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50231:338"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> feared <hi>an accuser,</hi> and behold <hi>an Advocate;</hi> we sate down in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and rise in joy; we leaned upon Rhubarb and Aloes, and our aprons were made of the sharp leaves of Indian fig-trees, and so we fed, and so were clothed: But the Rhubarb proved me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal, and the rough leaf of the tree brought its fruit wrapped up in its foldings; and round about our dwellings was planted a hedge of thornes, and bundles of thistles, <hi>the Aconite,</hi> and <hi>the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, the Night-shade,</hi> and <hi>the Poppy,</hi> and at the root of these grew the healing <hi>Plantain,</hi> which rising up into a talnesse, by the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invitation of a heavenly influence, turn'd about <hi>the tree of the</hi>

                     <hi>crosse,</hi> and cured the wounds of the thorns, and the curse of the thistles, and the malediction of man, and the wrath of God. <hi>Si sic irascitur, quomodo convivatur?</hi> If God be thus kinde when he is Angry, what is he when he feasts us with caresses of his more tender Kindnesse? All that God restored to us after the fo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>feiture of Adam grew to be a double Kindnesse; for it became the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of a bounty which knew not how to repent, a gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that was not to be altered, though we were, and that was it which we needed. That's the first generall: all the <hi>bounties</hi> of the creation became <hi>mercies</hi> to us, when God continued them to us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and restored them after they were forfeit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as a circle begins every where, and ends no where, so do the mercies of God: after all this huge progresse, now it began anew: God is good and gracious, and God is ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give. Now that he had once more made us capable of mercies God had what he desired, and what he could rejoyce in, something upon which he might pour forth his mercies; and by the way, this I shall observe, (for I cannot but speak without art, when I speak of that which hath no measure) God made us capable of one sort of his mercies, and we made our selves capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>God is good and gracious,</hi> that is, desirous to give great gifts; and of this, God made us receptive, first by giving us naturall possibilities, that is, by giving those gifts he made us capable of more; and next, by restoring us to his favour, that he might not by our provocations be hindered from raining down his mercies. But <hi>God is</hi> also <hi>ready to forgive]</hi> and of this kinde of mercy we made our selves capable, even by not deserving it; Our sin made way for his grace, and our infirmities called upon his pity; and because we sinned, we became miserable, and because we were miserable, we became pitiable, and this opened the other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his mercy; that because our <hi>sin abounds, his grace may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound.</hi> In this method we must confine our thoughts;</p>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50231:339"/>
us by mending of our nature: For the ignorance we fell into is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> instructed and better learned in spirituall notices then Adams morning knowledge in Paradise, our appetites are made subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the spirit, and the liberty of our wills is improved, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>the liberty of the sons of God,</hi> and Christ hath done us more grace and advantage then we lost in Adam; and as man lost <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> and got <hi>Heaven,</hi> so he lost the <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>first,</hi> and got the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>second Adam:</hi> his <hi>living soul</hi> is changed into <hi>a quickning spirit,</hi> our discerning faculties are filled with the spirit of faith, and our passions and desires are entertained with hope, and our election is sanctified with charity; and his first life of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> temporall possession is passed into a better, a life of spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; and though our first parent was forbidden it, yet we live of the fruits of <hi>the tree of life.</hi> But I instance in two great things in which humane nature is greatly advanced, and passed on to greater perfections; The first is, that besides body and soul, which was the summe totall of Adams constitution.

For (so said the Prophet) <hi>the son of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning said, I will ascend into heaven, and sit in the sodes of the North,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that is, the throne of Jesus seated in the East, called the sides, or obliquity of the North: and as the seating of his humane nature in that glorious seat brought to him all adoration, and the Majesty of God, and the greatest of his exaltation: So it was so great an advancement to us, that all the Angels of heaven take notice of it, and feel a change in the appendage of their condition: not that they are lessened, but that we, who in nature are lesse then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, have <hi>a relative dignity greater,</hi> and <hi>an equall honour</hi> of being fellow-servants.

The same also is the sense of the Glosse, of Saint <hi>Ambrose, Ansbertus, Haymo, Rupertus</hi> and others of old; and <hi>Ribera, Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Lewis of Granada</hi> of late; which being so plainly consonant to the words of the Angel and consigned by the testimony of such men, I the rather note, that those who worship Angels and make religious addresses to them, may see what priviledge themselves lose and how they part with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Christ who in his nature relative to us, is exalted far above all thrones and principalities and dominions. I need not adde lustre to this; It is like the Sun the biggest body of light and nothing can describe it so well as its own beams: and there is not in nature or the advantages of honour any thing greater then that we have the issues of that mercy which makes us fellow servants with Angels, too much honoured to pay them a religious worship, whose Lord is a man, and he that is <hi>their King</hi> is <hi>our Brother.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. To this for the likenesse of the matter I adde, that the divine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mercy hath so prosecuted us with the enlargement of his favours, that we are not onely fellow ministers and servants with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and in our nature in the person of Christ exalted above them, but we also shall be their Judges; and if this be not an honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of Joseph or Mordecai, an honour beyond all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of a man, then there is in honour no degrees no priority or

distances, or characters of fame and noblenesse. Christ is the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Judge of all the world, his humane nature shall then triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver evil men and evil spirits, then shall the Devils, those Angels that fel from their first originals be brought in their chains from their dark prisons and once be allowed to see the light, that light that shall confound them; <hi>while all that follow the lamb,</hi> and that are <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of that resurrection</hi> shall be assessors in the judgment. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> (saith, S.

The effect of these things ought to be this, that we do not by base actions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that nature that sits upon the throne of God, that reigns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Angels, that shall sit in judgement upon all the world. It is a great undecency that the son of a King should bear water upon his head, and dresse vineyards among the slaves; or to see a wise man and the guide of his country drink-drunk among the meanest of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but when members of Christ shall be made members of an harlot, and that which rides above a rain-bow stoopes to an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious whorish woman, when the soul that is sister to the Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, shall degenerate into the foolishnesse or rage of a beast, being drowned with the blood of the grape, or made mad with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> passion, or ridiculous with weaker follies, we shall but strip our selves of that robe of honour with which Christ hath invested, and adorned our nature, and carry that portion of humanity which is our own, and which God had honoured in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities above Angels, into a portion of an eternal shame, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came lesse in all senses, and equally disgraced with Devils. The shame and sting of this change shall be, that we turned the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Divine mercy into the basenesse of ingratitude and the amazement of suffering the Divine vengeance.

                  <p n="5">5. The next order of Divine mercies that I shall remark is also an improvement of our nature or an appendage to it: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our constitution is weak, our souls apt to diminution and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite faculties, our bodies to mutilation and imperfection, to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and crookednesse, to stammering and sorrows, to baldnesse
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50231:340"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and deformity to evil conditions and accidents of body, and to pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and sadnesse of spirit, God hath in his infinite mercy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for every condition rare suppletories of comfort and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to make recompence and sometimes with an overrunning proportion for those natural defects which were apt to make our persons otherwise contemptible and our conditions intolerable; God gives to blinde men better memories. For upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that Rufinus makes mention of Didymus of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, who being blinde, was blessed with a rare attention and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular memory, and by prayer, and hearing, and meditating, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> discoursing, came to be one of the most excellent Divines of that whole age. And it was more remarkable in Nicasius Machlinien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, who being blockish at his book in his first childhood fell into accidental blindnesse, and from thence continually grew to so quick an appretension and so tenacious a memory, that he became the wonder of his contemporaries, and was chosen Rector of the College at Mechlin, and was made licentiate of Theology at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine, and Doctor of both the laws, at Colein, living and dying in great reputation for his rare parts and excellent learning. At the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> same rate also God deals with men in other instances; want of children he recompences with freedom from care, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever evil happens to the body is therefore most commonly single and unaccompanied, because God accepts that evil as the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the sin of the man, or the instrument of his vertue, or his security, and is reckoned as a sufficient cure, or a sufficient Antidote. God hath laid laid a severe law upon all women that <hi>in sorrow they shall bring forth children,</hi> yet God hath so attempered that sorrow, that they think themselves more accursed if they want that sorrow, and they have reason to rejoyce in that state, the trouble of whic is alleviared by a promise, that <hi>they shall be saved in bearing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> He that wants one eye hath the force and vigorousnesse of both united in that which is left him; and when ever any man is afflicted with sorrow his reason and his religion, himself and all his friends, persons that are civil, and persons that are obliged, run in to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, and he may, if he will observe wisely, finde so many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of ease and remission, so many designes of providence and studied favours, such contrivances of collateral advantage and certain reserves of substantial and proper comfort, that in the whole sum of affaires, it often happens that <hi>a single crosse is a double blessing,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> &amp; that even in a temporal sense <hi>it is better to go to the house of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then of joyes</hi> and festival egressions. Is not the affliction of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty better then the prosperity of a great and tempting fortune? does not wisdom dwell in a mean estate and a low spirit retired thoughts and under a sad roof? and is it not generally true that sicknesse it self is appayed with religion and holy thoughts with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resolutions and penitential prayers, with returns to God and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50231:341" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to sober councels? and if this be true, that God sends sorrow to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cure sin, and affliction be the hand-maid to grace, it is also certain that every sad contingency in nature is doubly recompenced with the advantages of religion, besides those intervening refreshments which support the spirit, and refresh its instruments. I shall need to instance but once more in this particular.</p>
                  <p>God hath sent no greater evil into the world, then that <hi>in the sweat of our brows we shall eat our bread,</hi> and in the difficulty and agony, in the sorrows and contention of our souls we shall <hi>work out our salvation.</hi> But see how in the first of these God hath out done his own anger and defeated the purposes of his <hi>wrath</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the inundation of his <hi>mercy;</hi> for this labour and sweat of our brows is so far from being a curse that without it our very bread would not be so great a blessing. It is not labour that makes the Garlick and the pulse, the Sycamore and the Cresses, the cheese of the Goats and the butter of the sheep to be savoury and pleasant, as the flesh of the Roe-buek or the milk of the Kine, the marrow of Oxen or the thighs of birds? If it were not for labour, men neither could eat so much, nor relish so pleasantly, nor sleep so soundly nor be so healthful, nor so useful, so strong nor so patient, so noble, or so untempted, and as God hath made us beholding to labour for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the purchase of many good things, so the thing it self ows to labour, many degrees of its worth and value: and therefore I need not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that besides these advantages, the mercies of God have found out proper and natural remedies for labour; Nights to cure the sweat of the day, sleep to ease our watchfulnesse, rest to alleviate our burdens, and dayes of religion to procure our rest: and things are so ordered that labour is become a duty, and an act of many vertues, and is not so apt to turne into a sin as is its contrary, and is therefore necessary, not onely because we need it, for making provisions of our life, but even to ease the labour of our rest; there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> being no greater tediousnesse of spirit in the world then want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and an unactive life: and the lasie man is not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but also accursed, and he groans under the load of his time, which yet passes over the active man light, as a dreame or the feathers of a bird, while the disimployed, is a desease, and like a long sleeplesse night to himself, and a load unto his country: And therefore although in this particular God hath been so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this infliction that from the sharpnesse of the curse a very great part of mankinde are freed, and there are myriads of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, good and bad, who do not <hi>eat their bread in the sweat of their</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>brows,</hi> yet this is but an overrunning and an excesse of the divine mercy; God did more for us then we did absolutely need; for he hath disposed of the circumstances of this curse, that mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are so reconciled to it, that <hi>they desire it, and are delighted in it;</hi> and so the Anger of God is ended in loving Kindnesse, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50231:341"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the drop of water is lost in the full chalice of the wine, and the curse is gone out into a multiplied blessing.</p>
                  <p>But then for the other part of the severe law and laborious impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that we must work out our spiritual interest with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our spirit, seems to most men to be so intolerable, that rather then passe under it they quit their hopes of heaven, and passe into the portion of Devils; and what can there be to alleviate this sorrow, that a man shall be perpetually sollicited with an impure tempter, and shall carry a flame within him, and all the world is on fire round about him, and every thing brings fuel to the flame, and full tables are a snare, and empty tables are collateral servants to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lust, and help to blow the fire and kindle the heap of prepared temptations, and yet a man must not at all tast of the forbidden fruit, and he must not desire what he cannot choose but desire, and he must not enjoy whatsoever he does violently covet, and must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfy his appetite in the most violent importunities, but must therefore deny himself, because to do so is extremely troublesome; this seems to be an art of torture and a devise to punish man with the spirit of agony, and a restlesse vexation. But this also hath in it a great ingredient of mercy, or rather is nothing else but a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> heap of mercy in its intire constitution: For if it were not for this we had nothing of our own to present to God, nothing proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the great rewards of heaven, but either all men or no man must go thither; for nothing can distinguish man from man in order to beatitude but <hi>choice and election,</hi> and nothing can enoble the <hi>choice</hi> but <hi>love,</hi> and nothing can exercise <hi>love</hi> but <hi>difficulty,</hi> and nothing can make that <hi>difficulty</hi> but the <hi>contradiction of our appetite</hi> and the crossing of our natural affections; and therefore when ever any of you is tempted violently or grow weary in your spirits with resisting the petulancy of temptation, you may be cured if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will please but to remember and rejoyce, that now you have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of your own to give to God; something that he will be pleased to accept, something that he hath given thee that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est give it him: for our mony and our time, our dayes of feasting and our dayes of sorrow, our discourse and our acts of praise, our prayers and our songs, our vows and our offerings, our worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and prostrations, and whatsoever else can be accounted in the sum of our religion, are onely accepted according as they bear along with them portions of our wil and choice of love and appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant difficulty.</p>
                  <q>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Laetius est quoties magno tibi constat honestum.</q>
                  <p>So that whoever can complain that he serves God with pains and mortifications, he is troubled because there is a distinction of things such as we call vertue and vice, reward and punishment,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50231:342" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if he will not suffer God to distinguish the first he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> confound the latter; and his portion shall be blacknesse without variety and punishment shall be his reward.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As an appendage to this instance of <hi>divine mercy,</hi> we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that not onely in nature; but in contingency and emergent events of providence, God makes compensation to us, for all the evils of chance, and hostilities of accident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; <hi>brings good out of evil,</hi> which is that solemn triumph which mercy makes over justice, when it rides upon a cloud and crowns its darknesse with a robe of glorious light. God indeed suffered Joseph to be sold a bondslave into Egypt, but then it was that God intended to crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his chastity; for by that means he brought him to a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of dwelling and there gave him a noble trial; he had a brave contention and he was a conqueror: Then God sent him to prison, but still that was <hi>mercy,</hi> it was to make way to bring him to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs court; and God brought famine upon Canaan, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the souls of Jacobs family, and there was a plot laid for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercy; this was to bring them to see and partake of Josephs glory: and then God brought a great evil upon their posterity and they groaned under task-masters, but this God changed into <hi>the miracles of his mercy,</hi> and suffered them to be afflicted that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> might do ten miracles for their sakes, and proclaim to all the world how dear they were to God. And was not the greatest good to mankinde brought forth from the greatest treason that ever was committed; the redemption of the world from the fact of Judas, God loving to defeat the malice of man and the arts of the Devil by rare emergencies and stratagems of mercy? It is a sad calamity to see a kingdom spoiled, and a church afflicted, the Priests slain with the sword, and the blood of Nobles mingled with cheaper sand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion made a cause of trouble, and the best men most cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, Government confounded, and laws ashamed, Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> causes in fear and covetousnesse, and the ministers of holy things setting themselves against all that is sacred, and setting fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fields, and turning in little foxes on purpose to destroy the vineyards; and what shall make recompence for this heap of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, when ever God shall send such swords of fire? even <hi>the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God</hi> which then will be made publick, when we shall hear such afflicted people sing <hi>Inconvertendo captivitatem Sion</hi> with the voice of joy and festival eucharist, <hi>among such as keep holy day;</hi> and when peace shall become sweeter and dwell the longer; and in the mean time it serves religion, and the affliction shall try the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of God, and God shall crown them, and men shall grow wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and more holy, and leave their petty interstes, and take sanctuary in holy living and be taught temperance by their want, and patience by their suffering, and charity by their persecution, and shall better understand the duty of their relations, and at last

For so have I known a luxuriant Vine swell into irregular twigs, and bold excrescencies, and spend it self in leaves and little rings, and affoord but trifling clusters to the wine-presse, and a faint return to his heart which longed to be refreshed with a full vintage: But when the Lord of the vine had caused the dressers to cut the wilder plant and made it bleed, it grew temperate in its vain expense of uselesse leaves, and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into fair and juicy bunches, and made accounts of that losse of blood by the return of fruit: So is an afflicted Province, cured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of its surfets, and punished for its sins, and bleeds for its long riot, and is left ungoverned for its disobedience, and chastised for its wantonnesse, and when the sword hath let forth the corrupted blood, and the fire hath purged the rest, then it enters into the double joyes of restitution, and gives God thanks for his rod, and confesses the mercies of the Lord in making the smoke be changed into fire, and the cloud into a perfume, the sword into a staffe, and his anger into mercy.</p>

They that love to talk of the mercies of the Lord, and to recount <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his good things, cannot but have observed that God delights to be called by such Appellatives which relate to miserable and afflicted persons: <hi>He is the Father of the fatherlesse,</hi> and an <hi>avenger of the widowes cause, he standeth at the right hand of the poor to save his soul from unrighteous Judges,</hi> and <hi>he is with us in tribulation:</hi> And upon this ground, let us account whether <hi>mercy</hi> be not the greater ingredient in that death and deprivation, when I lose a man and get God to be my Father; and when my weak arm of flesh is cut <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from my shoulder, and God makes me to lean upon him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes my Patron and my Guide, my Advocate and Defender: and if in our greatest misery Gods mercy is so conspicuous, what can we suppose him to be in the endearment of his loving Kindnesse? If his vail be so transparent, well may we know that upon his face dwels glory, and from his eyes light, and perpetuall comforts run in channels, larger then the returns of the Sea, when it is driven and forced faster into its naturall course, by the violence of a tempest from the North. The summe is this, God intends every accident should minister to vertue and every vertue is the mother and the nurse of joy, and both of them daughters of the Divine goodnesse, and therefore, if our sorrows do not passe into comforts, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Gods intention; it is because we will not comply with the act <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of that mercy which would save us by all means, and all varieties, by health and by sicknesse, by the life and by the death of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est friends, by what we choose and by what we fear; that as Gods providence rules over all chances of things, and all designes of men, so his mercy may rule over all his providence. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

For even <hi>to make necessities,</hi> was a great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the mercy, and all the relishes of wine, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourinesse of meat, the sweet and the fat, the pleasure and the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the restitution of spirits, and the strengthening of the heart, are not owing to the liver of the vine, or the <hi>kidneys of wheat,</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the blood of the grape, or the strength of the corne, but to the appetite, or the necessity; and therefore it is, that he that sits at a full table and does not recreate his stomack with fasting, and let his digestion rest, and place himself in the advantages of natures intervals, he loses the blessing of his daily bread, and leans upon his table as a sick man upon his bed, or the lion in the grasse, which he cannot feed on; but he that wants it, and sits down when nature gives the signe, rejoyces in the health of his hunger, and the taste of his meat, and the strengthening of his spirit, and gives God thanks while his bones and his flesh rejoyce in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of nature, and the blessing of God. Are not the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of infancy, and the decayes of old age, the evils of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because respectively they want desire, and they want gust and relish, and reflections upon their acts of sense? and <hi>when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire failes,</hi> presently <hi>the mourners go about the streets.</hi> But then, <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.</note> that these desires are so provided for by nature and art, by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

and extraordinary, by foresight and contingency, according <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to necessity, and up unto conveniency, until we arrive at abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, is a chain of mercies larger then the Bowe in the clouds, and richer then the trees of <hi>Eden,</hi> which were permitted to feed our miserable father: Is not all the earth our orchard, and our granary, our vineyard, and our garden of pleasure? and the face of the Sea is our traffique, and the bowels of the Sea is our <hi>viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> a place for fish to feed us, and to serve some other collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appendant needs; and all the face of heaven is a repository for influences and breath, fruitfull showers and fair refreshments; and when God made provisions for his other creatures, he gave it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of one kinde, and with variety no greater, then the changes of day and night, one devouring the other, or sitting down with his draught of blood, or walking upon his portion of grasse: But man hath all the food of beasts, and all the beasts themselves that are fit for food; and <hi>the food of Angels, and the dew of heaven, and the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the earth;</hi> and every part of his body hath a provision made for it, and the smoothnesse of the olive, and the juice of the vine refresh the heart and make the face cheerfull, and serve the ends of joy, and the festivity of man, and are not onely to cure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or to allay thirst, but to appease a passion, and allay a sorrow. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> It is an infinite variety of meat with which God furnishes out the table of mankinde; and in the covering our sin, and clothing our nakednesse, God passed from sig-leaves to the skins of beasts, from aprons to long-robes, from leather to wool, and from thence to the warmth of furres, and the coolnesse of silks, he hath dressed not onely our needs, but hath fitted the severall portions of the year, and made us to go dressed like our mother; leaving off the winter sables when the florid spring appears, and assoon as the Tulip fades we put on the robe of Summer, and then shear our sheep for Winter; and God uses us as Ioseph did his brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have many changes of raiment, and our messe is five times bigger then the provision made for our brothers of the Creation. But the providence and mercies of God are to be estimated also according as these provisions are dispensed to every single person. For that I may not remark the bounties of God, running over the tables of the rich, God hath also made provisions for the poorest person: so that if they can but rule their desires they shall have their tables furnished; and this is secured and provided for by one promise and two duties, by our <hi>Own labour,</hi> and <hi>our Brothers charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and our faith in this affair is confirmed by all our own, and by all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> experience of other men. Are not all the men and the women of the world provided for, and fed and clothed till they die? and was it not alwayes so from the first morning of the creatures? and that a man is starved to death, is a violence and a rare contingency, happening almost as seldom as for a man to have but one eye:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50231:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and if our being provided for be as certain as for a man to have two eyes, we have reason to adore the wisdom, and admire the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our Almighty Father. But these things are evident. Is it not a great thing that God hath made such strange provisions for our health? such infinite differences of Plants, and hath discovered the secrets of their nature by meer chance, or by inspiration? either of which is the miracle of providence, secret to us, but ordered by certain and regular decrees of heaven. It was a huge diligence and care of the divine mercy that discovered to man, the secrets of Spagyrick medicines, of stones, of spirits, and the results of 7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or 8. decoctions, and the strange effects of accidental mixtures, which the art of man could not suspect, being bound up in the secret san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of hidden causes, and secret natures, and being laid open by the concourse of 20. or 30. little accidents, all which were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, as certainly as are the first principles of nature, or the descent of sons from fathers in the most noble families.</p>
                  <p>But that which I shall observe in this whole affair is, that there are both for the provision of our tables, and the relief of our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, so many miracles of providence that they give plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration what relation we bear to heaven: and the poor man need <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not be troubled that he is to expect his daily portion after the Sun is up: for he hath found to this day he was not deceived, and then he may rejoyce because he sees by an effective probation that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a decree was made, every day to send him provisions of meat and drink; and that is a mighty mercy, when the circles of heaven are bowed down to wrap us in a bosome of care, and nourishment, and the wisdom of God is daily busied to serve his mercy, as his mercy serves our necessities. Does not God plant remedies there where the diseases are most popular, and every Countrey is best provided against its own evils? Is not the Rhubarb found where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Sun most corrupts the liver, and the Scabious by the shore of the Sea, that God might cure as soon as he wounds, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants may see their remedy against the leprosie, and the scurvy, before they feel their sicknesse? And then to this we may adde, Natures commons and open fields, the shores of rivers, and the strand of the Sea, the unconfined air, the wildernesse that hath no hedge, and that in these every man may hunt and fowl and fish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively; and that God sends some miracles and extraordinary blessings so for the publike good, that he will not endure they should be inclosed and made severall: Thus he is pleased to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the <hi>Manna of Calabria,</hi> the medicinall waters of Germany, the Musles at <hi>Sluce</hi> at this day, and the Egyptian beans in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes of Albania, and the salt at Troas of old; which God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the covetousnesse of man, and to spread his mercy over the face of the indigent, as the Sun scatters his beams over the bosome of the whole earth, did so order that as long as every man was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50231:345" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to partake, the bosome of heaven was open; but when man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> gathered them into single handfulls, and made them impropriate, God gathered his hand into his bosome, and bound the heavens with ribs of brasse, and the earth with decrees of iron, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing reverted to him that gave it, since they might not receive it, to whom it was sent. And in general, this is the excellency of this mercy, that all our needs are certainly supplied, and secured by a promise which God cannot break, but he that cannot breake the lawes of his own promises, can break the lawes of nature, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> may perform his promise, and he will do a miracle rather then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee in thy needs: So that our security and the relative mercy, is bound upon us by all the power and the truth of God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But because such is the bounty of God, that he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a better life for the inheritance of man, if God is so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in making fair provisions for our lesse noble part, in order to the transition toward our Countrey, we may expect that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God hath rare arts to secure to us his designed bounty, in order to our inheritance, to that which ought to be our portion for ever. And here I consider, that it is an infinite mercy of the Almighty Father of mercies that he hath appointed to us such a religion that leads us to a huge felicity, through pleasant wayes. For the felicity that is designed to us is so above our present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and conceptions, that while we are so ignorant as not to understand it, we are also so foolish as not to desire it with passions great enough to perform the little conditions of its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase; God therefore knowing how great an interest it is, and how apt we would be to neglect it, hath found out such conditions of acquiring it which are eases and satisfaction to our present appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. God hath bound our salvation upon us by the endearment of temporall prosperities; and because we love this world so well, God hath so ordered it, that even this world may secure the other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And of this, God in old time made open profession, for when he had secretly designed to bring his people to a glorious immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in another world, he told them nothing of that, it being a thing bigger then the capacity of their thoughts, or of their Theology, but told them that which would tempt them most, and endear obedience: <hi>If you will obey, ye shall eat the good things of the land:</hi> Ye shall possesse a rich countrey, ye shall triumph over your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ye shall have numerous families, blessed children, rich gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, over-running wine-presses; for God knew the cognation of most of them was so dear, between their affections and the good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> things of this world, that if they did not obey in hope of that they did need, and fancy, and love, and see, and feel, it was not to be expected they should quit their affections for a secret in another world, whither before they come they must die, and lose all desire and all capacities of enjoyment. But this designe of God which

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was bare-faced in the dayes of the law, is now in the Gospel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven secretly (but yet plain enough to be discovered by an eye of faith and reason) into every vertue, and temporal advantage is a great ingredient in the constitution of every Christian grace for so the richest tissue dazles the beholders eye when the Sun reflects upon the mettal, the silver and the gold weaved into phantastic imagery, or a wealthy plainnesse, but the rich wire and shining fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are wrought upon cheaper silk, the spoil of worms and flies: so is the imbroidery of our vertue; the glories of the spirit dwell upon the face and vestment, upon the fringes and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> borders; and there we see the Beril and the Onyx, the Jasper and the sardyx, order and perfection love and peace and joy, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the passions and ravishment of the will, adherencies to God and imitation of Christ, reception and entertainment of the Holy Ghost and longings after heaven, humility, and chastity, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and sobriety; these make the frame of the garment, the cloaths of the soul that it may not be found naked in the day of the Lords visitation; but through these rich materials a thrid of silk is drawn, some compliance with worms and weaker creatures, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that shall please our bowels, and make the lower man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: they are wrought upon secular content, and material sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, and now we cannot be happy unlesse we be pious, and the religion of a Christian is the greatest security and the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain instrument of making a man <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>pleased,</hi> and <hi>healthful</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi> in the whole world. I shall now remark onely two or three instances; for the main body of this truth I have other <note place="margin">Life of H. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. part 3. Disc. 14.</note> where represented.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The whole religion of a Christian as it relates to others is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but justice and mercy, certain parents of peace and benefit: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and upon this supposition what evil can come to a just and a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a necessary and useful person? For the first permission of evil was upon the stock of injustice: He that kills may be killed, and he that does injury may be mischieved; he that invades ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans right, must venture the losse of his own; and when I put my Brother to his defence he may chance drive the evil so far from himself, that it may reach me; Laws and Judges, private &amp; publick judicatures, wars and tribunals axes and wheels were made, not for the righteous, but for the unjust; and all that whole order of things and persons would be uselesse, if men did do as they would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> willingly suffer. 2. And because there is no evil that can befal a just man unlesse it comes by <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> our religion hath also made as good provisions against that too, as the nature of the thing will suffer; for by patience we are reconciled to the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and by hope and faith we see a certain consequent reward; and by praying for the persecuting man we are cured of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of the minde, the envy and the fretfulnesse that uses to gall the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50231:346"/>
troubled and resisting man; and when we turn all the passion into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> charity, and God turns all the suffering into reward, there remains nothing that is very formidable. So that our religion obliges us to such duties which prevent all evils that happen justly to men, (and in our religion no man can suffer as a malefactor, if he follows the religion truely) and for the evils that are unavoidable and come by violence, the graces of this discipline turne them into vertues and rewards, and make them that in their event they are desirable and in the suffering they are very tolerable. 3. But then when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the religion of a Christian consists in doing good to all men, that it is made up of mercies and friendships, of friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and assemblies of Saints, that all are to <hi>do good works for necessary uses,</hi> that is to be able to be beneficial to the publick and not to be burthensome to any, where it can be avoided, what can be wished to man in relation to others, and what can be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to themselves then that they be such whom other men will value for their interest, such whom the publick does need, such whom Princes and Nobles ought to esteem, and all men can make use of according to their several conditions; that they are so well provided for that unlesse a persecution disables them they cannot onely maintain themselves, but oblige others to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> charity.</p>
                  <p>This is a temporal good which all wise men reckon as part of that felicity which recompences all the labours of their day, and sweetens the sleep of their night, and places them in that circle of neigbour-hood and amity where men are most valued and most secure. 4. To this we may adde this material consideration. That al those graces which oblige us to do good to others are nothing else but certain instruments of doing advantage to our selves. It is a huge noblenesse of charity to give alms not onely to our Brother, but for him, It is the Christian sacrifice, like that of Job who made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> oblations for his sons when they feasted each other, fearing lest they had sinned against God; and if I give almes and fast and pray in behalf of my prince, or my Patron, my friend or my children, I do a combination of holy actions, which are of all things that I can do, the most effectual intercession for him, whom I so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend; but then observe the art of this, and what a plot is laid by the divine mercy to secure blessing to to our selves. That I am a person fit to intercede and pray for him must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose me a gracious person, one whom God rather will accept; so that before I be fit to pray and interpose for him; I must first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dear to God, and my charity can do him no good, for whose interest I gave it, but by making me first acceptable to God, that so he may the rather hear me; and when I fast, it is first an act of repentance for my self before it can be an instrument of impetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him. And thus I do my Brother a single benefit, by doing my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50231:346"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a double one, and it is also so ordered that when I pray for a person for whom God will not hear me, yet then he will hear me for my self though I say nothing in my own behalf, and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are like Jonathans arrows, if they fall short, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my friend or my friendship to me; or if they go home, they secure him whom they pray for, and I have not onely the comfort of rejoycing with him but the honour and the reward of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a joy; and certain it is that a charitable prayer for another, can never want what it asks, or instead of it, a greater blessing. The good man that saw his poor brother troubled because he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had nothing to present for an offering at the Holy communion (when all knew themselves obliged to do kindnesse for Christs poor members with which themselves were incorporated with so mysterious union) and gave him mony that he might present for the good of his soul as other Christians did, had not onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of almes but of religion too; and that offering was well hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, for it did benefit to two souls; for as I sin when I make another sin: so if I help him to do a good, I am a sharer in the gains of his talent, and he shall not have the lesse but I shall be rewarded upon his stock. And this was it which David rejoyced in, <hi>Particeps</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>sum omnium timentium te; I am a partner, a companion of all them that fear thee,</hi> I share in their profits. If I do but rejoyce at every grace of God which I see in my Brother, I shall be rewarded for that grace; and we need not envy the excellency of another; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes mine as well as his: and if I do rejoyce, I shall have cause to rejoyce so excellent, so full, so artificial is the mercy of God in making and seeking and finding all occasions to do us good. 5. The very charity and love and mercy that is commanded in our religion is in it self a great excellency, not onely in order to heaven, but to the comforts of the earth too &amp; such without which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a man is not capable of a blessing or a comfort; &amp; he that sent charity and friendships into the world, intended charity to be as relative as justice, &amp; to do its effect both upon the loving and the beloved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. It is a reward and a blessing to a kinde Father, when his children do well, and every degree of prudent love which he bears to them is an endearment of his joy; and he that loves them not, but looks upon them as burdens of necessity, and loads to his fortune, loses those many rejoycings and the pleasures of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which they feast withal who love to divide their fortunes, amongst them, because they have already divided out large and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> equal portions of their heart. I have instanced in this relation; but it is true in all the excellency of friendship; and every man rejoyces twice when he hath a partner of his joy; A friend shares my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and makes it but a moiety; but he swells my joy and makes it double. For so two chanels divide the river and lessen it into rivulets, and make it foordable and apt to be drunk up at the first
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50231:347"/>
revels of the Sirian star; but two torches do not divide but increase <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the flame; and though my tears are the sooner dryed up, when they run upon my friends cheeks in the furrows of compassion, yet when my flame hath kindled his lamp, we unite the glories and make them radiant like the golden Candle-sticks that burn before the throne of God, because they shine by numbers, by unions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations of light and joy.</p>
                  <p>And now upon this account which is already so great I need not reckon concerning the collateral issues, and little streams of comfort which God hath made to issue from that religion to which God hath obliged us; such as are <hi>mutual comforts, visiting sick people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and after all this, the very anguish and trouble of being defeated in the purpose hath rolled it self into so much uneasinesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet reflections, that the man is grown a shamed and vexed into more sober counsels.</p>
                  <p>And the mercy of God is not lesse then infinite in separating men from the occasions of their sin, from the neighbour-hood and temptation; for if the <hi>Hyaena</hi> and a dog should be thrust into the

same Kennel, one of them would soon finde a grave, and it may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be both of them their death; so infallible is the ruine of most men, if they be shewed a temptation: Nitre and resin, Naphtha and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen, sulphur and pitch are their constitution, and the fire passes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them infinitely, and there is none to rescue them. But God by removing our sins far from us, <hi>as far as the East is from the West</hi> not onely putting away the guilt, but setting the occasion far from us, extremely far; so far that sometimes we <hi>cannot sin</hi> and many times, <hi>not easily,</hi> hath magnified his mercy, by giving us safety in all those measures in which we are untempted. It would be the matter of new discourses, if I should consider concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Gods grace, his preventing and accompanying, his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and corroborating grace; his assisting us to will, his enabling us to do, his sending Angels to watch us, to remove us from evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to drive us with swords of fire from forbidden instances, to carry us by unobserved opportunities into holy company, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister occasions of holy discourses, to make it by some means or other necessary to do a holy action, to make us in love with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, because they have mingled that vertue with a just and a fair interest, to some men by making religion that thing they live upon, to others, the means of their reputation, and the securities of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> honour, and thousands of wayes more, which every prudent man that watches the wayes of God cannot but have observed. But I must also observe other great conjugations of mercy, for he that is to passe through an infinite must not dwell upon everie little line of life.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The next order of mercies is such, which is of so pure, and unmingled constitution, that it hath at first no regard to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and disposition of the receivers, and afterwards when it hath, it relates onely to such conditions, which it self creates and produces in the suscipient, I mean the mercies of the <hi>divine predestination.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For was it not an infinite mercy that God should predestinate all mankinde to salvation by Jesus Christ, even when he had no other reason to move him to do it but because man was miserable and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his pity? But I shall instance onely in the intermediall part of this mysterious mercy. Why should God cause us to be born of Christian parents, and not to be circumcised by the impure hands of a Turkish Priest? What distinguished me from another, that my Father was severe in his discipline and carefull to <hi>bring me up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> and I was not exposed to the carelesnesse of an irreligious guardian, and taught to steal, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and lie, and to make sport with my infant vices, and beginnings of iniquity? Who was it that discerned our persons from the lot of dying Chrysomes, whose portion must be among those who never glorified God with a free obedience? What had you done of good, or towards it, that you was not condemned to the stupid ignorance
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50231:348"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which makes the souls of most men but a little higher then beasts, and who understand nothing of religion and noble principles, of parables and wise sayings of old men. And not onely in our cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, but in our schools, and in our colledges, in our friendships, and in our marriages, in our enmities, and in all our conversation, in our vertues and in our vices, where all things in us were equal, or else we were the inferiour, there is none of us but have felt the mercies of many differencies. Or it may be my brother and I were intemperate, and drunk, and quarelsome, and he kill'd a man, but God did not suffer me to do so: He fell down and died with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> little disorder, I was a beast and yet was permitted to live, and not yet to die in my sins: He did a misse once and was surprized in that disadvantage: I sin daily and am still invited to repentance; he would fain have lived and amended; I neglect the grace, but am allowed the time. And when God sends the Angel of his wrath to execute his anger upon a sinfull people we are encompassed with funerals, and yet the Angel hath not smitten us: what or who makes the difference? We shall then see, when in the separations of eternity, <hi>we sitting in glory,</hi> shall see some of the partners of our sins carried into despair and the portions of the left hand, and roaring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the seats of the reprobate; we shall then perceive that it is even that mercy which hath no cause but it self, no measure of its emanation but our misery, no natural limit but eternity, no beginning but God, no object but man, no reason but an essential and an unalterable goodnesse, no variety but our necessity and capacity, no change but new instances of its own nature, no ending or repentance, but our absolute and obstinate refusall to entertain it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Lastly, All the mercies of God are concentred in that which is all the felicity of man; and God is so great a lover of souls that he provides securities and fair conditions for them, even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> against all our reason and hopes, our expectations, and weak dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings. The particulars I shall remark are these. 1. Gods mercy prevails over the malice and ignorances, the weaknesses and follies of men, so that in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the convention and assemblies of hereticks (as the word is usually understood for erring and mistaken people) although their doctrines are such that if men should live according to their proper and naturall consequences, they would live impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, yet in every one of these there are persons so innocently and invincibly mistaken, and who mean nothing but truth, while in the simplicity of their heart they talk nothing but error, that in the defiance and contradiction of their own doctrines, they live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its contradictory. He that beleeves contrition alone with confession to a Priest, is enough to expiate ten thousand sins, is furnished with an excuse easie enough to quit himself from the troubles of a holy life; and he that hath a great many cheap wayes of buying off his penances for a little money, even for the greatest
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50231:349"/>
sins, is taught a way not to fear the doing of an act, for which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> must repent; since repentance is a duty so <hi>soon,</hi> fo <hi>certainly,</hi> and so <hi>easily</hi> performed: But these are notorious doctrines in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and yet God so loves the souls of his creatures that many men who trust to these doctrines in their discourses, dare not rely upon them in their lives. But while they talk as if they did not need to live strictly, many of them live so strictly as if they did not beleeve so foolishly. He that tels, that antecedently God hath to all humane choice decreed man to heaven or to hell, takes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> away from man all care of the way, because they beleeve that he that infallibly decreed that end, hath unalterably appointed the means, and some men that talk thus wildly live soberly, and are over-wrought in their understanding by some secret art of God, that man may not perish in his ignorance, but be assisted in his choice, and saved by the Divine mercies. And there is no sect of men but are furnished with antidotes and little excuses to cure the venom of their doctrine; and therefore although the adherent and constituent poison is notorious and therefore to be declined, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is collaterally cured and over-poured by the torrent and wisdom of Gods mercies, the men are to be taken into the Quire that we may all joyn in giving of God praise for the operation of his hands. 2. I said formerly that there are many secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mercies by which men live, and of which men can give no account till they come to give God thanks at their publication; and of this sort, is that mercy which God reserves for the souls of many millions of men and women concerning whom we have no hopes, if we account concerning them by the usuall proportions of revelation and Christian commandements, and yet we are taught to hope some strange good things concerning them by the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and generall rules of the Divine mercy. For what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ignorant Christians, people that live in wildnesses and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> places more desert then a primitive hermitage, people that are baptized, and taught to go to Church, it may be once a yeer, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that can get no more knowledge, they know not where to have it, nor how to desire it; and yet that an eternity of pains shall be consequent to such an ignorance is unlike the mercy of God, and yet that they should be in any dispositions towards an eternity of intellectuall joyes is no where set down in the leaves of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and when the Jews grew rebellious, or a silly woman of the daughters of Abraham was tempted, and sinned, and punished with death, we usually talk as if that death passed on to a worse; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but yet we may arrest our thoughts upon the Divine mercies, and consider that it is reasonable to expect from the Divine goodnesse, that no greater forfeiture be taken upon a law, then was expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in its sanction and publication. He that makes a law and bindes it with the penalty of stripes, we say he intends not to afflict the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:50231:349"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with scorpions and axes; and it had been hugely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that God had scar'd the Jews from their sins by threatning the pains of hell to them that disobeyed, if he intended to inflict it; for although many men would have ventured the future, since they are not affrighted with the present and visible evil, yet some persons would have had more Philosophical and spiritual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions then others, and have been infallibly cured in all their temptations with the fear of an eternall pain; and however, whether they had or no, yet since it cannot be understood how it consists with the Divine justice to exact a pain bigger then he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> threatned, greater then he gave warning of so we are sure it is a great way off from Gods mercy to do so. He that usually impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lesse, and is loth to inflict any and very often forgives it all, is hugely distant from exacting an eternall punishment, when the most that he threatned and gave notice of, was but a temporall. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this consideration I would have to be this, that we may pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely worship this mercy of God which is kept in secret and that we be not too forward in sentencing all Heathens, and prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Jews to the eternall pains of hell, but hope that they have a portion in the secrets of the Divine mercy, where also unlesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of us have some little portions deposited, our condition will be very uncertain, and sometimes most miserable. God knows best how intolerably accursed a thing it is to perish in the eternall flames of hell, and therefore he is not easie to inflict it: and if the joyes of heaven be too great to be expected upon too easie termes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the pains of the damned are infinitely too big to passe lightly upon persons who cannot help themselves, and who if they were helped with clearer revelations would have avoided it: But as in these things we must not pry into the secrets of the Divine Oeconomy, being sure whether it be so or no, it is most just, even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as it is; so we may expect to see the glories of the Divine mercy made publike in unexpected instances at the great day of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station: And indeed our dead many times go forth from our hands very strangely and carelesly, without prayers, without Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without consideration, without counsel, and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and to dresse the souls of our dear people to so sad a parting is an imployment, we therefore omit, not alwayes because we are negligent, but because the work is sad and allay the affections of the world, with those melancholy circumstances; but if God did not in his mercies make secret and equivalent provisions for them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and take care of his redeemed ones we might unhappily meet them in a sad eternity, and without remedy weep together and groan for ever. But <hi>God hath provided better things for them, that they without us,</hi> that is, without our assistances, <hi>shall be made perfect.</hi>

                  <p>THere are <hi>very many more</hi> orders and conjugations of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but because the numbers of them naturally tend to their own greatnesse, that is, to have no measure, I must reckon but <hi>a few more,</hi> and them also without order; for that they do descend upon us, we see and feel, but by what order of things, or causes, is as undiscerned as the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or a sudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a long neglected and forgotten proposition. 1. But upon this account it is, that good men have observed, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is so great a provider for holy living, and does so certainly minister to religion, that nature and chance, the order of the world, and the influences of heaven are taught to serve the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ends of <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>the spirit of a man.</hi> I do not speak of the miracles that God hath in the severall periods of the world wrought for the establishing his lawes, and confirming his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and securing our obedience; though that was all the way the overflowings and miracles of <hi>mercy</hi> as well as <hi>power:</hi> but that which I consider is, that besides the extraordinary emanations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power upon the first and most solemn occasions of an instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the first beginnings of a religion, such as were, the wonders God did in Egypt and in the wildernesse, preparatory to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that law, and <hi>the first covenant;</hi> and the miracles wrought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by Christ and his Apostles, for the founding and the building up the religion of the Gospel, and <hi>the new covenant:</hi> God does also do things wonderfull and miraculous, for the promoting the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and lesse solemn actions of our piety, and to assist and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them in a constant and regular succession. It was a strange

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> variety of naturall efficacies, that Manna should stink in 24. hours if gathered upon Wednesday and Thursday, and that it should last till 48. hours if gathered upon the Even of the Sabbath; and that it should last many hundreds of yeers when placed in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary by the ministery of the high Priest; but so it was in the Jews religion; and Manna pleased every palate, and it filled all appetites, and the same measure was a different proportion; it was much and it was little; as if nature, that it might serve religion, had been taught some measures of infinity, which is every where and no where, filling all things, and circumscribed with nothing, measured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by one Omer, and doing the work of two; like the crowns of Kings, fitting the browes of Nimrod and the most mighty Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and yet not too large for the temples of an infant Prince. And not onely is it thus in nature, but in contingencies and acts depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon the choice of men; for God having commanded the sons of Israel to go up to Jerusalem to worship thrice every yeer, and to leave their borders to be guarded by women, and children and sick persons, in the neighbourhood of diligent and spitefull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet God so disposed of their hearts and opportunities, that they never entered the land when the people were at their solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> untill they desecrated their rites, by doing at their Passeover the greatest sin and treason in the world; till at Easter they crucified the Lord of life and glory, they were secure in Jerusalem and in their borders; but when they had destroyed religion by this act, God took away their security, and Titus besieged the City at the feast of Easter, that the more might perish in the deluge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine indignation.</p>
                  <p>To this observation the Jews adde, that in Jerusalem no man ever had a fall that came thither to worship; that at their solemn festivals there was reception in the Town for all the inhabitants of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the land; concerning which although I cannot affirm any thing, yet this is certain, that no godly person among all the tribes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael was ever <hi>a begger,</hi> but all the variety of humane chances, were over-ruled to the purposes of providence, and providence was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the ends of the religion, and the religion which promised them plenty, performed the promise till the Nation and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion too began to decline, that it might give place to a better ministery, and a more excellent dispensation of the things of the world.</p>
                  <p>But when Christian religion was <hi>planted and had taken root, and</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

and choice, are forced into subjection and lowest ministeries, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cooperate as with an united designe to verifie all the promises of the Gospel, and to secure and advantage all the children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and now he that is made poor by chance, or persecution, is made rich by religion, and he that hath nothing, yet possesses all things, and sorrow it self is the greatest comfort, not only because it ministers to vertue, but because <hi>it self is one,</hi> as in the case of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and <hi>death</hi> ministers to <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi> is <hi>freedom,</hi> and <hi>losse is gain,</hi> and our <hi>enemies</hi> are our <hi>friends,</hi> and every thing turns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into religion, and religion turns into felicity, and all manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. But that I may not need to enumerate any more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in this observation certain it is that Angels of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, all the influences of heaven, and the fruits and productions of the earth, the stars, and the elements, the secret things that lie in the bowels of the Sea, and the entrails of the earth, the single ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of all efficients, and the conjunction of all causes, all events foreseen, and all rare contingencies, every thing of chance, and every thing of choice, is so much a servant to him whose greatest desire, and great interest, is by all means to save our souls, that we are thereby made sure, that all the whole creation shall be made to bend in all the flexures of its nature and accidents, that it may minister to religion, to the good of the Catholike Church, and every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> person within its bosom, who are the body of him that rules over all the world, and commands them as he chooses.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which is next to this, and not much unlike the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of this wonderfull mercy, is, that all the actions of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though mingled with circumstances of differing and sometimes of contradictory relations are so concentred in God their proper centre, and conducted in such certain and pure channels of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>rule,</hi> that no one duty does contradict another; and it can never be necessary for any man in any case to sin. They that bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by an oath to kill Paul were not environed with the sad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of murder on one side, and vow-breach on the other, so that if they did murder him they were man-slayers, if they did not they were perjured; for God had made provision for this case, that no unlawful oath should passe an obligation. He that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his faith in unlawfull confederation against his Prince, is not girded with a fatall necessity of breach of trust on one side, or breach of allegeance on the other; for in this also God hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the case of conscience, by forbidding any man to make an unlawfull promise, and upon a stronger degree of the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by forbidding him to keep it in case he hath made it. He that doubts whether it be lawfull to keep the Sunday holy, must not do it during that doubt, because <hi>whatsoever is not of faith is sin;</hi> But yet Gods mercy hath taken care to break this snare in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so that he may neither sin against the commandement, nor
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:50231:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>

It is a huge affront to a covetous man that he is the further off from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fulnesse by having great heaps &amp; vast revenues; and that his thirst increases by having that which should quench it; and that the more he shall need to be satisfied, the lesse he shall dare to do it; and that he shall refuse to drink because he is dry; that he dyes if he tasts, and languishes if he does not; and at the same time he is full and empty, bursting with a plethory, and consumed with hunger, drowned with rivers of oyle and wine and yet dry as the Arabian sands; but then the contradiction is multiplyed and the labyrinths more amazed, when prodigality waits, upon another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> curse, and covetousnesse heaps up, that prodigality may scatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; then distractions are infinite, and a man hath two Devils to serve of contradictory designes and both of them exacting obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more unreasonably then the Egyptian task-masters then there is no rest, no end of labours, no satisfaction of purposes, no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of things, but they begin where they should end, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again, and never passe forth to content or reason, or quietnesse, or possession. But the duty of a Christian is easie in a persecution, it is clear under a Tyranny, it is evident in despite of heresy, it is one in the midst of schisme, it is determined amongst infinite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> disputes, being like a rock in the sea which is beaten with the tide and washed with retiring waters, and encompassed with mists, and appears in several figures, but it alwayes dips its foot in the same bottom and remaines the same in calms and storms, and survives the revolution of ten thousand tides, and there shall dwell till time and tides shall be no more: so is our duty, uniform and constant, open and notorious, variously represented, but in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner exacted; and in the interest of our souls God hath not exposed us to uncertainty or the variety of anything that can change, and it is by the grace and mercy of God put into the power of every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Christian to do that which God through Jesus Christ will accept to salvation; and neither men nor Devils shall hinder it unlesse we list our selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After all this we may sit down and reckon by great sums and conjugations of his gracious gifts, and tell the minuts of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the number of the Divine mercies: God hath given <hi>his laws</hi> to rule us, <hi>his word</hi> to instruct us, <hi>his spirit</hi> to guide us, <hi>his</hi>

                     <hi>for asking,</hi> and commands us to ask, and theatens us if we will not ask, and punishes us for refusing to be happy.

His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is his glory, and his glory is the light of heaven; his mercy is the life of the creation and it fills all the earth, and his mercy is a sea too; and it fills all the abysses of the deep; it hath given us
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:50231:352"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promises for supply of whatsoever we need and relieves us in all our fears, and in all the evils that we suffer; his mercies are more then we can tell, and they are more then we can feel; for all the world in the abysse of the Divine mercies is like a man diving into the bottom of the sea, over whose head the waters run insensibly, and unperceived, and yet the weight is vast and the sum of them is unmeasurable, and the man is not pressed with the burden, nor confounded with numbers; and no observation is able to recount, no sense sufficient to perceive, no memory large enough to retain, no understanding great enough to apprehend this infinity, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we must <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>magnify</hi> this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for ever and ever; that we we may dwell in what we feel, and be comprehended by that which is equal to God, and the parent of all felicity.</p>
                  <p>And yet this is but the one half. The mercies of <hi>giving</hi> I have now told of, but those of forgiving are greater, though not more. <hi>[He is ready to forgive]</hi> and upon this stock thrives the interest of our great hope, the hopes of a blessed immortality; for if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of giving have not made our expectations big enough to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the confidences of heaven; yet when we think of the gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and readinesse of <hi>forgiving,</hi> we may with more readinesse hope to escape hell, and then we cannot <hi>but</hi> be blessed by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal consequence: we have but small opinion of the Divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if we dare not believe concerning it, that it is <hi>desirous</hi> and <hi>able</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> and <hi>passionate</hi> to keep us or rescue us respectively from such a condemnation <hi>the pain</hi> of which is insupportable, and <hi>the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is eternal, and <hi>the extension</hi> is misery upon all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and the intension is great beyond patience or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or supernatural abilities, and <hi>the state</hi> is a state of darknesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and despair, of confusion and amazement, of cursing and roaring, anguish of spirit, and gnashing of teeth, misery universal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and irremediable. From this it is which Gods mercies would so fain preserve us: This is a state that God provides for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not for them that love him, that endeavour to obey though they do it but in weaknesse, that weep truely for their sins though but with a shower no bigger then the drops of pitty, that wait for his coming with a holy and pure flame, though their lamps are no brighter then a poor mans candle, though their strengths are no greater then a contrite reed or a strained arme, and their fires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have no more warmth then the smok of kindling flax; if our <hi>faith be pure</hi> and <hi>our love unfained,</hi> if the degree of it be great God will accept it into glory: if it be little he will accept it into grace, and make it bigger. For that is the first instance of Gods readinesse to forgive: he will upon any termes, that are not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and that do not suppose a remanent affection to sin keep us from the intolerable paines of hell. And indeed if we consider the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50231:353"/>
constitution of the conditions which God requires, we shall soon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> perceive God intends heaven to us as a meer gift, and that the duties on our part are but little entertainments and exercises of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and our love that the Devil might not seize upon that portion which to eternal ages shall be the instrument of our happinesse. For in all the parts of our duty it may be there is but one instance in which we are to do violence to our natural and first desires. For those men have very ill natures to whom vertue is so contrary that they are inclined naturally to <hi>lust,</hi> to <hi>drunkennesse</hi> and <hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>unthankefulnesse</hi> and <hi>disobedience:</hi> Most men that are tempted with lust, could easily enough entertain the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sobrieties of other counsels, as of temperance, and justice, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if it would indulge to them but that one passion of lust, &amp; persons that are greedy of mony are not fond of amorous vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties nor care they to sit long at the wine and one vice destroyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and when one vice is consequent to another, it is by way of punishment and dereliction of the man, unlesse where vices have cognation, and seem but like several degrees of one another; and it is evil custome and superinduced habits that make artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all appetites in most men to most sins; But many times their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temper vexes them into uneasie dispositions and aptnesses one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to some one unhandsome sort of action; that one thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it in which God demands of thee <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certain it is; There are very many men in the world that would fain commute their severity in al other instances for a licence in their one appetite; they would not refuse long prayers after a drunken meeting, or <hi>great almes</hi> to gether with one great <hi>lust;</hi> but then consider how easie it is for them to go to heaven; God demands of them for his sake &amp; their own to crucifie but one natural lust, or one evil habit, (for all the rest they are easie enough to do themselves) &amp; God will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> give them heaven, where the joy is more then one, and I said it is but one mortification God requires of most men; for if those persons would extirp but that one thing in which they are principally tempted it is not easily imaginable that any lesse evill to which the temptation is trifling should interpose between them and their great interest. If Saul had not spared Agag, the people could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected mercy; and our little and inferiour appetites that rather come to us by intimation and consequent adherences, then by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect violence, must not dwell with him who hath crossed the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his distempered nature in a beloved instance; since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therefore this is the state of most men and God in effect demands of them but one thing, and in exchange for that will give them all good things, it gives demonstration of his huge easinesse to redeem us from that intolerable evil that is equally consequent to the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to one or to twenty sinful habits.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 2. Gods readinesse to pardon appears in this, that he pardons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ask, for he that bids us ask for pardon hath in designe and purpose done the thing already: for what is wanting on his <note place="margin">2.</note> part <hi>in whose onely power</hi> it is to give pardon, and <hi>in whose desire</hi> it is that we should be pardoned, and <hi>who commands</hi> us to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offer; he hath done all that belongs to God; that is all that concerns the pardon: there it lies ready, it is recorded in the book of life, it wants nothing, but being exemplified and taken forth, and the Holy spirit stands ready to consigne and passe the privy sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that we may exhibit it to devils and evil men when they tempt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> us to despair or sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay God is so ready in his mercy that he did pardon us even <note place="margin">3.</note> before he redeemed us: for what is the secret of the mysterie, that the eternal Son of God should take upon him our nature, and die our death and suffer for our sins and do our work, and enable us to do our own? he that did this is God: he who <hi>thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God:</hi> he came to satisfie himself, to pay to himself the price for his own creature: and when he did this for us that he might pardon us, was he at that instant angry with us? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was this an effect of his anger or of his love that God sent his Son to work our pardon and salvation? Indeed we were angry with God, at enmity with the the Prince of life: but he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us so far, as that he then did the greatest thing in the world for us: for nothing could be greater then that <hi>God, the Son of God,</hi> should die for us: here was reconciliation before pardon: and God that came to die for us did love us first before he came: this was hasty love. But it went further yet.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God pardoned us before we sinned; and when he foresaw our <note place="margin">4.</note> sin, even mine and yours, he sent his son to die for us; our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was wrought and effected by Christs death above 1600. years ago; and for the sins of to morrow, and the infirmities of the next day Christ is already dead, already risen from the dead, and does now make intercession and atonement. And this is not onely a favour to us who were born in the due time of the Gospel, but to all mankinde since Adam; For God who is infinitely patient in his justice, was not at all patient in his mercy; he forbears to strike and punish us, but he would not forbear to provide cure for us, and remedy; for as if God could not stay from redeeming us, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the <hi>Redeemer</hi> to Adam, in the beginning of the worlds sin; &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Christ was <hi>the lamb slain from the begining of the world;</hi> and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Gospel though it was not made with man yet it was from the beginning performed by God as to his part, as to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of pardon; The seed of the woman was set up against the dragon as soon as ever the Tempter had won his first battle; and though God laid his hand, and drew a vail of types and secresy before the manifestation of his mercies, yet he did the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50231:354"/>
and saved us by the covenant of faith, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of believing, and the mercies of repentance, the graces of pardon, and the blood of the slain lamb, even from the fall of Adam to this very day, and will do, till Christs second coming.</p>
                  <p>Adam fell by his folly and did not perform <hi>the covenant of one little work,</hi> a work of a single abstinence; but he was restored by faith in the seed of the woman; and of this righteousnesse Noah was a preacher; and <hi>by faith</hi> Enoch was traslated, and <hi>by faith</hi> a remnant was saved at the flood: and to Abraham <hi>this was imputed for righteousnesse</hi> and to all the Patriarks, and to al the righteous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> judges, and holy Prophets, and Saints of the old Testament, even while they were obliged (so far as the words of their covenant were expressed) to the law of works, their pardon was sealed &amp; kept with in the vail within the curtains of the sanctuary, and they saw it not then, but they feel it ever since; and this was a great excellency of the Divine mercy unto them: God had mercy on all mankinde before Christs manifestation, even beyond the mercies of their covenant: &amp; they were saved as we are, by <hi>the seed of the woman</hi> by <hi>God incarnate</hi> by <hi>the lamb slain from the beginning of the world;</hi> not by works, for we all failed of them; that is, not by an exact obedience, but <hi>by</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>faith working by love,</hi> by sincere, hearty endeavours &amp; believing God and relying upon his infinite mercy, revealed in part, and now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifest by the great instrument and means of that mercy <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> So that here is pardon before we asked it; pardon before Christs coming, pardon before redemption; and pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we sinned: what greater readinesse to forgive us can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? yes: there is one degree more yet; and that will prevent a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For God so pardoned us once, that we should need no <note place="margin">5.</note> more pardon; he pardons us <hi>by turning every one of us away</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>from our iniquities;</hi> thats the purpose of Christ, that he might safely pardon us before we sinned; and we might not sin upon the confidence of pardon, he pardoned us not onely upon condition we would sin no more, but he took away our sin, cured our cursed inclinations, instructed our understanding, rectified our will, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us against temptations, and now every man whom he pardons he also sanctifies, and <hi>he is born of God,</hi> and he <hi>must not, will not, cannot sin,</hi> so long as <hi>the seed of God remains within him,</hi> so long as his pardon continues. This is the consummation of pardon. For if God had so pardoned us, as onely to take away our evils which are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> past, we should have needed a second Saviour, and a redeemer for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very month, and new pardons perpetually. But our blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath taken away our sin not onely the guilt of our old, but our inclinations to new sins: he makes us like himself and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to live so, that we shall not need a second pardon, that is,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50231:354"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a second state of pardon: for we are but once baptized into Christs death, and that death was one, and our redemption but one, and our covenant the same, and as long as we continue within the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we are still within the power and comprehensions of the first pardon.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And yet there is a necessity of having one degree of pardon <note place="margin">6.</note> more beyond all this. For although we do not abjure our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and renounce Christ and extinguish the spirit, yet we resist him, and we grieve him: and we go off from the holinesse of the covenant, and return again, and very often step aside, and need <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this great pardon to be perpetually applyed and renewed: and to this purpose: that we may not have a possible need without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain remedy, the Holy Jesus, <hi>the Author, and finisher of our faith</hi> and pardon, sits in heaven in a perpetual advocation for us, that this pardon once wrought may be for ever applyed to every emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent need, and every tumor of pride, and every broken heart, and every disturbed conscience, and upon every true and sincere return of a hearty repentance: And now <hi>upon this title</hi> no more degrees can be added: it is already greater, and was before all our needs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and was greater then the old covenant, and beyond the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and did in Adams youth antidate the Gospel, turning the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miseries</hi> by <hi>secret grace,</hi> into <hi>eternall glories.</hi> But now upon other circumstances it is remarkable and excellent, and swels like an hydropick cloud when it is fed with the breath of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tide, till it fills the bosome of heaven, and descends in dews and gentle showers, to water and refresh the earth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. God is so ready to forgive that himself works our dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">7.</note> towards it, and either must in some degree pardon us before we are capable of pardon, by his grace making way for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or else we can never hope for pardon. For unlesse God by his preventing grace should first work the first part of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, even without any dispositions of our own to receive it, we could not desire a pardon, nor hope for it, nor work towards it, nor ask it, nor receive it; This giving of <hi>preventing grace,</hi> is a mercy of forgivenesse contrary to that severity by which some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate persons are given over to a reprobate sense; that is, a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of men to themselves, so that they cannot pray effectually, nor desire holily, nor repent truly, nor receive any of those mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which God designed so plenteously, and the Son of God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so dearly for us. When God sends a plague of warre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a land, in all the accounts of religion, and expectations of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the way to obtain our peace is to leave our sins, for which the warre was sent upon us, as the messenger of wrath: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, we are like to perish in the judgement. But then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a sad condition we are in, warre mends but few, but spoils multitudes; it legitimates rapine, and authorizes murder,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:50231:355"/>
and these crimes must be ministred to by their lesser relatives, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> covetousnesse, and anger, and pride, and revenge, and heats of blood, and wilder liberty, and all the evil that can be supposed to come from, or run to, such cursed causes of mischief. But then if the punishment increases the sin, by what instrument can the punishment be removed? How shall we be pardoned and eased, when our remedies are converted into causes of the sicknesse, and our antidotes are poison? Here there is a plain necessity of Gods <hi>preventing grace;</hi> and <hi>if there be but a necessity of it, that is enough to ascertain us we shall have it:</hi> But unlesse God should begin to pardon us first, for nothing, and against our own dispositions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we see there is no help in us, nor for us. If we be not smitten we are undone, if we are smitten we perish: and as young Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchus said of his Love, when he was made master of his wish; <hi>Salvus sum quia pereo, si non peream plane inteream,</hi> we may say of some of Gods judgements: We perish when we are safe, because our sins are not smitten, and if they be, then we are worse undone; because we grow worse for being miserable; but we can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved onely by a free mercy; for <hi>pardon is the way to pardon:</hi> and when God gives us our peny, then we can work for another, and a gift is the way to a grace, and all that we can do towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it, is but to take it in Gods method; and this must needs be a great forwardnesse of forgivenesse, when Gods mercy gives <hi>the pardon,</hi> and <hi>the way</hi> to finde it, and <hi>the hand</hi> to receive it, and <hi>the eye</hi> to search it, and <hi>the heart</hi> to desire it; being busie and effective as Elijah's fire, which intending to convert the sacrifice into its own more spirituall nature of flames and purified substances; stood in the neighbourhood of the fuell, and called forth all its enemies, and licked up the hindering moisture, and the water of the trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and made the Altar send forth a phantastick smoke before the sacrifice was enkindled: So is the preventing grace of God, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> does all the work of our souls, and makes its own way, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites it self, and prepares its own lodging, and makes its own entertainment, it gives us precepts and makes us able to keep them; it enables our faculties and excites our desires, it provokes us to pray, and sanctifies our heart in prayer, and makes our prayer go forth to act, and the act does make the desire valid, and the desire does make the act certain, and persevering; and both of them are the works of God: for more is received into the soul from without the soul, then does proceed from within the soul: It is more for the soul to be moved and disposed, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to work when that is done: as the passage from death to life is greater then from life to action, especially since the action is owing to that cause that put in the first principle of life.</p>
                  <p>These are the great degrees of Gods forwardnesse and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to forgive, for the expression of which no language is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50231:355"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but Gods own words describing mercy in all those dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which can signifie to us its greatnesse and infinity. His mercy <hi>is great,</hi> his mercies <hi>are many,</hi> his <hi>mercy reacheth unto the heavens,</hi> it <hi>fils heaven and earth,</hi> it is <hi>above all his works, it endureth for ever, God pitieth as a Father doth his children;</hi> nay he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the same also is <hi>the Father of mercy,</hi> and <hi>the God of all comfort:</hi> So that mercy and we have the same relation; and well it may be so, for we live and die together; for as to man onely, God shews the mercy of forgivenesse, so if God takes away his mercy, man shall be no more, no more capable of felicity, or of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> any thing that is perfective of his condition, or his person. But as God preserves man by his mercy, so his mercy hath all its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations upon man, and returns to its own centre and incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and infinity, unlesse it issues forth upon us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore besides the former great lines of the mercy of forgivenesse, there is another chain, which but to produce and tell its links, is to open a cabinet of Jewels, where every stone is as bright as a star, and every star is great as the Sun, and shines for ever, unlesse we shut our eyes, or draw the vail of obstinate and finall sins.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God is long-suffering, that is, long before he be angry, and <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yet <hi>God is provoked every day,</hi> by the obstinacy of the Jews, and the folly of the Heathens, and the rudenesse and infidelity of the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, and the negligence and vices of Christians; and he that can behold no impurity is received in all places with perfumes of mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes, and <hi>garments spotted with the flesh,</hi> and stained souls, and the actions and issues of misbelief, and an evil conscience, and with accursed sins that he hates, upon pretence of religion which he loves; and he is made a party against himself by our voluntary mistakes, and men continue ten yeers, and 20. and 30. and 50. in a course of sinning, and they grow old with the vices of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> youth; and yet God forbears to kill them, and to consigne them over to an eternity of horrid pains, still expecting that they should repent and be saved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Besides this long-sufferance and for-bearing with an unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">2.</note> patience, God also excuses a sinner oftentimes and takes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing for an excuse, so far as to move him to intermediall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours first; and from thence to a finall pardon. He passes by the sins of our youth with a huge easinesse to pardon, if he be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reconciled by the effective repentance of a vigorous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; he takes ignorance for an excuse, and in every degree of its <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> being inevitable, or innocent in its proper cause, it is also inculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and innocent in its proper effects, though in their own natures criminal. <hi>But I found mercy of the Lord because I did it in ignorance,</hi> saith S. Paul; he pities our infirmities and strikes off much of the account upon that stock; the violence of a temptation and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse of its motion, the perpetuity of its sollicitation, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50231:356"/>
of a mans spirit, the state of sicknesse, the necessity of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> affairs, the publike customs of a people have all of them a power of pleading and prevailing towards some degrees of pardon and diminution before the throne of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When God perceives himself forced to strike, yet then he <note place="margin">3.</note> takes off his hand and repents him of the evil; It is as if it were against him, that any of his creatures should fall under the strokes of an exterminating fury.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When he is forced to proceed, he yet makes an end before <note place="margin">4.</note> he hath half done; and is as glad of a pretence to pardon us, or to strike lesse, as if he himself had the deliverance and not we: When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Ahab had but humbled himself at the word of the Lord, God was glad of it and went with the message to the Prophet <hi>himself,</hi> saying, <hi>Seest thou not how Ahab humbles himself?</hi> What was the event of it? <hi>I will not bring the evil in his dayes,</hi> but in his sons dayes the evil shall come upon his house.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 God forgets our sin and puts it out of his remembrance, that <note place="margin">5.</note> is, he makes it as though it had never been; he makes penitence to be as pure as innocence to all the effects of pardon and glory: the memory of the sins shall not be upon record, to be used to any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter act of disadvantage, and never shall return unlesse we force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them out of their secret places by ingratitude and a new state of sinning.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. God sometimes gives pardon beyond all his revelations <note place="margin">6.</note> and declared will, and provides suppletories of repentance, even then when he cuts a man off from the time of repentance, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temporal death instead of an eternal: that although the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine anger might interrupt the growing of the fruits, yet in some cases, and to some persons, the death and the very cutting off shall go no further, but be instead of explicite and long repentances. Thus it happened to Uzzah, who was smitten for his zeal, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> died in severity for prevaricating the letter, by earnestnesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to serve the whole religion. Thus it was also in the case of the Corinthians that died a temporal death for their undecent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in receiving the holy Sacrament. Saint Paul who used it for an argument to threaten them into reverence, went no further, nor pressed the argument to a sadder issue then to die temporally.</p>
                  <p>But these suppletories are but seldom, and they are also great troubles, and ever without comfort, and dispensed irregularly, and that not in the case of habituall sins that we know of, or very great sins, but in single actions, or instances of a lesse malignity; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and they are not to be relied upon, because there is no rule concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; but when they do happen they magnifie the infinitenesse of Gods mercy which is commensurate to all our needs, and is not to be circumscribed by the limits of his own revelations.</p>

Paul a persecutor, and S. Peter that forswore his Master, Mary Magdalene, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Devils, the thief upon the crosse, Manasses an Idolater, David a murderer and adulterer, the Corinthian for incest, the children of Israel for ten times rebelling against the Lord in the wildernesse, with murmuring, and infidelity, and rebellion, and schisme, and a golden calf, and open disobedience; and above all, I shall instance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the Pharisees among the Jews, who had sinned against the Holy Ghost, as our Blessed Saviour intimates, and tels the particular, viz. in saying that the Spirit of God by which Christ did work was an evil spirit; and afterward they crucified Christ, so that two of the Persons of the most Holy Trinity were openly and solemnly defied, and God had sent out a decree that they should be cut off; yet 40. yeers time (after all this) was left for their repentance, and they were called upon by arguments more perswasive and more excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent in that 40. yeers, then all the Nation had heard from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> even from <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Zecharias:</hi> And Jonas thought he had reason on his side, to refuse to go to threaten Nineveh; he knew Gods tendernesse in destroying his creatures, and he should be thought to be but a false Prophet; and so it came to passe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his belief. <hi>Jonah prayed unto the Lord and said, I pray thee</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>You see the largenesse of this treasure; but we can see no end, for we have not yet looked upon the rare arts of conversion; nor that God leaves the naturall habit of vertues, even after the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is interrupted; nor his working extraregular miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the sufficiencie of Moses and the Prophets, and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and thousands more which we cannot consider now.</p>
                  <p>But this we can, when God sent an Angel to pour plagues upon the earth, there were in their hands <hi>Phialae aureae, golden phials:</hi>

and draw his judgements to the mouth of the <hi>Phial</hi> with a full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> body, and there made it stop it self.</p>
                  <p>The result of this consideration is, that as we fear the Divine judgements, so that we adore and love his goodnesse, and let the golden chains of the Divine mercy tie us to a noble prosecution of our duty and the interests of religion; For he is the worst of men whom Kindnesse cannot soften, nor endearments oblige whom gratitude cannot tie faster then the bands of life and death: He is an ill natur'd sinner if he will not comply with the sweetnesses of heaven, and be civill to his Angel guardian, or observant of his <hi>Patron God,</hi> who made him, and feeds him, and keeps all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and takes care of him, and endures his follies, and waits on him more tenderly then a Nurse, more diligently then a Client, who hath greater care of him then his father, and whose bowels yern over him with more compassion then a mother; who is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull beyond our needs, and mercifull beyond our hopes, and makes capacities in us to receive more. <hi>Fear</hi> is stronger then <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is more prevalent then <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>kindnesse</hi> is the greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment of <hi>Love;</hi> and yet to an ingenuous person <hi>gratitude</hi> is greater then all these, and obliges to a solemn duty when <hi>love</hi> fails, and <hi>fear</hi> is dull and unactive, and <hi>death</hi> it self is despised: but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man who is hardened against kindnesse, and whose duty is not made alive with gratitude, must be used like a slave, and driven like an ox, and inticed with goads and whips, but must never enter into the inheritance of sons: <hi>Let us take heed:</hi> for Mercy is like a rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe, which God set in the clouds to remember mankinde; it shines here as long as it is not hindered; but we must never look for it after it is night, and it shines not in the other world; if we refuse mercy here, we shall have justice to eternity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

There are but few persons upon whose foreheads every man can read the sentence of death written in the lines of a lingring sicknesse, but they (sometimes) hear the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing bell ring for stronger men, even long before their own knell calls at the house of their mother to open her womb and make a bed for them. No man is surer of to morrow then the weakest of his brethren: and when <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Aufidius</hi> stumbled at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold of the Senate and fell down and died, the blow came from heaven in a cloud but it struck more suddenly then upon the poor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> slave that made sport upon the Theatre with a praemeditated and foredescribed death: <hi>Quod quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est in horas.</hi> There are sicknesses that walk in darknesse, and there are exterminating Angels that fly wrapt up in the curtains of immateriality and an uncommunicating nature; whom we cannot see, but we feel their force and sink under their sword, and from heaven the vail descends that wraps our heads in the fatal sentence. There is no age of man but it hath proper to it self some posterns and outlets for death, besides those infinite and open ports out of which myriads of men and women every day passe into the dark <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the land of forgetfulnesse. <hi>Infancie</hi> hath life but <hi>in effigie,</hi> or like a spark dwelling in a pile of wood: the candle is so newly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every little shaking of the taper, and every ruder breath of air, puts it out, and it dies. <hi>Childhood</hi> is so tender, and yet so unwary; so soft to all the impressions of chance, and yet so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to run into them, that God knew there could be no security

So many new ones eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year. 3 The old ones are so changed in circumstance, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with so many collateral complications. 4 The Symptoms are oftentimes so alike. 5 Sometimes so hidden and fallacious. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 6 Sometimes none at all (as in the most sudden and the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imposthumations.) 7 And then, the diseases in the inward parts of the body, are oftentimes such, to which no application can be made. 8 They are so far off, that the effects of all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines can no otherwise come to them, then the effect and juices of all meats, that is, not till after two or three alterations, and decoctions, which change the very species of the medicament. 9 And after all this, very many principles in the art of Physick are so uncertain, that after they have been believed seven or eight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and that upon them much of the practise hath been establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they come to be considered by a witty man, and others establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their stead; by which, men must practise, and by which three or four generations of men more (as happens) must live or die. 10. And all this while the men are sick, and they take things that certainly make them sicker for the present, and very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly restore health for the future: that it may appear of what a large extent is humane calamity; when Gods providence hath not onely made it weak and miserable upon the certain stock of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, and upon the accidents of an infinite contingency; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> even from the remedies which are appointed, our dangers and our troubles are certainly increased: so that we may well be likened to water; our nature is no stronger, our aboad no more certain; If the sluces be opened, <hi>it falls away and runneth apace;</hi> if its cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent be stopped, it swells and grows troublesome, and spils over

And thus we make our selves like water spilt on the ground: we throw away our lives as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if they were unprofitable, (and indeed most men make them so) we let our years slip through our fingers like water; and nothing is to be seen, but like a showr of tears upon a spot of ground; there is a grave digged, and a solemn mourning, and a great talk in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and when the dayes are finished, they shall be, and they shall be remembred no more: And that's like water too, when it is spilt, <hi>it cannot be gathered up again.</hi>

When <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the widows son of Naim, and <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and the Saints that appeared in Jerusalem at the resurrection of our blessed Lord, arose; they came into this world, some as strangers onely to make a visit, and all of them to manifest a glory: but none came upon the stock of a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> life, or entred upon the stage as at first, or to perform the course of a new nature: and therefore it is observable that we never read of any wicked person that was raised from the dead: <hi>Dives</hi> would fain have returned to his brothers house; but neither he, nor any from him could be sent: but all the rest in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (one onely excepted) were expressed to have been holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

or else by their age were declared innocent. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beloved of Christ: those souls that appeared at the resurrection were the souls of Saints: <hi>Tabitha</hi> raised by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and a holy Christian: and the maiden of twelve years old, raised by our blessed Saviour, had not entred into the regions of choice and sinfulnesse: and the onely exception of the widows son, is indeed none at all; for in it the Scripture is wholly silent; and therefore it is very probable that the same processe was used, God in all other instances having chosen to exemplifie his miracles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> nature to purposes of the Spirit, and in spirituall capacities. So that although the Lord of nature did break the bands of nature in some instances, to manifest his glory to succeeding, great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failing purposes; yet (besides that this shall be no more) it was also instanced in such persons who were holy and innocent, and within the verge and comprehensions of the eternall mercy. We never read that a wicked person felt such a miracle, or was raised from the grave to try the second time for a Crown; but where he fell there he lay down dead, and saw the light no more.</p>
                     <p>This consideration I intend to you as a severe Monitor, and an advice of carefulnesse, that you order your affairs so that you may be partakers of the first resurrection, that is, from sin to grace, from the death of vitious habits, to the vigour, life and efficacy of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an habituall righteousnesse: For (as it hapned to those persons in the New Testament now mentioned, to them (I say) in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense) <hi>Blessed are they that have part in the first resurrection, upon them the second death shall have no power:</hi> meaning that they who by the power of Christ and his holy Spirit were raised to life again, were holy and blessed souls, and such who were written in the book of God; and that this grace happened to no wicked and vitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: so it is most true in the spirituall and intended sense: You one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that serve God in a holy life; you who are not dead in trespasses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and sins; you who serve God with an early diligence and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied industry, and a holy religion, you, and you onely shall come to life eternall, you onely shall be called from death to life; the rest of mankind shall never live again but passe from death to death; from one death to another, to a worse; from the death of the body, to the eternall death of body and soul: and therefore in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed there is no mention made of the resurrection of wicked persons: but of <hi>the resurrection of the body to everlasting life.</hi> The wicked indeed shall be haled forth from their graves, from their everlasting prisons, where in chains of darknesse they are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the judgement of the great day: But this therefore cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>in sensu favoris,</hi> a resurrection, but the solennities of the eternall death; It is nothing but a new capacity of dying again; such a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as cannot signifie rest; but where death means nothing but an intolerable and never ceasing calamity: and therefore these words
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50231:361" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of my Text are otherwise to be understood of the wicked, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the godly: The wicked are spilt like water and shall never be gathered up again; no not in the gatherings of eternity; They shall be put into vessels of wrath and set upon the flames of hell; but that is not <hi>a gathering,</hi> but a scattering from the face and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God. But the godly also come under the sense of these words. They descend into their graves, and shall no more be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the living; they have no concernment in all that is done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> hath no more to do with the Turks armies invading and possessing that part of Greece where he reigned, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had the Hippocentaur, who never had a beeing: and <hi>Cicero</hi> hath no more interest in the present evils of Christendome, then we have to do with his boasted discovery of <hi>Catilines</hi> conspiracie. What is it to me that Rome was taken by the Gauls? and what is it now to <hi>Camillus</hi> if different religions be tolerated amongst us? These things that now happen concern the living, and they are made the scenes of our duty or danger respectively: and when our wives are dead and sleep in charnel houses, they are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when we laugh loudly at the songs sung at the next marriage feast; nor do they envy when another snatches away the gleanings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of their husbands passion.</p>
                     <p>It is true they envy not, and they lie in a bosome where there can be no murmure, and they that are consigned to Kingdoms, and to the feast of the marriage-supper of the Lamb, the glorious and eternall Bride-groom of holy souls, they cannot think our marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges here, our lighter laughings, and vain rejoycings considerable as to them. And yet <hi>there is a relation continued still. Aristotle</hi> said, that to affirm the dead take no thought for the good of the living is a disparagement to the laws of that friendship which in their state of separation they cannot be tempted to rescind. And the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Church hath taught in generall that they pray for us, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to God the state of all their Relatives, in the union of the intercession that our blessed Lord makes for them and us: and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> gave some things in charge to his dying brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi> that he should do for him in the other world: he gave it him (I say) when he was dying, not when he was dead. And certain it is that though our dead friends affection to us is not to be estimated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our low conceptions, yet it is not lesse, but much more then ever it was; it is greater in degree, and of another kind.</p>
                     <p>But then we should do well also to remember, that in this world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we are something besides flesh and blood; that we may not without violent necessities run into new relations, but preserve the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we bear to our dead when they were alive: We must not so live as if they were perished, but so as pressing forward to the most intimate participation of the communion of Saints. And we also have some wayes to expresse this relation, and to bear a part in this
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50231:362" rendition="simple:additions"/>
communion, by actions of intercourse with them, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to our state: such as are strictly performing the will of the dead, providing for, and tenderly and wisely educating their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, paying their debts, imitating their good example, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their memories privately, and publikely keeping their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, and desiring of God with hearty and constant prayer that God would give them a joyfull resurrection, and a mercifull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed in behalf of <hi>Onesiphorus)</hi> that <hi>God would shew them <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 18.</note> mercy in that day,</hi> that fearfull, and yet much to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be desired day, in which the most righteous person hath need of much mercy and pity, and shall find it. Now these instances of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shew that the relation remains still; and though the Relict of a man or woman hath liberty to contract new relations; yet I do not finde they have liberty to cast off the old; as if there were no such thing as immortality of souls. Remember that we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse together again: let us therefore never do any thing of refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them which we shall be ashamed of in the day when all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets shall be discovered, and that we shall meet again in the presence of God: In the mean time, God watcheth concerning all their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and he will in his time both discover and recompense. For though, as to us, they are like water spilt, yet, to God, they are as water fallen into the sea, safe and united in his comprehension, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> inclosures.</p>
                     <p>But we are not yet passed the consideration of the sentence: This descending to the grave is the lot of all men. <hi>[neither doth God respect the person of any man]</hi> The rich is not protected for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor the poor for pity, the old man is not reverenced for his age, nor the infant regarded for his tendernesse; youth and beauty, learning and prudence, wit and strength lie down equally in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonours of the grave. All men, and all natures, and all persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the addresses and solennities of death, and strive to preserve a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> miserable and an unpleasant life; and yet they all sink down and die. For so have I seen the pillars of a building assisted with artificiall props bending under the pressure of a roof, and pertinaciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the infallible and prepared ruine,</p>

                     <p>till the determined day comes, and then the burden sunk upon the pillars, and disordered the aids and auxiliary rafters into a common ruine and a ruder grave: so are the desires and weak arts of man, with little aids and assistances of care and physick we strive to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our decaying bodies, and to put off the evil day; but quickly that day will come, and then neither Angels nor men can rescue us from our grave; but the roof sinks down upon the walls, and the walls descend to the foundation; and the beauty of the face, and the dishonours of the belly, the discerning head and the servile

If you have lived but little, and are still in youth, remember that now you are in your biggest throng of dangers both of body and soul; and the proper sins of youth to which they rush infinitely and without consideration, are also the proper and immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of death. But if you be old you have escaped long and wonderfully, and the time of your escaping is out: you must not for everthink to live upon wonders, or that God will work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to satisfie your longing follies, and unreasonable desires of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving longer to sin and to the world. Go home and think to die, and what you would choose to be doing when you die, that do daily: for you will all come to that passe, to rejoyce that you did so, or wish that you had: that will be the condition of every one of us; for <hi>God regardeth no mans person.</hi>

                     <p>I will not venture to determine what are the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the aboad of Holy Souls in their separate dwellings; and yet possibly that might be easier then to tell what or how the soul is and works in this world, where it is in the body <hi>tanquam</hi>

                     <p>Certain it is, that the body does hinder many actions of the soul: it is an imperfect body, and a diseased brain, or a violent passion that makes fools: no man hath a foolish soul; and the reasonings of men have infinite difference and degrees by reason of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies constitution. Among beasts which have no reason, there is a greater likenesse then between men, who have: &amp; as by faces it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to know a man from a man, then a sparrow from a sparrow, or a squirrel from a squirrel: so the difference is very great in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> souls; which difference because it is not originally in the soul (and indeed cannot be in simple and spiritual substances of the same spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or kind) it must needs drive wholly from the body, from its accidents and circumstances: from whence it follows, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the body casts fetters and restraints, hindrances and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the soul, that the soul is much freer in the state of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:50231:364"/>
and if it hath any any act of life, it is much more noble and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> expedite.</p>
                     <p>That the soul is alive after our death, S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms <hi>[Christ died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>him.]</hi> Now it were strange that we should be alive, and live with <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet do no act of life: the body when it is asleep does many: and if the soul does none, the principle is lesse active then the instrument; but if it does any act at all in separation, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be an act or effect of understanding; there is nothing else it can do. But this it can. For it is but a weak and an unlearned proposition to say, That the Soul can do nothing of it self, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without the phantasmes and provisions of the body. For 1. In this life the soul hath one principle clearly separate, abstracted &amp; immaterial, I mean, <hi>the Spirit of grace,</hi> which is a principle of life and action and in many instances does not all at communicate with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in the infusion, superinduction and the creation of spiritual graces. 2. As nutrition, generation, eating and drinking are actions proper to the body and its state: so, extasies, visions, raptures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive knowledge, and consideration of its self, acts of volition, and reflex acts of understanding are proper to the soul. 3. And therefore it is observable that S. <hi>Paul</hi> said that <hi>he knew not whether</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                        <hi>his visions and raptures were in or out of the body:</hi> for by that we see his judgement of the thing, that one was as likely as the other, neither of them impossible or unreasonable; and therefore that the soul is as capable of action alone as in conjunction. 4. If in the state of blessednesse there are some actions of the soul which doe not passe through the body, such as contemplation of God, and conversing with spirits, and receiving those influences and rare immissions which coming from the Holy and mysterious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity make up the crown of glory; it follows that the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the bodies ministery is but during the state of this life, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as long as it converses with fire and water, and lives with corn and flesh, and is fed by the satisfaction of material appetits; which necessity and manner of conversation when it ceases, it can be no longer necessary for the soul to be served by phantasmes and material representations. 5. And therefore when the body shall be re-united, it shall be so ordered that then the body shall confesse it gives not any thing, but receives all its being and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its manner and abode from the soul, and that then it comes not to serve a necessity, but to partake a glory. For as the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the soul in this life, begin in the body, and by it the object is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> transmitted to the soul: so then they shall begin in the soul and pass to the body; and <hi>as the operations of the soul</hi> by reason of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the body are <hi>animal, natural and material:</hi> so in the resurrection, <hi>the body</hi> shall be <hi>spiritual</hi> by reason of the preeminence, influence, and prime operation of the soul. Now between these
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50231:364"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> two states, stands the state of separation, in which the operations of the soul are of a middle nature, that is, not so spirituall as in the resurrection, and not so animal and natural as in the state of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
                     <p>To all which I adde this consideration. That our souls have the same condition that Christs soul had in the state of separation; because he took on him all our nature, and all our condition; and it is certain, Christs soul in the three dayes of his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did exercise acts of life, of joy and triumph, and did not sleep, but visited the souls of the Fathers, trampled upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pride of Devils, and satisfied those longing souls which were <hi>Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of hope;</hi> and from all this we may conclude that the souls of all the servants of Christ are alive, and therfore do the actions of life, and proper to their state; and therefore it is highly probable that the soul works clearer, and understands brighter, and discourses wiser, and rejoyces louder, and loves noblier, and desires purer, and hopes stronger then it can do here.</p>
                     <p>But if these arguments should fail, yet the felicity of Gods Saints cannot fail. For suppose, the body to be a necessary instrument but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> out of tune, and discomposed by sin and anger, by accident and chance, by defect and imperfections, yet, that it is better then none at all: and that if the soul works imperfectly with an imperfect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that then she works not at all when she hath none; and suppose also that the soul should be as much without sense or perception in death, as it is in a deep sleep which is the image and shadow of death; yet then God devises other means that his banished be not expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from him. For,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God will restore the soul to the body, and raise the body to such a perfection, that it shall be an Organ fitt to praise him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it shall be made spiritual to minister to the soul, when the soul is turned into a Spirit, then the soul shall be brought forth by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from her incomparable and easie bed, from her rest in Christs Holy Bosome, and be made perfect in her being, and in all her operations; And this shall first appear by that perfection which the soul shall receive as instrumental to the last judgement: for then she shall see clearly all the Records of this world, all the Register of her own memory. For all that we did in this life, is laid up in our memories: and though dust and forgetfulnesse be drawn upon them, yet when God shall lift us from our dust, then shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> appear clearly all that we have done, written in the Tables of our conscience, which is the souls memory. We see many times, and in many instances, that a great memory is hindered and put out, and we thirty years after come to think of something that lay so long under a curtain; we think of it suddenly and without a line of deduction, or proper consequence: And all those famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, of <hi>Simonides</hi> and <hi>Theodectes,</hi> of <hi>Hortensius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50231:365"/>
                        <hi>Sceptius Metrodorus</hi> and <hi>Carneades,</hi> of <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Embassadour of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                        <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> are onely the Records better kept, and lesse disturbed by accident and desease. For even the memory of <hi>Herods</hi> son of Athens, of <hi>Bathyllus</hi> and the dullest person now alive is so great, and by God made so sure a record of all that ever he did, that assoon as ever God shall but tune our instrument, and draw the curtains, and but light up the candle of immortality, there we shal finde it all, there we shall see all, and all the world shall see all; then we shall be made fit to converse with God after the manner of Spirits, we shall be like to Angels.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, although upon the perswasion of the former <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> discourse it be highly probable that the souls of Gods servants do live in a state of present blessednesse; and in the exceeding joyes of a certain expectation of the revelation of the day of the Lord, and the coming of Jesus yet it will concern us onely to secure our state by holy living, and leave the event to God; that (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said) whether present or absent, whether sleeping or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, whether perceiving or perceiving not, we may be accepted of him: that when we are banished this world, and from the light of the sun, we may not be expelled from God, and from the light of his countenance, but that from our beds of sorrows, our souls may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> passe into the bosome of Christ, and from thence to his right hand in the day of sentence: For we must all appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of Christ, &amp; then if we have done wel in the body, we shal never be expelled from the beatifical presence of God, but be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks of his family, and heires of his Kingdom, and partakers of his glory.</p>

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50231:365"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> worthy and Honoured Ancestors, and her self to be adopted and ingraffed into a more Noble family, yet she felt such outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages to be none of hers, because not of her choice, but the purchase of the vertues of others, which although they did ingage her to do noble things, yet they would upbraid all degenerate and lesse honourable lives then were those which began and increased the honour of the families. She did not love her fortune for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her noble; but thought it would be a dishonour to her if she did not continue her Noblenesse and excellency of vertue fit to be owned by persons relating to such Ancestors. It is fit for all us to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> honour the Noblenesse of a family: but it is also fit for them that are Noble to despise it and to establish their honour upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing excellent things, and suffering in good causes, and despising dishonourable actions, and in communicating good things to others. For this is the rule in Nature: Those creatures are most Honourable which have the greatest power and do the greatest good: And accordingly my self have been a witnesse of it, how this excellent Lady would by an act of humility, and Christian abstracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on strip her self of all that fair appendage of exteriour honour which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> decked her person and her fortune; and desired to be owned by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was her own, that she might onely be esteemed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable according to that which is the honour of a Christian, and a wise person.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. She had a strict and severe education, and it was one of Gods graces and favours to her. For being the Heiresse of a great fortune, and living amongst the throng of persons in the sight of vanities and empty temptations, that is, in that part of the Kingdom where greatnesse is too often expressed in great follies, and great vices, God had provided a severe and angry education to chastise the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of a young spirit, and a fair fortune; that she might for ever be so far distant from a vice, that she might onely see it and loath it, but never tast of it, so much as to be put to her choice whether she would be vertuous or no. God intending to secure this soul to himself, would not suffer the follies of the world to seize upon her by way of too neer a trial, or busie temptation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. She was married young; and besides her businesses of religion seemed to be ordained in the providence of God to bring to this Honourable family a part of a fair fortune, and to leave behinde her a fairer issue worth ten thousand times her portion: and as if this had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> been all the publick businesse of her life; when she had so far served Gods ends, God in mercy would also serve hers, and take her to an early blessednesse.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In passing through which line of providence, she had the art to secure her eternal interest, by turning her condition into duty, &amp; expressing her duty in the greatest eminency of a vertuous, prudent and rare affection, that hath been known in any example. I will not
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:50231:366"/>
give her so low a testimony, as to say onely that she was chast; She <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was a person of that severity, modesty, and close religion (as to that particular) that she was not capable of uncivil temptation; and you might as well have suspected the sun to smell of the poppy that he looks on, as that she could have been a person apt to be sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed by the breath of a foul question.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But that which I shall note in her, is that which I would have exemplar to all Ladies, and to all women. She had a love so great for her Lord, so intirely given up to a dear affection, that she thought the same things and loved the same loves, and hated according to the same enmities, and breathed in his soul, and lived in his presence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and languished in his absence: and all that she was or did, was onely for and to her Dearest Lord,</p>

                     <l>Si gaudet, si slet, si tacit, hunc loquitur.</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>and although this was a great enamel to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her soul, yet it might in some degrees be also a reward to the vertue of her Lord: For she would often discourse it to them that conversed with her; that he would improve that interest which he had in her affection to the advantages of God, and of religion: and she would delight to say, that he called her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to her devotions, he encouraged her good inclinations he directed her piety, he invited her with good books: and then she loved religion, which she saw was not onely pleasing to God, and an act or state of duty, but pleasing to her Lord, and an act also of affection and conjugal obedience; and what at first she loved the more forwardly for his sake; in the using of religion left such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes upon her spirit, that she found in it amability enough, to make her love it for its own. So God usually brings us to him by instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature and affections, and then incorporates us into his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, by the more immediate relishes of Heaven, and the secret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> things of the Spirit. He only was (under God) the light of her eyes, and the cordiall of her spirits, and the guide of her actions, and the measure of her affections, till her affections swelled up into a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then it could go no higher, but was confederate with those other duties which made her dear to God.

                  <p n="6">6. As she was a rare wife: so she was an excellent Mother. For in so tender a constitution of spirit as hers was, and in so great a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> kindnesse towards her children, there hath seldom been seen a stricter and more curious care of their persons, their deportment, their nature, their disposition, their learning and their customs: And if ever kindnesse and care did contest, and make parties in her, yet her care and her severity was ever victorious; and she knew
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:50231:366"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not how to do an ill turn to their severer part, by her more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and forward kindnesse. And as her custome was, she turned this also into love to her Lord. For she was not onely diligent to have them bred nobly and religiously, but also was carefull and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, that they should be taught to observe all the circumstances &amp; inclinations, the desires and wishes of their Father; as thinking, that vertue to have no good circumstances which was not dressed by his copy, and ruled by his lines, and his affections: And her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the managing her children was so singular and rare, that when ever you mean to blesse this family, and pray a hearty and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> profitable prayer for it, beg of God, that the children may have those excellent things which she designed to them, and provided for them in her heart and wishes, that they may live by her purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and may grow thither, whither she would fain have brought them. All these were great parts of an excellent religion as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned her greatest temporal relations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But if we examine how she demeaned her self towards God, there also you will finde her, not of a common, but of an exemplar piety. She was a great reader of Scripture, confining her self to great portions every day; which she read, not to the purposes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of vanity, and impertinent curiosities, not to seem knowing, or to become talking, not to expound and Rule, but to teach her all her duty, to instruct her in the knowledge and love of God and of her Neighbours; to make her more humble, and to teach her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the world, and all its gilded vanities; and that she might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain passions wholly in designe and order to heaven. I have seen a female religion that wholly dwelt upon the face and tongue; that like a wanton and an undressed tree spends all its juice in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and irregular branches, in leafs and gumme, and after all such goodly outsides you should never eat an apple, or be delighted with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the beauties, or the perfumes of a hopefull blossome. But the religion of this excellent Lady was of another constitution; It took root downward in humility, and brought forth fruit upward in the substantiall graces of a Christian, in charity and justice, in chastity and modesty, in fair friendships and sweetnesse of society: She had not very much of the forms and outsides of godlinesse; but she was hugely carefull for the power of it, for the morall, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and usefull parts; such which would make her be, not seem to be religious.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. She was a very constant person at her prayers, and spent all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> her time which Nature did permit to her choice, in her devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reading and meditating and the necessary offices of hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold government, every one of which is an action of religion, some by nature, some by adoption. To these also God gave her <hi>a very great love to hear the word of God preached;</hi> in which because I had sometimes the honour to minister to her, I can give this certain te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:50231:367"/>
that she was a diligent, watchfull and attentive hearer: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to this had so excellent a judgement, that if ever I saw a woman whose judgement was to be revered, it was hers alone: and I have sometimes thought that the eminency of her discerning facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did reward a pious discourse, and placed it in the regions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and usefulnesse, and gathered it up from the ground, where commonly such homilies are spilt, or scattered in neglect and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. But her appetite was not soon satisfied with what was usefull to her soul: she was also <hi>a constant Reader of Sermons,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> seldome missed to read one every day; and that she might be full of instruction and holy principles, she had lately designed to have a large Book in which she purposed to have a stock of Religion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd in such assistances as she would chuse, that she might be <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily furnished and instructed to every good work.</hi> But God preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that, and hath filled her desires not out of cisterns and little aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, but hath carried her to the fountain, where <hi>she drinks of the pleasures of the river,</hi> and is full of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. She alwayes lived a life of much Innocence, free from the violences of great sins: her person, her breeding, her modesty, her honour, her religion, her early marriage, the Guide of her soul, and the Guide of her youth, were as so many fountains of restraining grace to her, to keep her from the dishonours of a crime. <hi>Bonum est</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>portare jugum ab adolescentiâ:</hi> it is good to bear the yoak of the Lord from our youth; and though she did so, being guarded by a mighty providence, and a great favour and grace of God from staining her fair soul with the spots of hell, yet she had strange fears and early cares upon her; but these were not onely for her self, but in order to others, to her neerest Relatives. For she was so great a lover of this Honourable family of which now she was a Mother, that she desired to become a chanel of great blessings to it unto future ages, and was extremely jealous lest any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thing should be done, or lest any thing had been done, though an age or two since, which should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail a curse upon the innocent posterity; and therefore (although I do not know that ever she was tempted with an offer of the crime) yet she did infinitely remove all sacrilege <hi>from her thoughts,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to see her estate of a clear and disintangled interest: she would have no mingled rights with it; she would not receive any thing from the Church, but religion and a blessing: and she never thought a curse and a sin far enough off, but would desire it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely distant; and that as to this family God had given much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and a wise head to govern it, so he would also for ever give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more blessings: And because she knew that the sins of Patents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon Children, she endevoured by justice and religion, by charity and honour to secure that her chanel should convey nothing but health, and a fair example, and a blessing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And though her accounts to God was made up of nothing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50231:367"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but small parcels, little passions, and angry words, and trifling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, which are the allayes of the piety of the most holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet she was early at her repentance; and toward the latter end of her dayes, grew so fast in religion as if she had had a revelation of her approaching end; and therefore that she must go a great way in a little time: her discourses more full of religion, her prayers more frequent, her charity increasing; her forgivenesse more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, her friendships more communicative, her passion more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der discipline, and so she trimm'd her lamp, not thinking her night was so neer, but that it might shine also in the day time, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and before the Altar of incense.</p>
                  <p>But in this course of hers there were some circumstances, and some appendages of substance, which were highly remarkable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In all her Religion, and in all her actions of relation towards God, she had a strange evennesse and untroubled passage, sliding toward her Ocean of God and of infinity with a certain and silent motion. So have I seen a river deep and smooth passing with a still foot and a sober face, and paying to the <hi>Fiscus,</hi> the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer of the Sea, the Prince of all the watry bodies, a tribute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> large and full: and hard by it a little brook skipping and making a noise upon its unequall and neighbour bottom; and after all its talking and bragged motion, it payed to its common Audit no more then the revenues of a little cloud, or a contemptible vessel: So have I sometimes compar'd the issues of her religion to the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and fam'd outsides of anothers piety. It dwelt upon her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and was incorporated with the periodicall work of every day: she did not beleeve that religion was intended to minister to fame and reputation, but to pardon of sins, to the pleasure of God, and the salvation of souls. For religion is like the breath of Heaven; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if it goes abroad into the open air, it scatters and dissolves like cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre: but if it enters into a secret hollownesse, into a close con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, it is strong and mighty, and comes forth with vigour and great effect at the other end, at the other side of this life, in the dayes of death and judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other appendage of her religion, which also was a great ornament to all the parts of her life, was a rare modesty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of spirit, a confident despising and undervaluing of her self. For though she had the greatest judgement, and the greatest expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of things and persons that I ever yet knew in a person of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> her youth, and sex, and circumstances; yet as if she knew nothing of it she had the meanest opinion of her self; and like a fair taper when she shined to all the room, yet round about her own station she had cast a shadow and a cloud, and she shined to every body but her self. But the perfectnesse of her prudence and excellent parts could not be hid; and all her humility, and arts of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made the vertues more amiable and illustrious. For as pride
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:50231:368"/>
sullies the beauty of the fairest vertues, and makes our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but like the craft and learning of a Devil: so humility is the greatest eminency, and art of publication in the whole world; and she in all her arts of secrecy and hiding her worthy things, was but <hi>like one that hideth the winde, and covers the oyntment of her right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not by what instrument it hapned; but when death drew neer, befor it made any shew upon her body, or revealed it self by a naturall signification, it was conveyed to her spirit: she had a strange secret perswasion that the bringing this Childe should be her last scene of life: and we have known, that the soul when she is about to disrobe her self of her upper garment, sometimes speaks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> rarely <hi>Magnifica verba: mors propè admota excutit;</hi> sometimes it is prophetical; sometimes God by a superinduced perswasion wrought by instruments, or accidents of his own, serves the ends of his own providence and the salvation of the soul: But so it was, that the thought of death dwelt long with her, and grew from the first steps of faney and fear, to a consent, from thence to a strange credulity, and expectation of it; and without the violence of sicknesse she died, as if she had done it voluntarily, and by designe, and for fear her expectation should have been deceived, or that she should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> seem to have had an unreasonable fear, or apprehension; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as one said of <hi>Cato) sic abiit è vitâ ut causam moriendi nactam se esse gauderet,</hi> she died, as if she had been glad of the opportunity.</p>
                  <p>And in this I cannot but adore the providence and admire the wisdom and infinite mercies of God. For having a tender and soft, a delicate and fine constitution and breeding, she was tender to pain, and apprehensive of it, as a childs shoulder is of a load and burden: <hi>Grave est tenerae cérvici jugum;</hi> and in her often discourses of death, which she would renew willingly and frequently, she would tell, that she feared not death, but she feared the sharp pains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of death: <hi>Emori nolo, me esse mortuam non curo:</hi> The being dead, and being freed from the troubles and dangers of this world, she hoped would be for her advantage; and therefore that was no part of her fear: But she believing the pangs of death were great, and the use and aids of reason little, had reason to fear left they should do violence to her spirit and the decency of her resolution. But God that knew her fears, and her jealousie concerning her self, fitted her with a death so easie, so harmlesse, so painlesse, that it did not put her patience to a severe trial. It was not (in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) of so much trouble, as two fits of a common ague; so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was God to remonstrate to all that stood in that sad attendance, that this soul was dear to him: and that since she had done so much of her duty towards it, he that began would also finish her redemption, by an act of a rare providence, and a singular mercy. <hi>Blessed be that goodnesse of God, who does so careful actions of mercy</hi>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:50231:368"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>for the ease and security of his servants.</hi> But this one instance was a great demonstration that the apprchension of death is worse then the pains of death: and that God loves to reprove the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our fears, by the mightiness, and by the arts of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>She had in her sickness (if I may so cal it, or rather in the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and graver preparations towards death) some curious and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming fears, concerning the final state of her soul. But from thence she passed into a <hi>deliquium,</hi> or a kinde of trance, and as soon as she came forth of it, as if it had been a vision, or that she had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with an Angel, and from his hand had received a label or scroll of the <hi>book of life,</hi> and there seen her <hi>name</hi> enrolled, she cried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out aloud, <hi>[Glory be to God on high: Now I am sure I shall be saved.]</hi> Concerning which manner of discoursing we are wholy ignorant, what judgement can be made: but certainly there are strange things in the other world; and so there are in all the immediate preparation to it; and a little glimps of heaven, a minutes conversing with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, any ray of God, any communication extraordinary from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of comfort which God gives to his servants in strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known manners, are infinitely far from illusions; and they shall then be understood by us, when we feel them, and when our new and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> strange needs shall be refreshed by such unusual visitations.</p>
                  <p>But I must be forced to use summaries and arts of abbreviature in the enumerating those things in which this rare Personage was dear to God and to all her Relatives.</p>
                  <p>If we consider her Person, she was in the flower of her age, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum cum aetas florida ver ageret;</hi> of a temperate, plain and natural diet; without curiosity or an intemperate palate; she spent lesse time in dressing, then many servants; her recreations were little and seldom, her prayers often, her reading much: she was of a most noble and charitable soul; a great lover of honourable actions and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as great a despiser of base things; hugely loving to oblige others, and very unwilling to be in arrear to any upon the stock of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies and liberality; so free in all acts of favour, that she would not stay to hear her self thanked, as being unwilling that what good went from her to a needful or an obliged person should ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her again; she was an excellent friend, and hugely dear to very many, especially to the best and most discerning persons, to all that conversed with her, and could understand her great worth and sweetnesse: she was of an Honourable, a nice and tender repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and of the pleasures of this world which were laid before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> her in heaps she took a very small and inconsiderable share, as not loving to glut her self with vanity, or to take her portion of good things here below.</p>
                  <p>If we look on her as a Wife, she was chast and loving, fruitful and discreet, humble and pleasant, witty and complyant, rich and fair, &amp; wanted nothing to the making her a principal and a precedent to the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50231:369"/>
best Wives of the world, but a long life, and a full age. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we remember her as a Mother; she was kinde and severe, careful and prudent, very tender, &amp; not at al fond, a greater lover of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens souls, then of their bodies, and one that would value them more by the strict rules of honour and proper worth, then by their relation to her self.</p>
                  <p>Her servants found her prudent, and fit to Govern, and yet open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed and apt to reward; a just Exactor of their duty and a great Rewarder of their diligence. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was in her house a comfort to her dearest Lord, a guide to her children, a Rule to her Servants, an example to all.</p>
                  <p>But as she related to God in the offices of Religion, she was even and constant, silent and devout, prudent and material: she loved what she now enjoyes, and she feared what she never felt, and God did for her what she never did expect. Her fears went beyond all her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and yet the good which she hath received was, and is, and ever shall be beyond all her hopes.</p>
                  <p>She lived as we al should live, and she died as I fain would die—</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Et cum supremos Lachesis perneverit annos,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>I pray God I may feel those mercies on my death-bed that she felt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and that I may feel the same effect of my repentance which she feels of the many degrees of her innocence. Such was her death that she did not die too soon; and her life was so useful and so excellent that she could not have lived too long. <hi>Nemo parum diu vixit qui vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis perfectae perfecto functus est munere:</hi> and as now in the grave it shall not be enquired concerning her, how long she lived, but how well? so to us who live after her to suffer a longer calamity, it may be some ease to our sorrows, and some guide to our lives, and some securitie to our conditions, to consider that God hath brought the piety of a yong Lady to the early rewards of a never ceasing, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> never dying eternity of glory. And we also if we live as she did, shall partake of the same glories; not onely having the honour of a good name and a dear and honoured memory, but the glories of these glories, the end of all excellent labours, and all prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and all holy religion, even the salvation of our souls in that day, when all the Saints, and amongst them this excellent Woman shall be shown to all the world to have done more, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things then we know of or can describe. <hi>Mors illos consecrat, quorum exitum &amp; qui timent, laudant:</hi> Death consecrates and makes sacred that person whose excellency was such, that they that are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> displeased at the death, cannot dispraise the life; but they that mourn sadly, think they can never commend sufficiently.</p>

                     <p>For religion cannot be at all in communities of men without some to guide, to minister, to preserve and to prescribe the offices and ministeries: What can profane holy things but that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50231:373"/>
makes them common? and what can make them common more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then when common persons handle them, when there is no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Persons in their ministration? For although places are good accessories to religion, yet in all religions they were so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall to it, that a sacrifice might hallow the place, but the place (unlesse it were naturally impure) could not desecrate the sacrifice: and therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> worshipped upon a stone, offered upon a turfe, and the Arke rested in <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> house, and was holy in <hi>Dagons</hi> Temple; and hils and groves, fields and orchards, according to the severall customes of the nations, were the places of addresse; But a common person ministring, was so near a circumstance, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was so mingled with the action, that since the materiall part and exteriour actions of Religion could be acted and personated by any man, there was scarce any thing left to make it religious, but the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectation of the rites by a holy person; A <hi>Holy place</hi> is something, <hi>a separate time</hi> is something, <hi>a prescript form of words</hi> is more, &amp; <hi>separate and solemn actions</hi> are more yet; but all these are made common by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon person, &amp; therfore without a distinction of persons have not a natural and reasonable distinction of solemnity &amp; exterior religion.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it were a great disreputation to religion, that all great and publique things, and every artifice or profitable science should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                        <note place="margin">8.</note> in all the societies of men be distinguished by professors, artists and proper ministers; and onely religion should lie in common, apt to be bruised by the hard hand of mechanicks, and sullied by the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der touch of undiscerning and undistinguished persons; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the light of it shines to all, and so farre every mans inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest is concerned in religion, yet it were not handsome that every man should take the taper in his hand: and religion is no more to be handled by all men, then the laws are to be dispensed by all, by whom they are to be obeyed; though both in religion and the laws, all men have a common interest. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>For since all meanes must have some equality or proportion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their end, that they may of their own being or by institution <note place="margin">9.</note> be symbolicall, it is but reasonable that by elevated and sublimed instruments we should be promoted towards an end supernaturall and divine; now besides, that of all the instruments of distinction, the person is the most principall and apt for the honour of religion (and to make our religion honourable is part of the religion it self) it is also apt for the uses of it; such as are, preserving the rights, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, decent ministration, dispensing the laws of religion, judging causes, ceremonies and accidents; and he that appoints not offices <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to minister his religion, cares not how it is performed; and he that cares so little, will finde a great contempt passe upon it, and a cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse meaner then of the meanest civill offices; and he that is content with that, cares not how little honour God receives, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to him a cheape, a common, and a dishonorable religion.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But the very naturall design of religion forces us to a distinction <note place="margin">10.</note> of persons in order to the ministration; for besides that every man is not fit to approach to God with all his <hi>sordes</hi> and adherent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions; an assignment in reason must be made of certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose calling must be holy, and their persons taught to be holy, by such a solemn and religious assignment; that those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being made higher then the people by their calling and religion, and yet our brethren in nature, may be intermediall between God and the people, and present to God the peoples needs, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall to the reconveying Gods blessing upon those whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fiduciaries they are. This last depends upon Gods own act, and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>signation, and therefore must afterwards be proved by testimonies of his own, that he hath accepted such persons to such purposes; but the former part we our selves are taught by naturall reason, by the rules of proportion, by the honour we owe unto religion, by the hopes of our own advantages, and by the distance between God and us, towards which we should thrust up persons as high as they are capable. And that all the world hath done prudently in this, we are confirmed by Gods own act, who knowing it was most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, not onely to the constitution of religion, and of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to God, but to our meer necessities also, did in his glorious wisdome send his sonne, and made him apt to become a mediator between himself and us, by clothing him with our nature, and deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with great participation of his own excellencies, that he might doe our worke, the worke of his own humane nature, and by his great sanctity and wisdome approach neer to Gods mercy seat, whither our imperfections and sins could not have neer accesse.</p>
                     <p>And this consideration is not onely good reason, but true divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and was a consideration in the Greek Church, and affixed to the <note place="margin">11.</note> head of a prayer as the reason of their addresse to God in designing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ministers in religion. <hi>O Lord God who because mans nature cannot of it selfe approach to thy glorious Deity,</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> because we under value all religion; that is, because indeed we have nothing of it; <hi>The first</hi> is dishonorable to Christianity, and false as its greatest enemy; <hi>The second,</hi> is shame to us; and <hi>both</hi> so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and unnaturall, that if we separate not certain persons for the ministeries of Christianity, we must confesse we have the worst religion, or that we are the worst of men.</p>
                     <p>But let us consider it upon its proper grounds. When Christ had <note place="margin">2.</note> chosen to himselfe twelve Apostles, and was drawing now to the last scene of his life, he furnished them with commissions and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to constitute and erect a Church, and to transmit such powers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as were apt for its continuation and perpetuity. And therefore to the Apostles in the capacity of Church officers, he made a promise <hi>That he would be with them untill the end of the world;</hi> they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally be with him untill the end of the world, but he could not be here with them, who after a short course run, were to goe hence, <hi>and be no more seen:</hi> and therefore for the verification of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it is necessary that since the promise was made for the benefit of the Church, and to them as the ministers of the benefit, so long as the benefit was to be dispensed, so long they were to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to, and therefore assisted by the Holy Jesus according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that glorious promise: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <q>Not onely to the Apostles, but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and indefinitely to all Christs disciples, their successors, he promised to abide for ever, even to the consummation of the world, to the whole succession of the Clergy: so <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> upon this place.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we consider what were the power and graces Jesus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">3.</note> to the dispensation of the Apostles, such as were not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but lasting, successive, and perpetuall, we must also conclude the ministery to be perpetuall. I instance first in the power of <hi>binding and loosing remitting and retaining sins,</hi> which Christ gave them together with his breathing on them the holy Spirit, and a legation, and a speciall commission, as appears in S. <hi>John;</hi> which <note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 20. 21.</note> power, what sense soever it admits of, could not expire with the persons of the Apostles, unlesse the succeeding ages of the Church had no discipline, or government, no scandals to be removed, no weak persons offended, no corrupt members to be cut off, no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks rejected, no sins, or no pardon; and that were a more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then that of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> for they onely denyed this ministery in some cases; not in all: saying, Priestly absolution was not fit to be dispensed to them, who in time of persecution had sacrificed to idols. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>by Christ Jesus, and hath given to us the ministery of reconciliation;</hi> and it followes, <hi>now then we are Embassadours for Christ.</hi> The ministery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of reconciliation, is an appropriate ministery, <hi>It is committed to us; we are Embassadours,</hi> it is appropriate by virtue of Christs mission, and legation. <hi>He hath given to us, he</hi> hath made and deputed certain Embassadours whom he hath sent upon the message, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of reconcilement; which is a plain exposition of the words of his commission, before recorded; <hi>John</hi> 20. 21.</p>
                     <p>And that this also descended lower we have the testimony of S. <hi>James,</hi> who advises the sick person <hi>to send for the Elders of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                        <hi>Church, that they may pray over him,</hi> that they may anoint him, <note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, they were fathers of the people, but sons of the Apostles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certain the power was not personall, and meerly Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, but derived upon others by such a communication, as gives evidence the power was to be succeeded in; And when went it out? when the anointing and miraculous healing ceased? There is no reason for that. For forgivenesse of sins was not a thing visible, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therefore could not be of the nature of miracles to confirme the faith and christianity first, and after its work was done, return to God that gave it; neither could it be onely of present use to the Church, but as eternall and lasting as sin is: and therefore there could be nothing in the nature of the thing to make it so much as suspicious, it was presently to expire.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> To which also I adde this consideration, that the Holy Ghost which was to enable the Apostles in the precise office Apostolicall, as it was an office extraordinary, circumstantionate, definite, and to expire, <hi>all that,</hi> was promised should descend upon them after Christs ascension, and was verified in <hi>Pentecost;</hi> for to that purpose to bring all things to their minde, all of Christs doctrine and all that was necessary of his life and miracles, and a power from above to enable them to speake boldly and learnedly, and with tongues, all that, besides the other parts of ordinary power, was given them ten days after the Ascension. And therefore the breathing the holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Ghost upon the Apostles in the octaves of the resurrection, and this mission with such a power, was <hi>their ordinary mission,</hi> a sending them as ordinary Pastors, and Curates of souls, with a power to govern, (binding and loosing can mean no lesse: and they were the words of the promise) with a power to minister reconciliation: (for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds remitting and retaining) which two were the great hinges of the Gospell, the one to invite and collect a Church, the other to govern it, the one to dispense the greatest blessing in the world, the other to keep them in capacities of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. For since the holy Ghost was now actually given to these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> purposes here expressed, and yet in order to all their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and temporary needs was promised to descend after this, there is no collection from hence more reasonable, then to conclude all this to be part of their commission of ordinary Apostleship, to which the ministers of religion were in all ages to succeed.

                        <hi>and in earth, Goe yee therefore and teach all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and loe I am with you always even unto the end of the world.</hi> First, Christ declared his own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> commission, <hi>[all power</hi> is given him into his hand] he was now made King of all the creatures, and Prince of the Catholick Church; and therefore as it concerned his care and providence to look to his cure, and flock, so he had power to make deputations accordingly <hi>[Goe yee therefore,]</hi> implying that the sending them to this purupose was an issue of hispower, either because the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing certain persons was an act of power, or else because the making them doctors of the Church and teachers of the Nations, was a placing them in an eminency above their scholars; and converts, and so also was an emanation of that power which derived upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Christ from his Father, from him descended upon the Apostles. And the wiser persons of the world have always understood, that a power of teaching was a <hi>presidency</hi> and <hi>authority;</hi> for sinco all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is naturally founded in the understanding; although civill government accidentally, and by inevitable publick necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon other titles, yet where the greatest understanding and power of teaching is, there is a naturall preheminence and superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>eatenus,</hi> that is according to the proportion of the excellency; and therefore in the instance of S <hi>Paul</hi> we are taught the style of the court, and <hi>Disciples sit at the feet</hi> of their Masters, as he did at the feet of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Tutor <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> which implies duty, submission, and subordination; and indeed it is the highest of any kinde, not onely because it is founded upon nature, but because it is a submission of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious faculty we have, even of that faculty which when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from our Tutors, is submitted to none but God; for no man hath power over the understanding faculty; and therefore so long as we are under Tutors and instructors, we give to them that duty, in the succession of which claim, none can succeed but God himself, because none else can satisfie the understanding but he.</p>
                     <p>Now then because the Apostles were created Doctors of all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> world, <hi>hoc ipso</hi> they had power given them over the understandings <note place="margin">2.</note> of their disciples, and they were therefore fitted with an infallible spirit, and grew to be so authentick that their determination was the last addresse of all inquiries in questions of Christianity: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not absolute Lords of their faith and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,

                     <p>Upon this ground it is, that learning amongst wise persons is <note place="margin">3.</note> esteemed a title of nobility and secular eminency: <hi>Ego enim quid aliud munificentiae adhibere potui, ut studia, ut sic dixerim, in umbr a edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata è quibus claritudo venit,</hi> said <hi>Seneca</hi> to <hi>Nero.</hi> And <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <note place="margin">

                        <hi>presidency,</hi> that therefore a separation of persons is <hi>ex abundanti</hi> inferred, unlesse order and authority be also casuall, and that all men also may be <hi>Governours</hi> as well as <hi>Preachers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that here was a plain separation of some persons for this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, I shall not need to prove by any other argument besides the <note place="margin">4.</note> words of the Commission; save onely that this may be added, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50231:378"/>
here was <hi>more</hi> necessary, then a commission; great abilities, speciall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> assistances, extraordinary and divine knowledge, and understanding the mysteries of the kingdome; so that these abilities were separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enough of the persons, and designation of the officers; But this may possibly become the difficulty of the question; For, when the Apostles had filled the world with the Sermons of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and that the holy Ghost descended in a plentifull manner, then was the prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> fulfilled, <hi>Old men dreamed dreams, and young men saw visions, and sons and daughters did prophecy;</hi> now the case was altered; and the disciples themselves start up doctors, and women prayed and prophecied, and <hi>Priscilla</hi> sate in the chaire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with her husband <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> sat at their feet: and now all was common again; and therefore although the commission went out first to the Apostles, yet when by miracle God dispensed great gifts to the Laity, and to women, he gave probation that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all should prophecy and preach, lest those gifts should be to no purpose. This must be considered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. These gifts were miraculous verifications of the great promise <note place="margin">5.</note> of the Father, of sending the holy Ghost, and that all persons were capable of that blessing in their severall proportions, and that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity did descend from God were <hi>ex abundanti</hi> proved by those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> extraregular dispensations: so that here is purpose enough signified although they be not used to inferre an indistinction of officers in this ministery.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. These gifts were given extraregularly; but yet with some difference of persons; for all did not prophecy, nor all interpret, <note place="margin">6.</note> nor all speak with tongues; they were but a few that did all this; we finde but the daughters of one man onely, and <hi>Priscilla</hi> among all the nations of the Jews that ever did prophecy, of the women; and of Laymen I remember not one but <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Agabus;</hi> and these will be but too straight an argument to blend a whole order of men in a popular and vulgar indiscrimination. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. These extraordinary gifts were no authority to those who had them, and no other commission, to speake in publick. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">7.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids the women to speak in the Church, and yet it was not denyed but some of them might have the spirit of prophecy. <hi>Speaking in the Church</hi> was part of an ordinary power, to which not onely <hi>ability</hi> but <hi>authority</hi> also and <hi>commission</hi> are required: That was clearly one separation; women were not capable of a clericall imployment, no not so much as of this ministery of preaching.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50231:379"/>
now extraordinarily assisted should prophecy in publick; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when these extraordinaries did cease, if they were common persons, they had no pretence to invade the Chaire (nor that we finde ever did:) for an ordinary ability to speake was never any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to disturb an order; unlesse they can say the words of S. <hi>Paul [Whereunto I am ordained a Preacher,]</hi> they might not invade the office. To be able to performe an office, though it may be a fair disposition to make the person capable to receive it <hi>orderly,</hi> yet it does not actually invest him; every wise man is not a Counsellour of State, nor every good Lawyer a Judge. And I doubt not but in the Jewish religion there were many persons as able to pray as their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Priests, who yet were wiser then to refuse the Priests advocation <hi>apud Deum</hi> and reciting offices in behalfe of the people: <hi>Orabit pro eo sacerdos</hi> was the order of Gods appointing, though himself were a devout person and of an excellent spirit. And it had need be something extraordinary that must warrant an ordinary person to rise higher then his own evennesse; and <hi>ability</hi> or <hi>skill</hi> is but a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and must be reduced to act by something that transmits autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or does establish order, or distinguish persons, and separate professions. And it is very remarkable that when <hi>Judas</hi> had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried and lost his Apostolate, it was said, that it was necessary for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some body to be chosen to be a witnesse of Christs resurrection. Two were named, of ability sufficient, but that was not all: they must choose one, to make up the number of the twelve, a distinct separate person; which shews that it was not onely a work (for that, any of them might have done) but an office of ordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery. The ability of doing which work although all they that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with <hi>Jesus,</hi> might either have had, or received at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> yet the authority and grace was more: the first they had upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but this onely by divine election: which is a demonstration that every person that can doe offices clericall is not permitted to doe them, and that besides the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>artificiall</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>abilities,</hi> a divine qualification is necessary.</p>
                     <p>And therefore God complains by the Prophet, <hi>I have not sent them, and yet they run;</hi> and the Apostle leaves it as an established <note place="margin">9.</note> rule, <hi>How shall they preach except they be sent?</hi> which two places, I shall grant to be meant concerning a distinct and a new message; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets must not offer any doctrine to the people or pretend a doctrine for which they had not a commission from God. But which way soever they be expounded, they will conclude right in this particular. For if they signifie an ordinary mission, then there is an ordinary mission of preachers which no man must usurpe unlesse he can prove <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his title certainly and clearly, derivative from God; which when any man of the Laity can doe, we must <hi>give him the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,</hi> and <hi>wish him good speed.</hi> But if these words signifie an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary case, and that no message must be pretended by Prophets
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50231:379"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but what they have commission for, then must not ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons pretend an extraordinary mission to an ordinary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for besides, that God does never doe things unreasonably, nor will endure that order be interrupted to no purpose, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give an extraordinary Commission unlesse it be to a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable end; whosoever pretends to a license of preaching by reason of an extraordinary calling, must look that he be furnished with an extraordinary message, lest his Commission be ridiculous; and when he comes he must be sure to shew his authority by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proportionable; that is, by such a probation without which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> no wise man can reasonably beleeve him; which cannot be lesse then miraculous and divine. In all other cases he comes under the curse of the <hi>non missi</hi> those whom God sent not, they goe on their own errand, and must pay themselves their wages.</p>
                     <p>But besides that, the Apostles were therefore to have an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <note place="margin">10.</note> mission, because they were to receive new instructions: these instructions were such as were by an ordinary, and yet by a distinct ministery to be conveyed for ever after, and therefore did design an ordinary, successive, and lasting power and authority. Nay our blessed Lord went one step further in this provision, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the very first successors and partakers of this power, to be taken <hi>into the lot of this ministery;</hi> and they were the seventy two whom Christ had sent (as probationers of their future preaching) upon a short errand into the Cities of <hi>Judah:</hi> But by this assignation of more persons then those to whom he gave immediate commission, he did declare that the office of preaching was to be dispensed by a separate and peculiar sort of men, distinct from the people, and yet by others then those who had the commission extraordinary; that is, by such who were to be called to it by an ordinary vocation.</p>
                     <p>As Christ constituted the office and named the persons, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <note place="margin">11.</note> and ordinary, present and successive; so he provided gifts for them too; that the whole dispensation might be his and might be apparent. And therefore Christ <hi>when he ascended up on high gave gifts to men,</hi> to this very purpose; and these gifts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the same Spirit made separation of distinct ministeries under the same Lord. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies expresly. <hi>Now there are</hi>

concludes that the Spirit intended a distinction of Church officers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for the work of the ministery; for the conclusion of the discourse is; that <hi>God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>

                        <hi>the work of the Ministery</hi> must goe forwards, and is incumbent upon the Pastors and Teachers; this is their work, and they are the ministers, whom the holy Ghost designed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For, I consider that either to preach requires but an <hi>ordinary</hi> or an <hi>extraordinary ability;</hi> if it requires an extraordinary, they who <note place="margin">13.</note> are illiterate and unlearned persons are the unfittest men in the world for it; if an <hi>ordinary</hi> sufficiency will discharge it, why cannot they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> suppose the clergy of a competency, and strength sufficient to doe that which an ordinary understanding, and faculties can performe? what need they entermeddle with that, to which no extraordinary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance is required? or else why do they set their shoulder to such a work, with which no strength but extraordinary, is commensurate? in the first case it is needlesse; in the second it is uselesse; in both vain and impertinent. For either no man needs their help, or if they did, they are very unable to help; I am sure they are, if they be unlearned persons; and if they be learned, they well enough know that to teach the people is not a power of speaking, but is also an act of jurisdiction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and authority, and in which, order is at least concerned in an eminent degree: <hi>Learned men</hi> are not so forward; and those are most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent who have least reason.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Although as Homilies to the people are now used according to the smallest rate, many men more preach then should, yet besides <note place="margin">14.</note> that to preach <hi>prudently, gravely, piously</hi> and <hi>with truth,</hi> requires more abilities then are discernible by the people, such as make even a plain work reasonable to wise men, and usefull to their hearers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; besides this, I say, the office of teaching is of larger extent then making homilies or speaking prettily enough to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> please the common and undiscerning auditors. They that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to teach the people must <hi>respondere de jure, give account of their faith</hi> in defiance of the numerous armies of Hereticks; they must watch for their flock, and use excellent arts to arme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all their weaknesses from within, and hostilities from without;

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they must streng then the weak, confirme the strong, compose the scrupulous, satisfie the doubtfull, and be ready to answer cases of conscience; and I beleeve there are not so little as 5000 cases al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready started up among the Casuists, and for ought I know, there may be 5000 times 5000. And there are some cases of conscience that concern Kings and kingdomes in the highest mysteriousnesse, both of State and Religion, and they also belong to <hi>Pastors</hi> for the interests of Religion, and <hi>Teachers</hi> to determine or advise in. <gap reason="foreign">

But God hath taken order that those whom he hath appointed teachers of the people, should make it the work and businesse of their lives, that they should diligently attend to reading, to exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to doctrine, that they may <hi>watch over their flock, over whom the holy Ghost hath made them overseers.</hi> The inconvenience that this discourse is like to meet withall is, that it concerns those men who are sure not to understand it: for they that have not the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Prophets and wise men, cannot easily be brought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> know the degrees of distance between the others wisdome and their own ignorance. To know that there is great learning beyond us is a great part of learning; but they that have the confidence in the midst of their deepest ignorance to teach others, want both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and understanding too, either to perceive or to confesse their own wants, they never kissed the lips of the wise, and therefore thinke all the world breaths a breath as fenny and moorish as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

allow him nothing but an <hi>ordinary spirit,</hi> that is, abilities of art and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nature, there cannot in such discourses be any compensation for the disorder, or the danger, or the schismes, and innumerable Churches, when <hi>one head</hi> and <hi>two members</hi> shall make a distinct body, and all shall pretend to Christ, without any other common term of union.

                     <p>In opposition to which, I first consider, that the ordinary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <note place="margin">2.</note> of baptisme is a person consecrated; the Apostles and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> successors in the office Apostolicall, and all those that partake of that power; and it needs no other proof, but the plain production of the Commission; they who are teachers by ordinary power, and authority, they also had command to baptize all nations: and ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptisme being the solemn rite of initiating disciples, and making the first publick profession of the institution, it is in reason and analogy of the mystery to be ministred by those who were appointed to collect the Church, and make Disciples.

Now if Presbyters and Deacons have this power onely by leave and in certain cases, then it is no more then women have; onely that they are fitter persons to be intrusted with the deputation; a lesse necessity will devolve it upon Presbyters then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50231:383"/>
upon Deacons, and upon <hi>Deacons</hi> then <hi>Lay men,</hi> and a lesse yet will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cast it upon <hi>Lay men</hi> then <hi>women;</hi> and this difference is in respect of humane order and positive constitution, but in the nature of the thing according to this doctrine all persons are equally receptive of it: And therefore to baptize is no part of the grace of Orders, no fruit of the holy Ghost, but a work which may be done by all, and at some times must; and if baptisme may, then it will be hard to keep all the other rites from the common inrodes, and then the whole office wil perish.</p>
                     <p>But if Lay persons baptizing, though in case of necessity, <hi>doe sin,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> seems to say they doe, then it is certain, Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">6.</note> gave them leave so much as by insinuation; and then neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> can the Church give leave; for she can give leave for no man to sin; and besides, such a deputation were to no purpose; Because no person shall dare to doe it, for evill is not to be done, though for the obtaining the greatest good: and it will be hard to state the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so that either the childe shall perish, or some other must perish for it; for he that positively ventures upon a sin for a good end, worships God with a sinne, and therefore shall be thank'd with a damnation, if he dies before repentance; but if the childe shall not perish in such case of not being baptized, then why should any man break the rule of institution? and if he shall perish without being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> baptized, then God hath affixed the salvation of the childe upon the condition of another mans sinne.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And indeed the pretence of cases of necessity may doe much towards the excusing an irregularity in an exterior rite, though of <note place="margin">7.</note> divine institution, <gap reason="foreign">

But it will not be easily proved that God hath made any such necessities, it is <note place="margin">Eurip.</note> certain that for persons having the use of reason God hath provided a remedy that no lay persons should have need to baptize a Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for his <hi>votum</hi> or desire of Baptisme shall serve his turne; And it will be unimaginable that God hath made no provision for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and yet put it upon them in many cases with equall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, which without breach of a divine institution cannot be supplied.</p>

                        </gap>, <hi>Let it be received.</hi> Onely I offer this to consideration; if a Deacon can doe no ministeriall act with effect, but a lay person may doe the same with effect upon the person suscipient, what is that supernaturall grace and inherent and indelible character which a Deacon hath received in his ordination? If a Deacon can doe no supernaturall act which were void and null if done by him that is not a Deacon, he hath no character, no spirituall inherent power; and that he is made the ordinary minister of it, is for order sake; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but he that can doe the same thing, hath the same power and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by this ground a Lay person and a Deacon are not distinguished by any inherent character, and therefore they who understand the spirituall powers and effects of ordination in the sense and expression of an inherent and indelible character, will finde some difficulty in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the effect of a lay baptisme.</p>
                     <p>But I consider that the instances of Scripture brought for the <note place="margin">9.</note> lawfulnesse of lay administration, if they had no particular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet are impertinent to this question: for it is not with us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in any case to be lawfull, but in extreme necessity: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> therefore, S. <hi>Peters</hi> deputing the brethren who come with him to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to baptize his family, is nothing to our purpose, and best answers it selfe; for either they were of the Clergy, who came with them, or else lay persons may baptize by the right of an ordinary deputation, without a case of necessity: for here was none; S. <hi>peter</hi> might have done it himself.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Ananias,</hi> he was one of the seventy two; and if that be nothing, yet he was called to that ministration about <hi>Paul</hi> as <note place="margin">10.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe was to the Apostleship even by an immediate vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mission from Christ himselfe. And if this answer were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sufficient (as it is most certainly) the argument would presse fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then is intended; for <hi>Ananias</hi> tells him, he was sent to him that <hi>he might lay his hands on him that he might receive the holy Ghost:</hi> and to doe that was more then <hi>Philip</hi> could doe, though he was a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and in as great a necessity as this was: And yet besides all this this was not a case of necessity, unlesse there was never a Presbyter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50231:384"/>
or Deacon in all <hi>Damascus,</hi> or that God durst not trust any of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with <hi>Paul,</hi> but onely <hi>Ananias,</hi> or that <hi>Paul</hi> could not stay longer without baptisme, as many thousand converts did in descending ages.</p>
                     <p>And for the other conjecture it is not considerable at all; for the <note place="margin">11.</note> Apostles might take three or four days time to baptize the 3000; there was no hurt done if they had stayed a week: the text insinuates nothing to the contrary; <hi>The same day about</hi> 3000 <hi>were added to the Church;</hi> then they <hi>were added to the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>by virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of that Sermon,</hi> who, it may be, considered some while of S. <hi>Peters</hi> discourse, and gave up their names upon mature deliberation and positive conviction. But it is not said <hi>they were baptized the same</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                        <hi>day;</hi> and yet it was not impossible for the twelve Apostles to doe it in one day, if they had thought it reasonable.</p>
                     <p>For my own particular I wish we would make no more necessities then God made, but that we leave the administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">12.</note> to the manner of the first institution, and the Clericall offices be kept with their cancells, that no Lay hand may pretend a reason to usurpe the sacred ministery; and since there can be no necessity for unbaptized persons of years of discretion, because their desire may supply them, it were well also, if our charity would finde some other way also, to understand Gods mercy towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> infants: for certainly he is most mercifull and full of pity to them also; and if there be no neglect of any of his own appointed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries, so as he hath appointed them, me thinks it were but reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to trust his goodnesse with the infants in other cases; for it cannot but be a jealousie and a suspicion of God, a not daring to trust him, and an unreasonable proceeding beside, that we will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venture to dispense with divine institution, then thinke that God will; or that we shall pretend more care of children then God hath; when we will breake an institution, and the rule of an ordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of Gods appointing, rather then cast them upon God; as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if God loved this ceremony better then he loved the child: for so it must be, if the childe perishes for want of it: and yet still me thinkes according to such doctrine, there was little or no care taken for infants; for when God had appointed a ministery, and fixed it with certain rules and a proper deputation; in reason (knowing in all things else how mercifull God is and full of goodnesse) we should have expected that God should have given expresse leave to have gone besides the first circumstances of the Sacrament if he had intended we might or should; and that he should have told us so too; rather then by leaving them fast tyed without any expresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cases of exception, or markes of difference, permit men to dispute and stand unresolved between a case of Duty, and a point of Charity; for although God will have mercy rather then sacrifice, yet when both are commanded, God takes order they shall never crosse each other, and sacrifice is to be preferred before mercy, when the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is in the commandement and the mercy is not: as it is in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question. And if it were otherwise in this case, yet because God loves mercy so well, why should we not thinke, that God himself will shew this mercy to this Infant when he hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his pleasure that we should doe it? we cannot be more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull then he is.</p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath determined nothing in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <note place="margin">13.</note> that I know of; onely when in the first Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, a rubrick was inserted permitting midwives to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in cases of extreme danger, it was left out in the second Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which is at least an argument she intended to leave the question undetermined; if at least that omission of the clause was also not a rejection of the Article: Onely this <hi>Epiphanius</hi> objects it against the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> against the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> that they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">

                     <p>ASsoon as God began to constitute a Church and fix the Priesthood, which before was very ambulatory, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into all families, but ever officiated by the <hi>Major domo,</hi> God gives the power and designs the person.

                        <hi>gave him the order, but it was onely as the Minister and Deputy of God, under God the chief consecrator. And no man taketh upon him this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but he that was called of God as was Aaron,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> For in every Priesthood God designed and appointed the ministery, and collates a power, or makes the person gratious: either gives him a spirituall ability of doing something which others have not, or if he be onely imployed in praying and presenting sacrifices of beasts for the people, yet that such a person should be admitted to a neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er addresse, and in behalf of the people, must depend upon Gods acceptation, and therefore upon divine constitution; for there can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be no reason given in the nature of the thing, why God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the intermediation of one man for many, or why this man more then another, who possibly hath no naturall or acquired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency beyond many of the people, except what God himself makes, after the constitution of the person. If a spirituall power be necessary to the ministration, it is certain, none can give it but the fountain and the principle of the Spirits emanation. Or if the graciousnesse and aptnesse of the person be required, that also being <hi>arbitrary, preternaturall</hi> and <hi>chosen,</hi> must derive from the divine ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For God cannot be prescribed unto by us, whom he shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hear, and whom he shall entertain in a more immediate addresse, and freer entercourse.</p>
                     <p>And this is divinely taught us by the example of the high Priest <note place="margin">2.</note> himself; who, because he derived all power from his Father, and all his gratiousnesse and favour in the office of <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> was also personally chosen and sent, and took not the <hi>honour</hi> but as it descended on him from God, that the <hi>honour</hi> and the <note place="margin">

                        <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>ability,</hi> and the <hi>ministery,</hi> might derive from the same fountain. <hi>Christ did not glorisie himself to become high Priest.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may be deserved by our selves, but always comes from others; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and because no greater <hi>honour then to be ordained for men in things pertaining to God,</hi> every man must say as our blessed High Priest said of himself: <hi>If I honour my self, my honour is nothing; it is God that honoureth me;</hi> For Christ being the fountain of Evangelicall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, is the measure of our dispensations, and the rule of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall oeconomy; and therefore we must not arrogate any power

from our selves, or from a lesse authority then our Lord and Master <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> did: and this is true and necessary in the Gospell, rather then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ministery or Priesthood that ever was, because of the collation of so many excellent and supernaturall abilities which derive from Christ upon his Ministers, in order to the work of the Gospel.</p>

as it can be, that is, that it may by such rites be declared to all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> world what God is doing, and that man cannot doe it of himself; and besides the reasonablenesse of the thing, the very words in the present allegation doe to this very sense expound themselves: for <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>him will I accept;</hi> this separation of a person for the offices of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, is the same thing which I mean by <hi>this first sanctification;</hi> God did it, and gave him a power and authority to goe to him, and put him into a place of trust and favour about him, and made him a minister of the sacrifice; which is a power and eminency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the persons for whom he was to sacrifice, and a power or grace from God to be in neernesse to him. This I suppose to be the great argument for the necessity of separating a certain order of men for ecclesiasticall ministeries: And it relies upon these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. 1. All power of ordination descends from God, and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it is who sanctifies and separates the person. 2. The Priest by God is separate to be the gracious person to stand between him and the people. 3. Hee speaks the word of God, and returns the prayers and duty of the people, and reconveyes the blessings of God by his prayer and by his ministery. So that although every Christian must pray, and may be heard, yet there is a solemn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son appointed to pray in publick: and though Gods spirit is given to all that aske it, and the promises of the Gospel are verified to all that obey the Gospell of Iesus, yet God hath appointed sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and solemnities, by which the promises and blessings are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> more solemnly, and to greater effects. All the ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions the people may doe alone; the <hi>solemn, rituall,</hi> and <hi>publick,</hi> the appointed Minister onely must do. And if any man shall say, because the Priests ministery is by prayer, every man can doe it, and so, no need of him; by the same reason he may say also that the Sacraments are unnecessary, because the same effect which they produce is also in some degree the reward of a private piety, and devotion. But the particulars are to be further proved and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as they need.</p>
                     <p>Now what for illustration of this article I have brought from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> instance of <hi>Job,</hi> is true in the ministers of the Gospell, with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddition <note place="margin">3.</note> of many degrees of eminency. But still <hi>in the same kind,</hi> for the power God hath given, is indeed <hi>mysticall;</hi> but it is not like a power operating by way of naturall or proper operation; it is not <hi>vis</hi> but <hi>facultas,</hi> not an <hi>inherent quality</hi> that issues out actions by way of direct emanation, like naturall or acquired habits, but it is a grace
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50231:391"/>
or favour done to the person, and a qualification of him <hi>in genere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litico,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he receives a politick, publick, and solemn capacity, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene between God and the people; and although it were granted that the people could do the externall work, or the action of Church ministeries, yet they are actions to no purpose, they want the life and all the excellency, unlesse they be done by such persons whom God hath called to it, and by some means of his own hath expressed his purpose to accept them in such ministrations.</p>
                     <p>And this explication will easily be verified in all the particulars of the Priests power; because all the ministeries of the Gospell are <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                        <hi>in genere orationis,</hi> (unlesse we except <hi>preaching,</hi> in which God speaks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by his servants to the people) the minister by his office is an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor with God,</hi> and the word used in Scripture for the Priests <hi>officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> signifies his praying [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] <hi>as they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring or doing their Liturgy,</hi> the work of their supplications and intercession; and therefore the Apostles positively included all their whole ministery in these two: <hi>[but we will give our selves to the word of God and to prayer;</hi> the prayer of consecration, the prayer of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, the prayer of imposition of hands: they had nothing else to doe, but <hi>pray and preach.</hi> And for this reason it was, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in a sense neerest to the letter did verifie the precept of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Saviour; <hi>Pray continually,</hi> that is, in all the offices, acts, parts and ministeries of <hi>a dayly Liturgy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is not to lessen the power, but to understand it; for the Priests ministery is certainly the instrument of conveying all the <note place="margin">5.</note> blessings of the people, which are annexed to the ordinary admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit. But when all the office of Christs Priesthood in heaven is called <hi>intercession for us,</hi> and himself makes the sacrifice of the Crosse, effectuall to the salvation and graces of his Church, by his prayer, since we are ministers of the same Priesthood, can there be a greater glory then to have our ministery like to that of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Jesus? not operating by virtue of a certain number of syllables, but by a holy, solemn, determined and religious prayer, in the severall manners and instances of intercession; according to the analogy of all the religions in the world, whose most solemn mystery, was then most solemn prayer: I mean it in the matter of sacrificing; which also is true in the most mysterious solemnity of Christianity in the holy Sacrament of the Lords supper, which is hallowed and <note place="margin">

At the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity God gave gifts extraordinary, as boldnesse of spirit, fearless <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> courage, freedome of discourse, excellent understanding, discerning of spirits, deep judgement, innocence and prudence of deportment, the gift of tongues, these were so necessary at the institution of the Christian Church, that if we had not had testimony of the matter of fact, the reasonablenesse of the thing would prove the actuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Spirit; because God never fails in necessaries; But afterward, when all the extraordinary needs were served, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary stock was spent and God retracted those issues into their fountains, and then the graces that were necessary for the well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And therefore Ordination is a collation of holy graces of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; <note place="margin">16.</note> of a more excellent faith, of fervent charity, of providence and paternall care: Gifts which now descend not by way of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as upon the Apostles, are to be acquired by humane industry, by study and good letters, and therefore are presupposed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be ordained; to which purpose the Church now examines the abilities of the man, before she lays on hands; and therefore the Church does not suppose that the Spirit in ordination descends in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> gifts, and in the infusion of habits, and perfect abilities, though then also, it is reasonable to beleeve that God will assist the pious and carefull endeavours of holy Priests, and blesse them with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ayds and cooperation; because a more extraordinary ability is

                     <p>Now that these graces being given in ordination are immediate <note place="margin">19.</note> emanations of the holy Spirit, and therefore not to be usurped or pretended to by any man, upon whom the holy Ghost in ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not descended, I shall lesse need to prove, because it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon the former grounds, and will be finished in the following discourses; and it is in the Greek Ordination given as a reason of the former prayer, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>THe holy Ghost was the first consecrator, that is made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and the persons first consecrated were the Apostles, <note place="margin">1.</note> who received the severall parts of the Priestly order, at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times; the power of consecration of the Eucharist, at the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it; the power of remitting and retaining sinnes in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaves of <hi>Easter;</hi> the power of baptizing &amp; preaching, together with universall jurisdiction, immediately before the Ascension, when they were commanded to <hi>goe into all the world preaching and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</hi> This is the whole office of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and nothing of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was given in Pentecost when the holy Spirit descended and rested upon all of them; the Apostles, the brethren, the women; for then they received those great assistances which enabled them who had been designed for Embassadors to the world, to doe their great work; and others of a lower capacity had their proportion, as the effect of the promise of the Father, and a mighty verification of the truth of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>Now all these powers which Christ had given to his Apostles were by some means or other to be transmitted to succeeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                        <note place="margin">2.</note> because the severall Ministeries were to abide for ever. All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to be converted, a Church to be gathered and continued, the new Converts to be made Confessors, and consigned with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, sins to be remitted, flocks to be fed and guided, and the Lords death declared, represented, exhibited, and commemorated untill

And since the powers of doing these offices, are acts of free and gracious concession, emanations of the holy Spirit, and admissions to a vicinity with God, it is not onely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and sacriledge in the person, falsly to pretend, that is, to bely the holy Ghost, and thrust into these offices, but there is an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility in the thing, it is null in the very deed doing, to handle these mysteries without some appointment by God; unlesse he calls and points out the person, either by an extraordinary or by an ordinary vocation; Of these I must give a particular account.</p>
                     <p>The extraordinary calling was first, that is, the immediate; for <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the first beginning of a lasting necessity, is extraordinary, and made ordinary in succession, and by continuation of a fixed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministery. The first of every order hath another manner of constitution, then all the whole succession. The rising of the spring is of greater wonder, and of more extraordinary and latent reason, then the descent of the current; and the derivation of the powers of the holy Ghost that make the Priestly order, are just like the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the first man was made with Gods own hands, and all the rest by God, cooperating with a humane act; and there is never the same necessity as at first for <hi>God to create man.</hi> The species or kind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shall never fail, but be preserved in an ordinary way: And so it is in the designation of the Ministers of Evangelicall Priesthood; God breathed into the Apostles <gap reason="foreign">

God onely is the fountain and Author; and he that makes himself the Minister whom God appointed not, does in effect make himself the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Author; for he undertakes to dispose of grace which he hath not received, to give Gods goods upon his own authority; which he that offers at, without Gods warrant, does it onely upon his own.

without necessity.

                     <p>They are fancies of a too confident opinion, and over-valuing of <note place="margin">6.</note> our selves, when we think the very beeing of a Church is concerned in our mistakes; and if all the world be against us, we are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our folly, but think truth is failed from among the children of men, and the Church is at a losse, and the current derived from the first emanations is dryed up, and then he that is boldest to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his follies is also as apt to mistake his own boldnesse for <hi>a call from God,</hi> as he did at first his own vain opinion for a necessary truth; and then he is called extraordinarily, and so ventures into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Sanctuary. First, he made a necessity more then ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God made, and then himself finds a remedy that God never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. He that thinks every shaking of the Ark is absolute ruine to it, when peradventure it was but the weaknesse of his own eyes that made him fancy what was not, may also think he heares a call from above to support it, which indeed was nothing but a noyse in his own head: And there is no cure for this, but to cure the man, and set his head right. For he that will pretend any thing that is beyond ordinary, as he that will say he hath two reasonable soules within him, or three wills, is not to be confuted but by Physick, or by tying him to abjure his folly till he were able to prove it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

For we have no certainty that the Scriptures which we have this day, are the same which the Apostles delivered, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main so for ever; but onely 1. the reputation and testimony of all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50231:397"/>
Christian Churches, (which also must transmit the same by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> successive testimony to the following, or else they will be of an uncertain faith,) and 2. the confidence of the divine providence and goodnesse, who will not let us want what is fit for us, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot attain the end to which in mercy he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed us. Now the same Arguments which we have for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Scripture, we have for the perpetuity of a Christian Clergy, that is, besides the so long actuall succession and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we have the goodnesse and unalterable sweetnesse of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercies, who will continue such Ministeries which himself hath made the ordinary means of salvation; he would not have made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them the way to heaven and of ordinary necessity, if he did not mean to preserve them: indeed if the ordinary way should fail, God will supply another way to them that doe their duty; but then Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may as well fail as the ordinary succession of the Clergy; they both were intended but as the ordinary ministeries of salvation, and if Scripture be kept for the use of the Church, it is more likely the Church will be preserved in its necessary constituent parts then the Scripture; because Scripture is preserved for the Church, it is kept that the Church might not fail. For as for the fancy that all men being free agents may choose amisse; suppose that; but then may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they not all consent to the corruption or destroying of Scripture? yea, but God will preserve them from that, or will overrule the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: yea, but how doe they know that? what revelation have they? yet grant that too, but why then will he not also over-rule the event in the matter of universall Apostasie? for both of them are matter of choyce.</p>
                     <p>But then that all the Clergy should consent to corrupt Scripture, <note place="margin">13.</note> or to loose their faith, is a most unreasonable supposition; for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing there is a naturall possibility, yet it is morally impossible; and we may as well fear that all the men of the world will be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> upon the same reason; for if all the Clergy may, then all the people may, and you may as well poyson the Sea, as poyson all the springs; and it is more likely all the Ideots and the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the world should be cousened out of their religion, then that all the wise men and <hi>Antistites,</hi> the <hi>Teachers, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>publick Ministers</hi> of religion should. And when all men turn Mariners, or Apothecaries, or that all men will live single lives, and turn Monks, and so endanger the species of mankind to perish, (for there is a great fear of that too) that is, when all the world choose one thing (for if two men doe, two thousand may doe it if they will, and so may all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon this ground) then also we may fear that all the Governours of the Church may fail, because some doe, and more have, and all may; till then, there will be no need of an extraordinary commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but the Church shall goe on upon the stock of the first cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and designation, which was extraordinary. The Spirit issued
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50231:397"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> out at first miraculously, and hath continued running still in the first channels by ordinary conducts, and in the same conveyances it must run still, or it cannot without a miracle derive upon us, who stand at infinite distance from the fountain. Since then there is now no more expectation of an extraordinary calling (and to do so were an extraordinary vanity) it remains that the derivation of the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall power be by an ordinary conveyance.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of God in Scripture hath drawn a line, and chalked <note place="margin">14.</note> out the path that himself meant to tread in giving the graces of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall ministrations. At first, after that Christ had named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> twelve, (one whereof was lost) they not having an expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the manner of ordination, took such course as reason and religion taught them. They named two persons, and prayed God to choose one; and to manifest it by lot; which was a way lesse then the first designation of the other eleven; and yet had more of the extraordinary in it, then could be reasonably continued in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary succession. The Apostles themselves had not as yet received skill enough how to officiate in their ordinary ministery, because the Holy Ghost was not yet descended.</p>
                     <p>But when the Holy Ghost descended, then the work was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                        <note place="margin">15.</note> the Apostles wanted no power necessary for the main work of the Gospel; but now also they received Commissions to dispense the Spirit to all such purposes to which he was intended. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the <hi>office</hi> in themselves, but it was <hi>not communicable to others,</hi> till the Spirit, <hi>the anointing from above,</hi> ranne over to the fringes of the Priests garments; they had it but in imperfection and unactive faculties; So saith <hi>Theophylact: He breathed, not now giving to them</hi>

Now besides the reasonablenesse of the thing, this is also verified by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that will not easily fail us; by experience and <hi>ex postfacto;</hi> For as we doe not find the Apostles had before Pentecost a <hi>produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power,</hi> which made them call for a miracle, or a speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by lots, so we are sure that immediately after Pentecost they had it: for they speedily began to put it in execution and it is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, that the Apostles did not lay hands upon <hi>Mathias</hi> he being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50231:398"/>
made Apostle before the descent of the Holy Ghost: they had no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> power to doe it, they were not yet made <hi>Ministers of the Spirit;</hi> which because afterwards presently they did, concludes fairly that at Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost they were amongst other graces made <hi>the ordinary Ministers of Ordination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I say is certain, that the holy Ghost descending at Pentecost, they instantly did officiate in their ministeriall offices, they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they baptized, they confirmed and gave the holy Spirit of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, and took persons into the Lot of their Ministery, doing of it by an externall rite and solemn invocation: and now the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way did cease; God was the fountain of the power, but man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> conveyed it by an externall rite; And of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who was the onely exception from the common way, takes notice; calling himself an Apostle, <hi>not of man, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that he had a speciall honour done, to be chosen an Apostle in an extraordinary way; therefore others might be Apostles, and yet not so as he was; for else his expression had been all one, as if one should say <hi>Titius the sonne of a man, not begotten of an Angell, or Spirit, nor produced by the Sunne or Starre, but begotten by a man of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> the discourse had been ridiculous, for no man is born other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and yet he also had something of the ordinary too; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in an extraordinary manner he was sent to be ordained in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ministery. And yet because the ordinary ministery was setled, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was called to an account for so much of it as was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and was tyed to doe that which every man now is bound to doe, that shall pretend a calling extraordinary, <hi>viz.</hi> to give <hi>an extraordinary proof</hi> of his <hi>extraordinary calling:</hi> which when he had done in the College of Jerusalem, the Apostles <hi>gave him the right hand of fellowship,</hi> and approved his vocation; which also shews, that now the way of Ordination was fixed and declared to be by humane ministery; of which I need no other proof but the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Ordinations recorded in Scripture, and the <hi>no instances</hi> to the contrary, but of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whose designation was as immediate as that of the 11 Apostles, though his Ordination was not.
